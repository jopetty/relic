{"custom_id":"request-7","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out whether the string 't39' is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by looking at the grammar rules and see how I can derive 't39' from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are some production rules that directly produce 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- And so on.\n\nThese are terminals, meaning they are the final elements in the string, so any production rule that leads directly to one of these can be useful. Since the given string is just 't39', I need to see if the start symbol S can produce exactly 't39' in one step or through some steps.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production rules are:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, S can split into two non-terminals, each of which then splits further. Let's see if any of these can lead to 't39'.\n\nLooking at rule 1: NT12 -> NT17 NT8. Hmm, so NT12 becomes two non-terminals: NT17 and NT8.\n\nNT17: Let's check. NT17 can be produced by NT5 and NT4, based on the rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for NT17 -> NT5 NT4. So, NT17 is two non-terminals: NT5 and NT4. \n\nNT5 can go to 't39', which is exactly what we need, and NT4 can go to 't17'. But wait, 't17' is another terminal, but our string is only 't39', not followed by any other character. So if I have NT5 -> 't39' and NT4 -> 't17', then the production rule NT17 would produce 't39' followed by 't17', which is 't39t17'. But our string is just 't39', so that doesn't work unless the following steps can somehow eliminate 't17', which seems unlikely because 't17' is a terminal. So this path probably doesn't lead to just 't39'.\n\nLet's try rule 2 for S: S -> NT7 NT14.\n\nNT7: Looking at the rules, NT7 can be:\n\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT11\n- Also, NT7 -> NT7 NT12\n\nHmm, that's interesting. It can produce two different paths. So perhaps we need to follow one of these.\n\nIf we take NT7 -> NT2 NT11, then each of NT2 and NT11 would split further.\n\nLooking at NT2: NT2 can be NT11 NT17 or NT5 NT20, etc. Wait, let me check the rules. Looking at NT2, there are multiple production rules:\n\n1. NT2 -> NT11 NT17\n2. NT2 -> NT5 NT20\n3. NT2 -> NT7 NT16\n4. NT2 -> NT1 NT21\n5. NT2 -> NT21 NT4\n6. NT2 -> NT12 NT10\n\nBut that's a lot. Let's focus on the one that produces terminals directly.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see NT2 has some production rules that end with terminals. For example, looking back at some rules:\n\nWait, earlier I see NT20 -> 't65', NT10 -> 't53', etc.\n\nWait, but in the rules provided, for example, NT12 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't70', NT3 -> 't16', etc. So perhaps we can find a path where multiple non-terminals resolve to terminals, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, looking at rule 3 for S: S -> NT9 NT12.\n\nNT9: Let's see. The production rules for NT9 include:\n\n- NT9 -> NT11 NT11\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT9\n\nHmm, that's interesting. NT9 looks like it can produce a chain of NT11s and so on.\n\nNT11: Checking the rules, NT11 can be NT0 NT15 or NT15 NT10.\n\nLooking at NT0: NT0 can be NT6 NT10 or NT9 NT8.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to see if 't39' can be derived from any of the rules in the grammar.\n\nLooking back, NT5 is directly a terminal 't39', which is what we need. So perhaps the production path that reaches NT5 is the way to go.\n\nLooking at the S production rules, which of them can lead to a path that ends with NT5.\n\nLooking at the S rules:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12: Each NT12 leads to, say, NT17 and NT8. NT17 is NT5 and NT4, so that would lead to 't39' and 't17', which is 't39t17', not just 't39'.\n\n2. S -> NT7 NT14: NT7 can be, for instance, NT2 NT11. But does that lead anywhere? Maybe not directly to NT5.\n\n3. S -> NT9 NT12: NT9 is either NT11 NT11 or NT6 NT9. NT12 can also go to NT17 NT8, which would lead to 't39' and 't17', similar to the first case.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's see which non-terminals directly produce 't39'. From the rules:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT3 -> 't39' ??? Wait, no. Checking the rules, I see NT3 -> 't16' and 't29', etc. Not 't39'. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only terminal I see that starts with 't39' is 't39' in NT5. So NT5 -> 't39'.\n\nSo, to get 't39', we need to derive it from S. That would mean, one of the productions from S must have a path leading to NT5, and the other non-terminal in S's production must produce an empty string, which is not possible in Chomsky normal form because all productions have two non-terminals or terminals. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S production rule leads directly to NT5 and another terminal, but that seems unlikely because S's productions are S -> NT1 * NT2, etc.\n\nWait, unless the other non-terminal in S's production somehow doesn't contribute. For example, maybe NT12 can produce a sequence that ends with 't39' and the other part of S's production produces nothing, but that's not possible because NT12 is a non-terminal, so it will produce a string, not nothing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S -> NT9 NT12, and one of those produces 't39' and the other produces a string that somehow combines in a way that only 't39' remains. That seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to derive 't39' using multiple steps. For example, starting from S, and following the rules to break down each non-terminal until we get to 't39'.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTake S: S -> NT12 NT12\n\nSo both NT12s can be broken down. From the rules, NT12 -> NT17 NT8.\n\nSo now we have NT17 NT17 NT8 NT8 (but no, actually, each NT12 splits into two, so wait, S becomes NT12 NT12, each NT12 is replaced by NT17 NT8, so altogether four non-terminals: NT17 NT17 NT8 NT8).\n\nBut then each NT17 can split into NT5 NT4.\n\nSo each NT17 becomes NT5 NT4, which are terminals 't39' and 't17'.\n\nSo the string becomes: NT17 -> 't39t17', and another NT17 -> 't39t17', then two NT8s, each split into, say, NT4 NT20. Wait, but NT8 -> NT4 NT20.\n\nBut then each NT4 would split into, say, 't17' and some other, but this is getting too complicated. It seems that any path starting with S -> NT12 NT12 would lead to multiple terminal symbols, and wouldn't result in just 't39'.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if S can produce a string that includes 't39' as a substring, but in this case, the string is exactly 't39', so the entire string must be derived from S without any additional terms.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the only way is if S directly produces 't39', but looking at the S's production rules, none are like S -> 't39'.

{"custom_id":"request-0","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string \"t73\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a single terminal. But looking at the provided grammar, some rules have a terminal on the right, which is fine since in CNF, the left side is a non-terminal, and right side can have two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form usually requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So I should check if the grammar provided is strictly in CNF. Looking at the rules, some have a single terminal, which is allowed as an exception when generating terminals through one step. So it seems like it's still CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t73\". I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. I'll start by looking for any direct production that results in \"t73\". Scanning through the right-hand sides, I notice that several rules directly produce terminals. Let me list them:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- ... and some others that I can see, but probably not relevant for 't73'.\n\nSo, the production NT10 \u2192 't73' is direct. Now, can S derive to NT10 somehow? Looking at the productions for S, I check each production:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12 \u2192 Not NT10\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT14 \u2192 Not NT10\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12 \u2192 Not NT10\n\nOh, none of the initial productions from S produce NT10 directly. So S can only go to NT12, NT7, or NT9. So first step: S \u2192 NT12 or NT7 or NT9.\n\nLooking at NT12's production: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. Neither of these are terminals directly. So then, NT12 needs to derive further. Wait, but I just saw that NT12 directly becomes 't12' according to the grammar. So S \u2192 NT12 can go to 't12' in one step. But we need 't73'. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking that maybe S can go to another NT that can eventually produce 't73'. Let me check the other productions of S.\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14. Let's see what NT7 and NT14 produce. NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11. So NT7 can't go directly to 't73'. Then, looking at NT2 \u2192 various things, but some produce terminals. Let me see, NT2 has several productions with NT11 and NT17, NT5, NT20, etc. Wait, looking at the rules, NT2 is not directly producing 't73', but maybe indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, let's check S \u2192 NT9 NT12. NT9 \u2192 NT11 NT11. So first, NT9 \u2192 NT11 NT11. Then, each NT11 \u2192 ... but looking at NT11's production, it's NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT10 or NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT10. Wait, no: NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT10 or other? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe rule for NT11 is: NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT11 or NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT10? Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, the rule is NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT11. Wait, no: wait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT11 -> NT15 NT10\n\nand\n\nNT11 -> NT0 NT11\n\nWait, I think I might have misread. Looking again:\n\nNo, actually, in the given grammar, the rule is NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT10. Or is it? Let me check:\n\nWait, I see: NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT10 and NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT11. So NT11 can produce either NT15 NT10 or recursively NT0 NT11.\n\nSo, starting from S \u2192 NT9 NT12, which becomes NT11 NT11, which can expand into NT15 NT10 and another NT15 NT10? Or perhaps we can get NT15 and NT10 somewhere.\n\nWait, NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8. And NT21 can produce 't73' because NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5, but wait no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, looking back: There's a rule NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5. Not 't73'. But earlier, I saw that NT10 \u2192 't73'.\n\nWait, but let me check if any non-terminal eventually produces 't73'. So if I can get NT10 to appear somewhere, that is a direct path.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I see NT10 can be produced directly by NT10 \u2192 't73'.\n\nSo if I can get S to derive to a non-terminal that can produce NT10, then I can get 't73'.\n\nLooking back at S's productions, none of them directly give NT10, but maybe through other steps.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT7 NT14. Let's see.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT7 NT14.\n\nNT7's production is NT2 NT11. So let me see: NT2 can produce NT11, NT0, or other options.\n\nBut looking at NT2's productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17, NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20, NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT16, etc. But none of these immediately lead to a terminal, except if some production leads to another terminal. Wait, in the rules, I see NT2 appears in the production for NT4: wait, no, NT2 is a non-terminal, and I'm looking at the productions for other NTs, but perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: look for a parse tree where the root is S and leaves are terminals leading to 't73'.\n\nBut since 't73' is a terminal, the entire derivation must terminate with it. So, does any production start with S and can derive a string that includes 't73'? Alternatively, is 't73' a production from a non-terminal that's reachable from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a chain of non-terminals that leads to NT10.\n\nLet me think: NT10 has a production that directly gives 't73'. So if I can get S to produce NT10, then it's possible.\n\nLooking at S's productions, do any of them lead to NT10?\n\nLooking back:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12: NT12's production is NT17 NT8, which may not lead to NT10.\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14: NT7 leads to NT2 NT11, which could lead to various things.\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12: NT9 leads to NT11 NT11, which as we saw, can lead to NT15 NT10.\n\nWait, let me trace that:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n\nEach NT11 can produce NT15 NT10, so the first NT11 can become NT15 NT10, and the second can become NT15 NT10. So that would give us NT15 NT15 NT10 NT10.\n\nWait, but none of these are 't73' yet. So then, looking at NT15: NT15 can produce NT21 NT8. NT21 can produce 't73'?\n\nWait, checking NT21: There are two production rules: NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5 and NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT6. So NT21 could produce 't73' only if one of those productions leads to it. Wait, no, looking again, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, actually, in the given rules, I see NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5, and another NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT6. Also, NT21 was used to produce 't73' in some other line? Or no.\n\nWait, looking through the rule list again: there's a line NT21 -> 't73'? No, looking back, I don't see that.

Instead, looking for NT21 in the rules: There's a rule NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5 and another NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT6.\n\nSo if NT21 can produce 't73', but I don't see that.

The string is `t53 t53`. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a bit lengthy, but I can see that it's made up of a bunch of non-terminals that eventually produce terminal symbols, which are strings like 't53', 't95', 't12', etc. My task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string in question is `t53 t53`, which consists of two instances of 't53'. So, each 't53' must be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, I notice several that produce 't53'. For instance, NT10 has a production to 't53'. Specifically, NT10 -> 't53'. Also, NT2 has a production NT2 -> NT11 NT17. Wait, but 't53' comes from NT10, so maybe I should track how 't53' can be generated.\n\nLet me see the production rules more carefully. There's:\n\nNT10 -> 't53' (from the list, under NT10 -> 't53').\n\nBut also, looking at the terminal symbols, 't53' is produced by NT10.

The first line says S can produce NT12 NT14, S can produce NT9 NT12, and same for the third option. So S can choose between NT12 NT14 and NT9 NT12.\n\nSo, to get 't53 t53', since it's two 't53's, we need to find a way that S can produce two instances of 't53'. Let's see the possible routes.\n\nFirst, think about which production can produce 't53'. NT10 produces 't53'. So we'd need to have 't53' come from NT10.\n\nSo perhaps S needs to produce NT10 something. But looking at S's productions, S never directly produces NT10. It only produces combinations of NT12 and NT14, or NT9 and NT12. So how can S produce NT10?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT10 can be derived from S through some chain of productions. Let's look at the rest of the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT10 can be produced from NT2. Let me find where NT2 can go.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions:\n\nNT2 -> NT11 NT17\nNT2 -> NT5 NT20\nNT2 -> NT7 NT16\nNT2 -> NT0 NT16\n\nSo NT2 has multiple options. For example, NT2 can go to NT11 NT17. And further, NT11's production is NT0 NT11, and NT11 can produce other things. Hmm, this seems a bit involved. Let's try to see if there's a way to get to NT10.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT10 has a production to 't53', which is a terminal symbol. So, for NT10 to appear in the string, it must be directly expanded to 't53'. Therefore, the string `t53 t53` would come from two different NT10 nodes, each producing 't53'.\n\nSo, in the derivation, we would need to have S produce two NT10s, which then each produce 't53', resulting in `t53 t53`.\n\nBut the challenge is whether S can produce NT10 NT10, given its initial productions.\n\nLooking back, S's initial productions are S -> NT12 NT14, S -> NT9 NT12, and same again. So S can only directly produce combinations of two non-terminals. It cannot produce a single NT10, let alone two of them.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to derive `t53 t53` is to have S produce NT12 NT14, which then each expand into something, but that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through a series of steps, S can lead to a situation where two NT10s are produced.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to derive NT10 from S through intermediate steps. Let me see.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT10 appears in several rules, such as:\n\nNT10 -> 't53'\nNT10 -> NT2 NT16 (from line: NT10 -> NT2 NT16 under NT10's productions)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the provided grammar again. Yes, under NT10's productions, we have:\n\nNT10 -> 't53'\nNT10 -> NT2 NT16 ... ?\n\nWait, looking through the list: Yes, under NT10 -> 't53', and also NT10 can go to NT2 NT16.\n\nSo, the way this can work is that if we can find a way for S to produce NT10, which can then produce 't53', but since S can't directly produce NT10, we have to see if S can lead to NT10.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT14\n2. S -> NT9 NT12\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, S must produce a pair of non-terminals, either (NT12, NT14), (NT9, NT12), etc.\n\nSuppose S first expands to NT12 NT14. Then each of those can further produce other things.\n\nLet's see what NT12 can produce. Looking at NT12's productions:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\nNT12 -> NT19 NT8\nSo, NT12 can go to NT17 NT8 or NT19 NT8.\n\nIf NT12 expands to NT17 NT8, then let's see NT17's productions. NT17 can produce:\n\nNT17 -> NT13 NT4\nNT17 -> NT11 NT12\nNT17 -> NT20 NT17\n\nSo, from NT17, we can get to other non-terminals.\n\nIf we take NT17 -> NT11 NT12, then NT11 is produced, which can go to NT6 NT10.\n\nWait, let me check NT11's productions:\n\nNT11 -> NT6 NT10\nNT11 -> NT0 NT11\n\nSo, NT11 can produce NT6 NT10 directly, among others.\n\nSo, if we have NT11, it can expand to NT6 NT10, and NT6's productions are:\n\nNT6 -> NT3 NT21\nNT6 -> NT17 NT5\nOther options? Not sure, but let's see.\n\nIf we take NT11 -> NT6 NT10, then we have a NT6 and NT10.\n\nNT6's can produce more. Let's say NT6 -> NT21 NT5? Or NT21 NT8?\n\nLooking at NT6's productions: NT6 -> NT3 NT21, NT6 -> NT17 NT5.\n\nSo, NT6 can go to either NT3 NT21 or NT17 NT5.\n\nIf we have NT6 in this context, let's say we choose NT6 -> NT3 NT21.\n\nThen, NT3's productions are:\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT14\nNT3 -> NT13 NT2\nNT3 -> NT4 NT20\n\nHmm, okay, so NT3 can produce various combinations. For example, if NT3 is something like NT5 NT14, that could be useful for producing 't53' when NT5 is 't53' or something.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If I'm trying to get two 't53's, perhaps each 't53' comes from NT10.\n\nBut that would require having two NT10s, each producing 't53'. So, perhaps S needs to produce two NT10s in some way.\n\nBut looking at the initial productions, S can only produce two non-terminals at a time. So, unless there's a way for S to first expand into NT10s, but right now it seems S can't expand directly into NT10, only through NT12, NT9, etc.\n\nWait, unless via some chain. Maybe S can go to NT9 NT12, and then NT9 can produce NT10. Let me check NT9's productions.\n\nLooking at NT9:\n\nNT9 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-15","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t73 t53\" can be generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production is either S \u2192 AB or S \u2192 a, where A and B are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol is S, and the string we're checking starts with two terminals, 't73' and 't53'.\n\nI remember that in CNF, every production is either breaking down into two non-terminals or directly to a terminal. So, each step in the derivation will expand non-terminals until we get to terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's two terms: t73 and t53. Since these are terminals, I need to see if there's a production rule that allows the start symbol S to produce these two terminals in sequence.\n\nLet me check if the start symbol S can produce these directly. From the grammar, S has several productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12 (if I remember correctly, NT symbols stand for non-terminals)\n2. S \u2192 NT714 (wait, in the given grammar, S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, etc.)\n\nWait, I see the first production is S \u2192 NT12 NT12, the second is S \u2192 NT7 NT14, third is S \u2192 NT9 NT12. So, these are all options for S.\n\nI think the string is 't73 t53', so each part is a single terminal. So, I need to see if S can produce each of these terminals in order.\n\nBut looking at the productions of S, they seem to be starting from non-terminals. So, perhaps S has to be broken down into non-terminals first. For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT12. Then, each NT12 has its own production.\n\nLooking at NT12's production: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So, replacing S \u2192 NT12 NT12 would first expand each NT12 to NT17 NT8.\n\nSo after first expansion, we'd get NT17 NT8 NT17 NT8.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded. Let's take NT17 first: NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4. Then, NT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19, and NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT4, which in turn has various productions.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I can try tracing possible derivations step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the terminals 't73' and 't53' can be generated by any possible combination of S \u2192 NT... leading to those terminals.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals that produce terminals, I can check which NT rules directly produce terminals. For example, NT20 -> 't65', but others produce further non-terminals.\n\nWait, I also notice some NT symbols that directly produce terminals. For example, NT20 -> 't65', NT14 -> 't43' (wait, looking at the grammar, yes, NT4 is 't17', NT9 is 't77', NT10 is 't53', and so on.\n\nWait, looking through the given grammar, I can see that certain NT symbols expand directly to terminals.\n\nWait, specifically, for this problem, the string is \"t73 t53\". So the first part is 't73' and the second is 't53'. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT21 -> 't65', NT10 -> 't53' (twice, perhaps through different paths), and NT4 -> 't17', among others. Similarly, NT15 -> 't82', etc.\n\nBut to generate 't73 t53', the S must first produce something that expands to 't73' followed by 't53'. \n\nSo, perhaps S \u2192 NT12 NT12 is a starting point. Then, each NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nLet me see NT17's production: NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4.\n\nNow, NT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19.\n\nThen, NT12 again \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nWait, this seems like it's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe there is a production that allows S to directly produce a terminal pair.\n\nWait, I can't recall if the start symbol S can directly expand into terminals in this grammar. Normally, in CNF, the start symbol doesn't produce terminals directly, because the productions have two non-terminals on the right. So, S cannot produce a single terminal, but only two non-terminals. That would mean the entire string has to be built by expanding each symbol into two non-terminals until we reach the leaves which are terminals.\n\nBut in this case, the string is two terminals. So maybe S can produce two non-terminals that each expand into a single terminal.\n\nSo let me think: Does S have a production where each of the two non-terminals can directly produce 't73' and 't53'? Or maybe one of them expands into 't73' and the other into 't53'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see what non-terminals directly produce 't73' and 't53'. Let's check:\n\n- 't73' might come from NT21 \u2192 't65' (but wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 't65', which is different).

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see the production rules. It starts with S, which has several options for derivation. Each production seems to consist of two non-terminals connected by a number, except for the terminals at the end.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t19 t66 t66\". Since these are terminals, I should trace back from them to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet's start with the last part \"t66\". Looking at the grammar, I see that NT5 can produce \"t66\" via NT5 -> 't66'. That's a terminal production. So one part is okay.\n\nMoving to the middle \"t66\", again, NT5 can produce this as well. So that's another NT5 -> 't66'. \n\nNow, the first part \"t19\". Looking through the productions, I don't immediately see a production where NT19 directly produces \"t19\". Wait, actually, is there a production for that? Let me check. I see that NT19 has production rules, but none of them lead directly to \"t19\". Hmm. So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me think again. The string is \"t19 t66 t66\". Each \"t\" is a terminal, so each must come from some NT production. Let's consider that each \"t\" could come from different non-terminals.\n\nStarting with the first \"t19\", perhaps it's part of a larger production. Looking at the grammar rules, I see a production NT1 -> NT17 NT4. Wait, but NT17 has a production to NT8 NT10. This is getting a bit complex. Maybe I should try to find a path for the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string represents the leftmost derivation. Let's see if each \"t\" can be part of an NT production.\n\nWait, the grammar has S -> NT12 NT12 and other similar rules. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should check each terminal to see if they can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check all the productions again.\n\nLooking for \"t19\", I see that the non-terminal NT is not directly producing \"t19\" in any of the productions. So, maybe the first \"t19\" comes from a higher-level non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider S. Since S can produce two non-terminals, maybe each \"t\" comes from a left part of the production.\n\nWait, maybe I should track the entire string through the grammar. Let's consider the entire string \"t19 t66 t66\". This is a sequence of three terminals.\n\nIn the grammar, the start symbol S has productions that are pairs of two non-terminals each. So, for S to derive \"t19 t66 t66\", it would imply that the derivation goes through two steps, producing four symbols? Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each S production results in two non-terminals. So S can produce NT12 NT12, which would then produce terminals or more non-terminals. Wait, but \"t19 t66 t66\" has three terminals, so it might require S -> NT... something that can lead to three terminals in total.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to parse the string \"t19 t66 t66\" step by step.\n\nThe string is three terminals. So, to get three terminals, the derivation from S must resolve into three terminals. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at each terminal:\n\n- \"t19\": Could come from NT19, but nowhere does NT19 directly produce \"t19\".\nWait, I'm looking again. Oh, NT17 -> NT8 NT10. Does NT17 produce \"t19\"? No, it doesn't. So maybe \"t19\" comes from another non-terminal that resolves to it.\n\nWait, perhaps the production NT1 -> NT14 NT6, and NT14 -> NT4 NT0, and NT0 -> NT6 NT10, etc. This is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each \"t\" comes from a separate non-terminal path. For example:\n\n- \"t19\" comes from NT1 -> NT17 NT4, with NT17 -> \"t19\"\n\nWait, no, looking back, I don't see any NT producing \"t19\". The only NT that directly produces a \"t\" is NT5 -> 't66', which we've already established.\n\nWait a second, maybe the middle \"t66\" comes from a different NT, or the first \"t19\" comes from a different path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not possible because the first \"t19\" can't be derived from any NT production. Let me double-check the productions for NT19.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT19 -> NT1 NT2, which doesn't produce terminals. NT19 also has NT2 -> 't65', which is a terminal. Wait, no, that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps each \"t\" is produced by a different NT. For \"t19\", perhaps it comes from NT17, which has NT17 -> 't19' in one of its productions? Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 -> NT7 NT20, which can then maybe produce \"t19\" via NT7 or NT20. Wait, but none of the productions for NT17 directly lead to \"t19\". Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to reconstruct the possible derivation.\n\nThe string is \"t19 t66 t66\". Let's see if this can be produced by the grammar.\n\nThe first \"t19\" must come from a production of some NT. From the grammar, the only NT that directly produces a \"t\" is NT5 -> 't66'. We also have NT0 -> 't40', which doesn't help. \n\nWait, looking back, NT17 has productions leading to \"t19\" for example, via NT17 -> 't19' directly? Let me check.\n\nYes! Looking back, in the grammar, NT17 has the production NT17 -> 't61'. Wait, no. Let me look again. No, NT17's rules don't include 't19'. Wait, perhaps I missed that. Let me confirm. There's also a production NT17 -> NT7 NT20, but no direct terminal 't19'.\n\nWait, no. The production NT7 -> 't48' exists? No, actually, looking again, I see \"NT7 -> 't48'\". Wait, no, let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, I see \"NT17 -> 't61'\", but no \"t19\" for NT17. Wait, perhaps it's NT19 that produces 't19'?\n\nLooking at NT19: The productions for NT19 are NT19 -> NT1 NT2 and NT19 -> NT3 NT2. Neither of these directly produce terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps NT17 can produce 't19'. Let me see the productions for NT17 again: NT17 -> NT8 NT10 and NT17 -> 't61'. No, that's not correct. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nYes, in the grammar, I see NT17 -> NT8 NT10 as one production, and another? No, looking at the NT17 rules:\n\n- NT17 -> NT7 NT20\n- NT17 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT17 -> 't19'\n\nWait, no. I see \"NT17 -> 't61'\". So actually, NT17 has a terminal production NT17 -> 't61'. So maybe \"t61\" is a terminal.\n\nBut our string is \"t19\", so maybe that's a different NT. Hmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck. NT19 is one of the NTs. Does it have a production that results in a 't'?\n\nLooking at the production NT19: I see NT19 -> NT1 NT2 and NT19 -> NT3 NT2. No, those don't produce terminals. Then, perhaps \"t19\" comes from a different NT, like NT7.\n\nWait, looking back, NT7 has productions NT7 -> NT2 NT11, NT7 -> NT7 NT12, and NT7 -> 't48'. No, 't48' is in NT7.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have \"t19\" so that must be a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-43","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is \"t77 t95 t40\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. The grammar consists of productions where each non-terminal on the left produces two non-terminals on the right, except the base cases which produce terminals (like 't77', 't95', etc.). \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals are producing specific terminals. For example, S -> NT12 NT12 or S -> NT12 NT8, but other non-terminals like NT12 eventually produce 't12'. Similarly, NT7 produces 't7' or something that goes to 't17', etc. \n\nThe string we need to check is \"t77 t95 t40\". Each of these seems to correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Now, I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S. Since S produces non-terminals, the first step is to see if any of these productions can lead to the terminals in the string. The string has three terms, which suggests that S must generate a structure that can split into three terminals through some combination of productions.\n\nWait, but S produces two non-terminals on the right side. That would mean the entire string is two non-terminals, which would produce two terminals. However, the given string has three terms. That's a problem because the start symbol S can't produce a string of three terminals; it can only produce two.\n\nWait, unless there's a way for those two non-terminals to each produce sequences that result in more than one terminal. For example, NT... might produce a sequence that results in two or more terminals. But looking at the grammar, each production is a binary split except the terminals, so each step would add more non-terminals until they reach a terminal.\n\nBut even so, the initial step from S produces two non-terminals. Each of those can expand further, but each expansion replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we hit terminals. So the total number of terminals in the generated string should be equal to the number of expansions from S. \n\nWait, the number of terminals in the generated string corresponds to the number of leaves in the derivation tree. For a context-free grammar, if we have productions that go deeper, the number of terminals can be more than 2. For example, S can produce NT... which then each can produce more terms. So maybe the string \"t77 t95 t40\" has three terminals, which would require that somewhere in the derivation, a non-terminal expands into two branches, one of which leads to one terminal and another leads to more terms, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can produce a structure that branches several times, leading to three terminals. Let me think: S -> NT A, each NT and A can produce more non-terminals, which might split and combine in a way that results in three terminals.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky normal form, each production is a binary split. So each non-terminal on the left produces exactly two non-terminals on the right. So each expansion step adds one more non-terminal. The process continues until the non-terminals reach terminals. \n\nSo, starting from S, the first expansion is two non-terminals. Each of those can produce two each, making four, but some might produce a terminal. But to get three terminals, perhaps one of them produces two terminals while the other produces one. Wait, no, because each production can only split into two, and each of those can be non-terminals or terminals. So each expansion step increases the number of symbols, but the terminals would be the leaves.\n\nWait, maybe the derivation is such that the S production leads to two non-terminals, each of which can produce a terminal or non-terminals. For example, NT12 could produce 't12', and NT10 could produce another terminal, but that would make two, not three.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see that several non-terminals produce specific terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't12'. Similarly, NT13 -> 't16', etc. So the idea is that each non-terminal might eventually resolve to a single terminal.\n\nIf that's the case, then S -> NT12 NT12 would produce 't12 t12', which is two terminals, but the given string has three, so that's not matching. However, perhaps the productions are such that some non-terminals can produce multiple terminals through expansion.\n\nWait, but that's not how context-free grammars work. Each production is a split into exactly two. So the only way to get more than two terminals is if some of those steps produce more than one terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps one of the non-terminals in the production splits into two, one of which is a terminal, and the other splits into a production that then splits again, leading to more terminals.\n\nSo maybe S -> NT12 NT8, and NT12 -> a non-terminal that splits into a terminal and another non-terminal, which then splits again, etc., until we get three terminals.\n\nLet me take the string \"t77 t95 t40\". Let's see which non-terminals produce these:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT77? Wait, but I don't see the non-terminals defined in terms of NT with 77 as the suffix. Instead, the non-terminals are like NT9, NT21, NT12, etc. So 't77' must come from some NT.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\nNT7 -> NT7 NT12 (which leads to 't77'), but wait, looking at the productions again, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the productions in the grammar start with S, then all the NTs. So for example:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8, which then can split into NT17 and NT8.\n\nBut wait, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, check the string: \"t77 t95 t40\". Each of these is a terminal that comes from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't77' must come from an NT that eventually ends in 't77', but I don't see any NT like that. Instead, perhaps it's derived from multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps NT7 -> NT7 NT12, and then NT12-> 't12', but then how is 't77' formed? Alternatively, perhaps 't77' comes from NT77, but the grammar doesn't define that. So perhaps it's a combination of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each 't' in the string to the possible NTs.\n\nFor example, 't77' is likely from NT77, but I don't see such a production. So perhaps it's from a chain of NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't77' comes from a production like NT9 -> NT6 NT9, which could eventually lead to 't6' or 't9', but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't77' is from NT9 -> NT11 NT11, and NT11 could produce 't11' or something else. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to try to construct a derivation that produces \"t77 t95 t40\".\n\nStart with S. Let's see which production from S can lead to three terminals.\n\nS can produce NT12 NT12, NT12 NT8, NT9 NT12, etc. Let's pick one, say S -> NT12 NT12. Then NT12 -> NT17 NT8.\n\nSo S -> NT12 NT12 expands to NT17 NT8 NT17 NT8.\n\nBut that's four symbols, so further expansion is needed.\n\nLet's look at NT17: NT17 -> NT13 NT4, and NT8 -> 't48'. So one NT8 produces 't48'. The other NT8 is another NT8 which would produce 't48', but that's not matching our string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different production for S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S -> NT12 NT8. Let's see:\n\nS -> NT12 NT8. NT12 -> NT17 NT8. So that's NT17 NT8 NT8.\n\nThen NT17 -> NT13 NT4, and NT8 -> 't48'. So the NT8 on the right side produces another 't48'. So far, we have 't48 t48 t48', which is not matching the string.\n\nWait, maybe we need a different approach. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't77', 't95', and 't40'.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, 't77' appears in the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal productions are in the last part. So, for example:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT7 -> 't7' (but there's a production NT7->NT7 NT12, perhaps leading to more steps)\nWait, no, actually NT7's terminal is in the last part?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's take this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires each production rule to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, most rules seem to fit this, like S \u2192 NT12 NT12 or S \u2192 NT7 NT14. But I notice that some are more complex, so maybe the given string can help.\n\nThe string is a sequence of four terminals: t61, t19, t26, t53. Since each of these is a single terminal symbol, each must be produced by a non-terminal in a single step. So, I'll need to see if the grammar can produce each token in sequence.\n\nLet's list the non-terminals and their right-hand sides that produce the terminals:\n\n- t61 is directly produced by NT17 \u2192 NT8 (from the rule NT17 -> NT8 NT10, wait no, actually NT17's production is in various places.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all rules that directly produce a terminal:\n\nAre there any rules where RHS is a single terminal? Because in CNF, each production must be directly replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.

They all produce other non-terminals or multiple non-terminals. That can't be right because the given string has terminals, so there must be some non-terminals that expand into terminals via multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Wait, let me re-examine the rules.\n\nAh, here's a rule: NT20 -> 't65' (multiple times). Similarly, NT10 can produce 't53' and 't43' and 't73'. Also, NT4 can produce 't17'.

Because looking through the rules, I don't see any rule with RHS as 't61' directly. Hmm, that's odd. How can the string include 't61' if no non-terminal directly produces it? Unless it's produced by a longer production.\n\nWait, did I miss any rule that directly produces 't61'? Let me go through the rules again. It seems that 't61' is a terminal produced by NT17 in some way? Wait, looking back, I see a rule: NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10. Wait, but then NT8 and NT10 would have to expand into terminals.\n\nSo, for example, if NT17 can produce 't61' via other steps, but in our case, looking at the given string: t61 t19 t26 t53.\n\nWait, let's think of the steps.\n\nSo, the string is four tokens: t61, t19, t26, t53.\n\nI need to find a way to derive each of these in order.\n\nLet me try to see if each can be produced.\n\nFirst, t61: if any non-terminal can produce it directly, which seems not according to the initial rules, but perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. Let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nLooking for possible starting symbols:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, or S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nWait, no, actually in the grammar, S has three productions: S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, and S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nSo, S splits into two non-terminals each time.\n\nSince the string is four terminals, S would split into two, then those split into terminals.\n\nBut with four terminals, the parse tree would have three splits, so let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12 (let's take S \u2192 NT12 NT12 for now)\n\nNow, each NT12 can split further. So, NT12 expands via its production rules. Looking at the rules for NT12:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nSo, NT12 would become NT17 and NT8.\n\nNow, NT17 can split into NT8 and NT10, but that's non-terminals.

Let me start by understanding what the grammar and the string represent.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar rules, I see that the non-terminals are S, NT1 to NT21, and some terminals like t19, t48, etc. The grammar is structured such that each production on the left side of the arrow is a non-terminal, and the right side consists of two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Because it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. \n\nWait, actually, the user provided a mix of some terminals, so I need to parse the grammar correctly. Let me list the rules to keep track:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT12 NT8\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\nOther rules involve various non-terminals leading to combinations of NTs or terminals. For example, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20, NT4 \u2192 NT11 NT20, etc. Terminals are when non-terminals eventually lead directly to a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the string \"t19 t61 t48 t29\", it's a sequence of four terminals. I need to find if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string step by step. Since it's a CFG, I can use a top-down approach, starting from S and seeing if we can build the string.\n\nStarting with S, the possible productions for S are:\n1. NT12 NT12\n2. NT12 NT8\n3. NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these splits the string into parts. Let's see which one could possibly match the beginning of the string \"t19 t61 t48 t29\".\n\nThe first part of the string is \"t19\".

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a specific way of writing CFGs where every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that many non-terminals like S, NT12, NT14, etc., have productions that eventually lead to terminals (like 't's) and some non-terminals. The string has 5 tokens, so the parse tree might be pretty deep.\n\nFirst, I should check the overall structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and S has productions that lead to NT12 NT8, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. Each of these non-terminals eventually breaks down into a mix of terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by trying to match the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t29 t19 t66 t26 t77`. Let's see:\n\n1. The first token is `t29`. Let me look at all productions that can start with `t29`. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT3 \u2192 `t29` and also NT3 has another production. Wait, I think in the grammar, NT3 has two productions: one to `t16` and another to `t29`? Wait, no, looking more carefully, in the grammar, under NT3, one production is NT3 \u2192 `t16`, another is NT3 \u2192 `t29`, and another is NT3 \u2192 `t50` (I think I might have misread; in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nWait, looking again, under NT3, I see:\n- NT3 \u2192 `t16`\n- NT3 \u2192 `t29`\n- NT3 \u2192 `t50`? Wait no, looking back, no, perhaps it's other non-terminals.

Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nYes, there's NT3 \u2192 `t29`. So the first token is `t29` which can come from NT3.\n\nSo, to start, S can produce NT3 NT8. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nWait, S's productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12 (no, wait, the grammar shows:\nS \u2192 NT12 NT8\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nWait, each production is S \u2192 NTxA NTyB. So, for the string, the overall breakdown will have S generating two non-terminals, which then each generate more symbols.\n\nSo the initial step: S can produce, for example, NT12 and NT8.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t29`, so if the first part of the production is NT3 (since NT3 \u2192 `t29`), then maybe S's production NT3 would be part of it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol comes from one of the non-terminals that directly produce `t29`.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is `t29 t19 t66 t26 t77`. Let's see how each token could fit.\n\nStarting with `t29`:\n\nThe only production that leads to `t29` is NT3 \u2192 `t29`.\n\nSo the initial production is S \u2192 NT3 NT8.\n\nSo now we have NT3 and NT8.\n\nFirst, NT3 is `t29`, so that's the first symbol. Now, we need to derive NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8, what productions does it have? Looking through the grammar:\n\nI see that NT8 has a production NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20.\n\nAlso, NT8 is a non-terminal, but in the string, after `t29` comes `t19`, which is the second symbol.\n\nSo after NT3 (`t29`), we have NT8, which needs to produce `t19`.\n\nBut wait, NT8 itself doesn't directly produce `t19`. Let me check the productions for NT8.\n\nLooking back, under NT8, the productions are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n- Also, other lines, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT8, I see:\n\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar, I don't see NT8 directly producing any terminals except for 't' in the lines where NT3 \u2192 `t16`, `t29`, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a path where NT8 would produce `t19`.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's see if after NT3 (t29), the next symbol is t19, so perhaps NT8 must produce t19.\n\nLooking for NT8 \u2192 something that can derive t19.\n\nFrom NT8's productions:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20: Let's see what those can produce.\n\nNT4: Let's look at its productions.

{"custom_id":"request-79","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t61 t26 t29 t70 t26`. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and I need to walk through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar given seems to fit that structure.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The productions for S are:\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSince S is the start symbol, the string must be generated by one of these paths. The string given is `t61 t26 t29 t70 t26`. That's five tokens. Let me think about how the grammar would generate such a string.\n\nHmm, considering the production rules, each application of a rule adds one or two symbols to the string. In this case, all the productions seem to involve non-terminals except for the ones that directly produce terminals. So, for a string of length 5, the derivation must involve a certain number of steps where non-terminals are replaced by terminal symbols or other non-terminals until we get down to the terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string, the last part ends with `t26`. Let me see where `t26` comes from in the grammar. Looking through the rules, I see that NT20 \u2192 't26' and NT10 \u2192 't26' as well. So, `t26` can be generated by either NT20 or NT10.\n\nNext, looking at the third token from the end: `t29`. Checking the rules, NT3 \u2192 't29' directly. So, T29 must come from NT3.\n\nThen, the fourth token `t70`\u2014looking at the grammar, NT12 \u2192 't70'? Wait, checking the rules, I see NT12 has several productions:\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT8\n\nHmm, but none of these directly produce 't70'. Wait, perhaps I missed that. Let me scan the rules again for NT12's productions. Oh, I see NT12 -> 't12' is one of the rules. Wait, but in the string, we have `t70`. So how is that possible?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Looking at NT12's productions, I see:\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT8\nBut none of these directly produce 't70'. But in the string, we have a 't70' as the fourth token. So perhaps I need to look further down the rules.\n\nWait, maybe NT7 has a production that includes 't70'. Let me check NT7's productions. Oh, wait, I think NT16 \u2192 't70' is one of the rules. Looking through the rules, I see NT16 \u2192 't70'.\n\nSo, in the string, the next token after t29 is t70, so that would have to come from a production that eventually leads to t70. That suggests that one of the non-terminals in the chain of productions is NT16, which directly produces 't70'.\n\nContinuing backward, the second token is `t26`. As I noted earlier, that can come from NT20 or NT10. Let's see what precedes t26. The token before that is t29, which comes from NT3. So, perhaps we're looking at a structure where there's NT3 somewhere in the derivation.\n\nNow, considering the string, I think the structure might be something like S \u2192 NT7 NT14 \u2192 where one of these leads to t29 and the other to t26? Wait, but t29 and t70 are both in the string, so maybe S is expanding into a path that includes multiple non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's try to outline a possible derivation. Starting from S, which can be NT7 and NT14.\n\nLooking at the second token in the string, `t26`, which can come from NT20 or NT10. Let's assume one line of the derivation is S \u2192 NT7 NT14.\n\nNow, let's see what each could produce. For example, NT7 could produce t77 or other symbols, and NT14 could produce t43, t65, etc.\n\nBut looking deeper, let's consider each possibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S is using S \u2192 NT9 NT12. Then, NT9 could lead to more non-terminals, and NT12 could also lead to more. Let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT9 NT12, then NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9, and NT12 \u2192 NT12 \u2192 various options.\n\nWait, NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9 suggests that it might lead to a recursive structure, possibly containing 't65' or other terminals.\n\nWait, let's try to outline it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the terminals in the string and seeing which non-terminals can produce them. Let's break down the string:\n\nThe string is `t61 t26 t29 t70 t26`.\n\nLet me consider the order of production. In CFG, we derive from left to right, so the first symbol in the string should be the output of either S or a non-terminal that eventually produces it, then the next, and so on.\n\nSo, starting with the first symbol, 't61'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't61'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT17 \u2192 't61'. So, the first non-terminal must be NT17, which directly produces 't61'.\n\nWait, but in our case, the first symbol is 't61', so the entire starting symbol S must eventually derive into a string that starts with 't61'. Wait, but S is the start symbol, and the direct productions of S are NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, and NT9 NT12. None of these produce a terminal directly. So, S can only produce a string that starts with NT12, NT7, or NT9, each followed by their respective symbols, which may produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, the production of 't61' must come from a non-terminal that is derived from S, but then S expands into a structure that eventually produces 't61' as the first symbol. Wait, but from S, the first production is something else, so unless one of those production paths leads to a chain that starts with 't61'.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I had a mistake in thinking. Since S can only produce non-terminals, the first step is that S must expand into a non-terminal, say A, and then A must produce the first token 't61'. So, looking for a production where A \u2192 't61' or A \u2192 B, where B \u2192 't61'. But in this grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't61'; they all are either S or other non-terminals in the productions. Wait, but actually, the only way a non-terminal could produce 't61' is if none of them have that as a direct production. However, looking at the rules, I do see that NT17 \u2192 't61'. So, if a non-terminal A can produce NT17, and NT17 can produce 't61', then that's possible.\n\nWait, but S directly cannot produce 't61' because its productions are all pairs of non-terminals. So, for 't61' to be the first token, it must come from a non-terminal that is a child of S in the derivation tree.\n\nSo, one possibility is S \u2192 NT7 NT14, and then NT7 might produce NT17... which then produces 't61'. Alternatively, NT14 might produce something else.\n\nLet me think through this step by step. Let's build the derivation:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12 (assuming it's this production, but let's see if it can generate the string)\n\nBut NT12 has several productions. For example, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nLet me consider the first token is 't61' which comes from NT17. So, the first NT12 must expand into NT17 NT8, and then NT17 \u2192 't61', while NT8 expands into something.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't61', so perhaps the expansion is S \u2192 NT12 NT12 \u2192 [something] leading to 't61' as the first token. Alternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT7 NT14, where NT7 expands into NT17... and NT14 expands"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-99","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it belongs to the language generated by this grammar. Hmm, okay. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. It seems like it's a set of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT12, NT7, etc.) expands into other non-terminals or sometimes terminals, which are represented by strings starting with 't'. Terminal symbols can't be further expanded, so they represent the actual letters or parts of the string that make it up.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t16 t53 t39 t66 t73 t65\". So, it's a sequence of these terminal tokens. My task is to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the production rules that allow S to generate the string. The starting symbol S has several options:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these produces two non-terminals followed by NT8 or others. Since the string is six terminals, I need to generate a sequence that builds up to six tokens. Let me see how each option can be expanded.\n\nFirst, looking at option 1: S -> NT12 nt12 nt8. So, this would eventually need to produce t16, t53, t39, t66, etc., in order.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t16, so perhaps NT12 can produce t16. Looking at the production rules for NT12:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\nNT16 -> NT16 NT4\nHmm, not directly t16. Wait, looking through all the NT12 productions:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\nNT12 -> NT19 NT8\nWait, no. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the NT12 rules:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\nNT12 -> NT19 NT8\nWait, no. Checking back, I think I misread. Looking at the list:\n\nLooking for NT12 productions:\n\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT19 NT8\n- ... others but these are the ones I need.\n\nSo, NT12 can expand into NT17 NT8 or NT19 NT8. Both produce two non-terminals, which then need to expand into their terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t16, which suggests that one of these productions must lead to t16. Let me check if any of these can produce t16.\n\nLooking from the start, the string is t16 t53 t39 t66 t73 t65.\n\nSo, the first step would be to generate t16. Looking at the grammar, what terminal symbols are present? The user listed several like t16, t53, etc. Each start with 't', so the terminals are specific combinations.\n\nI need to see if the initial productions lead to these terminals. Let's take each production and see if any can start with t16.\n\nFirst production: S -> NT12 nt12 nt8. Wait, nt11 and nt8 in the initial production might not directly lead to t16. Let's see where NT12 leads.\n\nFrom NT12's productions: NT12 can go to NT17 NT8 or NT19 NT8.\n\nLooking at NT17's rules, for example:\n\nNT17 -> NT13 NT4, NT13 NT12, NT11 NT12, etc. Hmm, that's a bit complex.\n\nAlternatively, NT19 -> NT1 NT2, etc. Maybe not the straightforward path.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for a production that can directly produce a terminal. For example, looking for NT that have terminal productions.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT3 has a production NT3 -> 't16'. Similarly, NT3 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nYes, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT3 -> 't16'\nAnd so on. So some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. So, when trying to derive the string, we might have parts where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nSo, the string to derive is \"t16 t53 t39 t66 t73 t65\".\n\nLet me break it down into individual terminals: t16, t53, t39, t66, t73, t65.\n\nEach of these must be generated by some production rule where a non-terminal expands into that terminal.\n\nLooking for each terminal in the grammar, I can note which non-terminal can produce them.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- 't16' is produced by NT3.\n- 't53' is produced by NT10.\n- 't39' is produced by NT5.\n- 't66' is produced by NT15 and NT15 (duplicate).\n- 't73' is produced by NT14.\n- 't65' is produced by NT10, NT4, NT17, etc.\n\nSo, each of these terminals has a corresponding non-terminal that can produce them.\n\nNow, trying to model the derivation step by step.\n\nThe string is six terminals, so the parse tree must have three symbols on the left side (since 2n-1 = 5 for n=3 non-terminals, but here n=6, so perhaps a different approach).\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form requires each production to be either A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, some productions have more than two non-terminals on the left. For example, S->NT12 NT12 NT8 has three non-terminals. That would not be in Chomsky normal form. Wait, but the initial question states that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so maybe I misread.\n\nWait, Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires each production to be of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production can only have two symbols on the left. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in counting.\n\nLooking at the given rules again, I see that the productions like S -> NT12 NT12 NT8 have three non-terminals on the left. That would mean these are not valid CNF. Hmm, perhaps the user made a typo or a mistake in listing them. Alternatively, maybe some rules are allowed to have more than two non-terminals, but that contradicts CNF.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to clarify whether the given grammar is in CNF considering all rules. For example, looking at the S production: S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, which has three non-terminals. This would not fit CNF, which allows only two or one symbols. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, or maybe the user included an error.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mistake, and the user meant that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form except for some possible misspellings. Alternatively, maybe the user actually made a mistake in listing the grammar, but for the purpose of solving the problem, I need to consider the given rules as they are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is not in CNF, but the user says it is. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mistake, but let's assume that the grammar is as given, and proceed.\n\nNow, looking at the string \"t16 t53 t39 t66 t73 t65\". That's six tokens, so the derivation must have six steps, each expanding a non-terminal into a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, the parse tree must have a certain structure where the total number of nodes plus the number of leaves relates to the length.\n\nBut perhaps I can approach it by building the parse tree from the terminals upwards.\n\nLet me list the string and see how the non-terminals can expand into it.\n\nWe have:\n\nt16, t53, t39, t66, t73, t65.\n\nLooking at t16, the possible non-terminals that can produce it are those with production to t16.\n\nFrom the rules, only NT3 -> 't16'. So in the derivation, one of the non-terminals must be NT3.\n\nSimilarly, t53 is produced by NT10, which is only produced by NT14 and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking for each terminal:\n\n- t16: NT3\n- t53: NT10\n- t39: NT5\n- t66: NT15 (two times)\n- t73: NT14\n- t65: NT4, NT10, etc.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-98","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The string to evaluate is `t65 t70 t19 t40 t61 t29`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Looking at the rules, they're mostly non-terminals expanding into other non-terminals, except for a few that directly produce terminal symbols. The terminals are like 't65', 't70', etc. So, the string I'm checking is made up of these terminals, and I have to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar.\n\nMy approach will be to try to parse the string from left to right, checking if each terminal can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the top-down parsing approach or construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me first list the productions that directly produce terminals to map the string to possible non-terminals.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- S -> NT12 NT12 (but NT12 is a combination of other non-terminals)\n- Other S rules produce NT14, NT9, etc., which might eventually lead to terminals.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string:\n\nt65, t70, t19, t40, t61, t29.\n\nI need to find where these terminals appear in the grammar.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- 't65' appears in S -> NT12 NT12 (since NT12 -> 't12'), so in the given rules, 't65' is in NT4. Wait, no, looking closer, 't65' is in NT4 \u2192 't65', so NT4 can produce 't65'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- 't70' is in NT16 \u2192 't70'.\n\n- 't19' is in NT17\u2192't19' and some other NT17 rules, but in terminals, NT19\u2192't19' directly. Wait, looking, NT19\u2192 't19' because in the given rules, there's NT19\u2192't19'.\n\nWait, checking the given rules:\n\nYes, there's NT19 -> 't19' and also NT17->'t19' indirectly or directly.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the given rules, NT19 is a non-terminal. There's a rule for NT19:\n\nNT19 -> 't19'?\n\nWait, looking again: I see \"NT19 -> NT1 NT2\", but then further down, I also see \"NT19 -> 't19'\", no, wait. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps I misread. I see:\n\nNT19 -> 't19'?\n\nWait, looking again: in the given rules, I see\n\nNT19 -> 't19'.\n\nNo, wait: The user provided a list of rules, and I think in the user's message, under the productions, I see:\n\n- NT19 -> NT1 NT2\n\nBut then, is there a production where NT19 is a terminal?

Wait, perhaps that's a typo or misread.\n\nWait, the user's rules include:\n\n\"NT19 -> NT1 NT2\"\n\n\"NT17 -> 't19'\"\n\nWait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me parse the user's rules carefully.\n\nUnder the Rules:\n\nNT19 rules:\n\nLooking through the user's rules, I see:\n\n- NT19 -> 't19'?\n\nWait, wait. The user wrote:\n\n\"NT19\" is defined as:\n\n\"NT19 -> NT1 NT2\"\n\nBut in between, near the end, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT19 -> 't19'\"\n\nWait, no. Let me look again. The user's list is:\n\n... (a lot more rules)\n\nLooking for 't19' in the terminals, I see:\n\nYes, under the Rules:\n\n\"NT17 -> 't19'\"\n\n\"NT19 -> 't19'\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The user wrote:\n\n\"Here are the NT17 rules...\"\n\nLooking at the rules, under the user's given grammar:\n\n- NT17 has rules like:\n\n\"NT4 -> NT4 NT7\" (earlier)\n\n...\n\n\"NT17 -> 't19' (somewhere in the rules)\n\nWait, looking through the entire list of productions:\n\nYes, I notice that:\n\n\"NT17 -> 't19'\"\n\nand\n\n\"NT19 -> 't19'\"\n\nBut wait, looking at the user's rules, under NT17, there is:\n\n\"NT17 -> NT10 NT5\"\n\n\"NT5 -> 't19''?\n\nWait, wait no.\n\nWait, looking at the user's rules:\n\nAh, in the last bullet points, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT17 -> 't19'\"\n\nand\n\n\"NT19 -> 't19'\" ?\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-114","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is \"t82 t70 t82 t43 t73 t48 t61\", and the grammar is provided with all the production rules. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. C NF requires that every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit since all the non-terminals on the left side have right sides that are either two non-terminals or terminals. So that's good.\n\nNow, the main task is to parse the string using this grammar. Since context-free grammars can be parsed with methods like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is short, maybe a top-down approach like recursive descent or a backtracking method could be feasible.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string: \"t82 t70 t82 t43 t73 t48 t61\". Splitting this into tokens, we have seven tokens: [t82, t70, t82, t43, t73, t48, t61].\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. Let me list all the terminals in the grammar to see if I can match them.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals used are:\n- t82\n- t70\n- t43\n- t73\n- t48\n- t61\n- t12\n- t17\n- t95\n- t53\n- t65\n- t19\n- t9\n- t3\n- t7\n- t14\n- etc.\n\nSo, the string's tokens must be mapped to the grammar's terminals. Let me go through each token:\n\n1. t82\n2. t70\n3. t82\n4. t43\n5. t73\n6. t48\n7. t61\n\nI need to check if there's a sequence of productions that can derive this string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t82. In the grammar, which rules produce t82? Let me scan the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT13 \u2192 t82\n- NT3 \u2192 t82 (appears twice: one with 39 and another with 29)\n- NT20 \u2192 t65 (no)\n- NT12 \u2192 t12 (no)\n- NT17 \u2192 t61 (no)\n- NT15 \u2192 t65 (no)\n- NT10 \u2192 t43 (yes, NT10 \u2192 t43)\n- NT5 \u2192 t66 (no)\n- NT9 \u2192 t77 (no)\n- NT2 \u2192 does it produce t82? Looking, no.\n- NT7 \u2192 t77 (no)\n- NT13 \u2192 t82\n- NT3 \u2192 t82\n- Others seem to produce different terminals.\n\nWait, so t82 can be produced by NT13 or NT3, depending on the rule. Let me note that.\n\nThe string starts with t82, so the first symbol must be generated by a rule that produces t82. So, either NT13 or NT3.\n\nThen, after that, we have t70. Let's see what rules produce t70.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for NT70. Wait, I don't see a rule where NT produces t70. Or perhaps it's a typo. Maybe the rule is NT70 \u2192 something else, but in the given rules, I don't see that. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for rules that result in t70:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see a rule where any non-terminal directly produces t70. Oh, wait, maybe it's elsewhere. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, the productions given don't include t70 as a terminal. Hmm. Maybe I've made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the terminals are listed under certain production rules, such as:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'\nSimilarly, others like t70, t43, t73, etc., are defined.\n\nWait, so NT16 \u2192 t70, yes. So, rule NT16 \u2192 t70.\n\nSo, to produce t70, the non-terminal must be NT16.\n\nSo, the first production is S \u2192 NT12 NT16 (since the first rule under S is S -> NT12 NT16). Wait, let's see: the grammar has for S: S -> NT12 NT16. So, to get t82 and t70, let's see.\n\nWait, if S \u2192 NT12 NT16, then NT12 \u2192 t12, but wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT12 is defined as -> 't12'? No, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT12 appears in several production rules, some of which have terminals. For example, NT16 \u2192 't70'. But NT12 itself has rules like NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, or NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8, etc. Wait, but in the initial question, the string starts with t82, so how does that happen unless the initial S produces something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error. Let me start over.\n\nThe string is t82 t70 t82 t43 t73 t48 t61.\n\nGiven that, the first symbol is t82, which must come from a non-terminal that directly produces it. As I saw earlier, either NT13 or NT3 (which has two different rules: NT3 \u2192 t82 (twice)). So, t82 could be produced by NT13 or NT3.\n\nThen, the next token is t70, which must come from a non-terminal that produces t70. Looking through the grammar, is there a non-terminal that produces t70? Let's check the production rules for each non-terminal to see if they can produce t70.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT70: Not in the list provided.\n- S's rules don't have t70.\n- NT5 \u2192 't66' etc., which doesn't help.\nWait, looking more carefully, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me look at all the production rules to see if any non-terminal directly produces t70.\n\nLooking at the given production rules, I notice that there's an NT16 \u2192 't70'. So, NT16 produces t70, not NT. So, t70 is produced by NT16.\n\nTherefore, the first symbol, t82, must come from either NT13 or NT3.\n\nNow, the second symbol is t70, which must come from NT16.\n\nSo, considering the first production step, the first part of the string (t82 t70) would correspond to something like NT13 NT16, if t82 is from NT13, or NT3 NT16 if t82 is from NT3.\n\nBut how do these non-terminals relate in the grammar? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT13: In the grammar, none of the rules for NT13 directly produce t70. Wait, maybe through the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps t82 can be derived through a series of steps.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to consider possible derivations.\n\nLet's think: the string has seven tokens. Let's consider whether each token can be generated by some rule.\n\nFirst token: t82 (can be NT13 or NT3)\n\nSecond: t70 (must be NT16)\n\nThird: t82 (another NT13 or NT3)\n\nFourth: t43 (must be NT10, since NT10 \u2192 t43)\n\nFifth: t73 (what produces t73? Looking through the rules, I don't see a terminal t73. Wait, no: looking again, perhaps NT20 \u2192 t73? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at NT20: The rules say NT20 \u2192 t65 and others, so no. Hmm, wait. Did I make a mistake earlier? Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps t73 can be produced by another non-terminal. Let's check the rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at NT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4. Wait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-122","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has specific structures that I can exploit. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It consists of non-terminals (S, NT12, NT8, etc.) and terminals, which are the actual symbols in the strings, like 't19', 't48', etc. The string I need to check is `t19 t48 t39 t95 t73 t17 t66`.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Chomsky normal form grammars have no \u03b5-productions and every production has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal.\n\nGiven that, I can approach this problem by working backwards from the string, trying to see if each terminal can be derived by applying the productions in reverse.\n\nLet me list out the productions again for clarity, focusing on the ones that produce terminals since non-terminals will eventually expand into terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice several NT productions that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't53' (Wait, but the string has 't73', so that might not directly help)\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT21 -> 't65' etc.\n- Some others like NT17 -> 't61', NT13 -> 't82', etc.\n\nNow, the string is `t19 t48 t39 t95 t73 t17 t66`. Let's reverse the string to make it easier to process since we're working from the leaves up.\n\nSo, reversed: t66 t17 t73 t95 t48 t39 t19.\n\nI'll try to match the highest-level production first and see if I can expand it into the string.\n\nLooking at the first symbol in the reversed string, which is 't66'. Looking through the productions, I see that NT5 -> 't66', so the first part could come from NT5.\n\nSo, let's say the first production is NT5 -> 't66'. Then, we have to see how NT5 can be broken down. From the grammar, looking at NT5's productions:\n\nNT5 -> NT17 NT4\nNT5 -> NT13 NT7\nNT5 -> NT3 NT9\nNT5 -> NT14 NT5\nNT5 -> NT8 NT2\nNT5 -> NT11 NT14\nNT5 -> NT3 NT7\nNT5 -> NT15 NT9\nNT5 -> NT9 NT15\nNT5 -> NT7 NT2\nNT5 -> NT21 NT5\nNT5 -> NT21 NT3\nNT5 -> NT3 NT2\nNT5 -> NT21 NT8\nNT5 -> NT19 NT5\nNT5 -> NT17 NT5\nNT5 -> NT11 NT5\nNT5 -> NT16 NT5\nNT5 -> NT2 NT5\nNT5 -> NT15 NT5\nSo, maybe NT5 can produce 't66' through NT5 -> 't66', but that doesn't seem right because from the production rules, NT5 doesn't have a direct production to 't66'. Wait, looking again, I see that NT5's productions all involve non-terminals except at specific points. For example, NT5 -> 't66' is actually in the productions, as seen in the original list:\n\nYes, looking back, there's a production NT5 -> 't66', so NT5 can directly produce 't66'. So, that would be one part. Now, the rest of the string after 't66' is 't17 t73 t95 t48 t39 t19'.\n\nSo, the next step is to see what comes before 't66'. Since we're working backward, the structure would be something like NT5 -> [something] 't66', but that's not straightforward. Wait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals, except for the terminals. So, if NT5 -> 't66', then to produce a string that includes 't66' as the last symbol, we'd have a rule that ends with NT5, and the expansion would be ... -> NT5 -> 't66', but in terms of parsing, it's the other way around.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string is `t19 t48 t39 t95 t73 t17 t66`, I can try to split this string into parts that correspond to the non-terminal productions.\n\nLet's consider each production in the grammar and see if the string can be decomposed according to them. For example, starting from the first symbol, 't19', can that come from a single rule as a terminal?\n\nLooking at the productions, NT1 -> 't19' is present.\n\nSo, the first symbol could be derived from NT1 -> 't19'. Then, the rest after 't19' would be 't48 t39 t95 t73 t17 t66'.\n\nNow, moving to the next symbol, 't48', which is handled by NT8 -> 't48'.\n\nSo, after NT1, the structure would be something like NT1 -> something -> 't19', and before that something must be NT8, because NT8 produces 't48'. So, the next part of the string after 't19' is 't48 ...', which suggests that NT8 is the parent of 't48'.\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, the structure would be S -> NT1 NT8, where NT1 produces 't19' and NT8 produces 't48'. So, the first part of the string matches that.\n\nNow, after 't48', the next symbol is 't39', which comes from NT5 -> 't39'. So, the next production could be NT5 -> 't39'.\n\nSo now, the structure would be: NT1 -> NT5, which is 't19', and then NT8 -> 't48', but that doesn't align because NT8 is fixed as 't48', which only comes from the direct production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try building the string step by step.\n\nThe string is 't19 t48 t39 t95 t73 t17 t66'.\n\nIf the grammar starts from S, which produces either NT12 NT14 or others. Wait, looking at the productions, S can split into multiple non-terminals. Maybe it's better to break the string into parts according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to break the string from the start, considering each production that combines two non-terminals into a terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by a series of productions, starting from S and applying them step by step.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. S can produce various combinations, but let me see if any of the productions of S can match parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the first production options for S:\n\n- S -> NT12 NT14\n- S -> NT9 NT14\n- S -> NT9 NT12\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are 't19 t48', which might suggest that one of the non-terminals produces 't19', and another produces 't48'. From the grammar, I see NT1 -> 't19' and NT8 -> 't48'. So, maybe S -> NT1 NT8, which is one of the productions.\n\nSo, the first part of the string would be from NT1 -> 't19' and NT8 -> 't48', giving us the first two symbols: 't19 t48'.\n\nThen, after that, the remaining string is 't39 t95 t73 t17 t66'.\n\nNow, looking at the next symbols after 't19 t48', the next is 't39'. So, the next non-terminal must produce 't39', which is NT5.\n\nLooking through S's productions, the third option is S -> NT9 NT12. Let's see:\n\nIf S -> NT9 NT12, then NT9 would have to produce the next symbol(s), and NT12 would produce the remaining.\n\nBut NT9 -> 't39' is present. So, NT9 -> 't39' would make the next symbol 't39"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t82 t43 t43 t61 t70 t39 t40 t77`. \n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, most rules seem to be of the form A \u2192 BC, except some like S \u2192 NT12 NT12 or NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9, which might indicate left recursion or other complexities. But since it's CNF, any left recursion would need to be converted to right recursion, but perhaps that's handled elsewhere.\n\nEach non-terminal must eventually derive a terminal string. The problem is to see if the given string can be derived by the grammar. \n\nThe string has 8 tokens, so the derivation must expand to exactly these 8 terminals. In CNF, the number of steps required for a string of length n is n-1, so here, we'd expect 7 production steps.\n\nI'll start by looking for production rules that directly translate terminals. In the grammar, I see rules where a non-terminal expands to a terminal followed by another non-terminal or another terminal. For example:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n- NT17 \u2192 NT7 NT2\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n- NT4 \u2192 NT11 NT20\n- NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3\n- NT10 \u2192 't53' and 't43'\n\nWait, but some terminals are assigned directly to non-terminals, like NT4 \u2192 't65', NT5 \u2192 't39', etc. So these non-terminals expand to terminals.\n\nI'll list the terminals mentioned in the string: t82, t43, t43, t61, t70, t39, t40, t77.\n\nNow, looking for rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't29', 't16', 't43', 't81', 't39', 't82', 't65' (multiple options)\n- NT5 \u2192 't17', 't66', 't39', 't65'\n- NT8 \u2192 't48', 't15', 't70', 't19', 't40', 't48' (multiple options)\n- NT10 \u2192 't43', 't53', 't73'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12' is a terminal\n- NT14 \u2192 't4', 't53', etc. (Wait, looking back, I see NT10 \u2192 't43', NT12 \u2192 't12', NT5 \u2192 't39', etc.)\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 -> 't12' \u2014 so NT12 directly outputs 't12'.\n\nSimilarly, NT10 -> 't43', 't53', 't73'; so NT10 can produce 't43'.\n\nNT3 can produce 't29', 't16', 't43', 't81', 't39', 't82', 't65'.\n\nLooking at the string, the third token is t43, which could come from NT10 or NT3.\n\nWait, let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t82 t43 t43 t61 t70 t39 t40 t77.\n\nThat's 8 tokens. So the derivation would have to expand 8 terminals, meaning starting from S, which is the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the S rules: S \u2192 NT12 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT2, S \u2192 NT6 NT10. Hmm. Wait, wait, the S production rules are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT2\nS -> NT6 NT10\n\nWait, so S can derive three possible left combinations. Let me see what each rule produces.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT12 NT14. NT12 is a non-terminal, and NT14 is also a non-terminal. So this would mean we have to derive both NT12 and NT14.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is t82. Let's look for which NT can produce t82. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't82', NT5 \u2192 't66', NT15 \u2192 't82', etc. So NT3 and NT15 can produce 't82'.\n\nSo, if the first symbol is t82, NT12 or NT9 or other may produce that.\n\nWait, let's try to map the first token 't82'. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8 and others, maybe not directly t82.\n\nLooking for NT that directly derive to 't82'. Let's see:\n\nIn the grammar:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n\nAdditionally, NT14 \u2192 't4', 't53', 't73', etc. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't82' \u2014 yes, there's a production NT15 \u2192 't82'.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 can produce 't82'.\n\nSo, perhaps the first token comes from NT3 or NT15.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t82. Let's see how that can be generated.\n\nIf NT3 expands to t82, that would be one possibility. Alternatively, NT15 can produce t82.\n\nBut in the early steps, S \u2192 NT9 NT10, for example. Let me think about how the initial expansion might happen.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by parsing the string step by step, looking for possible productions that can fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach with the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the possible sentences that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me see some example derivations.\n\nFirst, S can produce NT12 NT14, NT9 NT2, or NT6 NT10. Let's pick NT12 NT14 first.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nNT14 \u2192 't4', which isn't t82, but wait, looking at NT14's rules: NT14 \u2192 NT4 NT0, and perhaps others. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build the parse tree.\n\nLooking at the string: [t82, t43, t43, t61, t70, t39, t40, t77]\n\nI can try to match t82 first. So, find a non-terminal that can derive t82. It could be NT3 or NT15.\n\nLet me assume that the first token is generated by NT15. Then NT15 \u2192 't82'.\n\nThen, the next token is t43. So, the second symbol is t43. Let's see what NT can derive t43.\n\nLooking back, NT10 \u2192 't43', 't53', 't73'.\n\nSo, perhaps the NT10 rule is used here.\n\nBut wait, looking at the S rules, the next step after S is a combination.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see how the non-terminals relate to each other and to the terminals. Since the string consists entirely of terminals, I'm dealing with an application of productions that ultimately replace non-terminals with terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16' (twice)\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT15 \u2192 't82' (three times in different productions)\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT21 \u2192 't82'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT4 \u2192 't6','t70' etc., but more directly, NT4 has several 't65', 't17', 't26', etc.\n\nWait, no, the grammar seems to have several rules where non-terminals directly produce a single terminal. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12', NT3\u2192 't16', NT5\u2192 't39', etc. So, any string generated by this grammar must consist of a sequence of these terminals, but also following the structure defined by the grammar.\n\nThe string given is: `t82 t66 t53 t82 t16 t82 t43 t66`\n\nLet's list the terminals in order: t82, t66, t53, t82, t16, t82, t43, t66.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nLooking at S, it has three productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo, S can produce two NT12s, or an NT7 and NT14, or an NT9 and NT12.\n\nIn the string, I start with t82, which is likely the result of a NT15 \u2192 t82. Because looking at the grammar, NT15 \u2192 't82' appears multiple times.\n\nWait, but looking back at the grammar, there are multiple NT15 \u2192 't82' rules. So, NT15 can directly produce t82.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT7 NT14 \u2192 ... but let's see.\n\nWait, actually, the first symbol is t82. Let's see what non-terminals can produce t82.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT15 \u2192 't82' multiple times. So T can be NT15.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 \u2192 't16' and other NTs produce 't16'.\n\nBut let's start from S. Suppose S expands to NT9 NT12.\n\nLooking at the production S \u2192 NT9 NT12. Then, to get 't82' as the first symbol, maybe NT9 is involved.\n\nWait, NT9 can produce 't77' (from NT9 \u2192 't77'), but also, other NTs like NT15 produce t82. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT7 NT14. Let me see what NT7 and NT14 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT16. Then NT2 could produce various things. For example, NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17, which could go on.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step, seeing possible substitutions.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to check if the string can be generated by the grammar. Since all symbols are terminals, each step must eventually substitute non-terminals with terminals.\n\nEach terminal in the string must come from a production that ends in that terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t82, t66, t53, t82, t16, t82, t43, t66.\n\nt82: could come from NT15\nt66: Hmm, looking at the grammar, are there any NTs that produce 't66'? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT15 \u2192 't82', so that's not it. Wait, NT5 \u2192 't39', NT4 \u2192 't65', etc. Wait, maybe I didn't see a t66 production. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules for NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT2 NT10, which later could lead to 't53' maybe. But the direct productions for terminals:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT15 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't39', etc.\n- NT10 \u2192 't53', 't43', 't73'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65', 't67', etc.\n- NT20 \u2192 't65', 't26', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't66' in the grammar. So perhaps the string includes a terminal that isn't present, meaning it can't be generated.\n\nWait, let me check again. The string is `t82 t66 t53 t82 t16 t82 t43 t66`. So 't66' appears twice. Looking through the grammar, are there any NTs that produce t66?\n\nLooking at all the direct productions:\n\nLooking at NT8: NT8 \u2192 't48' once and other rules that may not lead to t66.\n\nNT13: 't40' but no t66. NT14: 't65'. NT7: 't77'. NT20: 't65' and others. NT5: 't39', 't66' (wait, looking back).\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT5, there's NT5 \u2192 't39' and also NT5 \u2192 't66'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT5: NT5 \u2192 't39', 't66', 't66'? Wait, not sure. Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7\n...\nAlso, under NT15: NT15 \u2192 't82' multiple times.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar:\n\nDoes any non-terminal directly produce 't66'? Let me look for 't66' in the grammar. \n\nLooking through all lines, I see NT5 \u2192 't39' and 't66'. For example, under NT5, there's:\n\nNT5 -> NT17 NT4\n...\nAnd in the other rules, there's NT4 \u2192 't17', 't26', 't48', 't65', etc., but no 't66'.\n\nWait, but does any NT produce 't66'? Let's check:\n\nI see that in the list, under NT5, I see 't39', and 't66'\u2014wait, yes, under NT5:\n\nNT5 -> 't39' and 't66', perhaps? Wait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through each line, the production for NT5 is written as:\n\nNT5 -> NT17 NT4\n\nAlso, somewhere else, does NT5 produce a terminal? Let's check all lines.\n\nAh, I see several lines where non-terminals produce single terminals:\n\nFor example, under NT3: several 't16' production.\n\nUnder NT10: NT10 \u2192 't53', 't43', 't73'.\n\nUnder NT4: NT4 \u2192 't65' appears multiple times.\n\nUnder NT20: NT20 \u2192 't65' etc.\n\nWait, looking specifically, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't66'. So if the string has 't66', but no NT in the grammar can produce 't66' directly, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No' because 't66' is not a terminal that any non-terminal can produce.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the terminal 't66', which cannot be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-154","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem to solve. So, the task is to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except possibly the start symbol S. The start symbol S can produce NT12 NT8, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. Each of these non-terminals can then be further broken down into other non-terminals or terminal symbols.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t40 t19 t29 t48 t19 t19 t48 t43 t82`. It looks like each element is either a non-terminal or a terminal, but since the string doesn't have any spaces, each word is a symbol in the string.\n\nThe key here is to see how this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules. Since it's in CNF, every step in the derivation must produce strings of two symbols until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me start by checking the first symbol 't40'. Looking at the grammar, I see that T14 produces 't47', T12 produces 't12', and T5 produces 't39'. Wait, 't40' doesn't seem to be directly produced by any rule. Let me check T39? No, the rules don't mention t40. Hmm. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that some of the NT rules produce 't's with specific numbers. For instance, NT0 -> 't40' directly. So, 't40' is the terminal symbol for NT0. That means the last production step must involve NT0.\n\nSo, the string ends with t43, t82, but wait\u2014 I'm a bit confused. Let me consider that each symbol in the string must come from some production rule. Let's write down each symbol and see their possible origins.\n\nThe string is: t40, t19, t29, t48, t19, t19, t48, t43, t82.\n\nLooking for 't40': that's NT0 -> t40.\n\n't19': Let's see what NT19 produces. In the grammar, looking for NT19 productions: I don't see any direct production for NT19. Wait, perhaps NT19 is an alias like NT19 -> something else. Or perhaps it's a typo, and it should be 't19' as a terminal or linked to another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Let's see, NT19 -> NT1 NT2. Hmm, that's another non-terminal. So, 't19' would come from NT19. But if NT19 needs to be broken down into NT1 and NT2, and each of those must be terminals or non-terminals, that's possible, but I need to see if that's a path.\n\nWait a minute, hold on. Let me try to parse the string backward. Sometimes that helps in these derivations. Starting from the end and seeing if we can reduce the string using the productions.\n\nThe last symbol is 't82'. Looking at the grammar, NT3 -> 't16', 't29', 't3', 't82' appears in NT5 -> 't66', and NT15 -> 't65', etc. Wait, the only way to get 't82' is from NT13, I think. Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking back, the productions for NT13: NT13 -> NT12 NT19. Hmm, but 't82' is elsewhere. Wait, I don't see 't82' being directly produced by any NT. Let me look again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT13 -> NT12 NT19? No, actually, looking back, I see NT13 -> NT12 NT19 isn't directly; actually, let me correct: in the grammar, I see NT13 -> 't29', but wait no, that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look at the grammar again:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 -> NT5 NT2\n\nNT2 -> NT11 NT17\n\nNT3 -> NT13 NT7\n\nNT4 -> NT11 NT5, NT16 -> NT16 NT4\n\nNT5 -> NT5 NT4, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it systematically.\n\nEach step, we can split the string into pairs. So the string has 9 symbols, which is an odd number, but in Chomsky normal form, each production results in two symbols, so the length of the string after each step should increase by one (since starting from S, which is two symbols). So, starting from S (2 symbols), each step adds a symbol, so after 7 steps, we reach 9 symbols. That makes sense.\n\nBut in this case, the string is `t40 t19 t29 t48 t19 t19 t48 t43 t82`. Let me try to break it into tokens:\n\nTokens: 1: t40, 2: t19, 3: t29, 4: t48, 5: t19, 6: t19,7:t48,8:t43,9:t82.\n\nI think the best approach is to work from the start symbol and see if I can generate the string. But since the string has 9 tokens, it's a bit complex. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a parsing approach, trying to reduce the string from the right.\n\nLet me attempt to reduce the string by checking possible productions at each step.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: t82. Let's see which NT can produce t82. Looking through the productions, nothing directly produces t82 except perhaps NT18? Wait, I don't see a direct production for t82 in the NT rules. Wait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking at NT8: production rules include NT8 -> 't48'. So, 't48' is from NT8.\n\nWait, but where does 't82' come from? I don't see a production for t82, which suggests that 't82' must be a terminal that's produced by some NT.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT that produces 't82' as a terminal. So perhaps 't82' is from NT13 -> 't29', no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify all the terminal symbols:\n\nLooking in the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt40, t53, t43, t65, t16, t70, t12, t77, t19, t77, t17, t71, t65, t48, t43, t16, t19, t21, t53, t12, t17, t14, t54, t15, t66, t82, t39, t29, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps 't82' is a terminal. Let me check: the grammar has NT5 -> 't39', NT3 -> 't29', etc. So, 't82' must be a terminal in this grammar, perhaps as part of some NT.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that NT13 -> 't29', but not 't82'. Looking through, there's no rule that directly produces t82. So, perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT20 -> 't65', NT15 -> 't82'. Oh, yes! NT15 produces 't82' directly. So, the last symbol 't82' comes from NT15. So, in the string, the last symbol is 't82', which is produced by NT15.\n\nSo, looking at the string, the second last symbol is 't43', which is the ninth symbol in the string (9th position: t82, 8th: t43, 7th: t48). Wait, no, the string is 1-9, so the last is 9: t82, 8th: t43, 7th: t48, 6th: t19, etc.\n\nWait, let me get the positions right:\n\n1: t40\n\n2: t19\n\n3: t29\n\n4: t48\n\n5: t19\n\n6: t19\n\n7: t48\n\n8: t43\n\n9: t82\n\nSo, t82 is number 9. So, we can start by checking which NT can produce t82.

{"custom_id":"request-176","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, right. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. All the productions have that structure. So, for example, S \u2192 AB or A \u2192 BC. That should help because each step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the productions are for the non-terminals, and some of them directly produce terminals. For instance, NT12 \u2192 't12', which is a terminal string. Similarly, other non-terminals like NT4, NT5, NT8, etc., produce specific terminals.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t39 t70 t12 t61 t53 t77 t81 t66 t61 t26`. So it's a sequence of terminals. My task is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use a top-down parsing method, starting from S and trying to build the string step by step. But since the string is quite long, maybe I should start breaking it down into parts and see if each terminal can be matched from the productions.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of how each terminal in the string could be generated. Let me list all the terminals in the string: t39, t70, t12, t61, t53, t77, t81, t66, t61, t26. \n\nLet's look at each terminal and see if it's directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. From the grammar, I can see that NT12 \u2192 't12', NT4 \u2192 't65', NT5 \u2192 't39', NT8 \u2192 't48', NT15 \u2192 't65', etc. So, some terminals are directly produced.\n\nLooking at each position:\n\n1. t39: NT5 \u2192 't39' directly. So, this can be produced by NT5.\n2. t70: NT16 \u2192 't70' directly.\n3. t12: NT12 \u2192 't12' directly.\n4. t61: NT17 \u2192 't61' directly.\n5. t53: Hmm, wait. The string has t53. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't53'. Let me check. The productions for NT4, NT6, NT5, etc., produce other terminals or non-terminals. It seems that 't53' is not directly produced by any non-terminal. But wait, NT20 \u2192 't65' and NT14 \u2192 't43'. So no, 't53' isn't produced directly. So maybe this is a problem? Or perhaps the string contains a terminal that isn't in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check the terminal 't53' again. The grammar doesn't have a production for any non-terminal that directly outputs 't53'. Let me look through the productions again:\n\nLooking at NT3: I see NT3 has some other productions, like NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14, but none of the other entries directly produce 't53'. Let me go through each NT rule. \n\nHmm, maybe I missed it. No, I think 't53' is not directly produced by any non-terminal. That would mean that the string contains a symbol that cannot be derived, so the answer would be 'No'. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe 't53' can be produced indirectly. Let me try to see if any non-terminals can produce 't53'. For example, do any of the non-terminals have a production that includes 't53' on the right-hand side? Looking at all the rules, I don't see any. So, unless a non-terminal can produce a combination that leads to 't53', but since it's directly not there, it's impossible.\n\nSo, if the string contains 't53', which isn't directly generated by any production, but wait, the grammar's non-terminals might have to derive 't53' through a series of productions that produce other terminals. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the grammar again: NT5 \u2192 't39', so that's okay. But looking for 't53', it doesn't appear as a terminal in any production. The only terminals I see are as listed in the grammar's right-hand sides. 't53' isn't there. So that means the string has a terminal that isn't part of the grammar, which would make the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a sequence of the productions of the grammar, but if one symbol can't be produced, then the string isn't in the language.\n\nSo, that would mean the answer is 'No' because the string contains 't53', which isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a terminal symbol 't53' which is not produced by any non-terminal in the given grammar.

Let's try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow CNF since all left-hand sides are single non-terminals and the right-hand sides are combinations of two non-terminals or a mix until a terminal is reached.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t77 t40 t19 t70 t29 t40 t12 t82 t77 t12`. \n\nI notice that many of these tokens look like terminal symbols, but some might be non-terminals as well\u2014especially since the grammar has productions where the right-hand side includes terminals like 't53', 't65', etc. So, I need to see if each token in the string corresponds to a terminal production or can be built up from non-terminals.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, the top-down parsing can be done using something like the CYK algorithm, which helps determine if a string is in the language. Alternatively, I might try to find a parse tree for the string step by step.\n\nLet's list the productions relevant to the tokens in the string. Notably, terminal symbols like t77, t40, t19, t70, etc., are all defined in the grammar as single non-terminal productions. For example, t77 is defined via NT7 -> 't77', t40 via NT0 -> 't40', etc.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- t77 comes from NT7\n- t40 comes from NT0\n- t19 comes from NT1\n- t70 comes from NT16\n- t29 comes from NT3\n- t82 comes from NT15 and NT13\n- t12 comes from NT12\n- t77 again from NT7\n- t12 again from NT12\n\nSo, each of these could be leaves in a parse tree, but I need to see if the entire sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nNow, let's look at the S productions.

Each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for a string with ten terminals, we need a derivation that takes 9 steps (since each step can produce one terminal at a time). But actually, in CNF, each production contributes to the number of symbols, so the derivation length is (n-1) * 2^(n-1), where n is the number of terminals. Since there are ten terminals, the string's length is 10, which could be derived if there is a way to decompose it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a parse tree where each step combines non-terminals and terminals appropriately.\n\nLooking at the string step by step, let's see if we can find a way to parse it.\n\nFirst, let's consider where the first token 't77' comes from. 't77' is from NT7. Looking at NT7's productions, NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT16. So NT7 can be decomposed into NT2 and NT16. Each of these can further be decomposed.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT16\n- NT2 has several productions:\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT16\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT0\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT21 NT4\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT12 NT17\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT16\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT21 NT5\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT17 NT5\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT13\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT12 NT17\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT16\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT17 NT4\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT20 NT15\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT21 NT8\n  - NT2 \u2192 NT2 \u2192 NT12 NT0\n\nLooking at this, perhaps starting with NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT16.\n\nNow, NT16's productions are:\n\n- NT16 \u2192 NT16 NT4\n- NT16 \u2192 NT7 NT20\n\nSo, NT16 can either produce two NT16s and a NT4 or NT7 and NT20.\n\nBut maybe NT16 \u2192 NT7 NT20 is better since that gets us somewhere. So NT16 \u2192 NT7 NT20.\n\nNow, let's see NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT16 again. So, our initial decomposition would be:\n\nt77 (NT7) \u2192 NT2 NT16 \u2192 (NT2: let's pick one path) say NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17 and NT16 \u2192 NT7 NT20.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work from the start symbol and see if the string can be built up.\n\nStarting with S, which can derive:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nNow, our string starts with 't77', which comes from NT7. So, perhaps we need to use the S \u2192 NT7 NT14 production.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT7 NT14.\n\nNow, NT7 \u2192 ... Let's find out where 't77' comes from. NT7 is 't77'. So if we derive 't77' from NT7, we need NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT16, and then those non-terminals must derive to produce the rest.\n\nWait, this might be a dead end. Maybe another approach is to look at the structure of the grammar and see if the string can be built from the start.\n\nAnother way is to try to find the parse tree.\n\nGiven the string, we can start from the beginning and try to match the productions.\n\n- The first token is 't77', which is from NT7. So, NT7 must derive to 't77'. Looking at the production, NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT16.\n\nSo, after NT7 is used, we have the string split into:\n\nt77 [ ... rest of the string ... ]\n\nThe rest of the string would have to be the result of NT2 NT16 \u2192 the parts after 't77'.\n\nSo, the rest is 't40 t19 t70 t29 t40 t12 t82 t77 t12'.\n\nWait, that's nine tokens left, but we had 't77' and then nine more. Maybe that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, after 't77', the rest of the string is 't40 t19 t70 t29 t40 t12 t82 t77 t12', which is nine tokens. But considering that each production adds either two non-terminals or a terminal, we need to see if this can be constructed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach is to note that the string starts with 't77 t40', so let's see if there's a production where the first two non-terminals produce 't77' and 't40'.\n\nLooking at the productions, 't77' comes from NT7, and 't40' comes from NT0. So, are there any production rules where the left-hand side has NT7 and NT0? Looking back, I don't see any such production in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with 't77 t40 t19 t70 t29 t40 t12 t82 t77 t12'. Let's see:\n\nFirst, 't77' \u2192 NT7, then 't40' \u2192 NT0. But in the grammar, I don't see NT7 and NT0 being directly connected. So maybe that path is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT9 NT12. 't77' would have to come from either NT9 or NT12, but 't77' is from NT7, which isn't involved in S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. So maybe the initial S production can't produce 't77 t...' because S's productions don't start with NT7, unless we look deeper.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the first 't77' comes from NT7, and after decomposing NT7, the next symbols come from the decomposed parts.\n\nBut"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-203","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t70 t61 t61 t29 t17 t65 t39 t29 t82 t43 t81`, and I need to check if it's part of the language defined by the provided grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and the start symbol S can produce two non-terminals. The given grammar has S with productions that eventually resolve into terminals, which in this case are various `t` followed by numbers. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal, like NT12 \u2192 t12, NT10 \u2192 t53, etc. These are the base cases that terminate the derivation. The challenge is to see if the given string can be formed by a series of such productions starting from S.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the string: `t70 t61 t61 t29 t17 t65 t39 t29 t82 t43 t81`. There are 11 tokens, so the derivation must produce 11 terminals.\n\nSince each step in a CNF grammar can expand two non-terminals into two symbols (either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal or two terminals), the number of nodes in the parse tree is 2n-1 for a string of length n. So, for n=11, there should be 21 nodes, meaning 10 productions.\n\nBut maybe a more straightforward approach is to attempt to trace back from the start symbol S, seeing if I can produce the string through a series of expansions.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT12 NT12? Wait, looking at the given grammar, S has options like S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, and S \u2192 NT9 NT12. So S can produce two non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12: Each NT12 can produce t12, right? Wait no, looking at the grammar, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So that's still two non-terminals. Then NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, and NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20. This seems like it's getting more complex, and none of these directly produce t. So maybe this path isn't correct.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14. NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11, and NT14 \u2192 NT4 NT0. Then NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17, and NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT10. Continuing down this path, I end up with more non-terminals, which might lead to more symbols that don't directly produce t.\n\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12. Let's see: NT9 has a production NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9, which is a recursive production. Hmm, that might complicate things, but NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. Again, not directly giving t.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Instead of starting from S, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals produce which terminals and see if I can chain them together.\n\nLooking through the rules, there are several NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t12\n- NT10 \u2192 t53, t43, etc. Wait, actually, in the rules provided, NT10 can produce t43 via NT10 \u2192 t43 (I think I see that in one of the rules: NT10 \u2192 t43). Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see lines like:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n- NT5 \u2192 't66'\n- NT8 \u2192 't48'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', 't81', etc.\n\nSo these non-terminals directly generate certain `t` tokens. Others, like NT20, NT17, etc., generate combinations.\n\nThe string has `t70`, which is the only one that's not a direct terminal in the given rules (looking at the ones listed, most non-terminals produce `t` numbers, but some like NT6 produce other non-terminals). Wait, actually, looking back, in the provided grammar, there's \"NT16 \u2192 NT3 NT20\". Hmm, but looking at the lines, I don't see NT16 producing `t70`. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT21\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT12 (recursive)\n- NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps there's no NT directly that produces `t70`? Because in the rules, I don't see any `t70`. So maybe the string contains `t70` which isn't produced by any rule. That would immediately mean the string is not generated by the grammar. But let me confirm.\n\nLooking at all the rules, searching for any `t70`, I don't see it in the body of the grammar. For example:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the terminals are like 't70', 't61', etc., but each is part of the right-hand side of a production. So perhaps there are NTs that can produce these terminals.\n\nWait, actually, let's look for lines that start with NTx followed by \u2192 and then possibly a `t` as a terminal. For example, in the rules provided, NT8 \u2192 't48', but do any NTs produce 't70'?\n\nWait, looking through the rules again:\n\nLooking at the first set of rules, I don't see any terminal like `t70`. The initial grammar string given doesn't specify, but in the rules here, the non-terminals derive into other non-terminals and some `t` values. But I don't see NT producing `t70`. \n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules. Let's check the rules again. The user lists a long list of grammar productions, like:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\n\nSimilarly, others produce 't' followed by numbers. But does any NT produce, say, NT17 \u2192 't70'? Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT10\n- NT9 \u2192 NT12 NT15\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n- NT16 \u2192 NT7 NT20\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11\n- ... etc.\n\nAnd somewhere at the bottom of the rules, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't61'\n\nWait, yes, under the rules, some NTs produce `t`:\n\nLooking through the rules, there are multiple NTs with heads that produce `t`:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n\nWait, in the rules provided by the user, some NTs produce a `t` as their terminal symbol. For example, searching through the provided rules, I see lines such as:\n\n\"NT17 \u2192 't61'\", \"NT19 \u2192 't61'\", but I don't see any `t70` as a direct terminal.\n\nWait, looking through all the provided rules, do any of them result in a `t70`? Let me look through:\n\n- The initial part of the grammar has S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nNT12 can produce `t12`, and looking through the other rules, not seeing `t70` being directly produced.\n\nSimilarly, checking through other NT rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53', 't43', etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 't17', 't48', etc.\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'? Wait, let me check: looking at the grammar, in one place, it says \"NT16 \u2192 't70'\". Wait, yes:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n\"NT17 \u2192 't61'\", and somewhere else: \"NT20 \u2192 't65'}. Wait, wait, let me go through the rules again:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- `S -> NT12 NT12`, etc.\n\nThen, in the list of rules, looking for something like NTx \u2192 `t70`:\n\nWait, here's a line: \"NT16 \u2192 't70'\"\n\nYes, that's one. So NT16 produces 't70'.\n\nAh! So the string contains `t70`, which is produced by NT16. So that's valid.\n\nSo now, the question is whether the rest of the string can be built from the grammar.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to build the string step by step.\n\nThe string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t70 t17 t95 t48 t17 t40 t77 t82 t81 t82 t26`. I notice that these are all terminal symbols, so each token in the string corresponds to a rule that produces a single terminal in the grammar. \n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two terminals, or two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually in CNF, productions are of the form A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals or terminals (for direct terminals, they must be terminals). So looking at the grammar, all the rules on the left side are non-terminals, and the right side is two symbols. So each rule is either two non-terminals (e.g., S -> NT12 NT12) or a non-terminal leading to a terminal and a non-terminal (e.g., NT4 -> NT11 NT20).\n\nNow, the string has 11 tokens. Let me check the grammar to see how long derivations would be. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be either non-terminals or terminals. If the string has n terminals, the minimum number of steps to derive it is ceiling(log2(n+1)), but since we have 11 tokens, it would require at least 4 steps because 2^4=16 which is more than 11, but since each step doubles the number of symbols, starting from 1, after 4 steps, we have up to 16 symbols. Since our string is 11, it's possible.\n\nNext, I'll try to find a derivation path. Let's build the string from the bottom up. Let's start with the rightmost non-terminal, which should be able to produce the last token, 't26'. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see a non-terminal that directly produces 't26'.

For example, the rule NT8 -> t48 NT19: from the given grammar, NT8 is defined as NT8 -> t48 NT19. Hmm, but in the given grammar, it's written as S -> NT12 NT12, and so on.

Let me list each non-terminal and their possible terminal productions.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t12 (one rule)\n- NT16 \u2192 t70 (another rule)\n- NT20 \u2192 t65 (another rule)\n- NT3 \u2192 t16 (another rule)\n- NT5 \u2192 t39 (another rule)\n- NT4 \u2192 t65 (another rule)\n- NT8 \u2192 t48 (another rule)\n- NT17 \u2192 t61 (another rule)\n- NT12 \u2192 t77 (another rule), which is under S -> NT9 NT12, but that's under S, not directly NT12.\nWait, no. Let's look again. The rule is NT12 -> NT17 NT8, which produces two non-terminals, so that's a production from NT12 to NT17 and NT8. Not directly a terminal.\n\nWait, I think I need a better approach. Let me create a list of non-terminals that directly produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the given rules, I can find:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t12\n- NT16 \u2192 t70\n- NT8 \u2192 t48\n- NT3 \u2192 t16\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t65 (multiple rules)\n- NT20 \u2192 t65\n- NT17 \u2192 t61\n- NT21 \u2192 t82 (multiple ways)\n- NT3 \u2192 t29\n- NT13 \u2192 t82\n- NT5 \u2192 t82 via other routes\n- NT20 \u2192 t26 (another rule)\nWait, yes! The rule NT20 \u2192 t26 is present. So NT20 can produce 't26'.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 can produce 't16' and 't29', NT5 can produce 't39' and 't82', NT12 produces 't12', NT16 't70', NT8 't48', NT17 't61', NT21 can produce 't82' or 't16' or 't40' (but wait, t40 comes from which rule?)\n\nWait, looking back, the rule NT0 \u2192 t40 is present. So NT0 produces 't40'.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 \u2192 t61. And NT5 \u2192 t39, but also other rules.\n\nWait, I think I need to list all non-terminals that directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t12\n- NT16 \u2192 t70\n- NT3 \u2192 t16, t29\n- NT4 \u2192 t65 (multiple times)\n- NT5 \u2192 t39, t82, etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 t48\n- NT17 \u2192 t61\n- NT20 \u2192 t26, t48 (since S \u2192 NT8 NT12 leads to 't48' and 't12')\n- Wait, no. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I can spot several non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t12\n- NT16 \u2192 t70\n- NT8 \u2192 t48\n- NT3 \u2192 t16\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t65\n- NT20 \u2192 t26\n- NT17 \u2192 t61\n\nAdditionally, NT7 \u2192 t61, but that's part of another rule.\n\nWait, but NT12 \u2192 t12, so that's another terminal production.\n\nNow, looking at the string: t70 t17 t95 t48 t17 t40 t77 t82 t81 t82 t26.\n\nLet's see which of these are covered by direct terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nt70: yes, NT16 \u2192 t70.\nt17: Hmm, is there a non-terminal that produces 't17'? Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't17'. Wait, but NT17 can produce 't61', which is a terminal. So to get 't17' as a terminal, we'd need a rule for a non-terminal that produces 't17'. Looking through the rules, I see NT2 \u2192 t17, via the rule NT2 \u2192 t17 NT20 (from the grammar), wait no. Let me check.\n\nThe rule is: NT2 \u2192 t17 NT20?

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar structure. It's given in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which can produce various combinations of non-terminals leading to terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t17, t95, t61, t29, t12, t65, t19, t17, t61, t65, t61, t65.\n\nI think the best approach is to simulate the parsing process. Chomsky normal form typically allows for recursive descent parsing, which can be implemented using a stack or memoization.\n\nLooking at the grammar, several non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example:\n\n- S can produce NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, etc.\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT9 \u2192 which eventually might lead to a t.\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8 \u2192 etc.\n\nI should check each production of S and see if any of them can reduce to the given string.\n\nLet me try the first production: S -> NT12 NT12.\n\nSo the string starts with t17. Looking at NT12 productions, one is NT12 -> NT17 NT8. Let's check NT17: NT17 can produce NT13 NT4 or NT11 NT12 or NT17 NT12.\n\nWait, NT17 has a production NT17 -> NT13 NT4 and NT11 NT12, etc. Let's see. The first symbol after NT12 is t17, so looking for NT17 producing something that can lead to t17.\n\nWait, looking at NT17 productions: NT17 can produce NT8 NT10, NT7 NT16, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider step by step.\n\nGiven the string, the first symbol is t17. Let's see which non-terminal produces t17. Looking through the productions, I see NT4: NT4 can produce t17 because one of the productions is NT4 -> 't17' right? Let me check the grammar.\n\nYes, under NT4: NT4 -> 't17' is a production. So to get t17, we can have NT4 directly produce t17.\n\nBut in the production chain, the non-terminals must be linked. So let's see how to get t17.\n\nLooking at NT17, we have NT17 -> NT8 NT10, but that doesn't lead to t17. Alternatively, NT7 can produce t17? No, NT7 has a production NT7 -> NT7 NT12, but no direct t17. NT5: NT5 can produce t77 from NT9. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can work bottom-up. Let's see if the string ends with multiple t65s, which suggests that the string might end with some production involving NT6 or NT20, which have t65.\n\nLet me approach by trying to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string: t17 t95 t61 t29 t12 t65 t19 t17 t61 t65 t61 t65.\n\nI need to find a sequence of productions that can derive this string.\n\nFirst, S can produce NT12 NT12. Let me see: The first part would be NT12, then another NT12.\n\nLooking at NT12, it can produce NT17 NT8, so let's see if the first two symbols after t17 are t95. t95 is produced by which non-terminal? In the grammar, looking through all the terminal produce rules:\n\n- NT12 can produce t12 (from NT12 -> 't12').\n- NT16 -> 't70'.\n- NT3: t29, t39, t48, t16, t29 (from NT3), t20 (from NT0?), etc. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that each production in the grammar leads to a specific terminal. So for example:\n\nNT12 can produce t12, and if S -> NT12 NT12, then each NT12 could produce t12. But wait, in our string, after t17, the next is t95, which is not t12. So perhaps S -> NT12 NT12 is not the right path.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the NT12 productions again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\nNT12 -> NT19 NT8\n\nWait, so NT12 can produce NT17 NT8 or NT19 NT8. And NT17 and NT19 have further productions.\n\nLooking at NT17: It produces NT8 NT10, NT7 NT16, etc.\n\nWait, NT17 also has a production to NT7 NT16. But I'm not sure if that leads to t17. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking for where a terminal t17 comes from. Let me scan all the grammar rules for terminals in non-terminals:\n\n- NT4 -> 't17' (Yes!)\n- NT9 -> 't77' (Yes!)\n- NT14 -> 't4' (Wait, no, 't40' for some)\nWait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT14 -> 't40' and NT8 -> 't48', etc.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused again. Let me list all the terminals produced by each non-terminal:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\n- NT12 -> t12\n- NT16 -> t70\n- NT3 -> 't16' (Wait, no, for NT3, looking through:\n\nLooking through all the terminals for non-terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, the direct terminals are:\n\n- NT12 -> t12\n- NT16 -> t70\n- NT3 -> 't16' (Wait, no, for example:\n\nLine: NT3 -> 't16'\nAnother line: NT3 -> 't29'\nAnother line: NT3 -> 't39'\nAnother line: NT3 -> 't48'\nAnother line: NT3 -> 't16' again? Wait, looking through:\n\nLine:\nNT3 -> 't16'; yes.\nNT3 -> 't29'; yes.\nNT5 -> 't39'; yes.\nNT12 -> 't12'; yes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back.\n\nThe string starts with t17. So, we need a production that produces t17 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all non-terminals' productions, I see that NT4 -> 't17' is one. So maybe a non-terminal that can produce NT4, which then produces 't17'.\n\nLet's see:\n\nWhich non-terminals produce NT4? Looking through the grammar:\n\nLine: NT1 -> NT5 NT2\nLine: NT6 -> NT3 NT21\nLine: NT17 -> NT11 NT12\nLine: NT21 -> NT17 NT5\nLine: NT21 -> NT17 NT3\nLine: NT8 -> NT4 NT20\nLine: NT19 -> NT1 NT2\nLine: NT17 -> NT11 NT12\nLine: NT17 -> NT20 NT17\nLine: NT9 -> NT6 NT9\nLine: NT5 -> NT17 NT4\nLine: NT4 -> NT4 NT7 \u2192 no, this is a production for NT4.\nWait, NT5 produces NT17 and NT4. So NT4 is produced by NT5.\n\nBut for t17, we need NT4 -> 't17', but wait, in the grammar I have NT4 -> 't17', yes.\n\nSo, to produce t17, the production is NT4 -> t17.\n\nSo, how can we get NT4? Let me look at the productions for NT4.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nLine: NT4 -> 't17'\nLine: NT5 -> NT17 NT4\nLine: NT2 -> NT11 NT17\nLine: NT17 -> NT13 NT4\n\nSo, NT4 is directly producing 't17', and NT5 can produce NT17 NT4.\n\nBut wait, to get 't17', we can have a non-terminal that produces NT4.\n\nSo, for t17 in the string, we can have a production sequence where a non-terminal eventually leads to NT4, which then produces t17.\n\nSo, let's see: t17"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-220","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain optimizations in algorithms like CYK parsing. However, since I'm not using an algorithm here but rather trying to manually parse the string, I'll need to consider the structure of the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t61 t81 t73 t77 t95 t43 t81 t39 t40 t53 t29 t77`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice a bunch of terminal symbols like 't61', 't81', etc., which appear in the productions of non-terminals. My approach should be to trace back from the string using the grammar rules.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the string starts with 't61'. Looking at the grammar, 't61' appears on the right-hand side of a production. Specifically, 's6' is a non-terminal that can produce 't61'. So, the first token 't61' must come from 's6'.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, I see that 's' (the start symbol) has several productions. None of them directly start with certain terminals. Instead, each production starts with a combination of non-terminals. Wait, looking more carefully, I realize that in the initial part, the grammar for S is given as multiple options like S \u2192 NT12 NT8, etc. So, S produces two non-terminals, each of which can then produce terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't61', so we need to see where 't61' can be generated. Looking through the grammar, 't61' is in the production of NT17: 'NT17 -> NT8 NT10', and also in NT17's another production: 'NT17 -> NT5 NT2'. But wait, looking more carefully, I see that 't61' appears in NT17's productions. Let me check.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. The grammar has several rules, and I need to track where each terminal is used.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find 'NT17 -> NT8 NT10' leads to 't61', but no, checking the rules, 't61' is in NT17: 'NT17 -> NT8 NT10' results in 't61'? Wait, looking again, I think I'm confusing the rules. Let me list the rules more clearly:\n\n- NT17 can produce 't61' on some of its productions. Let me check each production of NT17.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT17 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- Also, some other rules don't produce 't61'.\n\nWait, no, looking at each production:\n\nLooking for NT17 in the list of rules:\n\n- NT17 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT17 -> NT5 NT2\n- Other NT17 rules are in the context of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in my initial scan, I don't see any production where NT17 directly produces a terminal except perhaps through other non-terminals. Hmm. So maybe 't61' comes from NT17 somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. Each terminal must be generated by a production rule in the grammar. So starting with 't61', let's see what can generate it. Looking through the rules, I see that 't61' is on the RHS of NT17's production.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10 (and this leads to 't61' because NT8 \u2192 something, etc.)\n\nWait, no, looking back, perhaps 't61' is generated by NT17. Wait, no, the rule NT17 -> NT8 NT10 results in 't61', but wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT17's production:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10 (but looking through the list, I don't see 't61' being produced by NT17 directly. Wait, let me check all the NT17 rules.\n\nNo, I think I'm mixing up the rules. Let me go through each rule line by line.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT17 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT17 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT17 -> NT13 NT4\n- NT17 -> NT8 NT20\n- NT17 \u2192 ... (many others)\n\nWait, no, perhaps 't61' is generated by NT17. Or maybe I'm wrong. Let me find where 't61' is.\n\nLooking through the rules: 'NT17 -> NT8 NT10' produces 't61' if NT8 and NT10 produce 't61', but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules.\n\nWait, no, looking more closely, I see in the rules, under 't61', the rule is:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT17 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT17 -> NT5 NT2\n- Also, some other rules, but none show 't61' directly as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps 't61' is in the production of another non-terminal. Let me check all the rules.\n\nAh, I see at the end of the rules: NT17 -> t61. Wait, no, looking through, it's:\n\nAt the very end, looking at these lines:\n\n- NT8 -> t48\n- NT15 -> t65\n- NT5 -> t39\n- NT12 -> t12\n- NT16 -> t70\n- NT3 -> t16\n- NT3 -> t29\n- NT5 -> t66\n- NT15 -> t82\n- NT10 -> t43\n- NT4 -> t17\n- NT9 -> t77\n- NT1 -> t19\n- NT17 -> t61\n- NT13 -> t82\n- NT3 -> t81\n- NT0 -> t40\n- NT20 -> t26\n- NT8 -> t48\n- NT15 -> t65\n\nWait, here it is: NT17 \u2192 t61. So NT17 can directly produce 't61'. That\u2019s a relief!\n\nSo the first token 't61' must come from NT17. So in the string, the first token is 't61', which comes from NT17 \u2192 t61.\n\nNow, the next token is 't81'. So after 't61', the next symbol must be produced by NT17? Wait, no, because in the grammar, each production consumes two non-terminals, so after NT17, we have to look at what comes next.\n\nWait, let's think about the production rules. The grammar for the start symbol S is S \u2192 NT12 NT8, or similar. Each of these non-terminals will expand into other symbols.\n\nSo in the string, starting with 't61', which is from NT17, what's next? The next symbol is 't81'. So we need to see what generates 't81'.\n\nLooking through the rules, 't81' appears as a terminal in NT17's production? Wait, no. Let me look for 't81':\n\nLooking through, I see NT13 \u2192 t82, which might not be relevant. Wait, looking again:\n\nIn the given rules, 't81' appears as the result of certain productions:\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see an immediate production that generates 't81'. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check carefully.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT17 -> t61\n- NT13 -> t82\n- NT3 -> t81? No, looking at the rules, I don't see NT3 \u2192 t81, but maybe another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see 't81' being directly produced by any non-terminal except possibly through other paths. Alternatively, perhaps 't81' comes from a combination of non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example, perhaps there's a production where NT13 \u2192 NT3 NT2, and NT3 \u2192 t81.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by building a parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is [t61, t81, t73, t7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t29 t19 t26 t39 t43 t19 t70 t61 t53 t65 t29 t12 t82\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should help in parsing or at least understanding the structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals are S, NT1 to NT21, and some terminals like 't29', 't19', etc., and also 't95', 't53', etc. The start symbol is S, so the string should derive from S.\n\nThe string seems to consist of a sequence of terminals, so I need to see how these can be produced from S.\n\nLet's break down the string into individual tokens: t29, t19, t26, t39, t43, t19, t70, t61, t53, t65, t29, t12, t82.\n\nNow, looking at the productions, I should try to trace a possible derivation path from S that would produce these tokens in order.\n\nS produces NT12 NT16 or NT21 etc. Wait, looking back, the productions for S are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8 (Wait, no, the user wrote it as S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, but let me check again: the grammar as given has S -> NT12 NT12 NT8? Or is it S -> NT12 NT8? Wait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nGrammar:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo S has three productions, each combining two NTs or an NT and a terminal.\n\nWait, let me recheck: the user's grammar is:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nOther productions are all NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal.\n\nSo S can derive into combinations of two non-terminals followed by a terminal, or three non-terminals, but in the examples, it's S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, which is three non-terminals, but maybe in the grammar, it's two?\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the user wrote S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, which is three parts, so the production would be S \u2192 NT12 NT12 NT8, which is S generating three non-terminals in a sequence? Or perhaps it's a typo and it's supposed to be S -> NT12 NT8, as three seems odd because Chomsky normal form usually has two symbols on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, but some of the productions are like NT9 -> NT11 NT11, which is two NTs. So perhaps the S productions are intended to be two symbols each, but in the user's message, it's written as S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, which is three. Maybe that's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write S -> NT12 NT8, but in the response, the user wrote it with an extra NT12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the S productions are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT8\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWhich would make more sense, as each production would have two symbols on the RHS.\n\nAssuming that, I think the user made a typo, and the correct production is S -> NT12 NT8, which is two symbols. Let me proceed under that assumption, perhaps.\n\nSo, S can produce either NT12 NT8, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12.\n\nEach of these is a pair of NTs, so from S, the first step would be to derive a pair of NTs, which are then expanded further.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it's a sequence of 13 tokens, but each production from NT would produce two tokens each time. So to get 13 tokens, which is odd, that suggests that the last expansion must have produced an odd number, but in Chomsky normal form with terminals only in productions of two symbols, it's impossible to get an odd number of tokens because each expansion of NTs would always result in an even number of tokens.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, there are terminals in productions. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12', which is a terminal. So each NT can produce either a terminal or another pair of NTs.\n\nIf we start with S, each production is two NTs, which can then each expand into terminals or more pairs.\n\nSo for the string length, let's count: the string has 13 tokens. Each NT can produce either one terminal or two NTs. To reach 13 tokens, the number of terminals must be odd, which is possible if the number of reductions leads to an odd count.\n\nWait, but let's think in terms of how many terminals each expansion would generate. Each NT production either introduces two NTs (so a multiplication) or a terminal (so a terminal). So each NT can potentially introduce terminals, but each time it doesn't, it adds complexity.\n\nTo get an odd number of terminals, let's see: Let's say S \u2192 NT12 NT12 NT8, but wait, if S has three symbols, that doesn't fit into two, but perhaps it's S \u2192 NT12 NT12, and then the third NT12 is a production. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string. Let me list the tokens in order: t29, t19, t26, t39, t43, t19, t70, t61, t53, t65, t29, t12, t82.\n\nSince S is the start symbol, I need to see if the entire string can be produced from S using the given productions.\n\nLooking for the earliest symbols in the string that might correspond to NT productions. Let's look for 't29' in the grammar. Looking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT20 -> 't65'\n\nNT5 -> 't39'\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nNT16 -> 't70'\n\nNT7 -> 't61'\n\nNT9 -> 't65'\n\nNT4 -> 't17'\n\nNT21 -> 't61'\n\nNT22 -> ?\n\nWait, looking at the given productions, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't17'\n\nBut in the grammar as given, the lines like:\n\nNT4 -> NT11 NT5\n\nNT5 -> NT17 NT4\n\nSo NT4 can produce either two NTs or a terminal. So if NT4 is expanded, it might produce 't17' or more NTs.\n\nLooking back to the string, the last token is 't82', which might correspond to an NT. Looking through the productions, I don't see 't82' as a terminal, so perhaps it's derived from NT13 or another NT.\n\nLooking for 't82' in the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines, I see NT3 -> 't39' and some others, but not seeing 't82'. Wait, I think I might have to reconstruct the entire chain of productions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to start from the end.\n\nThe last token is 't82'. Looking for NT productions that generate 't82', but in the given grammar, I can't spot any NT that directly produces 't82'. So maybe 't82' is produced by NT13 or another NT.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't39'\n\nOther NTs: NT5, NT7, NT9, etc., have terminals, but looking more carefully:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\nNT3 -> 't39'\n\nMaybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me search the entire grammar for terminal outputs:\n\n- NT3 -> 't39'\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar lines, here are the ones where NTs produce terminals:\n\nNT3 -> 't39'\n\n NT4 -> 't17'\n\n NT5 -> 't65'\n\n NT9 -> 't77'\n\n NT12 -> 't12'\n\n NT16 -> 't70'\n\n NT21 -> 't61'\n\n NT22 -> doesn't exist (but earlier lines show NT21 -> t61, which is 't61')\n\nWait, the user provided many entries, perhaps some missing, but looking for any NT that directly produces a terminal in the string. The string contains t29, t39, t43, t53, t65, t69, t70, t71, etc. \n\nFrom the terminal productions, I see:\n\n- t12, t17, t39, t61, t6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t16 t70 t16 t65 t29 t12 t82 t39 t61 t73 t39 t29 t39`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar better. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), so each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Looking at the grammar rules, I notice several terminals and non-terminals. Some rules have terminal tokens attached, like `S -> NT12 t12`, which I think means S can produce NT12 and something that derives to t12.\n\nWait, looking closer, some rules have terminals on the right side, such as `NT12 -> 't12'`.

{"custom_id":"request-258","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string I need to check if it's generated by the grammar. The string is `t81 t82 t40 t81 t95 t82 t17 t61 t39 t19 t17 t29 t66 t95`. First, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all the symbols in the grammar are either terminals or non-terminals derived from them.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the symbols end with a number, either lowercase or uppercase letters. Some of them like 't12', 't40' are terminals, and others are non-terminals. I should probably make a list of the terminals in the string to see if they match the grammar.\n\nThe terminals in the string are t81, t82, t40, t95, t17, t61, t39, t19, t29, t66. Let's see if all of these are present in the grammar's right-hand sides of the productions. Scanning through the grammar, I see that some of these terminals appear:\n\n- t81 appears in NT13 -> t81\n- t82 appears in NT3 -> t82, and some others\n- t40 appears in NT10 -> t40\n- t95 appears in NT2 -> t95, and others\n- t17 is a terminal in the string. Hmm, in the grammar, NT7 -> t7, which is a different symbol. Wait, let me check: looking for t17, I don't see it as a terminal, but in the productions, it's used as a non-terminal, like T->t17 t4, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the string has t17. So I need to check if t17 is a terminal in the grammar. Looking through the grammar, I see that t17 is used as a terminal in the production NT7 -> t7, but t7 is not a terminal, it's a non-terminal. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me check the productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, all the productions where a terminal is on the right side are the ones where the rule results in that terminal as a possible value. For example, NT73 -> nt...t73, so t73 is a terminal. Similarly, NT5 -> t39, so t39 is a terminal. So looking through the grammar, I think the terminals are all the ones that appear as literals, not as non-terminals.\n\nSo, in the string, the terminals are:\n\nt81, which is in NT13's production.\n\nt82, which appears in NT3's right-hand sides, as t82 is a terminal in some productions like NT3 -> t82.\n\nt40, which is NT10's terminal.\n\nt95, which is in NT2's production.\n\nt17, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any terminal with t17. Wait, do I?\n\nWait, let's check: the grammar has NT77 -> NT1 NT7, which becomes t77. So t77 is a terminal. Similarly, t7 is in NT7 -> t7, which I think is a non-terminal, not a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some productions have terminals:\n\nNT5 -> t39 (so t39 is a terminal)\n\nNT12 -> t12 (so t12 is a terminal)\n\nNT4 -> t65 (t65 is terminal)\n\nSimilarly, NT20 -> t65, NT9 -> t77, NT2 -> t11 (but I'm not sure if t11 is a terminal or non-terminal). Hmm, perhaps t11 is a non-terminal because in the grammar, NT11 is defined in some rules.\n\nWait, maybe the terminals are all the ones that are directly output as literals. So, looking through the rules, the right-hand sides that have a terminal symbol are as follows:\n\n- NT12 -> t12\n\n- NT20 -> t65\n\n- NT9 -> t77\n\n- NT10 -> t43\n\n- NT5 -> t39\n\n- NT16 -> t70\n\n- NT3 -> t16\n\n- NT3 -> t29\n\n- NT5 -> t66\n\n- NT15 -> t82\n\n- NT10 -> t43 (again)\n\n- NT4 -> t17\n\n- NT9 -> t77 (again)\n\n- NT1 -> t19\n\n- NT17 -> t61\n\n- NT13 -> t82\n\n- NT2 -> t21\n\n- NT8 -> t48\n\n- NT15 -> t65 (but that's a non-terminal since it's a symbol on the other side)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should compile a list of all terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12: both NT12 are non-terminals.\n\n2. S -> NT714: Non-terminals.\n\n3. S -> NT912: non-terminals.\n\n4. NT9 -> NT11 NT11: non-terminals.\n\n5. NT21 -> NT19 NT20: non-terminals.\n\n6. NT12 -> NT17 NT8: NT17 is a non-terminal because NT17 is in the left side of some productions, NT8 is also a non-terminal.\n\n7. NT16 -> NT16 NT4: both non-terminals.\n\n8. NT5 -> NT17 NT4: both non-terminals.\n\n9. NT4 -> NT4 NT7: both non-terminals.\n\n10. NT2 -> NT11 NT17: both non-terminals.\n\n11. NT0 -> NT6 NT10: both non-terminals.\n\n12. NT9 -> NT6 NT9: both non-terminals.\n\n13. NT7 -> NT2 NT11: non-terminals.\n\n14. NT13 -> NT11 NT14: non-terminals.\n\n15. NT2 -> NT11 NT0: non-terminals.\n\n16. NT2 -> NT5 NT20: both non-terminals.\n\n17. NT2 -> NT7 NT16: non-terminals.\n\n18. NT21 -> NT17 NT5: both non-terminals.\n\n19. NT21 -> NT17 NT3: so here, NT21 is on the left, and on the right, NT17 and NT3. Are these non-terminals? Checking NT3: in the grammar, NT3 is on the left of some productions, e.g., NT3 -> t82, so NT3 is a non-terminal because it has other symbols. So in this case, NT21 is a non-terminal because on the left.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a non-terminal to a terminal.\n\nSo, terminals are the ones that appear as leaves in the grammar, i.e., the right-hand side of a production where the right side is a single terminal.\n\nSo looking at each rule, which ones end with a terminal?\n\n- NT8 -> t48 (so t48 is a terminal)\n\n- NT19 -> t11 (but t11 is probably non-terminal, because NT11 is used on the left of other rules)\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT19 appears in several rules:\n\nNT19 -> NT1 NT2\n\nNT19 -> NT4 NT20\n\nNT19 -> NT11 NT4\n\nSo the right-hand side of NT19's production includes non-terminals, meaning t19 is not a terminal but part of the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the right-hand sides that have a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT12 -> t12: so t12 is a terminal.\n\n- NT20 -> t65: so t65 is a terminal.\n\n- NT9 -> t77: t77 is a terminal.\n\n- NT10 -> t43: t43 is a terminal.\n\n- NT5 -> t39: t39 is a terminal.\n\n- NT16 -> t70: t70 is a terminal.\n\n- NT3 -> t16: t16 is a terminal.\n\n- NT3 -> t29: t29 is a terminal.\n\n- NT5 -> t66: t66 is a terminal.\n\n- NT15 -> t82: t82 is a terminal.\n\n- NT10 -> t43 (repeated)\n\n- NT4 -> t17: t17 is a terminal.\n\n- NT9 -> t77 (repeated)\n\n- NT1 -> t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which may have one terminal. The grammar starts with S, which splits into several NT (non-terminal) symbols. Each NT eventually leads to a terminal `t` followed by numbers. \n\nLooking at the productions, I notice they all eventually resolve to terminals. So, the language consists of strings made by concatenating these `tXX` terminals in various orders, determined by the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string to parse is a sequence of tXX tokens. Each token is a combination of two digits starting with 't'. \n\nI'll note that each production in the grammar produces two non-terminals until they resolve to terminals. So, to generate the string, we must have a derivation from S that produces exactly the given sequence.\n\nLet me list the tokens in the string:\n\n1. t61\n2. t61\n3. t70\n4. t53\n5. t73\n6. t95\n7. t61\n8. t66\n9. t40\n10. t19\n11. t82\n12. t65\n13. t77\n14. t40\n\nI need to see how these tokens can be produced by the grammar. Starting from S, which can produce NT12 NT8, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12.\n\nLooking at the productions, some of the terminals correspond to specific non-terminals. For example, NT12 appears in some productions: `S -> NT12 NT8` and `S -> NT9 NT12`, and so on. Each NT eventually leads to a terminal, but some may require multiple steps.\n\nLet me start by considering where the terms might come from.\n\nLooking at the first token t61, which corresponds to NT17 -> NT8 NT10. But I also see that NT17 -> NT13 NT4, among others. But t61 comes from NT17, so let's see:\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, some terminals are defined directly, like NT12 -> 't12', which is literal in the grammar. Similarly, NT4 -> 't17', which is t17. Wait, no, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\nNT8 -> 't48'\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT12 is a terminal, so t12 is a terminal. Similarly, NT7 -> 't77', NT15 -> 't82', NT10 -> 't53', NT4 -> 't65', etc.\n\nWait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me make a list of all the terminals in the grammar and their corresponding `tXX`:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\nNT8 -> 't48'\nNT9 -> 't77'\nNT15 -> 't82'\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT16 -> 't70'\nNT3 -> 't16'\nNT3 -> 't29'\nBut wait, actually, in the given grammar, some NT productions directly result in a single terminal, e.g., NT12 -> 't12', which means whenever we have NT12 in a production, it is replaced by 't12'. Similarly for others.\n\nSo, the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' is part of a two-digit number (like 't61') except possibly 't10' which is a two-digit number starting with 1. Wait, but in the string, all tokens are 't61', 't53', etc. So each token is t followed by two digits, each digit from 0 to9 except that the first digit might be '6' or '7' or '5' etc.\n\nBut in the grammar, the terminals are specific. For example, NT12 gives 't12', NT5 gives 't39'? Wait, looking through:\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT7 -> 't77'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT11 -> 't70'\n- NT2 -> 't70' (Wait, no, let me check.)\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up NT rules. Let me make a list of all terminal productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- S starts, eventually splits into NT12 NT8, etc., but each NT eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, each NT eventually leads to a terminal, which is a specific two-digit string:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT5 -> 't39' (Looking at NT5 -> NT6 NT7, then NT4 -> ... but in the end, it's a terminal? Wait, let me see. Oh, wait not all NTs are terminals. Some produce other NTs, but others directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking through each rule, the ones that end with '-' have terminals:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT7 -> 't77'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\nWait, no, looking through, I see NT16 -> 't70'\nNT3 -> 't16'\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal NTs:\n\nFrom the grammar, looking at the ones that end with -> 't...':\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT7 -> 't77'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT9 -> 't95' ?

Let me check all the NTs:\n\nWait, actually, perhaps a better approach is to note which NTs directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT9 -> 't77' (Not exactly, actually, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me look at each rule carefully.)\n\nLet me re-examine the grammar for any production that directly assigns a terminal:\n\nLooking through, I can see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12' (immediately)\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT19 -> 't11 NT4' which seems to go through NT11, but then another production goes to NT5.\n\nHmm, perhaps some of the NTs are directly giving terminals, but others require more steps.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I can instead think about which combinations of terminals are present in the string and see if the grammar can produce such sequences.\n\nThe string has the following 'tXX' tokens:\n\n1. t61\n2. t61\n3. t70\n4. t53\n5. t73\n6. t95\n7. t61\n8. t66\n9. t40\n10. t19\n11. t82\n12. t65\n13. t77\n14. t40\n\nNow, let's look at these:\n\nt61 occurs three times\nt70 once\nt53 once\nt73 once\nt95 once\nt66 once\nt40 occurs twice\nt19 once\nt82 once\nt65 once\nt77 once\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be matched by the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step either combines two non-terminals or replaces one with a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-276","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar provided. It's a set of production rules. Each rule starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left, and the right side consists of non-terminals or terminals. The string I'm given is a sequence of terminal symbols, and I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production rules for S are:\n- S -> NT12 NT14\n- S -> NT9 NT12\n- S -> NT9 NT12 (another version, I think it's the same as above)\n\nWait, actually, looking closely, S has three production rules:\n1. S -> NT12 NT14\n2. S -> NT9 NT12\n3. S -> NT9 NT12 (I think that's maybe a typo, perhaps another line)\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the S productions properly. Oh, no, just three in total?\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar provided:\n- S -> NT12 NT14\n- S -> NT9 NT12\n- S -> NT9 NT12 (I'm seeing that line twice, perhaps a mistake?)\n\nWait, in the beginning, it's written as:\n```\nS -> NT12 NT14\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n```\nWait, no, looking back, the initial lines are:\n- S -> NT12 NT14\n- S -> NT7 NT14\n- S -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, actually, the user might have a typo in their message, but let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLet me list all the production rules properly. Perhaps I should list them all out to avoid confusion.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n- S can produce NT12 followed by NT14, OR NT7 followed by NT14, OR NT9 followed by NT12.\n\nWait, that doesn't quite fit, because in the user's message, the S productions start with three separate rules:\n1. S -> NT12 NT14\n2. S -> NT9 NT12\n3. S -> NT9 NT12 (Is this three lines or two lines? In the user's message, after \"S -> NT7 NT14\" comes \"S -> NT9 NT12\" and then another \"S -> NT9 NT12\". So maybe S has three production rules: S->NT12 NT14, S->NT7 NT14, and S->NT9 NT12. Wait, no, in the user's message, the S lines are:\n- S -> NT12 NT14\n- S -> NT7 NT14\n- S -> NT9 NT12\nWait, no, looking back, actually, the user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar:\nS -> NT12 NT14\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n... (then other rules)...\"\n\nWait, that can't be right because the first three lines are only S productions. So perhaps the user meant that, and the rest are the other non-terminals. So the S productions are:\n1. S -> NT12 NT14\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, that seems off because normally a grammar would have a certain number of production rules, but that seems to be the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again. The user provided:\n\n\"Grammar:\nS -> NT12 NT14\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n... (then the other rules)...\"\n\nSo yes, S has three production rules. Now, I need to see how to derive the given string using these.\n\nThe string given is: `t70 t53 t29 t95 t40 t39 t53 t81 t48 t70 t53 t16 t16 t29 t61`\n\nI notice that most of the string consists of terminal symbols, each like 'tXX', and some non-terminals like NT12, NT9, etc.\n\nBut since the start symbol S is a non-terminal, the string generated by S will consist of terminal symbols. So if the string has any non-terminals, it would have to be eliminated through productions.\n\nWait, looking at the string, some parts are 't' followed by two digits. Let me check the production rules to see which non-terminals correspond to these 't' strings.\n\nFor example, looking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT7 -> 't61'\nWait, does any production rule result in 't70'? Yes, NT16 -> 't70'.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 is 't61'.\n\nNow, the string is: `t70 t53 t29 t95 t40 t39 t53 t81 t48 t70 t53 t16 t16 t29 t61`\n\nLooking at each part:\n- t70 is derived from NT16.\n- t53: Wait, do any non-terminals produce 't53'? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the production rules for each NT symbol:\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT21 -> various, but none producing 't53'.\n- NT9 -> 't77', 't65' etc.\n- NT7 -> 't61'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't29', 't81', etc.\nWait, looking for 't53', it's not present in any of the production rules as a terminal.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If 't53' is part of the string, but no NT symbol directly produces 't53', then it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar, because it would require a non-terminal that produces 't53', which doesn't exist.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me make sure. Are there any production rules where a non-terminal expands into 't53'? Looking through the given rules:\n\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT20 -> 't26', 't15', etc.\n- NT21 -> 't17', 't53' (Wait! There's a production where NT21 -> 't53'). Yes, looking at the production rules:\n\nHere's a production rule:\n- NT21 -> 't53' (e.g., in the line `NT21 -> NT17 NT5` and another line `NT21 -> NT53`? Wait, no. Let me check the given productions again.\n\nLooking through the list, under NT21, the productions are:\n- NT21 -> NT17 NT5\n- NT21 -> NT17 NT3\n- NT21 -> NT8 NT13\nWait, no 't53' from NT21.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a line where a non-terminal directly produces 't53'. Let me scan through all NT rules for terminal strings:\n\nLooking through the list of production rules, some lines end with a terminal 'tXX':\n\n- NT20 -> 't10 NT3' (Wait, no, that's a production to another NT, not a terminal). \nLooking deeper:\n\n NT3 has several productions:\n- NT3 -> 't29' (e.g., NT3 -> 't29' and some others)\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT8 -> 't48', 't15', etc.\nWait, maybe I'm mistaking NT5 with t39, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the production rules have 't' followed by numbers in several places:\n\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT20 -> 't26', 't15'\n\nWait, but I don't see 't53' being produced by any of these. So in the given string, we have t53 which is a terminal, but none of the non-terminals have 't53' as a production.\n\nThat's a red flag. So, unless I'm missing a production rule that I haven't considered, 't53' cannot appear in any derived"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-282","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. That should make parsing the string step by step a bit manageable.\n\nFirst, let me list out the production rules to see how the non-terminals expand. The start symbol is S, and the string to check is `t70 t70 t17 t53 t43 t17 t17 t81 t65 t95 t82 t43 t73 t26 t53`.\n\nI notice that the string consists entirely of terminal symbols, so I have to see if each of these can be derived from the grammar starting from S. Each non-terminal in the grammar can expand to either another non-terminal pair or a terminal. Since the string is long, but each step in the grammar produces two symbols, the parsing tree should have a depth of about 16 (since 2^16 is 65536, which is more than 16 steps). Wait, no, the string has 16 symbols, so the grammar should derive each symbol in the string step by step, which aligns with the fact that each production rule is two non-terminals.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe a better approach is to recursively check each part of the string, ensuring that each production can derive the corresponding terminals.\n\nLet me break down the string into pairs of terminals and see if each pair can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\nt70, t70, t17, t53, t43, t17, t17, t81, t65, t95, t82, t43, t73, t26, t53.\n\nLet me group them into pairs where possible:\n\nFirst, since each production in CNF produces two symbols, but wait, the string is 16 symbols, which is even, so each production step should produce exactly two terminals. But that depends on how the grammar is structured. Alternatively, each production rule in the grammar can produce a single terminal or a pair. So, perhaps I need to parse the string from left to right, starting with S, and see if each production can generate the necessary terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of each production as possibly contributing to a part of the string. Alternatively, perhaps I can work backward, starting from the string and trying to split it into production rules.\n\nBut given that the string is a single sequence of terminals, I think the correct approach is to see if starting from S, the grammar can derive this string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform a recursive descent parsing, but that might be complicated given the size.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can perform a CYK algorithm. However, CYK requires building a table, which might be time-consuming for 16 symbols, but let me try.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to realize that since the grammar is in CNF, each production produces exactly two symbols, so each step in the derivation must combine two symbols. Since the string has 16 symbols, that's log2(16) = 4 levels. Wait, no. Wait, each production in CNF can expand two symbols into four, etc. So starting with S, which can produce two non-terminals, each step combines into more parts until we reach the full string.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The string has 16 terminals, so in the derivation, starting from S, each production adds two symbols, so the number of steps would be logarithmic. Wait, maybe not. Or perhaps it's better to look for the presence of certain terminals in the grammar, and see if each can be derived from a production.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. The productions from S are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo each S production gives two non-terminals. When S expands, say S becomes NT12 NT12, then each NT12 can expand further.\n\nLooking at the string: the first two tokens are t70 and t70.\n\nSo, perhaps the first NT in S's expansion is NT12, which then needs to expand into t70 and the next t70.\n\nBut wait, each NT in the grammar can expand into either two non-terminals or a terminal. So if we have NT12 in the expansion, perhaps it can expand into terminals t12, t20, etc. Let me check the NT rules for NT12.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT12 -> NT17 NT8 and also NT12 -> NT19 NT8. That's interesting. So NT12 can expand into two NTs: either NT17 and NT8, or NT19 and NT8.\n\nWait, but if NT12 is supposed to produce a terminal, it needs to do so directly, but in this case, it only expands into non-terminals unless one of those non-terminals can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, some non-terminals have rules that include terminals, like NT4 -> 't65' (NT4 is terminal). So some non-terminals can produce a single terminal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can work through the string, trying to see if it can be split into production rules.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string sequentially.\n\nThe string is: t70 t70 t17 t53 t43 t17 t17 t81 t65 t95 t82 t43 t73 t26 t53.\n\nLet's index each position as 1 to 16.\n\nStart with S -> NT12 NT12 (for now choosing one production; may have to backtrack if this doesn't work).\n\nEach NT12 needs to produce a terminal pair. Let's look at NT12's rules: NT12 -> NT17 NT8 or NT19 NT8.\n\nWait, let's check NT12:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, yes, NT12 has two productions: NT12 -> NT17 NT8 and NT12 -> NT19 NT8.\n\nSo each NT12 can split into either NT17, NT8 or NT19, NT8.\n\nNow, NT8 is given as t48. So if NT12 expands into NT17 and NT8, the first token would be from NT17 and the second from NT8, which is t48.\n\nBut the first token of the string is t70, so that would require that NT17 and NT8 somehow expand to t70 and t48. Hmm, but t70 is a terminal, so how can NT17 and NT8 produce t70 and t48?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each production in CNF for NT12 would be NT12 -> X Y, where X and Y are non-terminals, then X and Y would themselves have to generate the required parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the parsing as starting with S and expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to look for each terminal in the string and see if it can be derived from any NT.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: t70 and t70. So each of these must be produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NTs are producing t70? Let me see:\n\nThe terminal 't70' is produced by NT16.\n\nLooking at NT16's production: NT16 -> NT16 NT4 and also NT16 -> 't70' -> t70.\n\nAh, so NT16 can produce 't70' directly.\n\nSo if I have NT16, that can produce t70.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at the second 't70' in the string, same thing.\n\nSo perhaps the first production is S -> NT12 NT12, but NT12 can then expand into something that gives t70 and t70.\n\nWait, but NT12's rules are NT12 -> NT17 NT8 and NT12 -> NT19 NT8. Both of these would produce two other NTs, each of which would then have to produce terminals.\n\nSo for the first t70, maybe that comes from a NT that directly produces t70, like NT16.\n\nWait, so maybe the first t70 in the string is from NT16, which can directly produce t70.\n\nSimilarly, the string's first two t70s could be generated by two NT16's.\n\nSo perhaps S -> NT12 NT12, but NT12 is being used to expand into other things.

{"custom_id":"request-294","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string given is \"t29 t65 t82 t48 t48 t65 t70 t39 t19 t40 t48 t19 t26 t82 t43 t65\". \n\nFirst, let me recall what a context-free grammar is. A CFG is a set of production rules that generate all possible strings in a particular formal language. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or a terminal directly is a production, which is often written as A \u2192 a. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, where x, y, z are numbers. Some are directly generating terminals, like NT12 \u2192 't12', which is the terminal symbol 't' followed by a number. \n\nSo, the first step is to parse the given string, \"t29 t65 t82 t48 t48 t65 t70 t39 t19 t40 t48 t19 t26 t82 t43 t65\", and see if each 't' can be matched to a production rule's right-hand side.\n\nEach 't' is followed by a number, so I need to check if for each 'tN', there is a production that can generate it. But wait, in the grammar, many of the non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't3', NT5 \u2192 't39', etc. Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't3' (multiple entries)\n- NT5 \u2192 't66', 't66' again\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12', etc.\n\nWait, no, the grammar has NT3 \u2192 't3', for instance. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't39'. So, each 'tN' is a terminal whose production is specified in the grammar.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of these terminals. Each step in the derivation must expand each symbol to its right-hand side. For example, the first 't29' must be generated by a production rule that starts with NT29. But wait, looking through the grammar, do we have NT29? Hmm, upon checking, it seems that all the non-terminals go up to NT21, and others. So, perhaps the given string doesn't actually contain any non-terminals. That is, it's all terminals. So each token is a terminal generated by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, that's confusing because in the string provided, all elements are like 't29', which I thought was a terminal, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT29. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3', 't16', 't29', 't39', 't48', 't65', 't70', 't73', 't77', 't81', 't82', 't66' etc.\n\nAh, so some of the NTs produce multiple terminals. For example, NT12 can produce 't12', which is one of its productions. Also, NT4 can produce 't65' among others.\n\nSo, the string given is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be the result of a production rule starting with some non-terminal that produces that terminal.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each token in the string, check if there's a production rule where the non-terminal (the left-hand side) can produce that token as one of its right-hand sides.\n\nBut in this case, each token in the string is a terminal. So each must be the result of a production where the non-terminal expands to that terminal. For example, for 't29', is there a rule where NTx \u2192 't29'? Looking at the grammar, yes, NT3 appears to produce 't3', 't16', 't29', etc. So 't29' is indeed a terminal that can be produced by NT3.\n\nSimilarly, 't65' is produced by NT4, among others.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be the result of some production from the grammar.\n\nNow, the question is, can this entire string be generated by the CFG? Given that the CFG is in CNF, which assumes that all productions are of the form A\u2192BC, except in this case, some seem to have single terminals.\n\nWait, in the standard CNF, productions are of the form A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (a terminal). So each production either generates a terminal or two non-terminals. So, the top-down approach is to start with the start symbol and expand into other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nIn this case, the start symbol seems to be S, which has multiple productions, like S\u2192NT12 NT13, etc.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT12 NT13. But in the given grammar, I don't see all the rules starting with NT12. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nS has multiple rules, each leading to a pair of NTs. For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT13, which is an option for the start symbol S.\n\nEach of these options leads to two NTs, which can then be further expanded.\n\nBut in the given string, all symbols are terminals. So, perhaps each of these NTs in the string's decomposition can be split into their constituent parts, but it's crucial to see how each of the string is built from the grammar.\n\nHowever, the string is a flat list of terminals, which suggests that it's a direct derivation from the start symbol without any nested structure, except for the fact that some of the NTs might have to break down further into terminals.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, every production (except the ones producing terminals) produces exactly two non-terminals. So, the derived string must follow a binary tree structure.\n\nGiven that all the terminals in the string are produced by NTs, perhaps the string can only be formed if all the terminal 'tokens' can be aligned with the production rules.\n\nBut in the given string, each token is a terminal. So, for example, 't29' is produced by NT3. But then, since the grammar is in CNF, the tree would require that 't29' be the result of NT3 expanding into something, but if it's a direct terminal, how does it fit into the tree?\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string must be a valid derivation from S without any non-terminals left, meaning that each production must have completely resolved into terminals. Therefore, the number of symbols in the string should correspond to a certain structure determined by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is being considered as a single step, but that seems unlikely because in Chomsky Normal Form, each step only replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. The entire process is a sequence of these replacements until all non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nBut considering that, the string \"t29 t65 t82...\" would have to be the result of a series of replacements that ultimately end up with this list of terminals. However, in CNF, each production is only of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the number of symbols would have to follow certain patterns.\n\nWait, let's think about how the string could be constructed. Each rule production from a non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals, which can either produce terminals or non-terminals. So the string would be a sequence of terminals resulting from a full expansion of the grammar.\n\nHowever, in the grammar provided, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, such as NT3\u2192t3, etc. So, perhaps the approach is to simulate a possible parse of the string using the grammar.\n\nEach step would involve replacing the first non-terminal with its right-hand side. So, starting with S, we can do:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT13 (as an example)\nBut then each NT12 and NT13 need to be expanded.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated, so maybe another approach is to count the number of symbols. In context-free grammars, particularly in Chomsky Normal Form, the leftmost derivation of a string of length n will have exactly n-1 splits.\n\nGiven that the given string has 16 tokens (since there's a space between each, making the count 16), the derivation would have 15 splits. Each split replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, so each split increases the count by 1.\n\nBut in our case, the initial S is a single non-terminal. After the first split, it's two non-terminals. Then each split adds one more symbol, so after n splits, the number of symbols is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, looking at the grammar, I see it's in CNF, which means each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. Each rule produces exactly two symbols, except maybe the start symbol, but in this case, it's S that's splitting into two non-terminals.\n\nThe string is a series of tokens, and I notice they're all two-character abbreviations like 't53', 't43', etc. It seems like each of these tokens might correspond to a single non-terminal in the grammar. So, the strategy might be to parse the string from left to right, using the grammar to see if each token can be generated step by step.\n\nI should start by identifying all the non-terminals present in the grammar and map them to the tokens in the string. Let me list out the non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, the non-terminals include S, S again, so not much help there. Going through the rules, I see NT9, NT21, NT12, NT16, NT5, NT4, NT2, NT0, NT9, NT7, NT13, NT3, NT1, NT6, NT17, NT19, NT15, NT8, etc. It's a bit of a long list, but I'll need to map each token to one of these.\n\nNext, I need to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of production applications. Let's write down the string as a sequence of symbols:\n\nt53, t43, t70, t48, t17, t66, t95, t73, t12, t73, t77, t26, t70, t17, t48, t77.\n\nHmm, I notice that each of these tokens may correspond to a non-terminal that directly produces a terminal. For example, in the grammar, some rules directly expand to two terminals. For instance, S -> NT12 NT8, and from the string, 't70' and 't48' are present. Looking at the grammar, NT70? Wait, no, the grammar has specific terminals: NT12 -> 't12', NT8 -> 't48', etc.\n\nWait, actually, I need to figure out which non-terminals expand to which terminals. For example, looking at the rules:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\nNT8 -> 't48'\nNT5 -> 't66'\nNT15 -> 't82'\nNT20 -> 't65'\nNT4 -> 't17'\nNT9 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't19'\nNT17 -> 't61'\nNT13 -> 't82'\nNT0 -> 't40'\nNT20 -> 't26'\nNT8 is 't48', etc.\n\nWait, but I have to check all the rules. Let me go through the list:\n\n- S is the start symbol and splits into various non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if each token can be matched directly by a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt53, t43, t70, t48, t17, t66, t95, t73, t12, t73, t77, t26, t70, t17, t48, t77.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of these 16 tokens.\n\nNow, each of these must be produced by some non-terminal, possibly in a chain of productions.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single non-terminal or two. So, when expanding a symbol, it's either a terminal or another pair of non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is to a single symbol or two symbols. So, the way to parse could be to expand non-terminals into their right-hand sides (RHS) step by step.\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be parsed by recursively applying productions from the bottom up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to write a parse tree for the string.\n\nBut since I have to do this manually, I need a strategy.\n\nLet me list the tokens and see which non-terminals they might correspond to:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- t53: is this from any NT?\nLooking through the rules, do any NTs expand to t53? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t53. So, perhaps t53 must be produced by a NT that is defined in terms of other NTs that eventually lead to t53.\n\nBut wait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT2 -> 't11 NT17' etc., but I might be missing something.\n\nWait, no. In the grammar, all the non-terminals are defined in terms of other NTs, except for the terminals like 't53', 't43', etc.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Are all the non-terminals in the grammar? Or are the terminals just certain strings?\n\nWait, in CNF, all productions are to terminals or non-terminals. So, in this grammar, each production either produces a single non-terminal or two symbols. But some of these symbols are terminals. So, for example, NT12 -> 't12' might be a production where NT12 is a non-terminal that expands to the terminal string 't12'.\n\nWait, looking back at the given grammar, the rules like:\n\nS -> NT12 NT8\nBut also:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\nSo yes, NT12 is a non-terminal that expands to the terminal 't12'.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 -> 't48' so NT8 directly produces 't48'.\n\nSo, in the string, the token 't48' could come from NT8, which is a non-terminal that expands to 't48'.\n\nSimilarly, 't12' comes from NT12.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each token is either a terminal (like 't53') or produced by a non-terminal. So, to check if the string is in the language, we need to see if there's a derivation starting from S that produces this string.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can approach this by building a parse tree or a derivation step by step.\n\nStarting with S, and trying to apply productions until we reach the string.\n\nBut 16 non-terminals might make this tedious, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can see if each token in the string is covered by the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, another approach is to reverse the process: starting from the string and trying to reduce it to S by applying inverse productions.\n\nEach step would involve matching a pair of symbols from the current string and seeing if that pair is the RHS of any production.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, starting with the string: t53 t43 t70 t48 t17 t66 t95 t73 t12 t73 t77 t26 t70 t17 t48 t77.\n\nBut wait, the entire string is a single string with all the tokens separated. So, let's list them as a list:\n\n['t53', 't43', 't70', 't48', 't17', 't66', 't95', 't73', 't12', 't73', 't77', 't26', 't70', 't17', 't48', 't77']\n\nEach production is a sequence of two symbols (each could be a non-terminal or a terminal). So, the first step in the reduction would be to look for the leftmost two symbols and see if they are the RHS of any production.\n\nBut in this approach, since the string is linear, and each production is leftmost, we can proceed as follows:\n\nWe need to find consecutive symbols that are the RHS of some production. If we can reduce them step by step to derive the entire string down to S, then it's acceptable.\n\nLet me attempt this.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nFirst two symbols: 't53' and 't43'.\n\nIs there a production that takes 't53' and 't43' as its RHS?\n\nLooking through the grammar, are there any production rules whose RHS is 't53 t43'?

{"custom_id":"request-322","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is: `t53 t95 t12 t26 t19 t48 t19 t26 t81 t66 t29 t82 t61 t40 t73 t19 t53`.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the productions seem to follow this, like S \u2192 NT12 NT8, which is two non-terminals. But there are some productions where a non-terminal expands into a single terminal, like NT12 \u2192 't12'. These are the leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nThe string consists of several terms: t53, t95, t12, etc. The first step is to check if each terminal in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar. Let's list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt53, t95, t12, t26, t19, t48, t19, t26, t81, t66, t29, t82, t61, t40, t73, t19, t53.\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these terminals has a production rule where they are the only terminal on the RHS. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals do expand into terminals:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53' (Wait, no: NT10 \u2192 't43' according to the grammar? Let me check: Looking through the grammar, I see NT10 \u2192 't43'. Hmm, but the string has t53. So that might be an issue. Wait, let me check all NT productions for terminals. \n\nLooking through the grammar, NT entries:\n\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT9\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT11\n- NT21 -> NT17 NT5 or NT17 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT20 or NT15 NT19\n- NT19 -> NT1 NT2 etc.\n- NT3 -> various combinations, including t16, t29, t82.\n- NT5 -> t39 or t66.\n- NT12 -> t12\n- NT10 -> t43\n- NT4 -> t17\n- NT9 -> t77\nWait, but in the string, I see t53, which isn't mentioned in the productions. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only terminals I see are t12, t19, t48, t26, etc. Let me list all terminals from the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT12 \u2192 't12'\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\nNT4 \u2192 't17'\nNT9 \u2192 't77'\nNT5 \u2192 't66'\nNT8 \u2192 't48'\nNT15 \u2192 't82'\nNT19 \u2192 doesn't expand to a terminal, it goes to NT1 NT2\nSimilarly, NT3 has several production rules. Looking for NT3:\n\nWait, I see NT3 -> 't29' and 't16' and 't82' as RHS terminals? Wait, in the grammar:\n\nNT16\u2192 't70', NT3\u2192 't16' (but as NT3 is a non-terminal, perhaps it has a production that expands to 't16'? But looking through, I don't see any NT3 \u2192 t16. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't16' and 't29' and others. Wait, no, I think NT3 has productions like NT3 -> NT5 NT14 and others, but looking for direct terminal productions, I don't see any. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look for any NT \u2192 terminal.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12' (so yes, matches t12)\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\nNT4 \u2192 't17'\nNT9 \u2192 't77'\nNT5 \u2192 't66'\nNT8 \u2192 't48'\nNT15 \u2192 't82'\nNT3 has a production -> 't16' (if I'm reading correctly). Let me check: Oh, wait, looking at the grammar, there's a line: NT3 -> 't16' and another line: NT3 -> 't29'. So yes, NT3 can produce 't16' and 't29'. Similarly, NT5 can produce 't39' and 't66'.\n\nSo, the terminals in the grammar include t12, t16, t17, t19, t26, t29, t43, t48, t53, t66, t68 (wait, no, looking again, I think I might have confused some numbers), t77, t82. Wait, t53 isn't directly a terminal in any production. The terminal expansions are as follows:\n\nLooking for each NT and their terminal productions:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12' (so output 't12')\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n- NT4 \u2192 't17'\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n- NT5 \u2192 't66' and 't39' (NT5 has two terminals: t39 and t66)\n- NT3 \u2192 't16' and 't29'\n- NT8 \u2192 't48' and 't15 NT19' (so t48 is directly terminal)\n- NT19 \u2192 doesn't expand to a terminal; it goes to NT1 NT2 which might have terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking for t53 in the string. I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't53' in the grammar. The only NT that goes to a terminal is like t43, t12, etc., but I don't see 't53' as a terminal in any NT production. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar has NT10 \u2192 't43', NT4 \u2192 't17', NT5 \u2192 't66', NT9 \u2192 't77', NT12 \u2192 't12', NT3 \u2192 't16' and 't29', NT8 \u2192 't48'. So 't53' is not present as a direct terminal in any of these. That suggests that the string has a terminal 't53', which isn't in the grammar's terminals. So maybe this string cannot be generated, right? Because one of its terminals isn't present in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I need to check if any non-terminals can expand through a series of productions to produce 't53'. But since the grammar is in CNF, each expansion is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get a terminal, there must be a production that directly expands to it.\n\nSince I don't see NT53 or any NT that expands to 't53', the presence of 't53' in the string suggests it's not in the language. But wait, looking back, the string is: `t53 t95 t12 t26 t19 t48 t19 t26 t81 t66 t29 t82 t61 t40 t73 t19 t53`. So two 't53's appear.\n\nIs there any NT that can produce 't53'? It doesn't seem so. All terminal productions end with specific letters like t12, t16, t17, t29, t39, t43, t48, t66, etc., but 't53' is not there. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it contains 't53' which is not a terminal in any production.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a production. Let me go through all the productions again to ensure I didn't miss any NT that expands to 't53'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for any line where a non-terminal is followed by \u2192 and then either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, there's NT10 \u2192 't43', NT4 \u2192 't17', etc. But I don't see any with 't53'. So unless NT53 is a typo, the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to derive 't53' through the grammar, but since it's not directly produced"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-316","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, context-free grammars have productions that produce strings from a single non-terminal symbol. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can also produce a terminal. Wait, no, actually in Chomsky normal form, the start symbol can also produce a single terminal, but I think all non-terminals except the start must produce two non-terminals. Or maybe the start can also produce a terminal. I think in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol S has productions that go to multiple NTs, but the NTs go to more, so maybe all the NTs are non-terminals and their productions only have two non-terminals on the right side. Wait, the productions listed start with S going to NT12 NT12, then NT12 again appears, etc. So yes, it's in Chomsky normal form because each production has non-terminals on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t17 t19 t82 t73 t17 t17 t43 t61 t53 t17 t95 t61 t61 t12 t82 t66 t39.\n\nI think I should start by breaking down the string into symbols and see if I can parse it according to the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use parsing techniques like recursive descent or top-down parsing. Alternatively, I can try to look for the sequence step by step.\n\nLet me first list all the symbols in the string in order:\n\nt17, t19, t82, t73, t17, t17, t43, t61, t53, t17, t95, t61, t61, t12, t82, t66, t39.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's helpful to represent this as a list, so I can iterate through it while keeping track of the current position.\n\nI need to find a way to derive the entire string starting from S. The start symbol S has several productions, but looking at the grammar, the initial productions of S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nI don't know if these are the only S productions.

Wait, in the provided grammar, it's written as:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo S can only go into these combinations. So the starting point is S, which will split into one of these three options.\n\nLet me note that the string starts with t17, which I believe is a terminal symbol. So the first step is to find which production of S can produce a string starting with t17.\n\nLooking at the NTs and their productions, maybe I can find NTs that can derive t17.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I see NT2361 is not listed, so perhaps I should check each NT.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree from the string.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should parse the grammar to understand how the non-terminals produce the terminals. Let's look through the rules:\n\nStarting with S:\n- S can produce NT12 NT12 or other combinations, but looking deeper:\n  - NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n  - NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10 or NT17 NT4.\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20, NT20 could be terminal t82, t65, t20, etc.\n  \nWait, I need to see if the terminals in the string are produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at each component in the string:\n\n- t29: Looking through the rules, I see NT3 \u2192 t29 or t82.\n  - NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14 or NT5 NT0 or NT0 NT13.\n  - NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT4 or NT9 NT5 or NT5 NT4.\n  - NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9 or NT6 NT16.\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT21 or NT2 NT10 or NT11 NT5.\n  - NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7, NT11 NT4, NT7 NT2, NT5 NT20, etc. Wait, NT4 seems a bit complex.\n  \nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should see if each terminal in the string can be derived from a rule in the grammar. Let me go through each token one by one.\n\n1. t29: Found in NT3's production as NT3 \u2192 t29 or t82. So possible.\n2. t26: Looking for production that produces t26. In the rules, I see NT10\u2192't43', NT4\u2192't17', NT8\u2192't48', NT15\u2192't65', etc. I don't see t26 directly. Wait, in the provided rules, NT10\u2192't43', but what about NT26? Or maybe another route. Wait, the rules don't seem to have t26. Or did I miss it? Let me check: Looking through all the rules, I don't see a rule that directly produces t26. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with t29 t26, and if NT26 isn't in the grammar, the string can't be generated. Wait, but the rules might have some non-terminals leading to t26 through other steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production. Let me check again. Under NT20, it says NT20 \u2192 't10' something? Wait, no, the provided rules show NT10\u2192't43', NT4\u2192't17', NT8\u2192't48', etc. But there's no rule for producing t26 directly. So unless a non-terminal leads to it through other steps, like NT6 \u2192 some rules involving NT2 or others that produce t26.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5 or NT17 NT3\n- NT17\u2192 NT8 NT10 or NT17 NT4\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n\nHmm, so NT8 can go to t48 and then maybe to t26? Not directly.\n\nWait, maybe NT12 can produce t29 as per NT12\u2192't12', no, that's t12, not t29.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to map each terminal in the string to possible productions.\n\nThe first token is t29. Looking at the rules, NT13 \u2192 't82', NT3\u2192't29' or 't82', and NT5\u2192't66'. So if the string starts with t29, that must come from NT3.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT12 NT12 (or other combinations). Let's see what NT12 can do. NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT12 NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8 NT17 NT8.\n\nNow, the first symbol is t29, which comes from NT3, but where does NT3 come from? Let me see:\n\nLooking for a production where NT3 is on the left. I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14 or NT5 NT0 or NT0 NT13.\n\nBut we have NT12 on both sides after S. So maybe I need to break this down further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if each terminal can be derived. Let me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt29, t26, t70, t77, t29, t70, t82, t16, t40, t29, t53, t29, t26, t43, t53, t81, t48, t17.\n\nThat's 18 tokens. I'll go one by one.\n\n1. t29: From NT3 \u2192 t29 or t82. So possible.\n\n2. t26: Not directly in any rule, unless via NT6\u2192 t26? Wait, looking through, I don't see NT6\u2192t26. Let me check all NT6 rules:\n\nLooking for NT6: in the provided rules, I see NT6\u2192NT2 NT10, NT2\u2192NT11 NT17, etc. No, no t26. Hmm, maybe NT20, but that's not t26.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me check the initial rules provided again:\n\nLooking for any rule where NT6 \u2192 t26.\n\nGoing through all the provided rules, I don't find any NT6 \u2192 t26. Similarly, NT10 doesn't have t26. So the second token t26 can't be generated, which would mean the string can't be part of the language. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there's a way to get t26 through some derivation.\n\nWait, another angle: the string has t26. Since t26 isn't a terminal in the grammar, perhaps the string is invalid. But wait, the grammar might have a rule I missed. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar rules:\n\nI see NT20 \u2192 't26' in the rule: NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3, but wait, no, that's a production, NT20 is a non-terminal, and in another rule, NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3 is not, but actually, looking at the rules, I see some lines where NT20 is used as a non-terminal on the left side, but on the right side, sometimes it's a terminal. For example, in NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3 is shown under the provided rules, but looking through, no, actually, in the given rules, I don't see any NT20 producing a terminal like t26.\n\nWait, looking at the list of productions, here's a line: NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3 which is a production, but does any terminal appear in the productions? I see that some non-terminals produce terminals directly, like:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12' (NT12 is a non-terminal, 't12' is a terminal).\nSimilarly, NT16 \u2192 't70' (a direct production to terminal t70).\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'\n- NT3 \u2192 't29' or 't82'\n- NT5 \u2192 't65'\n- NT17 \u2192 't61', 't40'\n- NT13 \u2192 't82'\n- NT8 \u2192 't48'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65', 't82'\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n- NT4 \u2192 't17'\n- NT9 \u2192 't77', 't7\n- etc.\n\nAh, so each of these non-terminals can directly produce specific terminals. So for example:\n\n- NT12 can produce 't12'\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'\n- NT3 \u2192 't29'\n- NT5 \u2192 't65'\n- NT17 \u2192 't61' or 't40'\n- NT8 \u2192 't48'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65' or 't82'\n- NT10 \u2192 't43"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-342","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are quite long, so I should take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar is in CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or one terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT12 is okay because all are non-terminals except the terminal when applicable.\n\nThe string provided is `t12 t73 t12 t40 t26 t61 t19 t66 t81 t40 t81 t12 t61 t65 t53 t53 t77 t70`. So it's a sequence of terminals. I need to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nThe first thing I need to do is look at the production rules to see how the terminals can be formed. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse will occur from the top, and each non-terminal will split into two more non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nI'll start by looking at the possible production rules for S. According to the grammar, S can be NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is t12. So let's see which production rules can produce t12. Checking the grammar:\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, NT12 has productions like NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, and NT17 \u2192 NT7 NT2, etc. But I should check the strings that directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that NT12 \u2192 't12' is present. So if S \u2192 NT12 NT12, then the first symbol t12 could come directly from NT12. Similarly, I need to see other possible t12 sources.\n\nSo, for S to generate the first t12, S could derive to NT12 NT12, and then NT12 can produce 't12'.\n\nSimilarly, I need to look at the rest of the string to see if it can follow from the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nWait, but the string is t12 followed by t73. So the second symbol is t73. So if I have S \u2192 NT12 NT12, the first part is t12, but the second part of S's expansion is also NT12, which can produce either t12 again or another sequence.\n\nHmm, let me think. Alternatively, maybe S can be other rules like NT7 \u2192 't73'? Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see a production for NT7 \u2192 t73. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT10 \u2192 't53' and NT10 \u2192 't73'. So NT10 can produce t53 or t73. So maybe one of the NTs in the productions leads to t73.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the S \u2192 NT7 NT14 production is relevant because if one side is NT7 and the other is NT14, and NT7 might not produce t73, but NT14 can.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t12, so S must derive to t12 followed by something. Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me consider the entire string as a sequence of t's and see if it can be reduced using the productions. But parsing is quite involved. Another approach is to see if all the t's in the string can be matched by the terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking at each position in the string:\n\n1: t12 \u2192 possible via NT12 \u2192 t12\n\n2: t73 \u2192 Let's see where t73 comes from. Looking for 't73' in the grammar. From the given rules, I see NT10 can produce 't53' and 't73'. So t73 would have to come from NT10.\n\n3: t12 \u2192 same as position 1.\n\n4: t40 \u2192 Looking for 't40' in productions. Checking the rules, NT0 \u2192 t40 is present. So t40 comes from NT0.\n\n5: t26 \u2192 Looking for 't26' in grammar. Checking, NT8 \u2192 t26 is present. So t26 comes from NT8.\n\n6: t61 \u2192 NT6 \u2192 t61?\n\nWait, looking through the rules, yes: NT6 appears to have a production NT6 \u2192 t61.\n\n7: t19 \u2192 NT1 \u2192 t19.\n\n8: t66 \u2192 Looking for 't66', which is produced by NT4 \u2192 t66.\n\n9: t81 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 t81.\n\n10: t40 \u2192 same as above, so back to NT0.\n\n11: t81 \u2192 same as position 9.\n\n12: t12 \u2192 same as position 1.\n\n13: t61 \u2192 same as position 6.\n\n14: t65 \u2192 Wait, looking for 't65'. In the rules, I see NT13 \u2192 't13' is part of a production, but perhaps NT14 \u2192 't65' is not present. Wait, checking the rules, NT14 is sometimes followed by NT4, but the only terminal for NT14 is 't40' and 't14' in other rules. Wait, looking at the rules for NT14, it says NT14 \u2192 't14' and 't65'? I'm not sure. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the rules include NT4 \u2192 't65' because NT4's production is NT4 \u2192 't65'. Wait, looking at the rules, under NT4: \"NT4 -> 't65'\". So NT4 can produce 't65' or 't11' followed by 't5' and so on.\n\nSo position 14 is t65. Therefore, that could come from NT4 \u2192 't65'.\n\n15: t53 \u2192 comes from NT5 \u2192 t53.\n\n16: t77 \u2192 Hmm, looking for 't77'. Checking the rules, NT9 \u2192 't77' is possible because under NT9, one of the rules is \"NT9 -> 't77'\". Wait, actually, checking the rules: \"NT9 -> 't77'\". So t77 comes from NT9.\n\n17: t70 \u2192 From NT3 \u2192 't70'.\n\nAlright, so each symbol can be matched by some non-terminal that has a production yielding that terminal. But that doesn't necessarily mean the entire string is derivable from S, because the way the non-terminals expand must form a valid parse tree.\n\nNow, I need to check if the entire string is generated by a valid sequence of productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible to see that the first token is t12, so that would come from NT12. Then, the rest of the tree would have to be such that the other NT12 continues to expand into the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but S can be NT12 NT12, so let's see: first symbol t12 is from NT12. So the right-hand side of S would be NT12 followed by NT12. So the first t12 is from the left NT12, and the right NT12 starts expanding from position 2 onwards.\n\nBut the second symbol is t73. So the right NT12 needs to produce t73 as the next symbol. Let's see what NT12 can produce beyond the terminal. Looking at the rule for NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So after t12, we get NT17 followed by NT8.\n\nNow, the second symbol is t73, which would have to come from somewhere. Wait, the second symbol is t73, which would be after the original t12. But according to S \u2192 NT12 NT12, the expansion would be t12 followed by whatever the right NT12 produces. But the second symbol is t73, which is a terminal, so the right NT12 must derive t73 immediately.\n\nIs there a production for NT12 that directly yields t73? From the rules, looking at NT12, it's NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So it doesn't directly produce t73. Therefore, the second symbol t73 must come from somewhere else. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S rule isn't correctly applied. Maybe I should consider a different production for S. For example, S \u2192 NT7 NT14.

The string is: t16 t17 t81 t82 t17 t53 t61 t82 t77 t48 t53 t48 t39 t95 t77 t43 t48 t95 t61.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals lead directly to terminals. For example, S -> NT12 NT8, and NT12 is further broken down into NT17 NT8, but wait, NT8 itself becomes 't48'. Wait, no, looking closer, NT12 -> 't12', so S -> NT12 NT8, which would be 't12' followed by 't48'. Hmm, but the string starts with t16, not t12, so that can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, looking again, NT12 is a non-terminal, and its productions are things like NT12 -> NT17 NT8, NT16 -> NT16 NT4, etc., but some of them lead to terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't12' as well. Similarly, NT8 is broken down into NT4 NT20, which eventually leads to 't48'. But in the string, the first token is t16. So maybe the start symbol S can derive into different sequences, and I need to see if the string is a possible derivation.\n\nI think a good approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's Chomsky Normal Form, any context-free grammar can be parsed using a CYK algorithm, but given the size of the string, maybe I can try to break it down step by step.\n\nLet's start by looking at the string: t16, t17, t81, t82, t17, t53, t61, t82, t77, t48, t53, t48, t39, t95, t77, t43, t48, t95, t61.\n\nWait, that's 19 tokens. Starting with t16, which suggests that the first part of the string is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminals that produce 't's are things like NT16 -> 't65' (but wait, looking at the grammar, I think there are more 't's defined under NT9, NT5, etc.\n\nWait, let me list all the 't's in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT14 -> 't03'?\nWait, in the rules:\n\nLooking through, some NT's are mapped to 't's:\n\nNT16 -> 't70'\nWait, no, looking again, maybe NT16 is mapped to something else.

{"custom_id":"request-362","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is `t48 t53 t26 t29 t70 t73 t43 t12 t73 t48 t39 t39 t70 t81 t39 t53 t61 t43 t29`. That's quite a long string, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF looks like. A grammar in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has at most two non-terminals on the right side, and if it's a terminal, it's a single symbol.\n\nNow, looking at the given grammar, the start symbol is S. The production rules for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT14\n\nEach of these S rules has two non-terminals, so when expanded, the string would start with these NT pairs.\n\nNext, I notice that some of the NTs (non-terminals) have productions that are terminals. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12' and others like NT3 \u2192 't29', NT5 \u2192 't39', etc. So each of these non-terminals correspond to specific terminal symbols.\n\nTo check if the given string is generated by the grammar, I can reverse-engineer the process. That is, starting from the string, see if it can be broken down into the non-terminals according to the production rules.\n\nLet's write the string as a list: [t48, t53, t26, t29, t70, t73, t43, t12, t73, t48, t39, t39, t70, t81, t39, t53, t61, t43, t29]\n\nNow, the strategy is to start from the left and try expanding non-terminals into terminals or further non-terminals. But since we're working backwards, perhaps it's easier to group the string into possible NT pairs and see if they can be derived from the S rules.\n\nLet's see which NTs correspond to the terminals in the string. Looking at the grammar, I can make a list:\n\n- 't48' \u2192 NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n- 't53' \u2192 Not directly in the list; perhaps I need to check if 53 refers to NT15 \u2192 which has 't53' as a production? Wait, looking back, I don't see NT15 having 't53' as a production. Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39', NT4 \u2192 't65', HT? Wait, let me list all the NTs that produce terminals.\n\nLet me go through each NT rule:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'?\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar, I have:\n\nLooking for 't48' in NT4: Yes, in the line NT4 \u2192 't17', but no, wait. Wait, the grammar has:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't4' \u2192 no, looking back, actually:\n\nWait, the provided grammar seems extensive, but let me check:\n\nLooking for 't48': Yes, in the NT12 rule: Wait, no.

Let me start by understanding the grammar structure.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see various non-terminals (like S, NTx) and terminals (like t48, t26, etc.). \n\nFirst, I notice that S has several productions, like S -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, etc. Each of these productions produces two non-terminals. So, to generate the string, the S symbol will have to expand into a sequence of non-terminals and terminals, which then expand further until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. So, I should check if there's a way to derive this string starting from S, expanding through non-terminals until reaching the terminals in order.\n\nOne of the first things I notice is that the string starts with \"t48\". I should look for production rules that produce \"t48\". Scanning through the grammar, I see NT8 -> 't48' (twice) and also NT20 -> 't65' (appears multiple times). Let me also check if any other terminals match the string.\n\nWait, the string has \"t48 t26 t26 t26 ...\", so let's check if \"t26\" is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see NT20 -> 't65', NT4 -> 't17', NT5 -> 't39', NT12 -> 't12', etc. I need to see if any production rule directly gives \"t26\". Hmm, in the list of terminal rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't26'. That might complicate things because in CNF, all terminals must be leaves, so each production must lead directly to the terminal or a non-terminal that can expand into terminals.\n\nWait, let me check again. The terminal list at the end includes NT12 -> 't12', NT4 -> 't17', NT5 -> 't39', etc. There's no 't26' terminal. Wait, looking again, the first part of the string is \"t48 t26 t26 t26\". Since 't26' isn't a terminal in the grammar, I think the entire string can't be generated by the grammar because it would require a production rule that directly produces 't26' which doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Looking through the terminal definitions: \n\nNT12 -> 't12' (so 't12' is a terminal)\nNT8 -> 't48' (so 't48' is a terminal)\nNT20 -> 't65' (so 't65' is terminal)\nNT4 -> 't17' (t17 is terminal)\nNT5 -> 't39' (t39 terminal)\nNT3 -> 't16' (t16 terminal)\nNT10 -> 't73' (t73 terminal)\nNT17 -> 't61' (t61 terminal)\nNT3 -> 't29' (t29 terminal)\nNT5 -> 't82' (t82 terminal)\nNT15 -> 't82' (t82 terminal)\nNT10 -> 't43' (t43 terminal)\nNT4 -> 't17' (t17 terminal)\nNT9 -> 't77' (t77 terminal)\nNT1 -> 't19' (t19 terminal)\nNT17 -> 't61' (t61 terminal)\nNT13 -> 't82' (t82 terminal)\nNT3 -> 't81' (t81 terminal)\nNT0 -> 't40' (t40 terminal)\nNT20 -> 't26' (Wait, no, NT20->'t65', so 't26' isn't directly produced. Wait, looking at the terminal list again:\n\nWait, at the end, there are lines like:\n\nNT5 -> 't82'\nNT15 -> 't82'\nNT5 -> 't82'\nNT10 -> 't43'\nNT4 -> 't17'\nNT9 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't19'\nNT17 -> 't61'\nNT13 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't81'\nNT0 -> 't40'\nNT20 -> 't26'? No, looking at the list:\n\nI think I misread. Let me check the terminal part again:\n\nThe end part lists:\n\nNT7 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't19'\nNT17 -> 't61'\nNT13 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't81'\nNT0 -> 't40'\nNT20 -> 't26' \u2014 Wait, do I see that? Let me check:\n\nNo, I don't see any NT20 -> 't26'; instead, NT20->'t65'. Wait, let me check the terminal list again:\n\nLooking through, there's:\n\n...NT10 -> 't43'\n...NT4 -> 't17'\n...NT9 -> 't77'\n...NT1 -> 't19'\n...NT17 -> 't61'\n...NT13 -> 't82'\n...NT3 -> 't81'\n...NT0 -> 't40'\n...NT20 -> 't26'? No, I think I made a mistake. Looking through the list, I see NT20-> 't65'? Let me verify:\n\nIn the grammar, looking at the last few lines:\n\nNT20 -> 't65'\nNT8 -> 't48'\nNT15 -> 't65'\n\nWait, so no NT20 is assigned 't26'. So the string has \"t26 t26 t26 ...\", which would require that each 't26' is a terminal. But in the grammar, no rule produces 't26' as a terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because 't26' doesn't appear in any production as a terminal.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing where 't26' could be a terminal. Let me check all the terminal rules in the grammar.\n\nLooking through each line, starting from the beginning:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\nNT9 -> NT11 NT11\nNT21 -> NT19 NT20\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\nNT16 -> NT16 NT4\nNT5 -> NT17 NT4\nNT4 -> NT4 NT7\nNT2 -> NT11 NT17\nNT0 -> NT6 NT10\nNT9 -> NT6 NT9\nNT7 -> NT2 NT11\nNT13 -> NT11 NT14\nNT2 -> NT11 NT0\nNT6 -> NT2 NT10\nNT1 -> NT5 NT2\nNT6 -> NT20 NT15\nNT12 -> NT19 NT8\nNT2 -> NT5 NT20\nNT2 -> NT7 NT16\nNT21 -> NT17 NT5\nNT21 -> NT17 NT3\nNT8 -> NT4 NT20\nNT19 -> NT1 NT2\nNT4 -> NT11 NT20\nNT16 -> NT7 NT20\nNT7 -> NT7 NT12\nNT5 -> NT13 NT7\nNT3 -> NT14 NT5\nNT1 -> NT14 NT6\nNT9 -> NT12 NT15\nNT10 -> NT16 NT8\nNT11 -> NT15 NT10\nNT20 -> NT10 NT3\nNT15 -> NT21 NT8\nNT7 -> NT1 NT0\nNT4 -> NT7 NT2\nNT21 -> NT8 NT13\nNT17 -> NT13 NT4\n... and so on.\n\nLooking through all the terminals, I don't see any rule that produces 't26' as a terminal. So, 't26' isn't an terminal, which would mean that it must be generated by a non-terminal. But the grammar's terminal rules don't include 't26'; therefore, 't26' cannot appear in the derived string.\n\nWait, but the string provided includes \"t26 t26 t26 ...\", which are terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-381","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This should make it easier to parse the string using a method like CYK parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first rule is S \u2192 NT12 NT8. So, the string should start with two non-terminals, NT12 and NT8, or any combination of rules that expand to these.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t82 t61 t29 t16 t43 t43 t19 t12 t82 t95 t95 t17 t29 t12 t19 t12 t61 t95 t43 t16`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a series of terminals, so I need to find a way to derive this sequence using the given production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's likely that each symbol in the string is derived from a single step in the grammar, meaning each terminal letter must be generated directly from a production rule where the right-hand side is a single terminal symbol.\n\nLet me look through the grammar to see which non-terminals produce terminals. Scanning through, I see that several rules end with a single terminal:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't95'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n- NT4 \u2192 't17'\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n- NT1 \u2192 't19'\n- NT17 \u2192 't61'\n- NT13 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT8 \u2192 't48'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT5 \u2192 't82'\nWait, some rules have 't' and other letters, but I think each terminal is a single token, like 't82', which is a single terminal symbol. Wait, but in the grammar provided, some rules have 't' followed by numbers, but I might need to clarify how the terminals are represented.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example, NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5, but some non-terminals expand to terminals with 't' followed by a number, like NT2 \u2192 't95'. So each rule that ends with a single terminal is a direct production to a single token in the string.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of these 't' tokens, and I need to check if the grammar allows each of these tokens to be derived.\n\nBut perhaps each 't' token corresponds to a non-terminal that can be directly expanded to that token. So, for example, NT2 can be directly replaced by 't95', so in the parse tree, that's a leaf node with 't95'.\n\nWait, but the string has 20 tokens, which suggests a parse tree with 20 leaves. Since the grammar is in CNF, the depth of the parse tree would be log2(n), but I'm not sure. However, the key is that each token must be directly derivable from a non-terminal that has a production rule leading to that terminal.\n\nSo let me look at each token in the string and see if the grammar allows it to be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nStarting with the first token: t82. I need to find a non-terminal that can produce 't82'. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT13 \u2192 't82' and NT5 \u2192 't82' (wait, let me recheck the grammar provided):\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't16'\nNT13 \u2192 't82'\nNT5 \u2192 't82' (Wait, let me check the grammar provided by the user.

Let me check.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I think I need to parse the grammar more carefully.\n\nThe user lists NT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4 and then later NT5 \u2192 't82'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar rules:\n\n- NT5 -> NT17 NT4\n- NT5 -> 't82'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar provided by the user:\n\nScanning through, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't39'; another branch is NT5 -> NT17 NT4.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 -> 't16', and another rule NT3 -> NT5 NT14.\n\nSo, for 't82', looking at the grammar, NT13 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't82' (NT13 \u2192 't82'). Also, NT5 \u2192 't82', wait, no, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through, I find NT13 \u2192 't82' and another rule: NT3 \u2192 't16', NT5 \u2192 't82' (Wait, actually, in the user's grammar, I think I see NT5 -> 't66'?

So, in the user's grammar, NT13 \u2192 't82' and also NT5 \u2192 't82' is not present, because looking more carefully, NT5 has several rules, but none directly say 't82' except possibly through NT5 -> 't66'? Wait, that's not correct.

Let me parse the user's grammar step by step.\n\nThe grammar is given as a list of production rules.

{"custom_id":"request-403","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is a series of tokens: `t48 t17 t82 t12 t48 t48 t40 t73 t29 t26 t82 t82 t48 t48 t29 t12 t66 t77 t70 t65 t48`. The grammar is pretty complex with a lot of non-terminals (like S, NT12, NT7, etc.) and terminals. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has productions where the right-hand side (RHS) is either two terminals, two non-terminals, or a single terminal (though sometimes considered differently). So, in this case, all the productions seem to be in forms that fit CNF, except maybe for single terminals on the RHS, which I think are allowed but handled differently.\n\nLooking at the string, it's all terminals, so each token in the string must be derived from a production that produces exactly that terminal. So the strategy is to see if each token in the string can be matched through the productions starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI need to build a derivation tree or trace the string through the productions. Since it's a long string, I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the first token, which is t48. I look at all the productions that have t48 on the RHS. From the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT8 -> t48 (multiple times)\n- NT20 -> t26\n- NT29 -> t29 (twice)\n- NT12 -> t12\n- NT77 -> t77\n- NT70 -> t70\n- NT65 -> t65\n- NT66 -> t66\n- NT77 -> t77 (maybe from NT7 or somewhere else? Wait, looking at the grammar, there are multiple t's but their sources vary. I think I might have to track each t back through the production chain.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for which non-terminals produce t48. From the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT8 -> t48 (multiple times). So if any production leads to NT8, then t48 can be produced. Similarly, other terminals might lead to t48.\n\nBut starting with the first token t48, so the first step is to find a way to produce t48. So perhaps the first production is S -> NT12 NT12, which would produce two symbols, but the first token is t48, so maybe that's not the start. Alternatively, S can produce other combinations.\n\nWait, the first token is t48, so let's think about which non-terminals can expand into t48. Looking at the productions, some NTs have t48 as their RHS:\n\nFor example, NT8 -> t48 multiple times. So to get t48, maybe a production of NT8. But how do we get NT8 into the start?\n\nLooking at S, the productions are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 (t12 twice)\nS -> NT7 NT14 (what does NT7 and NT14 produce?)\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo S can produce combinations of these. But our string starts with t48, so maybe the first step is to find a path from S to NT8, which then produces t48.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first token t48 is from NT12, which is in the first production. Wait, but S -> NT12 NT12 would produce t12 twice, but the first token is t48, which is different. So maybe that path isn't the right one.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT and S. Let me try to plan this differently.\n\nPerhaps the approach is to check if the string can be split into a sequence of productions that match the tokens. Since each token is a terminal, we need to have productions that produce each of these terms step by step.\n\nFor example, the first token is t48, which comes from a production that produces t48. Looking at the grammar, NT8 -> t48, and other NTs might as well, but I don't think any other NTs directly produce t48 except NT8. So somewhere, the derivation must reach NT8, which then produces t48.\n\nSimilarly, the second token is t17, which comes from a production that produces t17. Looking in the grammar, NT17 has some productions, like NT17 -> NT7 NT12 (wait, but let me check the grammar).\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n\n- NT17 -> NT13 NT4\n- NT17 -> NT20 NT17\n- NT17 -> NT6 NT20\n- ... and others like NT7 -> NT17 NT0, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see which NTs can produce t17 or t17 is part of a production.\n\nLooking for t17: searching through the grammar, for example, in NT17 -> NT7 NT16, and other places NT17 is used, but doesn't directly produce a terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe I need to check for terminals in the grammar RHS:\n\nLooking again, the terminals in the grammar include t48, t17, t82, t12, t48, etc. So each of these must be the result of a non-terminal production.\n\nSo, for the token t17, which production produces t17? Looking through the grammar, it seems that most productions produce two symbols, not a single terminal. But perhaps some have just a single terminal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar rules. For example:\n\nLooking at line \"NT17 -> NT13 NT4\".\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking of this incorrectly. No, all the RHS are either two non-terminals, two terminals, or maybe one. Wait, no, in CNF, the RHS can only have two symbols, no more. So each production is two symbols, either both NTs or one NT and one terminal, or two terminals. But in some cases, a production might just produce a single terminal, but I think CNF doesn't allow that, so all productions must have exactly two symbols on the RHS. Hmm, but the given grammar may have some ambiguities.\n\nWait, no, CNF allows productions to have either two symbols, including terminals and non-terminals, as long as each is a single symbol. So for example, S -> AB, where A and B are non-terminals, or A->aB, etc.\n\nSo, to get a terminal like t48, we need a production where the RHS is just t48, or a production where one of the non-terminals in the RHS produces t48. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any productions that directly have a single terminal, except for perhaps some non-terminals that can derive a terminal through other steps.\n\nWait, for example, looking at NT8 -> t48, which is a terminal. So to produce t48, the production must involve NT8, which can be derived from some sequence of other non-terminals.\n\nBut in that case, the first token t48 would come from NT8 being expanded, so we have to see if S can eventually derive to something that includes NT8.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t48, so S must derive into a sequence where the first expansion leads to t48. How?\n\nWait, perhaps the first two symbols in the string are t48 t17. So S -> NT12 NT12 would give t12 t12, which doesn't match. S -> NT7 NT14 would give something else, maybe not. S -> NT9 NT12, but NT9 is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production is S -> NT12 NT12 leading to t12 t12, but the first token is t48, so that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the first production is the one that leads to t48, but then the second token is t17.\n\nI'm getting confused. Maybe I should try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nFirst token: t48. So we need a production that produces t48. From the grammar, NT8 -> t48, and also looking at other rules, maybe NT12 has a production leading to t48? No, looking at NT12's productions:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8.\n\nSo NT12 is two non-terminals. Then, to get t48, we need to derive from one of those non-terminals. For example, NT17 could produce t17, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe NT12 can produce t48? No, NT12 is split into NT17 and NT8, so first it'll split into two symbols, so the entire string will have the first part as t48. So perhaps the first step is NT12 -> NT17 NT8, which would produce two symbols,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-396","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given string \"t16 t77 t65 t43 t39 t48 t81 t66 t53 t16 t65 t82 t26 t53 t40 t43 t53 t73 t29 t43 t29\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the grammar to understand the structure. The start symbol is S, and it has productions leading to combinations of non-terminals. Each non-terminal branches into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it's a sequence of terminals: t's with numbers. So, the string is made up of terminal symbols. My job is to see if this sequence can be derived from S through a series of productions in the grammar.\n\nThe first step is to map each terminal in the string to the corresponding non-terminals in the grammar. Let's list the terminals and their positions:\n\n1. t16\n2. t77\n3. t65\n4. t43\n5. t39\n6. t48\n7. t81\n8. t66\n9. t53\n10. t16\n11. t65\n12. t82\n13. t26\n14. t53\n15. t40\n16. t43\n17. t53\n18. t73\n19. t29\n20. t43\n21. t29\n\nI'll need to see if each terminal can be derived from non-terminals through the productions. The key is to see if the sequence can be reduced starting from S, each production leading to the correct terminals.\n\nStarting with S, the productions from S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo, the first step is to decide which production to take. Looking at the string, the first terminal is t16. Let's check if S can produce a t16.\n\nLooking into the grammar, I see that NT12 has a production: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. Let me check the terminals. The string starts with t16, which might come from NT17 or NT8.\n\nLooking into NT17, there's a production NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4. Then, NT13 is in the grammar: NT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19. Hmm, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, let's see if any NT can directly produce t16.\n\nLooking at the list of NT productions, I don't see any NT directly producing t16. So maybe it's through multiple steps.\n\nWait, let's check the NTs that can lead to t16. Maybe from NT16? NT16 can lead to NT7 NT20, which can lead to t73. Alternatively, NT16 can lead to NT7 NT20, which might get to t73, but that's not directly 16.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT5: NT5 can produce t39, which is in the string. Let me see if there's a way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production S \u2192 NT9 NT12 is better because NT9 can lead to NT6 NT9, and so on. Let me try that.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT9 NT12. Then, NT9 can produce NT6 NT9, but that might not directly give t16. Alternatively, NT9 \u2192 NT12 NT15, and NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, and NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, etc. Maybe it's getting too deep.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step is to see which NTs can produce t16.\n\nLooking through the NTs, I notice NT4: NT4 can produce t65, t17, but not directly 16. NT3 produces t16: NT3 \u2192 t16 (multiple times? Wait, in the grammar, there's multiple productions for NT3, but one of them is NT3 \u2192 t16. So NT3 can directly produce t16. Similarly, NT3 can produce t29, t39, t43, etc.\n\nSo, if we can find a way to get t16 from S through NTs, that's a possibility.\n\nLooking at the first terminal, t16 is from NT3. So, perhaps S can produce a NT that eventually produces t16. Let me see:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12. Let's see how NT9 and NT12 can produce components of the string.\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9: which might lead to more NTs. Alternatively, NT9 \u2192 NT12 NT15, which would involve NT12 and NT15.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to reverse-engineer the string. Starting from the end and see if each terminal can be connected through inverse productions.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two non-terminals. So, the string can be broken down into pairs of non-terminals at each step.\n\nLet's try to process the string in pairs, starting from the end.\n\nThe string is 21 terminals long, which is odd. However, each production splits into two, so the parse tree will have a certain structure. Let me count the number of non-terminals. Since each production splits into two, the number of nodes in the parse tree is 21, which is N+1 for N terminals. Wait, that's correct because each step in the derivation adds one symbol, starting from S which has 1 symbol, then each production adds 2, but maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to break the string into pairs starting from the beginning, but that might not work because CNF allows any split, but in practice, it's like a binary tree.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it by building the parse tree from the bottom up or top down, but I'm a bit stuck.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the presence of the terminals in the grammar. The terminals available are t16, t77, t65, t43, t39, t48, t81, t66, t53, t16, t65, t82, t26, t53, t40, t43, t53, t73, t29, t43, t29.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each NT can produce some terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t16, t29, t39, t43\n- NT5 \u2192 t39, t48\n- NT4 \u2192 t65, t17\n- NT6 \u2192 t3, which is a non-terminal, but looking in grammar, NT3 \u2192 t16, etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 t48, t65, t73, t81, t19\n- NT7 \u2192 t77, t95, etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 t39, t65, t77, t82, t66, t53\n- NT12 \u2192 t12, which is a terminal.\n- NT16 \u2192 t70, t7, t20, etc. Wait, in the grammar, NT16 \u2192 NT7 NT20, and some terminals in the entries, like NT16 \u2192 NT7 NT20 (which might lead to t7), but looking for t16.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, which leads to more NTs, but NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, and NT4 can \u2192 t65, t17. So, perhaps NT17 can produce t16 indirectly? Let me check.\n\nLooking for possible paths to t16:\n\n1. NT3 can produce t16 directly, as in NT3 \u2192 t16.\n2. Are there other NTs that can produce t16? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that can directly produce t16 except NT3.\n\nSo, to get t16, we need to have a production that leads to it.

{"custom_id":"request-421","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. Let me see what the start symbol is. It looks like the string starts with S, so the start symbol is S. The production rules for S are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT12 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT14 NT9\n\nWait, looking more carefully, some rules are like S \u2192 NT12 NT12, but others have different combinations. I should verify.\n\nWait, the user might have mistyped. Let me check again. The grammar has S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT12 NT14, and S \u2192 NT14 NT9. Hmm, that's a bit unusual because S can produce two NTs each time. So the string should start with combinations of NTs, each of which can further produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string provided: `t17 t40 t12 t29 t19 t17 t16 t95 t73 t53 t66 t53 t19 t70 t77 t73 t82 t77 t16 t19 t81 t19`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with `t17`, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I need to see where `t17` is defined. Looking through the productions, I see that NT17 \u2192 t61, and others like NT7 \u2192 t61, etc. Wait, no, in the productions, some NTs lead to terminals. For example:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t17 (twice), and NT17 \u2192 t61.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t17 (appears twice: once as NT4 \u2192 t17 NT2 and NT4 \u2192 t11 NT20 NT5 ???

Wait, looking back, the production for NT4 is:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT4: NT4 \u2192 t17 NT2 and NT4 \u2192 t11 NT20.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t17 NT2? Or is it NT4 \u2192 t17 NT2?\n\nWait, looking at the user's grammar:\n\nWait, it's a bit hard to parse, but let's see. The user's grammar has lines like:\n\nNT4 -> NT17 NT2\nNT4 -> NT11 NT20\nNT16 -> NT7 NT20\nWait, somewhere it says NT4 -> t17 NT2 and NT4 -> NT11 NT20. Hmm.\n\nWait, but looking further down, I see NT4 \u2192 't17', for example:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, yes, multiple entries have:\n\nNT4 -> t17 NT2,\n\nand\n\nNT4 -> t11 NT20.\n\nWait, but also, in the terminal definitions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't17' appears at NT4 -> t17? Or is it a production where NT4 \u2192 t17 but I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some NTs directly produce terminals, such as NT12 \u2192 't12', which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs might lead to terminals. For example:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t77, I think.\n\nWait, no. Let me find the terminal productions.\n\nLooking specifically, I see:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', 't81', 't82'.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the terminal productions are:\n\nWait, actually, it's a bit confusing. Let me go through each non-terminal and see if they produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', 't81', 't82', 't3' (Wait, no, 't3' is another NT, perhaps).\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3: several productions, but some go to terminals:\n\nNT3 -> t16, NT3 -> t29, NT3 -> t82, etc. Wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, upon closer inspection, the grammar seems to have some rules where NTs produce terminals. For example:\n\nLooking for where an NT is followed by a terminal and nothing else, like A -> a.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all NTs and their productions to see which ones produce terminals.\n\nLooking through each NT and its productions:\n\n- NT12: 3 rules, one leading to 't12', others are nt... So NT12 \u2192 't12' as one of its rules.\n\n- NT10: multiple rules, some leading to 't53', others to 't73', 't43'.\n\n- NT4: multiple NT rules and possibly a terminal rule. Wait, looking again, does NT4 have a production that leads directly to a terminal? Let's check:\n\nNT4: NT4 -> NT17 NT2, NT4 -> NT11 NT20, NT4 -> NT16 NT7, NT4 -> NT5 NT20, ...\n\nWait, no, looking at the end of the grammar, under NT4: There's:\n\nNT4 -> t17 NT2,\nNT4 -> t11 NT20,\nand others? Or wait, perhaps the user made a typo.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, under NT4, there's:\n\nNT4 -> t17 NT2,\n\nand\n\nNT4 -> t11 NT20.\n\nSo, are these the only productions for NT4? Or am I missing others.\n\nWait, no, the user's grammar has a line: NT4 -> t17 NT2, another line: NT4 -> t11 NT20.\n\nSo, NT4 can produce a terminal combined with a non-terminal, but no direct terminal production. So NT4 \u2192 t17 NT2.\n\nWait, but wait, in the grammar, I see near the bottom:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> t39,\n\n- NT12 -> t12,\n\n- NT16 -> t70,\n\n- NT3 -> t16,\n\n- NT3 -> t29,\n\n- NT5 -> t66,\n\n- NT15 -> t82,\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, other NTs do have direct terminal productions. For example:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39', 't66'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't82'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't61'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't61'\n\n- Wait, but looking at the grammar, do any NTs have a production that ends with a terminal? Let's see.\n\nWait, I see NT12 \u2192 't12', which is a terminal.\n\nAlso, NT9 \u2192 't65'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through NT9:\n\nNT9 has rules leading to other NTs, but I don't see a direct terminal production. Wait, in the grammar:\n\nNT9: NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9,\n\nso not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me check other parts:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 't17' in this line:\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-419","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by that grammar. The string is: `t73 t43 t73 t16 t66 t48 t73 t73 t16 t12 t66 t66 t16 t65 t66 t39 t26 t12 t43 t70 t61 t40`. \n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the grammar and the string. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The strings in the grammar seem to be terminals when they end with an 'a'. Looking at the non-terminals, some produce specific terminals like 't73', 't43', etc.\n\nSo, my task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S in the grammar, I see that S can produce:\n1. NT12 NT12\n2. NT7 NT14\n3. NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these is a production with two non-terminals. So, starting from S, the first step will be to replace S with one of these pairs.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is 't73'. I need to see which production starts with 't73' in the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar productions, I see:\n- NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17 and also NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT16\nWait, let me look through all the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT2 has several productions. For example:\n- NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT16\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT21 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT12 NT0\n\nWait, but we're looking for a production that leads to 't73'. So, which non-terminals produce 't73'? Looking at the bottom of the grammar, there's a production NT10 \u2192 't73', and also NT4 \u2192 't17', etc.\n\nBut the terminals are all leaf nodes. So, any production that ends with a non-terminal, when fully expanded, should lead to these terminal tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can derive the string. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string into possible sub-strings that correspond to the non-terminals' productions.\n\nAnother approach is to check the grammar's start symbol S and see if the entire string can be generated from S.\n\nWait, but another method is to see if all the symbols in the string can be matched by the productions, possibly by checking the step-by-step expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the grammar is in CNF and try to parse the string using that structure.\n\nBut considering that the grammar is quite extensive, perhaps I can identify which non-terminals correspond to each token.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals, which must have been generated by the non-terminals through their productions.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order: t73, t43, t73, t16, t66, t48, t73, t73, t16, t12, t66, t66, t16, t65, t66, t39, t26, t12, t43, t70, t61, t40.\n\nI'll try to match these tokens step by step, using the productions.\n\nFirst, S can produce either NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12.\n\nLet me assume S \u2192 NT12 NT12. Then, each of these NT12's can be replaced by their productions.\n\nLooking at NT12's productions in the grammar:\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT4\n- NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT12\n- NT12 \u2192 NT0 NT10\n- NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT8\nWait, wait, actually, looking at the list, it's:\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT12 is produced by several rules:\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT4\n- NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT12\n- NT12 \u2192 NT0 NT10\n- NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT8\n\nWait, but in the initial part, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, after S, we have two non-terminals, perhaps in this case, two NT12's.\n\nEach NT12 can generate several things. So, let's try to see if the first token is t73, but NT12 doesn't produce t73. Wait, looking back, perhaps I'm mixing up non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the right-hand sides are either combinations of non-terminals or terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-443","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, which I remember is a specific way of structuring the production rules where each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, I look at the provided grammar. It's a bit lengthy, but I notice that many of the rules produce terminal symbols (like 't65', 't12') rather than non-terminals. This makes me think that the grammar is somewhat specialized, possibly modeling a particular language based on these terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t65 t12 t43 t48 t61 t70 t82 t81 t73 t29 t95 t61 t70 t17 t73 t40 t95 t39 t17 t65 t48 t43 t95`. It looks like a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, separated by spaces.\n\nMy task is to figure out if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, I might be able to use the Cocke-Younger-Scott (CYK) parsing algorithm, but wait, the CYK algorithm is used for top-down parsing, and it requires certain structures in the grammar. Alternatively, since some terminals are used directly, maybe I can construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to analyze the grammar and see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start symbol S, following the production rules. Let's see.\n\nThe string starts with 't65'. Looking into the grammar, I notice that 't65' is a terminal. I check the production rules for NT14 and NT3, it seems that NT14 can produce 't65' (rule: NT14 -> 't65'), and similarly NT3 can also produce 't65' (NT3 -> 't65').\n\nWait, so the first token is 't65', which could be produced by either NT14 or NT3.\n\nBut looking further, the string also includes other tokens like 't12', which appears in the rule NT12 -> 't12'.\n\nLet me look at the structure of the string. It starts with sequences like 't65 t12 t43...'.\n\nSo perhaps the starting symbol S can produce these sequences by expanding into NT12 and NT8, as per the first rule in the grammar: S -> NT12 NT18? Wait, the first rule is S -> NT12 NT18? Wait, no, looking again, the first rule is S -> NT12 NT18? Wait, no, let me double-check: Initial rules are S->NT12 NT12, S->NT7 NT14, S->NT9 NT12.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar starts as:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\n\nWait, no, looking at the user's input, the grammar starts as:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, but I need to be precise. Let me reread the grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the first few lines:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, now looking at the strings, it's possible that S could split into these non-terminals, which then derive the terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the initial step is to split the string into parts that correspond to the non-terminals.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Let me try to map the string step by step.\n\nLet me consider the CYK algorithm.\n\nIn CYK, we first preprocess the string into a table where each cell corresponds to a substring. For each position, we consider all possible non-terminals that can derive that substring in k steps.\n\nStarting with the input string: \n\nt65 t12 t43 t48 t61 t70 t82 t81 t73 t29 t95 t61 t70 t17 t73 t40 t95 t39 t17 t65 t48 t43 t95.\n\nThe length is 23, so we'll process substrings of length 1, 2, ..., 23.\n\nFor each position, we consider each possible k (number of derivation steps), and check if any production rule can combine smaller substrings.\n\nBut since the grammar can have multiple production rules, and because this could take a long time, perhaps there's a more straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to see if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the beginning, the first token is 't65', which can be produced directly by NT3 or NT14.\n\nSuppose we choose S -> NT12 NT12, then each NT12 will produce something.\n\nLooking at the first NT12: if it's derived into 't12', which is the second token.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT12 can produce 't12' (rule NT12 -> 't12'), so that fits.\n\nSo the first two tokens could be 't65 t12' if the grammar allows that.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S -> NT12 NT12. Each NT12 is a non-terminal. So the first NT12 would derive a string, and the second NT12 would derive another string. So the overall string is the concatenation of the two NT12 strings.\n\nWait, but the first token is 't65', which would be produced by a single NT12, but in reality, NT12 is a non-terminal that can produce 't12' as a terminal, or via other production rules that involve other non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nEach production rule in Chomsky normal form has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait no, in standard Chomsky normal form, each rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nBut in the provided grammar, it seems some rules have NTs followed by digits, probably terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't12', which would be a terminal.\n\nSo, the starting symbol S can expand into two NTs, each which can in turn expand into other NTs or terminals.\n\nThis makes it a bit more complex, but manageable.\n\nLet me try to find a possible derivation.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't65'. Let's see where 't65' comes from. Looking through the grammar, I see NT14 has a production rule that sometimes leads to 't65'. For example, looking at NT14: rules like NT14 -> 't65'? Yes, at one point it's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 also can produce 't65'.\n\nSo, perhaps the first token 't65' is derived from NT14 or NT3.\n\nBut let's think about the context, since the production rules are S-based.\n\nS -> NT12 NT12: So the string is the concatenation of two derivations from NT12 and NT12. Looking at that, the first NT12 must derive 't65', and the second NT12 must derive the remaining tokens.\n\nSo for the first part, can NT12 derive 't65'?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT12, one production is NT12 -> 't12', another is NT12 -> NT17 NT8, another is NT12 -> NT19 NT8.\n\nWait, so NT12 can produce 't12', but that first token is 't65', which is another thing. So, no, NT12 cannot directly produce 't65'. So the initial assumption that S splits into two NT12s might not yield the first token as 't65'.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the initial expansion of S is different.\n\nLooking again, S can expand into NT7 and NT14, for example. So perhaps S -> NT7 NT14.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf S -> NT7 NT14, then NT7 can derive...? Let's check NT7's rules.\n\nLooking at NT7: rules like NT7 -> NT2 NT11, NT7 -> NT7 NT12, NT7 -> NT1 NT0, etc.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I can try starting from the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is made up of terms that can be derived step by step from the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to check each step where a NT can produce a specific token.\n\nLet's try to see if the entire string can be parsed.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t65 t12. Let's see if that can be produced.\n\nLooking at the production S -> NT12 NT12.\n\nEach NT12 can derive a terminal or a combination. For the first token 't65', it must be one of the NT12's deriving it.\n\nBut as I saw"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-442","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t16 t70 t48 t48 t95 t43 t70 t77 t81 t70 t12 t61 t29 t82 t65 t70 t19 t48 t29 t40 t40 t82 t82`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the left. This makes parsing easier, maybe even allowing for a recursive descent parser.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several productions where non-terminals expand into terminals, like S -> NT12 NT12 where NT12 is 't12'. So some of the non-terminals are directly mapping to terminals. That means whenever I see those terms in the string, they should correspond to specific non-terminals expanding to those terminals.\n\nMy plan is to start from the start symbol, S, and try to decompose the string step by step, matching the productions. Since the string is quite long, I'll break it into segments that match the possible productions.\n\nFirst, S can go to NT9 NT12. Let's see if the first part of the string can be NT9 expanding. Wait, NT9's production is NT11 NT11. Looking at the string, the first term is t16. Does NT9 expand to t16? Let me check the grammar: NT9 -> NT11 NT11. But none of the non-terminals expand directly to t16 except NT3, which is t16. So perhaps NT11 expands to t16? Or wait, no, because NT3 is t16, and NT11 has a production NT15 NT10, which then expands to t21 (if NT21 is t21?) Wait, no, looking at the grammar, several entries have 't' followed by a number, which I think are the terminals. So for example, NT3 is 't16'.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, some entries have 't' followed by a number, like NT3->t16, NT5->t39, etc. So those are the terminals. So NT9->NT11 NT11, which would be t16 t16 if NT11 is t16? No, wait, NT11's production is NT15 NT10, which further expands. Let me check:\n\nNT11 -> NT15 NT10\nNT15 -> NT21 NT8\nNT21 -> NT8 NT13 (among others)\nNT8 -> t48\nNT13 -> t82\nWait, NT21 in the grammar expands to multiple options, including 't26', 't48', etc. But in the string, after the first t16, the next is t70, t48, etc. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to see which non-terminals expand directly to t16. Looking through the grammar, NT3 is 't16'. So if S uses NT12 -> t12, which is a terminal, then the S-> NT12 NT12 would produce t12 t12. But the string starts with t16, so that can't be from S->NT12 NT12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S uses another production. Let's list all S productions:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo the first option is NT12 NT12, producing t12 t12. Doesn't fit the string starting with t16. The second is NT7 NT14. Let's see what NT7 and NT14 expand to.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions: NT7->NT2 NT11. So NT7 is a non-terminal that produces NT2 NT11. Similarly, NT14->NT4 NT0, and NT4 is 't17' and NT0 is t40. So NT14 would be t17 t40. So if S takes the second option, NT7 NT14, then:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT11\nNT11 -> NT15 NT10\nNT15 -> ... eventually, perhaps producing terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t16, so maybe not. Alternatively, S-> NT9 NT12: NT9->NT11 NT11, which would then be NT11 NT11.\n\nLet me see what NT11 is. NT11's production is NT15 NT10. Let's see what those expand to:\n\nNT15->NT21 NT8\nNT21->NT8 NT13 or others, but in the string, the next terms are 70, 48, etc.\n\nLooking at NT15->NT21 NT8. NT21 could be t26, t48, t53, etc., based on the grammar. Wait, the string starts with t16, so maybe NT11 doesn't apply here.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should take a different approach. Let's map each terminal in the string to the possible non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLooking at the string: t16, t70, t48, t48, t95, etc.\n\nLooking up the grammar, t16 is from NT3. t70 is NT17. t48 is NT8. t95 is NT12. t43 is NT5. t70 is NT17 again. t77 is NT9. t81 is NT13. t82 is from multiple NTs. t12 is from NT12. t61 is NT17. t29 is NT3. t82 from NT9, etc.\n\nNow, I'll try to build the string step by step. Let's see what the string looks like:\n\nt16 t70 t48 t48 t95 t43 t70 t77 t81 t70 t12 t61 t29 t82 t65 t70 t19 t48 t29 t40 t40 t82 t82.\n\nThis seems long. Let me try breaking it down.\n\nThe first term is t16, which must come from NT3. So let's look at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3->t16 (a terminal)\nNT3->t13 NT2 (but t13 is a terminal)\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT3->t16\nNT3->t13 NT2 (but NT13 is t82, and NT2 is t70)\nSo NT3 can either produce t16 or t13 t2.\n\nBut in the string, the first term is t16, so that's likely from NT3 -> t16.\n\nSo now, after producing t16, what's left is the rest of the string starting from the second term.\n\nNext term is t70. Let's see what can produce t70.\n\nLooking back, NT7's production is NT2 NT11. NT2 is t70 or NT6, etc. Wait, looking at NT2's productions:\n\nNT2->NT11 NT17\nNT2->NT5 NT20\nNT2->NT21 NT4\nNT2->NT7 NT16\n\nLooking for a production that starts with t70.\n\nWait, let's look at each NT that expands to t70:\n\nNT17->NT6NT20 (which would produce NT6 which may be t3 or something)\nWait, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly. I need to find which non-terminals directly produce t70 as a terminal. Looking at the grammar, t70 is not a terminal directly. Instead, NT17->t70? No, in the grammar, NT17 has a production NT17->NT6 NT20. So t70 isn't directly produced by any NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The grammar only has terminals of the form 't' followed by a number. So t70 is the terminal produced by NT17->t70? But looking at the grammar, I don't see that. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly gives t70. So t70 must come from a production where the NT expands into something that includes t70.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because in Chomsky normal form, each production is non-terminals only. So t70 is a terminal, meaning a non-terminal must directly produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps NT17 can produce t70?

{"custom_id":"request-458","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It starts with the start symbol S, which can produce different combinations of other non-terminals. Each production rule seems to consist of two non-terminals on the right side, as per Chomsky Normal Form, which typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nThe terminals in the string are the 't' tokens followed by numbers, like t26, t61, etc. Each of these must be derived from a production rule that results in exactly those terminals. So, I need to see if each 't' in the string can be generated by some terminal production rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several production rules that end with a terminal. For instance:\n\n- S can produce NT12 NT12 (but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet)\n- NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3\nAnd wait, actually, I need to look for production rules that directly produce a single terminal symbol. Scanning through, I notice some rules that have terminals on the right-hand side, such as:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16'\n- NT3 \u2192 't29'\n- NT5 \u2192 't82'\n- NT15 \u2192 't82'\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n- NT4 \u2192 't17'\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n- NT1 \u2192 't19'\n- NT17 \u2192 't61'\n- NT13 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't81' (Wait, this seems conflicting with NT3 \u2192 't29', but maybe it's a mistake; perhaps two different rules for the same NT, but same terminal?)\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT8 \u2192 't48'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65' (Again, same as NT20)\n- NT7 \u2192 't61'\n- NT13 \u2192 't82'\n\nWait, looking again, I think I might have misread. Let me go through each rule that directly produces a terminal:\n\n1. NT12 \u2192 't12'\n2. NT3 \u2192 't16'\n3. NT3 \u2192 't29'\n4. NT5 \u2192 't39'\n5. NT10 \u2192 't53'\n6. NT10 \u2192 't73'\n7. NT4 \u2192 't65'\n8. NT20 \u2192 't65'\n9. NT10 \u2192 't43'\n10. NT4 \u2192 't17'\n11. NT9 \u2192 't77'\n12. NT1 \u2192 't19'\n13. NT17 \u2192 't61'\n14. NT13 \u2192 't82'\n15. NT3 \u2192 't81' (Wait, earlier I thought NT3 was producing different things, but this is the same as NT13. Maybe it's an error in the rules provided. Let me check again: No, looking back, I think I might have mixed up the rules. Wait, the original grammar has, for example, NT3 \u2192 't29' and 't81'\u2014that can't be right unless it's a typo. But perhaps it's a mistake, like two separate rules, but I'll proceed assuming that each symbol has only one production rule.)\n\nWait, perhaps some of these rules are different. Let me look carefully:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12' (12)\n- NT3 \u2192 't16' (16)\n- NT3 \u2192 't29' (29)\n- NT5 \u2192 't39' (39)\n- NT10 \u2192 't53' (53)\n- NT10 \u2192 't73' (73)\n- NT4 \u2192 't65' (65)\n- NT20 \u2192 't65' (65)\n- NT10 \u2192 't43' (43)\n- NT4 \u2192 't17' (17)\n- NT9 \u2192 't77' (77)\n- NT1 \u2192 't19' (19)\n- NT17 \u2192 't61' (61)\n- NT13 \u2192 't82' (82)\n- NT3 \u2192 't81' (81)\n- NT0 \u2192 't40' (40)\n- NT20 \u2192 't26' (26)\n- NT8 \u2192 't48' (48)\n- NT15 \u2192 't65' (65)\n- NT7 \u2192 't61' (61)\n- NT13 \u2192 't82' (82)\n- NT3 \u2192 't59' (Wait, no, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck each line.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the terminals in the string are 't26', 't61', etc., and I need to see if each corresponds to a terminal production.\n\nThe string is: t26 t61 t82 t53 t95 t65 t66 t29 t73 t53 t17 t65 t61 t12 t48 t82 t70 t29 t95 t26 t19 t48 t70 t39.\n\nI'll go through each token and see if it's a terminal production in the grammar.\n\n1. t26: Looking for NT that produces t26. In the rules, I see NT20 \u2192 't26' (Yes, rule exists)\n2. t61: Check for NT61. Looking through rules, NT17 \u2192 't61' (Yes)\n3. t82: Check NT82. Looking, NT13 \u2192 't82' (Yes)\n4. t53: Check NT53. NT10 \u2192 't53' (Yes)\n5. t95: Looking for NT95. Hmm, checking the rules, I don't see any NT95. The rules for NT12 go to 't12', etc., but nothing produces 't95'. Wait, is that a mistake? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I don't see any production where the right-hand side is 't95' as a terminal. So this could be a problem. Maybe I missed it. Let me go through all the terminal rules again quickly:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\nNT3 \u2192 't16', 't29'\nNT5 \u2192 't39'\nNT10 \u2192 't53', 't73', 't43'\nNT4 \u2192 't65'\nNT20 \u2192 't65', 't26'\nNT9 \u2192 't77'\nNT1 \u2192 't19'\nNT17 \u2192 't61'\nNT13 \u2192 't82'\nNT3 \u2192 't81'\nNT0 \u2192 't40'\nNT20 \u2192 't26' (duplicate but same as above)\nNT8 \u2192 't48'\nNT15 \u2192 't65' (same as NT20)\nNT7 \u2192 't61' (same as NT17)\nNT13 \u2192 't82' (duplicate)\nNT3 \u2192 't81' (duplicate)\nNT0 \u2192 't40'\nSo, no 't95' in the terminal productions. That means the fifth token, t95, cannot be generated by the grammar. So the string cannot be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. Is there any rule that produces 't95'? Scanning the rules again, I don't find any. So token 5 is impossible. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any rule. Looking through all, I don't see 't95' anywhere on the right-hand side of a production. So, the presence of t95 in the string is a deal-breaker.\n\nSo, the string has 't95' which can't be generated, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-474","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is:\n\n`t39 t82 t66 t43 t26 t81 t66 t65 t61 t65 t66 t53 t77 t70 t39 t53 t26 t95 t66 t61 t39 t73 t17 t43 t16`\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because all the productions I spot are either non-terminals on both sides or terminals on the right side with only one terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are some terminals in the productions, like 't95', 't53', etc. My task is to see if the provided string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nMy approach is to look for possible derivations, starting from S and seeing if I can break down the string into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nFirst, let's list all the productions with terminals and identify the non-terminals. From the grammar, the non-terminals are S, NT12, NT9, NT7, NT21, NT12, NT17, NT5, NT4, NT2, NT0, NT9, NT7, NT13, etc. Terminals in the grammar are 't12', 't39', 't43', 't53', 't65', 't61', 't77', 't70', 't82', 't95', etc. The given string includes these terminals.\n\nI notice that S has productions to NT12 NT12, NT9 NT14, and NT7 NT14. Wait, no, looking back, the initial productions from S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT9 NT14\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\n\nWait, the user provided the same three lines again, so probably S has these three productions.\n\nWait, looking again, the user listed:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT9 NT14\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo starting from S, the first step is to choose one of these productions and split accordingly. So the string must start with the two parts derived from the chosen production.\n\nFor example, if we choose S \u2192 NT12 NT12, the string must start with the expansion of NT12 followed by another NT12.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are 't39 t82 t66 t43 t26 t81 t66 t65 t61 t65 t66 t53 t77 t70 t39 t53 t26 t95 t66 t61 t39 t73 t17 t43 t16'.\n\nWait, but the string has 24 tokens, each a terminal. So each step in the derivation must break it down into smaller parts.\n\nWait, actually, in CFG, the length of the string can vary, but for CNF, each production either introduces a non-terminal or a single terminal. Since the grammar has all productions either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, it's a straight line derivation, meaning the length of the string must be a power of two. But wait, the given string has length 24, which is not a power of two. So 24 is 2^4 + 8, but that's not a power of two. So if the string length isn't a power of two, and the grammar is in CNF, which generates only strings of length 2^n, then it's immediately not derivable.\n\nWait, but I might be mistaken. Let me double-check: in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so starting from S, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. The derivation tree's leaves are the terminals, and each internal node has two children, so the number of terminals is 2^k for some k, but the length of the string is 2^k.\n\nWait, but I'm being told to derive the string using the grammar. So if the string length isn't a power of two, then it can't be generated by a grammar in CNF.\n\nLet me see: 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. 24 is in between. So 24 isn't a power of two, which suggests that the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should verify whether the number of terminal symbols in the string is a multiple of the number of terminals in the initial productions. Alternatively, perhaps it's possible through specific productions that allow for the string to have a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated as a combination of the different productions, each contributing to parts of the string.\n\nBut considering that in CNF, the number of steps needed to derive a string of n symbols is n-1, and each step doubles the number of symbols from non-terminals to two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). Wait, that might not be accurate. Actually, each production in CNF replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols, each of which is either a terminal or a non-terminal. So the total number of symbols can increase as 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., but the string must have a length that is a sum of such steps.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct either. The length of the string depends on the number of terminals in the derived string. Since each production in CNF either adds a terminal or two non-terminals, the total number of terminals at the end of a derivation is equal to the number of initial terminals at the start of the derivation times 2^{number of productions that produce a terminal}.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing this. Let me think differently: each time you use a production that replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (A \u2192 BC), you increase the number of symbols by one (from 1 to 2, then 2 to 3 if another non-terminal is replaced). But that's not correct either because each replacement replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to consider that the overall structure of a CNF grammar generates strings whose length is a sum of certain steps, but it's not strictly a power of two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the parse tree. The start symbol S has productions that each split into two non-terminals or terminals. Each non-terminal can further split, and so on. So the total number of leaves in the parse tree (i.e., the number of terminals) determines the length of the string.\n\nSince the given string has length 24, which is not a power of two, perhaps it's not possible for a grammar in CNF to generate it.\n\nWait, but wait: let's see, when starting with S:\n\nLevel 0: 1 symbol (S).\n\nLevel 1: Two symbols derived from S's production.\n\nLevel 2: Each of those two symbols can be non-terminals, leading to two each, so 4 symbols.\n\nLevel 3: 8 symbols.\n\nLevel 4: 16 symbols.\n\nLevel 5: 32 symbols.\n\nBut maybe the string is shorter, so perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar allows the string to end earlier by not splitting all the way down to leaves.\n\nWait, but in a derivation, every non-terminal has to be replaced until all symbols are terminals. So the number of symbols must be n, where n is 2^k for k steps.\n\nWait, that seems to suggest that 24, which is between 16 (2^4) and 32 (2^5), isn't a power of two, so the string of length 24 can't be generated by a grammar in CNF.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So if the string's length isn't a power of two, it's impossible for it to be generated by a grammar in Chomsky normal form where each production introduces two symbols.\n\nBut let me check: the given string has 24 tokens, so n=24, which is not a power of two. So the answer must be 'No', it's not possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me consider the initial productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12: which is length 2 (if both produce a terminal)\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT14: which is length 2\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT14: which is length 2\n\nSo if each of those produces a terminal pair, the entire string would be built from pairs that contribute two symbols each. Therefore, the total number of symbols would be a multiple of 2 starting from S. But in our case, the string is 24, which is even, but it's not a power of two.

{"custom_id":"request-475","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the string provided is generated by the given grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the string and see if it can be generated by this grammar. The input string is: \n\nt29 t82 t12 t19 t81 t66 t65 t73 t40 t12 t95 t12 t48 t39 t26 t40 t19 t61 t12 t53 t82 t53 t53.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are all the parts that end with a number, like t29, t12, etc. The non-terminals are everything else, like S, NT12, NT7, etc. The start symbol is S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols. So to parse the string, I might need to work backwards, starting from the start symbol S and expanding it step by step to see if it can generate the given string.\n\nLet's break down the grammar a bit. The start symbol S has three productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12 (but in the provided grammar, it's written as S -> NT12 NT12 ?? Wait, actually, in the user's message, the first line under the grammar is \"S -> NT12 NT12 NT8\", \"S -> NT7 NT14\", etc. Wait, no, the first line starts with \"Grammar: ```S -> NT12 NT12 NT8`\" which seems incorrect since CNF productions in CNF are binary, not ternary. Wait, maybe that's a typo. Let me check: \n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nGrammar: \nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nHmm, that can't be correct because in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Having three non-terminals in one production isn't allowed. So perhaps the user made a mistake when writing the grammar, and maybe those lines are not actual grammar rules but part of something else. Alternatively, perhaps the leading spaces are making it look like it's a code block with incorrect formatting. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, looking at the actual grammar lines, they are written as:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nNo, that's three non-terminals for one production, which would actually be a problem because CNF only allows two symbols. So perhaps the user messed up the initial part of the grammar. Maybe it's supposed to be S \u2192 NT12 NT8, but it's written as S -> NT12 NT12 NT8 by mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write the grammar correctly, but maybe in the initial part, it's written wrong.\n\nWait, the next lines are:\n\nNT9 -> NT11 NT11\nNT21 -> NT19 NT20\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\n...\nSo perhaps the initial part was a typo and the correct production for S should be NT12 NT8, because looking further down, NT12 is present as a production. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the first few lines, but it's hard to know for sure. Regardless, perhaps the initial step is confusing, and maybe it's better to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S productions are correct as written, but that would mean producing three non-terminals, which can't be right because in CNF, the start symbol can only produce two symbols. So perhaps the user's initial lines were incorrect, and maybe the S productions are different. But given that, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's grammar is actually correct, and the initial lines have a mistake, but perhaps it's better to proceed by looking at the other productions. Each symbol in the string is a terminal, so each must be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the terminals are:\n\nt29, t82, t12, t19, t81, t66, t65, t73, t40, t12, t95, t12, t48, t39, t26, t40, t19, t61, t12, t53, t82, t53, t53.\n\nThat's a lot of terminals. I need to see if there's a way to parse this string using the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar's terminal productions, I can see several:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nNT14 -> 't65'\n\nWait no, let's see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT12: NT17 NT8\n- NT16: NT16 NT4\n- NT3: several times, e.g., NT3->'t16', 't29', 't81', 't39', 't82', 't38', 't19', 't26', 't61', 't12', 't53', etc.\n\nWait, the grammar has several productions for NT3 that produce different terminals:\n\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n- NT3 -> 't66'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- And others produce more non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking through:\n\n- NT3 -> 't16' \u2192 that's one production\n- NT3 -> 't29' \u2192 another\n- NT3 -> 't81' \u2192 another\n- NT3 -> 't66' \u2192 another, but I don't know where 't66' comes from; maybe it's linked to other productions.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 has a production to 't39' and 't66'.\n\nLooking further down:\n\n- NT3 -> 't82' via NT15 -> NT82?\nWait, NT15 is a non-terminal that seems to point to 't82' from NT15\u2192't82'.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look for possible starting points.\n\nLet's see the first symbol in the string is 't29'. Looking at the grammar, where does 't29' come from?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16' (so maybe NT3 is used)\n- NT3 \u2192 't29'\n\nSo NT3 can produce 't29'. So maybe the first symbol comes from NT3.\n\nBut then the next symbol is 't82'.\n\nLooking at the grammar for where 't82' comes from:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't82'\n- NT5 \u2192 't66' (not useful)\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'? No, NT3 doesn't directly produce 't82' except through NT15.\n\nAlternatively, looking for where 't82' can be generated:\n\nThe production NT15 -> 't82' or NT3 \u2192 't82' via NT15.\n\nWait, yes, because NT3 \u2192 NT15 nt82? No, actually, NT3 has the production NT3 -> NT82? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe user's grammar includes:\n\nNT3 -> 't16', 't29', 't81', 't82'?\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nUnder the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't16'\nNT3 -> 't29'\nNT3 -> 't81'\nNT3 -> 't66'\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT5 -> 't66'\nNT15 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nWait, yes, in the grammar block, there is:\n\nNT3 -> 't82' \n\nSo NT3 can directly produce 't82'.\n\nSo perhaps the first part of the string is derived from NT3 \u2192 't29' followed by 't82'. So, the first two symbols are 't29' and 't82', which could be produced by NT3 \u2192 't29' (so NT3), then that same NT3 can produce 't82' directly.\n\nBut wait, each production in CNF replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols. So each step produces two symbols. So perhaps that's not how it works.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about the parse tree.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me write down the grammar rules and the string to analyze.\n\nThe grammar rules are a bit complex, so I'll list them systematically. But for brevity, I notice some rules like NT12 -> 't12', so those are terminals. The string provided consists of a series of these tokens like 't19', 't12', etc.\n\nThe given string is: `t19 t12 t43 t61 t29 t19 t81 t43 t16 t61 t16 t16 t53 t82 t82 t70 t77 t70 t82 t81 t61 t17 t66 t17 t61 t39`.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the start symbol S and try to derive the string step by step, maybe using a parsing strategy or looking for a way the non-terminals can produce the terminals in the string. Since the grammar is CNF, I can use the leftmost derivation method.\n\nLooking at the S rules:\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nI need to see if any of these can lead to the given string.\n\nFirst, let me see if the string starts with any of the terminals that could be from S.\n\nLooking at the string starting with 't19'. Let's see which non-terminals might produce 't19' terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- NT11 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT13 -> NT11 NT14\n- NT17 -> NT13 NT4 or NT11 NT12\n- NT19 -> NT1 NT2\n- NT21 -> various, but not sure about 't19'\n- NT others: some might produce terminals like 't19', 't29', etc.\n\nWait, looking for a non-terminal that can expand to 't19'. Scanning through the rules:\n\n- NT19 -> NT1 NT2. So to get 't19', maybe NT1 or NT2 produce it? Let's check the grammar for these.\n\nLooking at NT1 rules:\n- NT1 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT1 -> NT1 NT8\n- NT17 -> NT11 NT12\n- NT13 -> NT12 NT19\n- NT1 has several options.\n\nLooking at NT2 rules:\n- NT2 -> NT11 NT17\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT20\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT16\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT6 NT10\n- And others which produce terminals like 't19', 't20', etc. Wait, looking at NT2 rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> NT21 NT4\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT16\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT6 NT10\n- NT2 -> NT17 NT5\n- NT2 -> NT12 NT19\nWait, there's a rule NT2 -> NT12 NT19. Wait, that's not correct; let me check the original grammar. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nWait, looking back: For example, one rule is NT2 -> NT5 NT20, another is NT2 -> NT21 NT4, etc. Wait, is there a rule where NT2 expands into NT12 NT19? Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see that. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the user provided a lot of rules. Let me look for 't19'. For example, NT19 -> NT1 NT2. So NT19 can produce 't19' through NT1 and NT2, but wait, does NT1 or NT2 expand to a terminal?\n\nWait, no, because in the grammar, the rules are in CNF, so each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, looking for NT19, it's NT1 NT2. So to get 't19', either NT1 or NT2 must expand to a terminal followed by another terminal, but that might not be directly possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals can expand to 't19' terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT20 -> 't70'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT13 -> 't82' and other terminals like 't81', etc.\n- Wait, perhaps I should see which non-terminals directly produce 't19'.\n\nLooking at all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT19 -> NT1 NT2\n- So NT19 can produce two non-terminals. To get a terminal 't19', perhaps one of those non-terminals leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking at all the terminal rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly go to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT17 -> 't61', etc.\n\nWait, but 't19' isn't one of the direct terminals, so perhaps NT19 must be part of a larger derivation, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider which non-terminals directly produce 't19'.\n\nLooking through all the terminal production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't19' except perhaps in a longer expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace back from the string to see if any non-terminals can produce 't19 t12 t43...'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to see what the start symbol can generate. Let's see the options for S:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nLooking at these, maybe the string could come from one of these.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first option: S -> NT12 NT12.

From the rules provided:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see an NT12 -> NT16 NT8. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

That should make parsing easier, maybe a recursive descent approach could work here.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S. The grammar has multiple productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT12 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nWait, but when I look closer, the user wrote:\n\nWait the grammar as given is:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo each production starts with S \u2192 NT... So the first step is to see how the string starts.\n\nThe string starts with `t53`, which is a terminal. I need to find which production rule produces `t53`. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT10 (but t63 isn't t53)\n- NT4 \u2192 't65', 't17', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't39', 't66', 't82', 't66' again.\n- NT10 \u2192 't43', 't73', 't53'\nAh, yes! NT10 \u2192 't53'. So, the string starts with `t53`, which must come from NT10.\n\nSo the first part of the string is generated by NT10, which breaks down into two non-terminals. Let's see what NT10 produces. From the rules, I see NT10 \u2192 't43', 't73', or 't53'. So `t53` comes from NT10 \u2192 't53'.\n\nSo the first step is: S \u2192 NT_X NT_Y, and for the first token `t53`, it must come from one of the productions that starts with NT10, but looking at the S productions, S can only produce NT... So wait, the first production for S is S \u2192 NT12 NT12. Wait, that can't be right because the first token is `t53`, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Let me check again:\n\nWait the user provided the grammar with S having the productions:\n\n- S -> NT12 NT12\n\n- S -> NT7 NT14\n\n- S -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo S is always a combination of two non-terminals. So to produce `t53`, the first step must involve replacing S with something that includes NT10, but the given S productions don't directly include NT10. So perhaps NT10 is part of a larger chain.\n\nWait maybe I need to find a way to decompose the entire string step by step according to the grammar rules. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a parsing problem, trying to parse the string step by step to see if it can be fully matched.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each production in CNF is a single terminal or two non-terminals, so the parse tree must have each node (except the leaves) being a production of two non-terminals. So the string length should be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string length should be equal to the number of terminal symbols, which is the same as the string's length.\n\nLet me count the tokens in the string: \n\nt53 (1), t66 (2), t77 (3), t26 (4), t82 (5), t17 (6), t29 (7), t81 (8), t53 (9), t65 (10), t73 (11), t48 (12), t19 (13), t53 (14), t61 (15), t26 (16), t39 (17), t26 (18), t53 (19), t61 (20), t29 (21), t29 (22), t19 (23), t70 (24), t26 (25), t53 (26). \n\nSo 26 tokens. That's a pretty long string. Maybe it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's try to parse it.\n\nStarting with S. S has three productions: NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, NT9 NT12.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is t53. Which of these productions can produce a t53 as the first symbol?\n\nLooking at the non-terminals NT12, NT7, NT9, see which of their productions start with a terminal. For example, NT12 has:\n\nLooking back, I see that some NT12 productions:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8 (among others, but looking for which ones produce terminals).\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see several NT12 productions:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT19 (I think I saw that somewhere)\n\nWait no, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\n\nNT12 -> NT19 NT14\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, actually, looking line by line:\n\nLooking at the user's list:\n\nLine 3: S->NT12 NT12\n\nLine4: S->NT7NT14\n\nLine5: S->NT9 NT12\n\nThen:\n\nNT9-> NT11 NT11\n\nNT21-> NT19 NT20\n\nNT12-> NT17 NT8\n\nNT16-> NT16 NT4\n\nNT5-> NT17 NT4\n\nNT4-> NT4 NT7\n\nNT2-> NT11 NT17\n\nNT0-> NT6 NT10\n\nNT9-> NT6 NT9\n\nNT7-> NT2 NT11\n\nNT13-> NT11 NT14\n\nNT2-> NT5 NT20\n\nNT2-> NT7 NT16\n\nNT21-> NT17 NT5\n\nNT21-> NT17 NT3\n\nNT8-> NT4 NT20\n\nNT19-> NT1 NT2\n\nNT4-> NT11 NT20\n\nNT16-> NT7 NT20\n\nNT7-> NT7 NT12\n\nNT5-> NT13 NT7\n\nNT3-> NT14 NT5\n\nNT1-> NT14 NT6\n\nNT6-> NT2 NT10\n\nNT1-> NT1 NT8\n\nNT19-> NT11 NT4\n\nNT17-> NT13 NT4\n\nNT21-> NT8 NT13\n\nNT17-> NT6 NT6\n\nNT8-> NT15 NT19\n\nNT1-> NT1 NT9\n\nNT19-> NT11 NT4\n\nNT17-> NT11 NT12\n\nNT17-> NT20 NT17\n\nNT9-> NT6 NT16\n\nNT14-> NT4 NT0\n\nNT3-> NT5 NT14\n\nNT13-> NT12 NT19\n\nNT21-> NT11 NT9\n\nAnd some others.

{"custom_id":"request-516","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for the terminals, which are the leaves. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string. The string consists of a sequence of symbols: t77 t61 t81 t19 t29 t29 t26 t40 t61 t16 t82 t12 t82 t48 t73 t70 t16 t48 t17 t16 t48 t17 t73 t81 t29 t66 t73.\n\nI notice that many of these symbols are two-digit numbers, which probably represent terminals derived from non-terminals using the production rules. So, I should look at the productions to see if these numbers appear on the right-hand side of any rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't53' but wait, in the string, I see 't10'. Oh, maybe that's a mistake, or perhaps I should check all possible NT10 productions. Actually, checking the productions, I don't see NT10 on the right side; instead, NT3 is production 't81', and I don't see 't10' anywhere as a direct production. Hmm, that might be an issue, but let me check more thoroughly.\n\nWait, I see several 't's followed by numbers. Looking through the productions, for example:\n- NT12 -> 't12' is one, so that's fine.\n- NT10 is given as 't43', 't53', 't73', etc. So 't10' in the string must be produced by one of these NT10 rules. Looking back, in the productions, NT10 appears as 't43', 't53', 't73'. So 't10' isn't directly a production. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I notice that NT10 is followed by 't43' and other t's, but I don't see 't10' as a production. Maybe the string contains a typo, but I can proceed regardless, perhaps it's supposed to be another production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should map each terminal in the string to a production. Let's go through the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t77 t61 t81 t19 t29 t29 t26 t40 t61 t16 t82 t12 t82 t48 t73 t70 t16 t48 t17 t16 t48 t17 t73 t81 t29 t66 t73.\n\nEach of these terminals must be generated by some production in the grammar. So, for each terminal, I'll note which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals directly produced are:\n\n- NT9 -> 't77' (since NT9 -> NT6 NT9 and NT6 ->...'t77' is produced by NT6, I think. Wait, looking at the last part of the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't3'... Hmm, maybe I need to check all the terminals. Wait, there's a long list at the end, but it's cut off, so I can't see all of them, but I can refer back to the initial part.\n\nWait, the initial part shows that NT12 -> 't12', so that's one terminal. Similarly, NT10 is 't43', 't53', etc. Wait, maybe I should list all the terminals:\n\nFrom the given grammar, the right-hand sides include 't77', 't61', 't81', 't19', 't29', 't26', 't40', 't16', 't82', 't48', etc.\n\nSo each of these must correspond to a production rule where the non-terminal on the left produces a terminal.\n\nSo, the grammar seems to have many non-terminals that produce terminals like 't77', 't61', etc. So the string is composed of these terminals, which are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each step of the derivation is replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the derivation starts with S and replaces it step by step until only terminals remain, which form the string.\n\nHowever, with the given grammar and the string, it's complicated to build the entire parse tree. Instead, I can try to follow a bottom-up approach, starting from the string and trying to see if I can derive it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for sequences in the string that can be derived from the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't77'. Looking through the grammar, NT9's production is NT6 NT9, and in the rules, NT6 is sometimes 't3', but that's a guess. Alternatively, in the last part of the grammar, I see NT9 -> 't77'. Wait, the grammar doesn't list all, but let's check:\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar list, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT9 -> NT6 NT9\nNT6 -> NT21 NT4\nNT21 -> NT17 NT5\n... and so on, but also, in the end, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't17', 't20', etc.\nNT6 -> 't3'...\nWait, perhaps I can find the production rules that produce 't77', 't61', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, in the final part:\n\nNT9 -> 't77' (from the list at the end, \"NT9 -> NT6 NT9\")\nWait, perhaps I should list all terminals:\n\nFrom the given grammar, the right-hand sides include:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\nNT10 -> 't43', 't53', 't73'\nNT5 -> 't39', 't66'\nNT12 -> 't12'\nNT17 -> 't61'\nNT3 -> 't29'\nNT20 -> 't61', 't40', etc.\nNT13 -> 't29' (multiple times)\nNT15 -> 't82'\nNT10 -> 't73'\nNT4 -> 't17', 't20'\nNT9 -> 't77'\nNT21 -> 't61' (multiple times)\nNT8 -> 't48'\nNT19 -> 't41', 't48', 't57' (wait, not sure about this)\n NT17 -> 't61' etc.\n\nSo each of these terminals must come from some production.\n\nSo, for example, 't77' is produced by NT9, because in the last part of the grammar, NT9 -> 't77' (I think). Let me check:\n\nLooking at the last lines:\n\nNT9 -> NT6 NT9\n...\nNT6 -> NT21 NT4\n...\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nActually, looking through the provided grammar, at the very end, I see:\n\n\"NT17 -> 't61' NT16\nNT13 -> 't29' NT5\nNT21 -> 't61' NT5\nNT21 -> 't61' NT3\nNT8 -> 't48' NT20\nNT19 -> 't48' NT1\nNT17 -> 't61' NT12\nNT17 -> 't61' NT5\nNT7 -> 't77' NT0\nNT4 -> 't17' NT2\nNT21 -> 't82' NT5\nNT15 -> 't82' NT8\nNT7 -> 't77' NT19\nNT14 -> 't40' NT0\nOh, so here I see NT7 -> 't77' NT0. So 't77' is produced by NT7. Therefore, in the string, 't77' comes from NT7.\n\nBut looking at the production rules earlier, NT7 -> NT2 NT11. Then, looking further, NT2 and NT11 have their own productions. For example, NT2 -> NT11 NT17 and NT11 has multiple productions, including NT0 NT11. \n\nSo 't77' in the string implies that in the parse tree, there's a node labeled NT7, which produces 't77' and another non-terminal, let's say NT0. But wait, wait, if NT7 -> 't77' NT0, then NT0 must be processed as well. However, looking back, I don't see NT0 in the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-514","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember has specific rules, like each production being of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. I think that's correct because that's standard for Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice it's a bit extensive. There are many non-terminals (S, NT12, NT1, etc.) and terminals like 't95', 't12', etc. The string I need to evaluate is a series of these terminals in a particular order: \n\nt73 t29 t39 t65 t12 t29 t77 t77 t39 t16 t39 t77 t53 t29 t19 t77 t17 t12 t16 t73 t77 t65 t12 t17 t48 t40 t48.\n\nFirst, I should see if I can parse this string step by step using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production will generate either two terminals or two non-terminals, but in this case, the string is entirely terminals, so I think it means that eventually, all non-terminals will be expanded into terminals.\n\nThe initial symbol in the grammar is S, which is part of the first rule. I'll need to check if the entire string can be derived from S.\n\nLet me walk through the string. Each pair in the grammar corresponds to two non-terminals, I assume. So the first step is to see if the string can be divided into such pairs, but the string length is 26, which is an even number, so that's good. But I need to see how each production applies.\n\nThe first symbols are t73 and t29. Looking at the grammar, I remember that NT21 can produce t73 or other things, but let's check the productions for NT21. Wait, the productions for NT21 are: NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5, NT17 NT3, etc. Hmm, maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nWait, let's see. The string starts with t73, and looking at the grammar, NT20 \u2192 t48, but that's later in the string. Maybe I should think about the starting symbol S and see what it can produce.\n\nLooking at S's rules: S can produce NT12 NT14 or NT9 NT12, etc. So the first token would need to come from one of these non-terminals.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is to analyze each part of the string and see if it can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a tree or use memoization, but since the string is 26 tokens, it's manageable to check each split.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. The string is: t73 t29 t39 t65 t12 t29 ... t48 t40 t48.\n\nFirst, the entire string is 26 tokens. Since each production from a non-terminal either gives two non-terminals or a terminal, the derivation process will involve breaking the string into segments that match pairs of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but in CFGs, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals, so for a string to be generated, it must be a sequence where each part can be built by combining the left-hand sides of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the fact that each production corresponds to a way to split the string into parts.\n\nSince the initial symbol is S, the string must be split into a combination of the productions of S. Let's see S's rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\nS \u2192 NT9 NT15\n\nSo the string must start with one of these combinations. Let's check if the first two tokens match any of NT12, NT14, NT9, NT15, etc.\n\nLooking at NT14's productions, I see in the grammar that NT14 \u2192 T39 T4? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think I should find which terminals correspond to each NT.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar has lines like NT12 \u2192 T12, NT16 \u2192 T70, etc. So I need to map each NT to its terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t12\n- NT3 \u2192 t3?\nWait, for example, NT12 \u2192 T12, which is a single terminal. Similarly, NT16 \u2192 T70, etc. So each NT ultimately maps to a single terminal, and the non-terminals are built by combining other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but some NTs have productions that split into two non-terminals. For example, NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5 or NT17 NT3, etc. So a production like NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5 would split a segment into two smaller segments.\n\nSo to parse the string, we can recursively split it into parts that match the possible NT productions.\n\nBut the challenge is that each NT may expand into multiple possibilities, and the string is a sequence of terminals that must be generated by combining these splits.\n\nSo perhaps the way is to start from the beginning and see if the first tokens can be split into a combination that matches any of the S's productions.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I can look for a way to parse the string by trying to match possible NT pairs.\n\nLet's start by checking if the first two tokens can form a possible pair for any NT.\n\nFirst, the first two tokens are t73 and t29.\n\nLooking at the NT productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT9 (but that's NTT, not terminal)\nWait, perhaps I should find for any NT, does it have a terminal as the first symbol, and what NT splits to it?\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs have terminal productions. For example, NT12 \u2192 T12, which is not terminal but the string has T12 as a token, which is 't12' in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check which NTs produce T12, T29, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 T12 ('t12')\n- NT17 \u2192 T61 ('t61')\n- NT21 \u2192 T63 ('t63')\nWait, but looking through the grammar, some NTs produce terminals:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12' (line 87)\n- NT16 \u2192 't70' (line 88)\n- NT3 \u2192 't39' (line 108)\n- NT3 \u2192 't29' (line 14, maybe)\nWait, let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nThe grammar has multiple lines, so I need to search each for '\u2192' and the terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT3: Line 17: NT3 \u2192 NT13 NT2, line 22: NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5, NT5 \u2192 etc. Wait, perhaps I should list all NTs that have terminal productions.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-539","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t81 t17 t70 t48 t29 t26 t39 t81 t40 t40 t70 t39 t73 t95 t29 t61 t26 t77 t61 t26 t40 t53 t82 t16 t81 t40 t53 t77`.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this structure, with various non-terminals and terminals.\n\nI notice that some of the non-terminals have productions that directly map to terminals, like NT12 \u2192 't12'. These are like base cases in the grammar and will correspond to the literals in the target string.\n\nLooking at the string, I see that it's a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if this string can be derived by applying the grammar's productions step by step. \n\nI think about how to approach this: perhaps I can try to parse the string using the grammar. Another approach is to see if the string can be generated from the start symbol S, expanding non-terminals until all symbols are terminals.\n\nThe string has 32 symbols, so it's a bit long. I can start by trying to see which non-terminals can produce parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't81', I see that NT5 \u2192 't39', NT3 \u2192 't26', and others lead to 't29', 't61', etc. But none directly start with 't81', wait\u2014looking back, I see NT17 \u2192 't61' and NT3 \u2192 't16', but that doesn't help. Oh wait, wait, the grammar has NT15 \u2192 't82', and NT3 \u2192 't16', but I don't see 't81' directly. Let me check the productions.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, I see NT15 \u2192 't82', and other NTs. Hmm, maybe I'm overlooking something. Let me check the productions again. Oh, wait, I see NT13 \u2192 't29', NT3 \u2192 't16', but that still doesn't help. Wait, perhaps the starting point is S, which branches into NT12 and NT8, each being terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the initial productions, S can go to NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. So S \u2192 NT12 NT12. Let's see what NT12 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT12, it has several productions: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8, and NT12 \u2192 't12'. Oh, so it can produce either 't12' or something else. But in the string, the first symbol is 't81', so maybe S goes through another branch.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The initial productions are S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, and S \u2192 NT9 NT12. So S must expand into two non-terminals, each possibly leading to more production.\n\nWait, let's break down the initial step. S can be replaced by a pair of non-terminals. So for each step, we'll have a string that's a concatenation of the replaced symbols.\n\nLet's try to see if the string can start with 't81'. Let's find which non-terminals produce 't81'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT3 \u2192 't16' and 't81' under certain conditions. Wait, looking back, I notice that NT3 has the following productions: NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14 (which eventually leads to 't66' and 't16'), and also NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT0. Wait, perhaps I'm missing where 't81' is derived.\n\nWait, looking again, I see in the grammar that NT3 has several productions, but none directly produce 't81'. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me go through the productions more carefully.\n\nWait, I see that NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT5, but that's recursion, not helpful for terminals. Wait, perhaps in another part of the grammar.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm missing a production. Wait, let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT12 has 't12', 't70' from NT16, etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 't61', NT13 \u2192 't29', NT3 \u2192 't16', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm focusing on the wrong part. Maybe I should construct the parse tree for the string step by step, expanding non-terminals until all leaves are terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to consider the string as a series of steps where each symbol in the string is generated by some non-terminal, and ensure that each step follows the production rules.\n\nLet me look at the first symbol in the string: 't81'. So the derivation must eventually produce 't81'. I need to find a way for 't81' to be a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't29' and 't16', but I don't see 't81' directly. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a production elsewhere.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the grammar again, I notice that some non-terminals might produce 't81' when combined through their own productions.\n\nFor example, NT17 \u2192 't61', NT13 \u2192 't29', etc. But where does 't81' come from? Let me check all the produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all the '\u2192 a' productions:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT8 \u2192 't48'\n- NT21 \u2192 't82'\n- NT7 \u2192 't77' (from NT17 \u2192 't61', NT13 \u2192 't29' etc. Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see that NT7 has production NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11. But that's a non-terminal, not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production that results in 't81'. Or maybe 't81' is a terminal, but I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't81' except maybe in the strings.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for chains of non-terminals leading to 't81'. Let me check if any non-terminal can produce 't81'.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12', 't70' (from NT17)\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', 't81'? Wait, looking back, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the productions.\n\nWait, wait, I see that NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14. Let me check what NT14 does. Looking for NT14:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't40', 't0' (Wait, 't0' is 't40'? No, looking at the grammar, I see NT14 \u2192 't40'. Oh, perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, no, the list shows NT14 \u2192 't40' and 't40' again, but wait, looking again:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't40' (multiple times)\n- NT7 \u2192 't77' via NT17 \u2192 't61', but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production for 't81'. Alternatively, maybe 't81' is a non-terminal, but that can't be because the string contains 't81' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps 't81' is derived from a non-terminal that eventually produces that terminal. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly or indirectly produces 't81' as a terminal. Hmm, that's confusing because the string includes 't81' which I think should be part of the grammar.\n\nWait, let's check the productions again. Maybe I'm missing it. Looking back through all the productions, perhaps in another part.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't61'\n- NT21 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16' (multiple times)\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT12 \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

First, I'll try to understand the grammar's structure and see if there's a way to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. Looking at the start symbol S, it's connected to combinations of NTs. Let me list the rules for S:\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo S can generate strings based on these combinations. Now, looking at the string provided: t43 t82 t95 t16 t65 t73 t70 t53 t43 t81 t77 t39 t66 t82 t40 t29 t81 t73 t66 t17 t16 t17 t65 t40 t82 t17 t19 t95.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a series of t's followed by numbers. Each token seems to be a terminal symbol, so I need to see if these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should check if the grammar can generate the terminals present in the string. Let's look for any NTs that might produce these tokens.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several NTs with rules that produce specific terminals:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't53', 't73', 't43', 't10'.\n- NT4 \u2192 't65', 't17', 't4'.\n- NT3 \u2192 't29', 't39', 't16', 't20', 't82', 't95', 't66'.\n- NT8 \u2192 't48', 't15', 't20'.\n- NT14 \u2192 't4', 't0', 't12'.\n- NT12 \u2192 't12', 't95'.\n- NT5 \u2192 't39', 't66'.\n- NT9 \u2192 't77', 't77' again (but that's a repeat, maybe an error). Wait, in the grammar, NT9 has two rules: NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9 and NT9 \u2192 NT12 NT15.\n\nHmm, I think I should try to see if the string can be built by tracing back through the grammar rules. Let's try to parse the string from the start.\n\nThe string starts with 't43 t82 t95 t16...'. Let's see if these can be derived from someNT.\n\nLooking for 't43', which is produced by NT10 (t43). So maybe the first part of the string is from NT10. Let me check the production rules for NT10:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8 or NT43? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, NT10's rules are written as:\n\nNT10 -> 't10' 't73' 't53'? Wait no, looking again, the rule for NT10 is:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\nNT10 -> NT16 NT8,\nNT10 -> 't53',\nNT10 -> 't73',\nNT10 -> 't43'.\n\nSo NT10 can produce t43, t53, t73, or a combination of NT16 and NT8.\n\nSo the first 't43' could come from NT10's rule. But then, after that, the next token is 't82'. Let's see if 't82' is from NT10. Looking at NT10->'t53','t73','t43', but no 't82'. Wait, does any NT produce 't82'? Yes, NT3 and NT15 both have rules with 't82'.\n\nWait, but I'm considering the start symbol S, which is built from NTs, so perhaps the initial production is S\u2192NT12 NT12, S\u2192NT7 NT14, or S\u2192NT9 NT12.\n\nWait, let's try building the string step by step. Maybe it's easier to approach it as a parsing problem, trying to see if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the number of steps needed to derive a string of length n is n-1. But given the size of the string, that's not practical.\n\nAnother approach: let's see if each token in the string can be matched by some rule, and check if the sequence is consistent.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\n1. t43\n2. t82\n3. t95\n4. t16\n5. t65\n6. t73\n7. t70\n8. t53\n9. t43\n10. t81\n11. t77\n12. t39\n13. t66\n14. t82\n15. t40\n16. t29\n17. t81\n18. t73\n19. t66\n20. t17\n21. t16\n22. t17\n23. t65\n24. t40\n25. t82\n26. t17\n27. t19\n28. t95\n\nWow, that's quite a list. Let's see.\n\nI'll start from the beginning. The first token is t43. From NT10's rules, NT10 \u2192 t43, so maybe the first NT10 produces t43.\n\nNext, the second token is t82. Let's see if t82 can come from another NT. Looking through the grammar, NT3 and NT15 produce t82.\n\nWait, let's see if the production S\u2192NT12 NT12 can produce t43 t82... Let's explore that.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT12 NT12, then the first NT12 could produce t43, and the second NT12 could produce t82. But let's check what NT12 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT12's rules:\nNT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\nNT12 \u2192 NT95 (t95 is a terminal)\nWait, looking back, I see:\nNT12 \u2192 NT12 (t95). Wait no, the rule is NT12 \u2192 't12'? Wait, wait, no, it's written as:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\nNT12 -> 't12' (maybe that's a rule, but in the given grammar, I notice:\n\nLooking through all the rules, for example, one rule is NT12 \u2192 't12', another is NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT12's other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I misformatted the rules. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nFrom the grammar provided, here's the relevant part for NT12:\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT95 (Assuming 't12' is 't95' or maybe a typo; wait, actually, looking back, the line is written as 'NT12->'t12'', which is likely a terminal 't12', but perhaps a different token. Wait, no, I need to check.\n\nWait, perhaps the line is \"NT12 -> NT17 NT8\" and others.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the provided grammar for NT12 and other NTs.\n\nHere's the entire list again, searching for 't' tokens to see which NTs produce them:\n\nFor NT10: 't53', 't73', 't43' are terminals.\nNT3: 't29', 't39', 't16', 't20', 't82', 't40', etc.\nNT12: 't12', 't95' perhaps?

{"custom_id":"request-555","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the productions.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t66 t16 t66 t61 t61 t16 t39 t77 t82 t61 t70 t26 t65 t16 t29 t53 t17 t82 t17 t16 t77 t48 t66 t81 t82 t12 t12 t40 t53`.\n\nI notice that each word is a terminal symbol (like 't66', 't16', etc.), which suggests that the entire string is composed of terminal symbols, no non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals or terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminal strings directly. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12', NT10 \u2192 't53', etc. So, any occurrence of these letters in the string must correspond to a production rule where that non-terminal expands directly to a terminals.\n\nI'll go through the string step by step, trying to see if each part can be matched by a production.\n\n1. The first token is 't66'. Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't66'? Let me scan the productions for terminal symbols. Yes, NT9 \u2192 't77' and NT4 \u2192 't17', but that's not 66. Wait, looking again, I see NT5 \u2192 't39', NT10 \u2192 't53', NT12 \u2192 't12', etc. Hmm, checking NT17: from the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, NT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19, etc. So, perhaps NT19 which is used early. Alternatively, checking the token 't66'\u2014looking through all the rules, I see NT3 \u2192 't16', NT3 \u2192 't29', NT3 \u2192 't40', NT3 \u2192 't48', NT3 \u2192 't53', but I don't see NT3 \u2192 't66'. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let's check again. In the grammar, I see 'NT3 -> 't16'...', 't16' is another token, but where does 't66' come from?\n\nWait, looking again, NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8, and NT21 has some rules. Also, in the grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 't66'\u2014no, wait: actually, it says NT5 -> 't39', but then other NT's: NT3 appears to have multiple productions like 't16', 't29', etc. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT16 -> 't70', NT20 -> 't65', NT10 -> 't53', NT12 -> 't12', etc. But I'm not seeing NT15 \u2192 't82' which is present, but that's not what we're looking for. So 't66' is a terminal symbol, so it must come directly from a non-terminal that produces 't66'. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 many productions: NT1 -> NT1 NT8, etc., but nothing to 't66'.\n- NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT21 and others.\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14, etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9.\n- NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4.\n- NT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4 and others.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT11 NT20, etc.\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'.\n- NT15 \u2192 't82'.\n- NT7 \u2192 't77'.\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'.\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'.\n- NT8 \u2192 't48'.\n- NT2 \u2192 various productions, some to terminals.\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't66'. Let me check NT15: from the grammar, it's 't82', so that's not it. What about NT20? It's 't65'. So 't66' must be produced by a non-terminal. But in the given grammar, I don't see a production for a non-terminal that directly produces 't66'. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Scanning through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking down the list:\n\n- NT3 has several productions: NT3 -> 't16', 't29', 't40', 't48', 't53', 't66'? Wait, yes, I see 'NT3 -> 't66'\u2014so that's correct. So NT3 \u2192 't66'. So that's good.\n\nSo the first word is 't66', which is produced by NT3. Then, the next word is 't16'. Looking for a production after that.\n\nThe string is: t66 t16 t66 t61 t61 t16 t39 t77 t82 t61 t70 t26 t65 t16 t29 t53 t17 t82 t17 t16 t77 t48 t66 t81 t82 t12 t12 t40 t53.\n\nSo after 't66' (NT3), the next is 't16'. So we need to see how 't16' can be generated. Looking at NT16: NT16 -> 't70', so maybe it's part of a longer production. Alternatively, perhaps NT6 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, another approach: we can try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nLet me start:\n\nThe string starts with 't66', which is generated by NT3.\n\nSo, NT3 -> 't66'.\n\nNow, looking at the next token 't16'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't16' directly. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', etc. But in this case, after 't66', the next is 't16', but NT3 is already used. So maybe another non-terminal produces 't16'.\n\nLooking again, perhaps NT16 \u2192 't70', so not directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the next token is generated by a production involving NT16, but it's a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe looking at NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, and NT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19, etc. So maybe a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't16' is generated by NT17 or some other non-terminal. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a non-terminal called NT17, which has productions NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, and perhaps eventually produces a terminal. For example, if NT13 produces something that eventually leads to 't16', or if NT4 produces something.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't66' comes 't16', which would need to come from a direct or indirect expansion. Since 't66' comes from NT3, and the next is 't16', maybe NT16 is involved in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't16' is produced by NT16, but NT16 \u2192 't70' which is a terminal, so that can only produce 't70'. So that's not possible. So where else?\n\nWait, maybe the 't16' comes from a longer production, like NT17 \u2192 ... which then reduces to 't16'? Let me check NT17's productions.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4 and NT5 \u2192 't66', etc. Wait, no, wait: NT17's productions are:\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\nNT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19\nNT17 \u2192 NT20 NT17\nNT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12\nSo perhaps NT17 can go further down. Let's see if it can expand to 't16'.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19\nNT12 \u2192 't12' and NT19 \u2192 NT11 NT4\nNT11 \u2192 some rules, like NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT11, which would be 't40' perhaps.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's easier to approach this by building the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\n1. t66\n2. t16\n3. t66\n4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-551","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which might produce terminals directly. Wait, but looking at the rules, some non-terminals can produce two other non-terminals, and some can produce terminals. So I guess the grammar allows both possibilities.\n\nThe string we're given is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. Let me look at it: `t77 t16 t77 t73 t39 t70 t12 t61 t39 t66 t77 t16 t81 t61 t61 t70 t48 t29 t95 t77 t16 t29 t77 t17 t82 t77 t95 t43 t40`.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse this string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. Parsing this could involve building a parse tree or using some kind of recursive descent approach. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, maybe there's a way to traverse the string and check if it can be broken down into subparts that each match the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list out the symbols in order to see any familiar sequences. The string starts with t77, which I notice appears a few times. Looking at the grammar rules, NT13 and NT9 have production rules that generate t82 or t12, but I don't see t77 being a terminal on the right-hand side. Wait, actually, looking closely, I see that NT1 -> 't19', NT3 -> 't16', NT5 -> 't39', and so on. But I don't see 't77' as a terminal in any of the production rules. Hold on, maybe I missed it. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT17 -> 't61', NT21 -> 't82', NT12 is a terminal 't12', etc. Wait, but nowhere do I see 't77' being a terminal. Hmm, that's confusing because the string includes 't77' multiple times. Did I misread the grammar?\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar starts with S -> NT12 NT12, but also other options. Looking for terminals, I see 't77' as part of the string, but in the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal becomes 't77'. So does that mean that 't77' is not part of the grammar's terminal symbols, which would imply that the string contains a symbol that the grammar doesn't recognize, making the string impossible to generate?\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some of the rules produce terminals like 't77' must not be a terminal because I don't see a production rule that has it. For example, looking through all the rules, I see NT9 -> 't77' is not a production; instead, NT9 -> NT11 NT11. So 't77' isn't a terminal in this grammar. Therefore, the string must have at least one symbol that isn't produced by any rule, which would make it invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread. Let me double-check. Looking through each production, I see:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\nNT9 -> 't77'? No, NT9 is a non-terminal, it's NT9 -> NT6 NT9. So 't77' is not a terminal in this grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because it contains symbols not allowed by the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait again. Maybe I'm missing something.

The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That makes parsing potentially easier because it's more structured. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t53 t82 t26 t73 t40 t43 t39 t19 t81 t82 t65 t95 t61 t16 t16 t43 t12 t53 t39 t73 t66 t12 t19 t16 t66 t53 t16 t65 t70 t81`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to approach this. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step in the derivation adds exactly one production. Each non-terminal A -> BC expands a symbol, so I can think of the string as being built up by substituting non-terminals step by step until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nI think the best way is to try to build a parse tree from the given string upwards to see if it can be reduced to the start symbol S. Alternatively, I can start from S and see if the string can be generated. Since the string is quite long, maybe the latter approach isn't feasible manually, but perhaps I can find patterns or key points in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce certain 't' strings, like 't53' is produced by NT10, 't82' by NT15, etc. So perhaps the string is built by substituting these.\n\nLet me note down the immediate productions that produce the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT10 -> 't53' (but wait, in the grammar, I see NT10 -> 't43' and NT5 -> 't39', etc.)\n\nWait, let me check each production for the terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT10 -> 't53' (from the 25th rule)\n- NT20 -> 't65' (from the 8th rule)\n- NT12 -> 't12' (from the 17th rule)\n- NT16 -> 't70' (from the 14th rule)\n- NT13 -> 't82' (from the 9th rule)\n- NT3 -> 't16' (from the 25th rule)\n- NT3 -> 't29' (from the 33rd rule)\n- NT5 -> 't66' (from the 39th rule)\n- NT15 -> 't82' (from the 45th and 46th rules)\n- NT10 -> 't43' (from the 26th rule)\n- NT4 -> 't17' (from the 42nd rule)\n- NT9 -> 't77' (from the 40th rule)\n- NT17 -> 't61' (from the 34th rule)\n- NT11 -> 't95' (from the 2nd rule)\n- NT2 -> 't53' (from the 11th rule) \u2014 wait, no, NT2 here is 11th rule: NT2 -> 't53'\n- NT19 -> 't19' (from the 19th rule)\n- NT7 -> 't73' (from the 30th rule)\n- NT8 -> 't48' (from the 24th rule)\n- NT14 -> 't43' (from the 36th rule)\n- NT20 -> 't26' (from the 20th rule)\n- NT3 -> 't81' (from the 43rd, 50th, and 52nd rules)\n- NT1 -> 't19' (from the 9th rule)\n- NT9 -> 't40' (from the 35th rule)\n- NT7 -> 't40' (from the 41st rule)\n- Others produce more non-terminals.\n\nLooking back at the string, let's list all the terminals:\n\nt53, t82, t26, t73, t40, t43, t39, t19, t81, t82, t65, t95, t61, t16, t16, t43, t12, t53, t39, t73, t66, t12, t19, t16, t66, t53, t16, t65, t70, t81.\n\nSo let's see if I can find a starting point. Let's look for high-level terminals that might be produced by root non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t53. From the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't53'?\n\nFrom above, I think NT10 -> 't53' (rule 25) and NT2 -> 't53' (rule 11). Let's check other terminals: 't82' is produced by NT13 (rule9) and NT15 (rules45,46). 't26' is from NT20 (rule20). 't73' is from NT7 (rule30). 't40' is from NT7 (rule41), NT5 (rule39 is 't66', but wait, perhaps no. Wait, NT7 -> 't73' (rule30), and NT5 -> 't66'? Wait, in the grammar at the very end, there are multiple rules for NT5. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at NT5, there are multiple productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39' (rule18)\n- NT5 -> 't66' (rule29)\n- Wait, I must have miscounted earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar is written with multiple rules for each non-terminal. Let me go through each part carefully.\n\nThe grammar has a lot of rules, so perhaps it's better to list all rules that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12' (rule17)\n- NT16 -> 't70' (rule14)\n- NT3 -> 't16' (rule25)\n- NT3 -> 't29' (rule33)\n- NT5 -> 't66' (rule29)\n- NT15 -> 't82' (rules45 and 46)\n- NT10 -> 't53' (rule25)\n- NT20 -> 't65' (rule8)\n- NT10 -> 't43' (rule26)\n- NT4 -> 't17' (rule42)\n- NT9 -> 't77' (rule40)\n- NT17 -> 't61' (rule34)\n- NT11 -> 't95' (rule2)\n- NT2 -> 't53' (rule11)\n- NT19 -> 't19' (rule19)\n- NT7 -> 't73' (rule30)\n- NT5 -> 't39' (rule18)\n- NT9 -> 't40' (rule39 is 't66'; wait, no.

The string has 30 tokens. Since each step in the derivation adds a symbol, but in CNF each production adds one non-terminal, I think the minimal length of the string would be 2^k where k is the number of steps. But this might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of multiple productions. Maybe I can try to see if the string can be broken into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to try building the string step by step from the start.\n\nWait, looking at the first part: t53, t82, t26, t73...\n\nFrom the grammar, let's see: the start symbol is S, which can go to several options. Let's see what options are available for S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has three productions:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12 (option1)\n2. S -> NT7 NT14 (option2)\n3.

Hmm, this looks a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has the left-hand side as a single non-terminal and the right-hand side as either two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol can only directly produce two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar provided, I see that S is the start symbol and it has multiple productions, each with two non-terminals except maybe the ones that end up generating terminals. Wait, actually, the first production is S -> NT12 NT12, so S can produce two NT12 symbols. Then each NT12 can produce NT17 and NT8, and so on.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each symbol in the string must be derived from a terminal production. Let me look at the string and see if each 't' followed by numbers corresponds to any terminal in the grammar. Wait, looking through the productions, I notice that some like NT12 might produce 't12', NT10 produces 't53', NT5 produces 't39', etc. So each terminal in the string should have a corresponding production rule in the grammar that can generate it.\n\nWait, but actually, I think the terminals in the string are multi-character because they're like 't73', but in the grammar, the productions only generate single terminals, like 't12' or 't53'. So I need to check if each part of the string can be generated by the grammar. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me check: looking at the grammar, some non-terminals are assigned to single terminals, like NT12 -> 't12', NT10 -> 't53', NT4 -> 't17', etc. But in the string, I see 't73', which is a different terminal. So no production rule seems to directly produce 't73'. Wait, is 't73' perhaps a typo? Or is it a combination of two numbers?\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string correctly. Let me list out each token: t73, t16, t29, t19, t29, t61, t29, t81, t95, t26, t95, t39, t81, t43, t16, t16, t39, t12, t43, t61, t82, t81, t16, t77, t70, t61, t95, t19, t26, t53.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, I see NT20 -> 't65', NT10 -> 't53', NT7 -> 't77', etc. But there's no production for 't73'. So that's a problem because 't73' would have to be a generated terminal, but none of the non-terminals seem to produce it. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the terminals in the grammar. Looking through the production rules, I see that some terminals are defined, like NT12 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't65', NT3 -> 't16', etc. But I don't see 't73' being generated by any production.\n\nWait, so if the string contains 't73', and the grammar doesn't have a production that results in 't73', then the string cannot be generated by the grammar. That would mean the answer is 'No'. But let me make sure I'm not overlooking something. Maybe there's a production that indirectly leads to 't73' through a chain. Let me check the grammar's productions again:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any that directly generate 't73'. The closest is NT21 -> 't82' and NT20 -> 't65'. Wait, perhaps through some combination, but since each production step must generate a terminal or two non-terminals, I don't think you can produce a two-character terminal like 't73' directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the terminals. In the string, each token is a separate terminal, right? So each 't' followed by two digits is a separate terminal symbol. So for example, 't73' is a single terminal. But in the grammar, no non-terminal directly produces 't73'. So unless there's a way for a non-terminal to split into two terminals such as 't7' and '3' or something, but that doesn't make sense because the grammar only splits into non-terminals or single terminals. For example, in the grammar, NT12 -> 't12', which produces 't' followed by 12, but maybe that's a three-character string, which would be 'tt12'? No, I think in the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So 't12' would be a single terminal, but in the string, 't12' is a separate token. Wait, but in the string, 't12' appears as a single token, so in the grammar, there is a production NT12 -> 't12', so that's okay.\n\nWait, but if NT12 can produce 't12', then that token is allowed. So in the string, I have 't73', which if it's a terminal, then it needs to be produced by some non-terminal. But none of the productions in the grammar produce 't73'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains a terminal that the grammar doesn't generate. So the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each of these non-terminals then eventually must produce terminal symbols, but the exact path isn't immediately clear.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t39 t40 t65 t48 t65 t43 t77 t43 t17 t77 t82 t12 t48 t43 t82 t66 t82 t26 t29 t66 t40 t81 t39 t26 t43 t61 t48 t77 t26 t29 t95`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. So, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. The grammar has several productions that directly map non-terminals to these terminals, so perhaps the string can be traced back step by step through the grammar.\n\nI should list out the possible production rules that lead to each terminal in the string, then see if there's a path from the start symbol S to the entire string using these productions.\n\nLet me start by looking for the leftmost and rightmost symbols in the string to see how they might be generated.\n\nThe first symbol is 't39'. Looking at the grammar, there's a production NT9 -> NT6 NT9. Additionally, in the grammar, there's NT4 -> 't17', but that's not directly matching 't39'. Wait, actually, I see in the grammar that NT5 -> 't39'. So, NT5 produces 't39'.\n\nSo, the first token 't39' must come from NT5. Therefore, in the grammar, NT5 must be part of the leftmost derivation. Looking at the productions for NT5: NT5 -> NT13 NT7, and also NT5 -> 't39' at some point. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has several NT5 productions. Wait, actually, looking more carefully, the grammar has:\n\nNT5 -> NT13 NT7\n\nBut wait, I think I might have misread the grammar. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nWait, I see that at the end of the grammar, there's a line that says: NT5 -> 't39'. So, yes, NT5 has a production that directly outputs 't39'. That's a crucial point. So, 't39' can be generated by NT5.\n\nNow, how does NT5 get derived? Let's look at the productions for NT5:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\nNT5 -> NT13 NT7\n\nand \n\nNT5 -> 't39'\n\nSo, NT5 can be either 't39' directly, or it can split into NT13 and NT7. But since our first symbol is 't39', that suggests that NT5 must directly produce it, right? Or is there another production that allows this? Wait, no, because in a CFG, each non-terminal must have a production that can generate the terminal. So, if the start symbol can generate a string that eventually reduces to the given string, then it's valid.\n\nBut let's think step by step. The first symbol is 't39', which comes from NT5. So, the production must be NT5 -> 't39'. So, that's a step from NT5 to 't39'.\n\nNow, the next symbol is 't40'. After 't39', the next is 't40'. We need to see how these tokens are connected. But wait, if NT5 directly produces 't39', then after that, perhaps another non-terminal is produced, but in this case, since 't39' is the first symbol, then the next symbol must come from another production in the same step? Maybe not, because each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals if using a production that splits into two. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the token after 't39' is part of the same non-terminal. Wait, let me think: The string is a sequence of tokens. So, in the grammar, each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal in the grammar. So, each token in the string must be generated by some term production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree from the bottom up, or maybe look for the leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is at most two non-terminals. So, each step of the derivation either splits a non-terminal into two, or produces two terminals.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, any production is A -> BC, but if B and C can produce terminals, then you can have steps where a single non-terminal is replaced by two terminals. So, each production can be applied until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nGiven that, let's see the string: 't39 t40 t65 t48 t65 t43 ...' and so on.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. Let's list them:\n\n1. t39\n2. t40\n3. t65\n4. t48\n5. t65\n6. t43\n7. t77\n8. t43\n9. t17\n10. t77\n11. t82\n12. t12\n13. t48\n14. t43\n15. t82\n16. t66\n17. t82\n18. t26\n19. t29\n20. t66\n21. t40\n22. t81\n23. t39\n24. t26\n25. t43\n26. t61\n27. t48\n28. t77\n29. t26\n30. t29\n31. t95\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, which are two non-terminals. So, the overall structure is that the start symbol S would expand into a series of non-terminals that eventually produce the terminals in the string.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's easier to reverse-engineer the string, working from the end to see if each symbol can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a string of terminals, we can try to match the entire string by seeing if there's a way for the start symbol to generate it.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is 't39'. From the grammar, we have a production NT5 -> 't39'. So, the first symbol must come from NT5. Therefore, in the leftmost derivation, the first step is S -> ... -> NT5 ...something... to produce 't39'.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, S has several productions:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, after S is expanded into one of these, each of those non-terminals must produce the rest of the string.\n\nWait, so maybe S first expands into NT12 and NT12, or NT7 and NT14, or NT9 and NT12. Then each of these non-terminals, in turn, must produce the rest of the string.\n\nBut the string starts with 't39', which comes from NT5, not NT12. So, that suggests that perhaps the first expansion is NT9 into NT12 and NT something else?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list for each non-terminal what terminals they can produce. For example, NT5 can produce 't39'. NT4 can produce 't17', etc. So, perhaps the string can be broken down into segments that correspond to non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be represented as a series of splits from the start, each non-terminal potentially splitting into smaller parts until only terminals remain.\n\nWait, I might need to look at this more systematically. Let's try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt39 t40 t65 t48 t65 t43 t77 t43 t17 t77 t82 t12 t48 t43 t82 t66 t82 t26 t29 t66 t40 t81 t39 t26 t43 t6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-584","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's in the language defined by the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. From what I can see, the start symbol is S, and the productions are all in the form A \u2192 BC, which is typical for Chomsky normal form. Each production has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. \n\nLooking at the productions, I can see that a lot of them are terminating with terminal symbols, like 't48', 't16', etc. For example, NT12 -> 't12', which is a terminal. So the grammar seems to build up strings of these terminal symbols.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t48 t16 t70 t16 t29 t43 t16 t65 t26 t82 t61 t40 t73 t82 t16 t43 t29 t26 t65 t73 t16 t29 t81 t39 t43 t43 t53 t66 t17 t48 t17`.\n\nSo, the plan is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, we can use either the recursive descent method or the CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, CYK might be more efficient, but it's complicated. Maybe I'll try to break it down into smaller parts.\n\nI'll start by seeing which non-terminals produce which terminals. For example, NT12 -> t12, which is a single terminal. Similarly, other non-terminals like NT4, NT20, etc., have terminals. So, the strings generated by the grammar will consist of these terminals in a certain order, dictated by the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at S, the start symbol. The productions from S are all of the form S \u2192 NTX NTY, where NTX and NTY are non-terminals. So every production rule of S leads to two non-terminals which eventually produce strings of terminals.\n\nLet's take the first production: S \u2192 NT12 NT12. Since NT12 -> t12, so concatenating them gives 't12 t12'. Similarly, the second production is S \u2192 NT7 NT14. NT7 I need to check what it produces.\n\nWait, NT7 has multiple productions. Let me list out NT7's productions:\n\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT11\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT16\n- NT7 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT7\n\nHmm, this could get tricky. Maybe I can build a parse tree, but it's going to be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nBut this might take a long time. Another approach is to see if each part of the string can be matched by the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into segments that correspond to certain productions.\n\nAnother thought: since most of the non-terminals eventually produce single terminals, maybe the grammar is a straight line, meaning each step produces exactly one terminal or a combination that doesn't branch. But looking at the grammar, it seems to have multiple productions and possible cycles, so it's more complex.\n\nWait, maybe I can check the start symbol S and each production of S. Since every production of S leads to two non-terminals, and each of those might have their own productions, the total length of the string should be a power of 2 related to the number of productions, but in this case, the string length seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar can generate any combination of terminals, but perhaps the order is constrained. Let me think about how the grammar builds the string.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the fact that each production of S gives a certain starting pair. For example, S can produce NT12 NT12, which starts with t12 t12, or NT7 NT14, which starts with t something t something else, etc. The first symbol in the string is t48, which doesn't show up in any of S's first two symbols from the production rules.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first symbol is t48. Let me check if any production of S can lead to t48. Since all S productions are of the form NTX NTY. So, NTX and NTY must produce t48 in some way.\n\nLooking at the NTX's that can produce t48: checking the grammar, I see that NT48 is not a non-terminal. Wait, the grammar only goes up to S. So perhaps I should check each non-terminal that directly produces t48.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT4: t17\n- NT8: t48\n- NT1: t19\n- NT9: various, like t77\n- NT17: t61, etc.\n- NT3: t16, t39, etc.\n- NT0: t40\n- Others like NT4, NT8, etc.\n\nAh, so NT8 produces 't48'. So perhaps in one of the productions of a non-terminal, NT8 is involved.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce NT8 as one of their symbols? For example:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT17 -> NT4 NT20. If NT20 can produce t48, then NT17 would produce 't48'.\n\nLooking up NT20: NT20 has multiple productions. Checking each:\n\n- NT20 -> NT10 NT3\n- NT20 -> NT14 NT21\n- NT20 -> NT10 NT3\n- NT20 -> NT3 NT21\n- NT20 -> NT10 NT3\n- etc.\n\nWait, none of these directly produce a terminal, except maybe in some cases. Wait, I need to check if any of these can eventually produce t48.\n\nLooking deeper, NT10 has productions like NT10 -> 't53', 't73', 't43', etc. For example, NT10 -> 't43' in one place. So NT10 can produce t43.\n\nNow, looking back, NT20 -> NT10 NT3. So if one of these is t43, and NT3 can produce t48, then perhaps NT20 can produce a sequence that includes t43 and t48.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions, I see NT3 -> 't16', 't29', etc. Wait, is there a way for NT3 to produce 't48'? I'm not seeing that. Let me check the NT3 productions:\n\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT14\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT0\n- NT3 -> NT4 NT20\n- etc.\n\nHmm, none of these directly produce 't48'. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe there's a longer path where multiple steps produce t48. For example, through NT20 -> NT10 NT3, and if NT10 can produce t43, and NT3 can produce t45, but I don't see NT3 producing t48 directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if any non-terminal that starts with t48 is the result of a production. Since NT8 produces t48, then perhaps a non-terminal that has NT8 as one of its produced terminals would be part of the string.\n\nWait, another approach: let's try to see how 't48' is produced. It's produced by NT8. So, in the parse tree, there must be a production that leads to NT8, which must be part of a production of a higher non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce NT8? Let me see:\n\n- NT8 has a production NT8 -> NT19 NT15\n- Wait, but NT19 is another non-terminal. Does NT19 produce anything? Let me check.\n\nLooking for NT19 in the productions: NT19 -> NT1 NT2. So NT19 is produced from NT1 and NT2. NT1 and NT2 need to produce something to eventually get to NT8.\n\nWait, this might be getting too complicated. Maybe I'll try a different approach. Let's consider the entire string as a series of steps and see if each part can be divided into segments that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and I'm more concerned with the initial parts. Wait, the string starts with t48, which is produced by NT8. So the first step would be NT8, which comes from NT19 NT15. So let's see.\n\nBut to get NT8, we need to have a production that includes NT8. However, NT8 doesn't produce itself. Instead, NT8 -> NT19 NT15, which are other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me reconstruct: the production rules, for example, S -> NT12 NT12, which would immediately produce 't12 t12'.

{"custom_id":"request-591","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is pretty complex, with a bunch of production rules. The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens like 't39', 't53', etc.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific properties. Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. Looking at the given grammar, most of the rules are of the form NT -> something, but I notice rules like NT12 -> 't12', which are terminals. So that makes sense in CNF.\n\nThe string provided is a series of terminals, each in the format 'tXX'. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule with terminals on the right-hand side contributes one terminal at a time during expansion. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are either two non-terminals or one terminal. So when generating the string, each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols that could be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut actually, the productions can produce sequences of terminals, depending on how they expand. For example, S can go to NT12 NT12, which then could expand further. Each NT (non-terminal) can be replaced with two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string is built by expanding symbols step by step until all are terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can treat the grammar as a context-free grammar and use a top-down or bottom-up parsing approach. But since the string is quite long, maybe I should look for patterns or try to find a way to break it down.\n\nWait, let me look at the string: \n\nt39 t53 t48 t43 t17 t81 t65 t40 t77 t73 t19 t66 t77 t77 t26 t82 t53 t66 t43 t43 t65 t82 t77 t61 t43 t29 t26 t26 t82 t29 t70 t65.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens, and each is a terminal.

Wait, I see multiple rules:\n\nLooking closer, the grammar includes:\n\nNT20 \u2192 t65\nNT6 \u2192 t3 NT21\nWait, I see a few rules where NT12 \u2192 't12', etc. So, for example:\n\nNT12 \u2192 t12\nNT3 \u2192 t16\nNT5 \u2192 t39\nNT9 \u2192 t77\nNT10 \u2192 t73\nNT5 \u2192 t82\nNT10 \u2192 t43? Because I see NT10 \u2192 t43. So maybe some of these are terminals.\n\nHmm, so the string includes t39, t53, etc. Let's see:\n\n- t39: Looking at the grammar, NT5 \u2192 t39, because I see a rule NT5 \u2192 t39.\n- t53: Hmm, NT4 \u2192 t53? Because looking through the rules, I don't immediately see NT53, but checking the rules, I see NT13 \u2192 t82, etc. Wait, perhaps NT21 has a rule that includes 't53'. Let me check: in the rules, I don't see 't53' directly, but wait, I see NT20 \u2192 t65, and other rules, maybe. Alternatively, maybe NT12 produces 't12', NT9 \u2192 t77, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or one terminal. So the string must be derivable by successively replacing non-terminals with other symbols until only terminals remain.\n\nEach step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So for a string of length n, the derivation must have (2^n -1) steps because each non-terminal expands into two symbols, but this is more applicable for binary trees. However, with a string of length 30, that's a lot, so maybe an alternative approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol S, following the production rules. But since the string is a flat list, I probably need to see if it can be built up correctly.\n\nMaybe I should build a parse tree for the string. But manually doing that for 30 tokens would be tedious. So perhaps I can look for certain patterns or key tokens that must come from specific non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t39. From the grammar, I see that NT5 \u2192 t39. So one possibility is that the string starts with NT5, which could then divide into two symbols, perhaps another non-terminal and a terminal, but wait, wait: in the grammar, all rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for NT5, the only rule is NT5 \u2192 t39 (I see in the rules: looking again, I see \"NT5 -> t39\" in the grammar provided.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I see several rules for NT5:\n\nLooking at the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> t39\n- NT5 -> t82\n\nWait, actually, yes, that's correct. Looking at the list:\n\nNT5:\n\n\"NT5 -> NT17 NT4\"\n\nWait, hold on: Let's go through the grammar rules to find where NT5 appears. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT5 \u2192 t82 (Wait, no, actually, in the provided rules, I think only NT5 \u2192 t39 is present. Let me check each line:\n\nNo, looking through the rules, I think the correct ones are:\n\nLooking for \"NT5\", I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT5 \u2192 t82\n\nWait, no, in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> NT17 NT4\n- NT5 -> t39\n- NT5 -> t82?

{"custom_id":"request-596","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string, and I need to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. The string I have is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to understand how it's structured. The grammar starts with S, which can produce different combinations of other non-terminals. For example, S can become NT12 NT12, or NT8 NT14, etc. Each of these is a combination of two non-terminals, following Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the process involves expanding these non-terminals and seeing if they can derive down to terminals to form the given string.\n\nLooking at the string to be analyzed: `t82 t61 t16 t48 t48 t95 t16 t77 t77 t65 t61 t48 t26 t66 t81 t82 t65 t61 t81 t82 t82 t16 t43 t48 t70 t70 t39 t61 t61 t53 t29 t12`.\n\nThis is a list of 33 tokens. I notice some tokens appear multiple times, like t82, t61, t16, etc. I think each of these terminal symbols must correspond to a production in the grammar. So, my task is to see if combining these tokens through the grammar rules can produce this sequence.\n\nI'll start by looking at the end of the string to backtrack how the derivation might happen. Starting from the last token, t12. Looking at the grammar, I see S can produce NT12 NT8, but t12 is a terminal. So, I should check if there's a production for NT12 that produces t12. Looking through the rules, I find NT12 -> 't12', which is straightforward. So, t12 comes directly from NT12.\n\nNext, the token before t12 is t41, but wait, looking again, the string is a list, so before t12 is t53 from the string list. Wait, let me parse the string correctly. Let me write it out:\n\n`t82 t61 t16 t48 t48 t95 t16 t77 t77 t65 t61 t48 t26 t66 t81 t82 t65 t61 t81 t82 t82 t16 t43 t48 t70 t70 t39 t61 t61 t53 t29 t12`\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me number them for clarity:\n\n1: t82\n2: t61\n3: t16\n4: t48\n5: t48\n6: t95\n7: t16\n8: t77\n9: t77\n10: t65\n11: t61\n12: t48\n13: t26\n14: t66\n15: t81\n16: t82\n17: t65\n18: t61\n19: t81\n20: t82\n21: t82\n22: t16\n23: t43\n24: t48\n25: t70\n26: t70\n27: t39\n28: t61\n29: t61\n30: t53\n31: t29\n32: t12\n\nWait, that's 32 tokens, not 33. So the last token is t12. So working backwards:\n\n32: t12 comes from NT12. Now, looking back in the string, the token before t12 is t53 (token 30). Wait, no: token 29 is t61, token 30 is t61, 31 is t53, 32 is t29, 33 is t12. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me index correctly:\n\nLet me reindex from 0 for easier handling:\n\n0: t82\n1: t61\n2: t16\n3: t48\n4: t48\n5: t95\n6: t16\n7: t77\n8: t77\n9: t65\n10: t61\n11: t48\n12: t26\n13: t66\n14: t81\n15: t82\n16: t65\n17: t61\n18: t81\n19: t82\n20: t82\n21: t16\n22: t43\n23: t48\n24: t70\n25: t70\n26: t39\n27: t61\n28: t61\n29: t53\n30: t29\n31: t12\n\nSo, the string has 32 tokens, indexed from 0 to 31.\n\nI'll start from the end:\n\nToken 31: t12 comes from NT12. So, the last rule is S -> NT12 NT8, where the NT12 part produces t12, and the other part is NT8. Now, looking at NT8's production: check if the grammar has a production for NT8 that can produce t29, t48, etc.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT8 has multiple productions. For example, NT8 -> 't48', 't70', 't15', etc. So, one possible production is NT8 -> t48, which is in position 11 and 3 in the string. Let me check where t48 appears: tokens 3, 4, 11, 19, 20, 23.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building a parse tree from the start symbol S and see if the sequence can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the possible paths the string can take through the grammar. Since the string is quite long, I should look for patterns or known sequences that might fit.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that NT12 can produce t12 directly, and NT16 can produce t70. Also, NT14 can produce t65, etc.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be viewed as a sequence of valid NT expansions that lead to terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nToken 0: t82. So, we need a production that can derive t82. Looking for NT where production includes t82. Scanning through, I see NT15 -> t82, and NT5 -> t82, etc. But we need to see how NT15 or other relevant NTs can be derived.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, maybe I should list all the possible terminals and their corresponding NTs.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT12 -> t12\n- NT16 -> t70\n- NT3 -> t16\n- NT3 -> t29\n- NT5 -> t39\n- NT15 -> t65\n- NT8 -> t48\n- NT9 -> t77\n- NT4 -> t65\n- NT20 -> t65\n- NT21 -> t81\n- NT6 -> t26\n- NT6 -> t66\n- NT5 -> t53? Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nThe rules for NT5: One of them is NT5 -> NT17 NT4, another is NT5 -> NT13 NT7. Then there are lines like NT1 -> NT5 NT2, etc. I think I need a better approach.\n\nPerhaps it's better to construct a mapping of NTs to their possible terminals or further expansions.\n\nBut maybe instead of writing all that, I should look for patterns in the string. For instance, if the string contains \"t82 t65 t65\", that might correspond to S -> NT12 NT12, then each NT12 is t12, but t82 appears only once, so perhaps that's a different path.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, S can produce NT12 NT12, which would be t12 twice, but t82 is once in the string. So that might not fit.\n\nAnother thought: since the string starts with t82, let's see what NTs derive t82.

So perhaps it's generated via a longer path.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nSince the string consists of only terminals, I need to see if sequences of NT production rules can derive it from S.\n\nLooking at S's possible expansions:\n\nS can be NT12 NT12, which is 't12' and 't12' if both NT12 produce t12.\n\nAlternatively, S can be NT7 NT14, which would be 't70' and 't48'?

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, but I should focus on the right-hand sides because the left-hand sides are just non-terminals. Let's look at the string: it's a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, starting with t66, then t95, t17, etc. \n\nFirst, I notice that the string consists of tokens like t66, t29, t39, etc., which might correspond directly to the terminals in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce specific terminals. For instance, NT12 -> 't12', NT4 -> 't65', and others that produce various txx. \n\nThe string starts with t66. Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT15 -> 't82' and NT9 -> 't77', but where does t66 come from? Wait, I see NT3 -> 't16', NT3 (from another rule) -> 't29', NT5 -> 't66'. There's also NT17 producing certain things, but I'm not sure. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check: NT5 has two productions, NT5 -> NT17 NT4 and NT5 -> NT15 NT4. Also, NT4 -> 't65' and NT3 -> 't16'. Wait, no, NT3 has other productions too. Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking for 't66': yes, NT5 -> 't66'. So, 't66' could come from production NT5. But in the grammar, NT5 has two production rules: NT5 -> NT17 NT4 and NT5 -> NT15 NT4. Oh, but NT4 isn't a terminal; NT4 -> 't67'... wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT4 -> 't65'\u2014oh wait, no! Let me check again.\n\nWait, here are the productions for NT4: NT4 -> NT11 NT20, NT4 -> 't65', and also NT4 -> 't17'. Wait, no\u2014that can't be right because in context-free grammars, each rule is a production, so NT4 can produce NT11 NT20, or 't65', or NT4 and NT2. Wait, no, actually looking at the grammar, I see NT4 has five productions:\n\nNT4 -> NT11 NT20\n\nNT4 -> NT17 NT2\n\nNT4 -> NT11 NT5\n\nNT4 -> NT15 NT20\n\nNT4 -> 't65'\n\nWait, that's five. So, 't66' isn't directly a production. Wait, no, I think I might have miscounted. Looking again, yes, NT5 can produce 't66'\u2014that's correct. So, the first token in the string is 't66', which would need to come from NT5.\n\nSo, the first part is NT5 -> 't66'. Now, the next token is 't95'. Let's see where 't95' comes from. Looking through the grammar, NT12 -> 't12', but there's an NT12 in one of the rules as 't12'. So that's not 't95'. Wait, looking further, I don't see any NT rule producing 't95' except possibly NT12. Wait, no\u2014NT12 is 't12', so that's not it. Wait, maybe NT12 is 't12'? No, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I missed it. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT rule for 't95'. Wait, I see NT17 has some rules, but looking, NT17 has productions to NT13 NT4, etc., but nothing directly giving 't95'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me double-check all the rules. Let me list out the NT rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nNT4 -> 't65'\n\nNT3 has some, but not 't95'\n\nLooking, I don't see any NT rule that directly produce 't95'. So perhaps 't95' isn't among the terminals in the grammar. Wait, that can't be right because the string given has 't95', so maybe I missed it. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nLooking for \"t95\": no, wait, the grammar as presented doesn't have any production where NT12 is 't95', because NT12 is 't12'. So, the first two tokens are 't66' and 't95'. If neither of the NTs produce 't95', then the string can't be generated. Therefore, immediately, the string can't be generated, because we have a 't95' token which isn't a terminal in the grammar. So, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let's see, perhaps an NT rule produces 't95' indirectly. For example, maybe NT12 can produce something else that then reduces to 't95', but in the given grammar, NT12 is directly 't12', not anything else. Similarly, other NTs like NT9, NT17, etc., don't seem to produce 't95'. So yes, the presence of 't95' in the string means it can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Perhaps 't95' comes from a combination of NTs that ultimately produce that symbol, but looking at the rules, it's not there. So, I think the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, for each NT20 production:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3: if NT10 and NT3 derive to terminals, then NT20 can produce 't53' (from NT10) and 't39' (from NT3). Wait, no: if a production is A \u2192 B C, the result is the concatenation of B and C's strings. So, to produce a terminal string, one of them must derive to a terminal, and the other must derive to a terminal string. But in Chomsky normal form, each step produces exactly one non-terminal or a terminal. So, perhaps in some cases, NT20 could produce a pair of terminals if both B and C are terminals. Wait, but looking at the grammar, the terminals are only the specific 't' strings. So, each 't' corresponds to a production.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to map which non-terminals directly produce which terminals and then see how the string can be broken down.\n\nSo, let's list all the non-terminals that can directly produce a terminal:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\nNT10 \u2192 't53'\nNT4 \u2192 't65'\nNT20 \u2192 't65' (twice, from NT20 \u2192 NT4 NT26 etc.\u2014maybe I'm getting confused here)\nWait, no, looking back, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't65' as a terminal?

This helps because it limits the possible structures of the strings that can be generated, making it easier to parse using CYK algorithm or by tracking the possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it has several productions:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, the start symbol S can only produce strings that consist of two parts derived from any of these combinations. The string we're checking starts with `t95`, which I notice is directly produced by the production NT12 -> 't95'. So the first part of the string must come from NT12.\n\nSince the first part is 't95', which comes from NT12, then the next symbols must come from the production of NT12. Let's check what NT12 produces:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT12 has the production NT12 -> NT17 NT8. So after 't95', we should have a sequence generated by NT17 followed by NT8.\n\nNow, 't73' is next, but I need to check if NT17 can produce 't73'. However, in the grammar, I don't see any production that directly gives 't73'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again.\n\nAh, searching the productions for NT17: NT17 has both NT13 and NT5 on the left, and production rules like NT17 -> NT7 NT20 and NT17 -> NT11 NT12. So NT17 can produce two non-terminals, which in turn might produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should backtrack and see what each NT can produce. Let's outline the possible productions for each NT.\n\nStarting with NT12:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\n\nThen NT17 can go to NT7 NT20 or NT11 NT12. If we take NT17 -> NT7 NT20, then NT7 and NT20 will have their own productions.\n\nNT7 has NT7 -> NT7 NT12 or NT5 NT2. Wait, NT7 can produce NT7 NT12, which is recursive. Alternatively, NT7 can produce NT5 NT2.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't95' (NT12) is 't73'. So perhaps NT17 produces 't73' somehow.\n\nWait, let me check the terminals. The string has 't73' so I need to see if any NT production can derive 't73'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I see that NT12 -> 't95', which we've used. Then, for example:\n\nNT3 -> 't29', NT5 -> 't39', etc. Wait, 't73' doesn't immediately show up as a terminal in any production.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check all the terminals in the string to see if they are produced by the NTs. Let me list each terminal and see where they come from:\n\nt95: from NT12\nt73: Need to find which NT produces 't73'. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't73' except possibly through longer chains.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to find a path that leads to 't73'. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice NT12 is 't95'. NT17 can produce 't61' via NT17 -> NT11 NT12, right? Because NT11 -> 't61' doesn't seem correct. Wait, no, looking again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT17 has a production NT17 -> NT11 NT12. But in the string, after 't95 t73', which is 't95' (from NT12) and 't73' (unknown production). Let me check if any NT can produce 't73'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I don't see any NT directly producing 't73' as a terminal. So that's a problem. If the grammar doesn't have a production that directly outputs 't73', then the string cannot be derived because it would require a NT that branches into something that eventually produces 't73', which may not be possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me check all the NT productions for terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT12 -> 't95', NT5 -> 't39', NT4 -> 't65', NT8 -> 't48', NT7 -> 't61', NT3 -> 't29', NT17-> 't61', etc. Hmm, I don't see 't73' as a terminal. \n\nWait, but I see `t73` is present in the string, so how can that be? Unless it's produced by some NT combining two terminals. But in the grammar, it's only the right-hand sides of the productions, so unless some combination of non-terminals can reach 't73'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to see if it's possible through the right-derivations. But maybe I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this with the CYK algorithm. It's probably the most reliable method for checking if a string is generated by a CNF grammar.\n\nSo, the string is: t95 t73 t39 t66 t17 t65 t48 t81 t73 t29 t81 t29 t48 t65 t17 t66 t73 t26 t70 t17 t16 t77 t19 t66 t29 t53 t61 t12 t12 t39 t77 t29 t77 t82\n\nThat's 34 tokens. So the length is 34, which implies the structure could be complex. But I'll need to try applying the CYK algorithm.\n\nFirst, set up the table with 34 columns and 34 rows. Each cell CYC[i][j] corresponds to the non-terminals that can generate the substring from position i to j.\n\nI start by initializing each CYC[i][i] to the NTs that directly produce the i-th terminal.\n\nLooking at the first token t95: which NTs produce t95? From the grammar, only NT12 does: NT12 -> 't95'.\n\nSo CYC[0][0] = NT12.\n\nNext, the second token t73: looking for NTs that produce t73. But I don't see any NT directly producing t73 in the given productions. The productions either have two terminals or non-terminals. So if t73 is a terminal, and no NT directly produces it, then the string cannot be generated. Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the grammar as provided.\n\nWait, let's double-check the grammar:\n\nI see a production NT3 -> 't29', but no NT producing t73. So unless t73 is derived through some combination of non-terminals, it can't appear. Therefore, unless there's a production chain that leads to t73, the string has a terminal that can't be derived, which would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps t73 is being output by some combination of NTs. Maybe it's inside another production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the provided grammar produces only certain terminals, and t73 isn't among them. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nSo, the answer would be 'No' because the string contains t73, which isn't present in any production as a terminal, meaning it's impossible for t73 to appear in the string derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, but in the given production list, I don't see any NT (Non-Terminal) that directly or indirectly leads to t73 as a terminal. So the string contains a terminal 't73' that can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side.

The productions for S are:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT14 NT2\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, wait, actually, the first lines are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the initial productions. Let me double-check. Oh, no, the first three S productions are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the initial S productions are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, the start symbol S can expand into two non-terminals, each of which can further expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar more carefully, the right-hand sides of the productions are combinations of NTs ending with lowercase letters, and some of these NTs have terminals as their productions, like NT12 -> 't12', etc.\n\nSo, first step: Identify what each non-terminal (NT) can produce.\n\nFor example, NT12 can produce 't12', NT7 can produce 't73' or other options, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar rules:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\nBut wait, let's check all NT expansions.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT productions that result in terminals:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12' (Line: NT12 -> 't12')\n- NT20 -> 't26' (Line: NT20 -> 't26')\n- NT8 -> 't48' (Line: NT8 -> 't48')\n- NT9 -> 't53' (Line: NT9 -> 't53')\n- NT7 -> 't77' (Line: NT7 -> 't77') I think.

Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT -> 't53'\n\nFound: NT9 -> 't53' (from line: NT9 -> 't53').\n\nSo, in the first step, the string must start with 't53' which comes from NT9.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce NT9 and NT12.\n\nSo, the first production could be S -> NT9 NT12.\n\nSo, first part: 't53' would come from NT9.\n\nSo, the next step is after 't53' comes part of NT9's expansion.\n\nNT9 has several productions, but one is NT9 -> NT6 NT9 (line: NT9 -> NT6 NT9) and another is NT9 -> NT2 NT5 (line: NT9 -> NT2 NT5), and another is NT9 -> NT12 NT15 (line: NT9 -> NT12 NT15), and also NT9 -> NT10 NT15 (line: NT9 -> NT10 NT15). Additionally, NT9 can produce 't53' as a terminal.\n\nBut wait, given that the grammar uses CNF, each rule's right-hand side is two non-terminals. So, NT9 can be expanded into two non-terminals. Wait, but in our case, the string starts with 't53', which is a terminal, so that requires NT9 to produce 't53' directly. So, that would be T, so the first production would be S -> NT9 NT12, where NT9 expands to 't53'.\n\nSo, after that, the next token should come from NT12.\n\nIn the string, after 't53' comes 't65'. So, the next part is 't65'.\n\nLooking at NT12's productions, we have NT12 -> 't12', which is a terminal. So, but we need to get 't65' next. So, perhaps the production of NT12 must be through some non-terminal chain leading to 't65'.\n\nLooking at NT12's productions: Let's list all NT12 rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules for NT12:\n\nNT12 -> 't12' (line: NT12 -> 't12')\n\nAnd other rules where NT12 is on the left and has other non-terminals on the right.

{"custom_id":"request-645","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing, I think. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar consists of several production rules. The start symbol is S, and it can produce different combinations of non-terminals. For example, S -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, and so on. Each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which is typical for CNF.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: the string is a sequence of symbols like 't77', 't65', etc. Some of these are non-terminals, and some are terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal on the left, and on the right, there are zero, one, or two non-terminals. Terminals are the atomic symbols that cannot be broken down further.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, all the productions on the right have two non-terminals, except maybe I need to check again. No, every production has exactly two non-terminals on the right. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others. So this suggests that the string should be composed of non-terminals that eventually derive into terminals.\n\nBut in the string, some symbols are terminals, and others are non-terminals. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar seems to have all non-terminals being replaced by other non-terminals except for some that have terminals. For example, I see rules like NT12 -> 't12', which is a terminal. So, 't77' might be a terminal or a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, many of the non-terminals have productions that result in terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't12', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT9 -> 't77', which is a terminal. So in the string, these terminals are part of the string, and the derivation must replace the start symbol S through a series of productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals. So each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal derived from the grammar.\n\nBut wait, the string has symbols like 't77', 't65', etc. I need to see if each of these corresponds to a terminal that can be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, I notice that many of the NT rules produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\nNT7 -> 't61' in one rule and 't77' in another\nNT9 -> 't77', 't95', etc.\nNT4 -> 't65' etc.\n\nSo each terminal in the string must be produced by one of these NT rules.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string: t77, t65, t16, t26, t95, t39, t26, t29, t95, t39, t12, t70, t70, t82, t16, t61, t81, t53, t82, t16, t17, t17, t82, t77, t95, t12, t26, t19, t12, t48, t81, t66, t12, t43, t53, t81.\n\nWait, but I think I need to parse the string correctly. Let me split the string into individual tokens. The string is:\n\nt77 t65 t16 t26 t95 t39 t26 t29 t95 t39 t12 t70 t70 t82 t16 t61 t81 t53 t82 t16 t17 t17 t82 t77 t95 t12 t26 t19 t12 t48 t81 t66 t12 t43 t53 t81.\n\nNow, the goal is to check whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it according to the grammar's production rules until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, resulting in this exact string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the derivation starts with S and, at each step, replaces a non-terminal with two others until all symbols are terminals.\n\nThe key here is to check if each terminal in the string can be matched by expanding the non-terminals according to the grammar. Also, the structure of the string must match the sequence of productions.\n\nSince this is a potentially long string, I need a systematic way to approach this. One approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse context-free grammars efficiently. However, since I might not remember all the details of the CYK algorithm, I can think through the process.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each terminal is present in the grammar and then attempt to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nFirst, let's check each terminal to ensure it's a terminal in the grammar. From the grammar rules, it looks like the terminals are the two-digit strings like 't12', 't65', etc. So the string provided consists of such terminals. That's good because it means they are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nNow, the problem is to see if the sequence of terminals can be generated by the grammar. Since each production produces two non-terminals, every step in the derivation increases the length by one (since each non-terminal replaced adds one more symbol). The start symbol S can produce two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can split further.\n\nThe length of the string is 34 terminals. Since each production step doubles the number of symbols, starting from 1 (S), then 2, 4, 8, etc. But that might not be directly applicable here because the string length is not a power of two. Hmm, wait, no. Because the grammar can have multiple rules, the length can vary, but in our case, we're given a specific string. So the number of steps in the derivation should result in 34 non-terminals, but since each production replaces one non-terminal with two, the length increases by one each time. So starting from S, a single non-terminal, the length after each expansion is 1, 2, 3, 4,... So for 34 symbols, we would need 33 expansions. That seems plausible, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.\n\nInstead, perhaps a better approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be associated with a production in the grammar and then check the structure.\n\nAnother thought is to see if the string can be represented as a leftmost derivation. That is, starting from S, we replace the leftmost non-terminal in each step until all non-terminals are replaced.\n\nBut the string provided is a sequence of terminals, so each terminal must come from a terminal production. Therefore, we can traverse the string from left to right, checking if each terminal can be reached via the grammar, and ensuring that the structure makes sense.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can model the entire process step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to check if the grammar can generate the string by analyzing the possible steps.\n\nI realize this might be time-consuming, but let me try to proceed.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol in the string: 't77'. In the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't77'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 -> NT6 NT9 (which is a production with non-terminals, but eventually leads to terminals) and NT9 -> NT2 NT11, etc. Wait, no, the direct productions where a non-terminal becomes a terminal.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT14 (wait, no, NT14 produces 't65' etc.)\n\nWait, let's list all non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\nNT7 -> 't61', 't77', 't82'\nNT9 -> 't77', 't95', 't12', etc.\nNT4 -> 't65', 't17' etc.\nNT20 -> 't65', 't26', 't19', etc.\nNT5 -> 't39', 't66', etc.\nNT1 -> 't19', 't17', etc.\nNT2 -> 't11', 't17', etc.\nNT0 -> 't40', 't16', etc.\nAnd some others produce 't' followed by other numbers.\n\nWait, I think I can find 't77' as a terminal produced by NT7 and NT9.

{"custom_id":"request-650","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string we need to evaluate. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the production rules because they might help me figure out how the string can be derived. The grammars use several non-terminals like S, NT12, NT7, etc., but some seem to have specific terminal assignments. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12', NT10 \u2192 't53', and some others directly expand to specific terminals. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: 't66 t43 t81 t12 t66 t39 t81 t65 t82 t19 t16 t12 t29 t29 t61 t39 t73 t61 t65 t61 t40 t95 t26 t66 t12 t29 t70 t40 t26 t17 t43 t70 t82 t12 t43 t73'.\n\nI notice that many of these are terminals like 't66', 't43', etc. So my first thought is to see if the non-terminals can connect these terminals according to the grammar rules.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into parts and see if each part can be matched to a production rule or a combination of rules that chain together to form the string.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: 't66', 't43', 't81', 't12', etc. Checking the grammar, I see that NT12 \u2192 't12', which is the first token. But how do the others connect?\n\nLooking at the production S \u2192 NT12 NT12, which would be 't12 t12', but the string starts with 't66 t43...', which doesn't match. So S seems to generate combinations of other non-terminals. \n\nWait, maybe S isn't the start symbol? No, the grammar says S is the start symbol. So S must derive the entire string. Let me see what S can produce.\n\nLooking at the S rules: S can produce NT12 -> 't12' or NT7 \u2192 't77', or NT9 \u2192 't77'? Wait, earlier I saw NT12 is 't12', but looking back, the grammar rules, I don't see NT12 directly mapping to 't12', unless it's in the rules I might have missed. Hmm, wait in the rules, I do see NT12 \u2192 't12' and a production for NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So maybe that's a chain.\n\nWait, but in the initial rules for the grammar, under NT12, it's actually two productions: one is NT12 \u2192 't12', and another is NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So, which one do I use? If the string starts with t66, which is not t12, perhaps I need to figure out how to get that. \n\nWait, let me list more accurately the production rules from the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal assignments are:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT4 \u2192 't17'\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16'\n- NT3 \u2192 't29' (twice)\n- NT5 \u2192 't66'\n- NT5 \u2192 't69' (oops, maybe I misread. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see:\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT4\nNT5 \u2192 't39'\nNT4 \u2192 't65'\nWait, no, looking again: NT5 -> NT15 NT4, NT5 -> 't39', and NT4 -> 't65'? No, wait I think I might have misseen earlier. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the user provided a large list of productions, some with terminals and others non-terminals. For example, looking for key terminals:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't77' (if I recall correctly from an earlier part, but upon rechecking I think I might have been mistaken.

Wait, perhaps I should parse the grammar more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is a context-free grammar, I can try to apply the productions step by step to see if the string can be generated.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't66'. So perhaps the S or some non-terminal produces 't66' or a rule that leads to it.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12, which would produce 't12 t12'\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14, which produces something else\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nBut none of these start with 't66' immediately, unless some non-terminals connect to it via rules.\n\nWait, the terminal 't66' is a production rule for NT5 -> 't66'. So is there a way to get NT5 to be part of the string?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps there's a non-terminal that can derive 't66' as a sequence of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps NT5 can expand into other non-terminals that lead to t66.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT5: NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT4, but that doesn't lead to t66 immediately. Alternatively, looking for a production where NT5 can expand, but maybe it can through other steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for t66 elsewhere. Wait, in the grammar, I do see NT5 \u2192 't66', which is a direct production, so maybe a chain leads to t66.\n\nWait, let me see which non-terminals can expand into 't66':\n\nNT5 can directly produce 't66'. So to get 't66' in the string, perhaps the derivation starts with a non-terminal that can produce 't66', which is NT5.\n\nSo perhaps the first step is to have NT5 at the start. But wait, the start symbol is S, not a non-terminal like NT5. So perhaps S must be expanded into NT5 followed by something else? Let me check S's productions:\n\nS's productions are:\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo S can't directly produce NT5. Unless some of the other non-terminals can break down into NT5.\n\nWait, perhaps NT12 can produce 't12' when needed, but that's t12, not t66. But maybe NT5 is reachable from another non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to parse the given string backward. Maybe the last token is 't73', which could be NT10 \u2192 't53'? Wait, in the grammar, NT10 \u2192 't53'? No, wait, in the provided rules, I see NT10 \u2192 't53' and NT10 \u2192 't73' (twice? Let me check again).\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't53' (twice)\n- NT10 \u2192 't73' (twice)\n\nSo 't7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It looks like the grammar is made up of non-terminals (like S, NT9, NT2, etc.) that eventually expand into terminals, which are these 't' strings with numbers. The given string is a sequence of these terminals, so my job is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce NT12 NT8, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. Each of these NTs then breaks down into other NTs until we get to the terminals. So, the string starts with t70, which is a terminal\u2014looking back at the rules, t70 is derived from NT16. Let me check the rules:\n\n- NT16 -> NT7 NT20\n- NT7 -> NT7 NT12\n- NT20 -> NT10 NT3\n- NT10 -> 't43' and NT3 -> 't16' (among others). Wait, looking at the production for NT20 under NT10, it's 't43' for NT10. But in the grammar, NT20 has a production to 't65' and also to 't65' via another rule? Wait, looking carefully, the rules for NT4: that might not be relevant here.\n\nWait, let me approach this methodically. The string starts with t70, so I need to see how t70 is generated. Looking at the grammar rules, t70 is part of NT16's productions: NT16 -> NT7 NT20. And both NT7 and NT20 can be expanded further.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nNT16 -> NT7 NT20\n\nNT7 can be:\n- NT7 -> NT7 NT12 (which would lead to more expansion)\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT11\n\nBut in the start, after NT16, we have NT7, which would eventually result in t77 via NT5 -> NT7 -> t77. Wait, let me check the rules for NT7.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT11\n- NT2 -> NT11 NT17 (and other productions)\n- NT11 -> NT15 NT10\n- NT15 -> NT21 NT8\n- NT21 can be 't82' or maybe more expansions. Wait, perhaps I'm getting off track.\n\nWait, maybe I should construct a parse tree step by step. The string is a series of tokens, so I can try to parse it as a sequence of these tokens.\n\nThe string is: \nt70 t19 t81 t17 t77 t12 t16 t19 t40 t16 t70 t16 t66 t70 t19 t16 t16 t66 t82 t81 t77 t66 t26 t61 t82 t66 t29 t12 t19 t48 t48 t73 t73 t77 t40 t48 t48\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n1. t70: This must come from NT16, as per the grammar. So, first part is NT16.\n\nNT16 -> NT7 NT20.\n\nSo, t70 comes from NT16, which splits into NT7 and NT20. So the string starts with NT16, so t70 (from NT16) is the first token.\n\nThen, we have t19. Let's look back: the grammar has t19 in various places. For example, in the rules:\n\n- NT17 -> NT11 NT12\n- NT17 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT3 -> 't16' (but I'm not sure). Wait, actually, in the grammar, I need to see where t19 comes from.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT21 -> NT17 NT5\n- NT9 -> 't77' or other.\nBut wait, in the rules, I see NT2 -> NT5 NT20 and so on. Wait, perhaps more directly: the t19 comes from NT19.\n\nLooking through, NT19's rules include:\n\n- NT19 -> NT1 NT2\n- NT19 -> NT21 NT8\n- NT19 -> 't11' or 't16'? Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT19 -> 't19' under NT3? Wait, no. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT2-> NT11 NT17\n- NT6 -> NT2 NT10\n- NT1-> NT5 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT7 NT16\nWait, perhaps I should list all the rules where a non-terminal expands to a terminal or to other non-terminals, but it's getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for how to derive each token in the string step by step.\n\nLet me try starting from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can expand to three alternatives:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT8\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nI need to see which of these can lead to the given string. Since the first token is t70, which comes from NT16, maybe I should see how that can be part of one of these productions.\n\nWait, looking at S, the productions expand to pairs like NT12 NT8, etc. So, each of S's expansions contributes two non-terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t70, so looking at the first production S -> NT12 NT8: NT12 is in the grammar; does it expand to t70? Let's see.\n\nFrom the rules, NT12 can expand as:\n\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT19 NT4\n- NT12 -> NT8 -> other tokens.\n\nLooking further down, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12' (from some rules: like in NT12->'t12'. Wait, in the rules, I see NT12 is sometimes 't12'\u2014like in S->NT12 NT8, and in some production rules, for example:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12' (I think in the very end, but let me find it).\n\nLooking through the rules, there are several entries that expand to 't12' or others. For example, at the end, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n\nAnother one is:\n\n- NT3 -> 't12'\n\nWait, but that's a terminal? Hmm. Alternatively, let's find all terminal usages:\n\nLooking at the very bottom of the rules, I see a lot of 't' with numbers:\n\n- \"NT7 -> 't77'\" etc.\n\nWait, in the rules, the very last lines are:\n\nNT9 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't19'\nNT8 -> 't48'\nand so on.\n\nWait, no, the rules seem to mix expansion into other non-terminals and terminals. For example, some NTs expand into other NTs (like NT16 -> NT7 NT20), while others directly expand into 't' strings.\n\nLooking through, for example, NT12 has a production -> 't12'. Similarly, other NTs have productions that directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT14 -> 't40'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n\nSo, the string starts with t70. So, the first part of the string comes from NT16, as I thought before.\n\nSo, starting with S, let's see if we can have a production that starts with NT16.\n\nLooking at the S expansions, none directly produce NT16, except perhaps through the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-659","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. I've got to determine if the given string is generated by this context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens, and I need to figure out if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production has at most two non-terminals on the left and one on the right. The start symbol is S. I notice that S has a few productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT14 (from the first line)\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14 (second line)\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12 (third line)\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must come from one of these paths. Now, the given string starts with t73. Let me look for which NT can produce 't'3 or something that starts with t73.\n\nLooking at the right-hand side of the productions, I see that NT10 and NT3 are the only NTs that produce strings starting with 't'. Specifically:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', 't39', etc.\n\nSo the string starts with t73, which could come directly from NT10. If S \u2192 NT7 NT14, maybe one of those NTs is NT10.\n\nLooking at NT7 and NT14 from S:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11\n- NT14 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n\nSo NT7 and NT14 are both non-terminals. For the first token to be t73 from NT7: Let's see what NT7 produces. Wait, NT7 is transformed into NT2 and NT11. So from NT7, you have two symbols: NT2 and NT11.\n\nLet me see what NT2 and NT11 produce. Looking at the productions:\n\n- NT2 has multiple rules, for example, NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20, or NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17, etc. It's a bit complex. Similarly, NT11 has a rule: NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT11, which is a recursive rule, meaning it could generate multiple instances of NT0.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the other initial production for S: S \u2192 NT9 NT12. Let's see what NT9 and NT12 can produce.\n\nNT9 has productions:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT16\n- NT9 \u2192 NT12 NT15\n\nSo NT9 can produce a chain ending in NT12 or NT16, and since it has the rule NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9, it can also produce longer sequences. Now, looking at the string, the first token is t73, which could be from NT10. So if S \u2192 NT9 NT12, and one of the symbols is NT10, but NT9 might not directly produce NT10. Let's check NT9's productions to see.\n\nAlternatively, if S \u2192 NT7 NT14, and NT14 \u2192 NT4 NT0, but that starts with NT4 and NT0. I'm not sure if that leads to t73. Maybe it's better to look at the string from the beginning.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string step by step, starting from S, and see if it can produce the tokens.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order:\n\nt73, t19, t39, t82, t48, t65, t66, t40, t61, t66, t43, t40, t16, t81, t40, t16, t73, t66, t53, t16, t53, t73, t12, t39, t73, t16, t40, t17, t82, t66, t48, t53, t39, t66, t39, t81, t70.\n\nNow, let's map each token to possible NT productions.\n\nt73: Could be NT10 \u2192 't73'.\n\nIf the first NT is NT10, then the second NT must be what? Looking back at S's productions, if S produces NT7 NT14, that's two NTs. Or if it's NT9 NT12 or NT7 NT14, maybe I need to see if both NTs can produce the tokens.\n\nWait, but S has three productions, all of which are two NTs. So S must produce two NT symbols, and the entire string should be the concatenation of their productions.\n\nLet me try to see if the string starts with NT10.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT7 NT14, but if either NT7 or NT14 can produce t73, then that might work. Alternatively, if S produces NT9 and NT12, but I need to see if either NT9 or NT12 can start with 't73'. \n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n\nAre there any other NTs that produce t73? Let me search through the rules.\n\nLooking at all the NT productions, only NT10 produces 't73', so the string must start with NT10, which is the first token.\n\nSo the first token is from NT10. Now, looking at S's productions to see if one of the NTs can produce NT10.\n\nWait, S's productions are S \u2192 NT12 NT14, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT7 NT14, one of those NTs must produce NT10, but I don't see NT7 or NT14 producing NT10. Alternatively, if S \u2192 NT9 NT12, then NT9 or NT12 must produce NT10. But looking at NT9's rules, it's about NT6, NT16, etc., but not directly to NT10. Similarly, NT12's rules involve NT17, etc. So maybe S can't produce NT10 unless I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the initial production is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts from another production. Let's think differently. Suppose the string starts with t73, which is from NT10.\n\nIf the string is generated as S \u2192 NT7 NT14, then NT7 could be t73. But looking at NT7, I don't see a production that leads directly to 't73'. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT7's productions: NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11, and so on. Maybe NT7 can produce a sequence that starts with t73, but I don't see NT2 leading to t73 in its productions. Alternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT9 NT12, and one of those NTs can produce t73.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Let me look for any NTs that can produce t73. Only NT10 does. So the first token must come from NT10. So the first NT must be NT10, so S must produce NT10 NTsomething. But S's productions are pairs: either NT12 and NT14, NT7 and NT14, or NT9 and NT12. None of these are NT10 except if one of NT12 or NT14 can produce NT10, which I don't think is the case.\n\nWait, maybe the initial production is a typo. Let me double-check the grammar:\n\nLooking back, S \u2192 NT12 NT14, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12. So none of these directly produce NT10. So if the first token is t73, it's from NT10, but S can't directly produce NT10. Therefore, this seems impossible. So maybe the string isn't in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe NT10 is a non-terminal that appears in another production. Let me check if any of the S's right-hand sides include NT10. Looking, S's productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nNone of these include NT10, so I'm stuck. The string starts with ND10, but S can't produce THAT unless S has a production that includes NT10, which it doesn't.\n\nWait, but maybe S can produce a string where one of the NTs is NT10, but the other NTs can produce the rest. Let me think: S \u2192 NT9 NT12. If NT9 produces some tokens, and NT12 produces the others, and one of those includes NT10.\n\nWait, looking at NT9: NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9 or NT6 NT16 or NT12 NT15. So if NT9 is expanded and produces a substructure, maybe one of those could include NT10.\n\nAlternatively, if S \u2192 NT9 and NT12, and one of those could produce NT10.

{"custom_id":"request-671","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, and the grammar includes production rules for each symbol, including terminals and non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. The grammar provided seems to fit this because all the rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by something (I think I need to verify that all are either two non-terminals or a single terminal).\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, S \u2192 NT12 NT12 is a production of two non-terminals, which is fine. Each rule in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal, except for some that look like they produce a terminal followed by other things. Wait, most of the productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, so all are in CNF. So I don't have to worry about longer right-hand sides or single non-terminals; everything is either two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \n\n`t61 t73 t43 t70 t65 t43 t26 t40 t73 t66 t65 t19 t61 t19 t17 t48 t19 t26 t12 t77 t77 t16 t53 t43 t66 t17 t53 t16 t65 t17 t17 t26 t65 t12 t39 t26 t73 t39`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the productions in reverse. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a binary tree structure, and each step adds one token to the string.\n\nI think a good approach is to try to parse the string from left to right, using the grammar to see if I can break it down into the production rules. Alternatively, since it's a top-down approach, starting from S and expanding, I can try to see if the string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but since the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm is applicable. However, the grammar here is quite large, with a lot of non-terminals and production rules, so manually applying CYK would be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to look for parse trees that can generate the string. Since it's a binary grammar, each production splits a non-terminal into two symbols. The string's length is 37 tokens, so the parse tree will have a structure that, when fully expanded, results in these 37 symbols.\n\nI should consider the structure of the string. For instance, the first token is t61. Looking at the grammar, t61 is produced by NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, and NT13 can be produced by NT12 NT19, and so on. Maybe I can see if each token in the string is a production starting terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, terminals are on the right-hand side of some productions. For example, NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5 produces t61 and t80? Wait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, I need to check each production rule to see which produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5: And in the rules, NT17 \u2192 t61? Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 t17 (Wait, no, in some rules like NT4 \u2192 t65 or NT4 \u2192 t17), but it seems some rules produce terminals.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list the rules where terminals appear.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t12\n- NT10 \u2192 t53\n- NT4 \u2192 t65\n- NT16 \u2192 t70\n- NT3 \u2192 t16\n- NT3 \u2192 t29\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT20 \u2192 t65\n- NT8 \u2192 t48\n- NT15 \u2192 t82\n- NT17 \u2192 t61\n- NT21 \u2192 t53, t77, t82\n- NT5 \u2192 t82\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT9 \u2192 t77\n- NT4 \u2192 t17\n- NT2 \u2192 t26\nWait no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, the user provided some rules in a confusing format.

So looking carefully, maybe the NT12 has other productions beyond the ones I see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

{"custom_id":"request-667","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, especially since all the production rules have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions seem to be mainly from S to NT12 NT8 or similar. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. I'll first list them out:\n\nt39, t53, t81, t53, t66, t16, t81, t73, t73, t43, t77, t43, t61, t16, t77, t43, t40, t81, t82, t73, t77, t73, t39, t95, t61, t16, t82, t39, t70, t12, t19, t48, t19, t82, t66, t19, t70, t53.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string contains many terminal symbols, like t39, t53, etc., so the grammar must have production rules that generate these tokens. The non-terminals in the grammar are things like S, NT12, NT7, etc. Each rule has two non-terminals on the RHS, so the derivation will have a binary tree structure with S at the root.\n\nSince the string is quite long, I'll try to break it down into smaller parts. Maybe each part corresponds to an initial production from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these implies that S can produce a pair of non-terminals. For example, S can expand into NT12 and NT8. Then, each of these NTs can further expand into other NTs or terminals.\n\nI'll check the string for the presence of the terminals that appear in these rules. For instance, looking at the productions, 't39' appears as a terminal in NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT4, among others. Similarly, 't53' appears in NT10 \u2192 't53' and NT10 \u2192 't73'.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, in the grammar, the terminals are in the productions, like NT12 \u2192 't12', NT10 \u2192 't53', etc. So I need to find if the string can be broken down into such sequences.\n\nI'll scan the string for these terminal tokens. The string starts with t39, t53, t81, t53, t66, t16, etc. I need to see if there's a way these tokens can arise from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT4 can produce t66 and t17? Wait, no, because in the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8, which eventually becomes t65, t8, etc. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps some NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nFor example, NT12 \u2192 't12', NT10 \u2192 't53' and 't73', NT4 \u2192 't65', and others. So, some NTs produce single terminals.\n\nIn that case, the string must have sequences where these terminals appear as leaves in the parse tree.\n\nI'll list the string again and try to identify possible splits into production rules:\n\nLooking at the first few tokens:\n\nt39, t53, t81, t53, t66, t16, t81, t73, t73, t43, t77, t43, t61, t16, t77, t43, t40, t81, t82, t73, t77, t73, t39, t95, t61, t16, t82, t39, t70, t12, t19, t48, t19, t82, t66, t19, t70, t53.\n\nWait, I'm noticing that t12 is one of the terminals, as per NT12 \u2192 't12'. Also, t53 and t73 are in NT10. Similarly, t65 is in NT4.\n\nBut parsing such a long string manually seems tedious. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be split into segments that correspond to S \u2192 NT12 NT8, etc.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT12 NT8. NT12 can go to 't12' or as other non-terminals. If NT12 is a terminal t12, then NT8 would have to produce a sequence starting after t12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated via a series of these two-step productions.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the possible production chains. For example, if S \u2192 NT12 NT8, then NT12 could be t12, and NT8 could produce a sequence starting with something else.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t39. So if nt8 is t39, but in the grammar, NT8 can generate t48 via NT8 \u2192 NT15 NT19 \u2192 other non-terminals... Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is generated by a different production, like S \u2192 NT7 NT14. NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11, etc. But again, it's hard to follow without a systematic way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for the presence of multiple similar tokens, which might indicate chains of productions leading to them.\n\nLooking for t39: In the grammar, NT4 \u2192 NT11 NT5, and NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT4. There's a cycle here. Similarly, NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8, which might eventually produce t65 or other terminals.\n\nSimilarly, t40 appears in NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9 (cycle), but also NT9 \u2192 NT12 NT15. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the string is built from a series of S productions, each expanding to two non-terminals, which in turn expand further. So each step doubles the number of non-terminals, but since terminals are leaves, the total length of the string would be a power of 2 times the initial S.\n\nBut looking at the string, the length is 40 tokens. Let's see if that's a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 40 isn't a power of two, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the derivations can vary, so maybe the string is not a direct expansion but a combination via different productions.\n\nWait, no. Since each step in the derivation splits each non-terminal into two, the total number of symbols (terminals and non-terminals) at each level doubles. But the string is the final result, so it's all terminals. So, the total number of terminals must be a multiple of some power of two minus 1 perhaps?\n\nWait, each derivation step starting from S (which is one non-terminal) would lead to two non-terminals. To reach 40 tokens, maybe the derivation went through several steps, each splitting into more symbols. The number of symbols should be 2^k - 1, but I'm not sure. Maybe the number of terminals can vary, but 40 isn't a power of two, so maybe it's possible but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the presence of cycles. For example, NT9 has a cycle NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9, which can produce multiple NT9s until it's resolved via another production. Similarly, NT4 has a cycle NT4 \u2192 NT11 NT4.\n\nBut it's hard to say without more concrete steps. Maybe I should consider specific tokens and see if their presence can fit into any production.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, there's t53. In the grammar, NT10 \u2192 't53' and NT10 \u2192 't73', so t53 could come from NT10. Also, NT5 \u2192 't66' etc., but maybe we can find a path.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire string as built by starting from S and expanding each symbol step by step until all are terminals. But this would take too long manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for a binary tree structure where the terminals in the string can be grouped into the required non-terminals. The string is 40 tokens, which is even, which could correspond to S \u2192 NT12 NT8, then each NT12 and NT8 split into two each, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: look for the presence of each token in the grammar. All the tokens in the string are present as terminals in the grammar, like t39, t53, t81, etc. But that's not sufficient because"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-682","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can also go to terminals. Wait, no, CNF also allows A \u2192 a where a is a terminal, but only the start symbol can have such productions? Or maybe it's allowed for non-terminals too. Hmm, but I think in general, for Chomsky Normal Form, if the start symbol is allowed to produce terminals, that's acceptable, but all other productions must be non-terminals to non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all productions except some seem to have non-terminals on both sides. Let me check a few. For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT13 \u2014 these are non-terminals. But looking at the later rules, some have terminals on the right-hand side, like NT12 \u2192 't95'. Wait, that's a problem because if a non-terminal can produce a terminal, then the grammar can generate a string with that terminal. But in the provided grammar, NT12 is a non-terminal that directly produces a terminal 't95'. Similarly, other non-terminals like NT4 produce 't65', NT3 \u2192 't16', etc.\n\nWait, but hold on: NT3 also has a production to 't29' and others. So it's possible for non-terminals to produce terminals, which is acceptable. But then, the entire question is whether the string can be derived from the start symbol S through the grammar, with all non-terminals replaced by terminal sequences according to the rules.\n\nBut the string given is a sequence of these terms: t40, t17, etc. So I think my task is to see if the entire sequence can be constructed step by step by expanding non-terminals into terminals, following the productions.\n\nTo approach this, I can use the Leftmost Derivation method since I'm breaking down the start symbol S into its components, then each non-terminal into their components, until I get all terminals.\n\nFirst, let me look at the start symbol S. The grammar has three productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT13\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nBut looking closely, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. The user provided the grammar with some lines. Let me list the S productions.\n\nLooking back, the user wrote the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT12 NT13\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the initial line is:\n\n\"Grammar:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the user probably made a typo when writing the initial grammar. Let me look again carefully. The first line after the Grammar: header is:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\nHere's the actual initial grammar part:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, no, the user probably has a typo, but let me clarify. The user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar:\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n...\"\n\nSo S can be derived in multiple ways. So when starting, I have to consider which of these three options S takes first. Since it's leftmost derivation, we'll expand S's leftmost non-terminal first.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first symbol is t40. So I need to see if there's a production that starts with NT leading to t40.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT12 can produce 't95' (from S -> NT12 NT13, but no, NT12 has its own productions. Let me look up NT12's productions.\n\nIn the grammar, NT12 has a production: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. And then NT17 can produce 't61' (from the production NT17 \u2192 't61'), and NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20. Hmm, wait, I think it's better to have a list of all non-terminals and their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to represent the entire grammar and see which pathways are possible.\n\nBut given the length of the grammar, perhaps I can see if any of the non-terminals directly produce the symbols in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t40, t17, t81, t29, t26, t39, t70, t48, t16, t40, t73, t95, t81, t66, t16, t43, t39, t12, t61, t81, t43, t16, t48, t73, t12, t70, t40, t19, t12, t66, t19, t77, t77, t66, t40, t19, t70, t70.\n\nWait, this is a very long string of 39 symbols. The string provided has 38 symbols. Since each production in CNF either produces a terminal or two non-terminals, so the length of the string must be equal to 2^n where n is the number of productions starting from S. But in this case, it's a very long string, so n must be larger than log2(38), which is roughly 6, but 2^6 is 64. But the string is longer than that, so perhaps it's constructed in a way that terminals can be produced directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol S can generate a string by combining multiple terminals. But given that the grammar has S deriving into two non-terminals, each of which can further derive into two, and so on, making the string a binary expansion. So the string length would be a power of 2.\n\nBut let's not get bogged down on the structure. Let's see if we can map the string to possible non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let's note that each symbol in the string is a terminal non-terminal symbol, so to derive it, we might need to have a production rule where a non-terminal directly maps to this terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see which non-terminals produce each of these symbols:\n\nt40:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT8 \u2192 't48' and others. Wait, but looking line by line:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see lines like NT4 \u2192 't65', NT5 \u2192 't39', NT12 \u2192 't12', NT16 \u2192 't70', NT3 \u2192 't16', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps making a list of all non-terminals that produce each terminal could help.\n\nLet me try to list some non-terminals and their terminal productions:\n\nFrom NT12: NT12 \u2192 't95' (from the line NT12 -> 't95')\n\nWait, no, actually looking through the provided grammar, for example:\n\nLine: NT12 \u2192 't12' (from NT12 -> 't12')\n\nSimilarly, NT13 \u2192 't82'\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar lines:\n\nLine: NT3 \u2192 't16' (line NT3 \u2192 't16'), but another line: NT13 \u2192 't82'\n\nWait, let me be methodical.\n\nLooking for each non-terminal, find their terminal productions.\n\nI'll start scrolling through the grammar rules:\n\n- Line: NT12 \u2192 't12' \u2192 NT12 can produce 't12'\n\n- Line: NT13 \u2192 't82'\n\n- Line: NT3 \u2192 't16'\n\n- Line: NT3 \u2192 't29'\n\n- Line: NT5 \u2192 't66'\n\n- Line: NT15 \u2192 't82'\n\n- Line: NT10 \u2192 't43'\n\n- Line: NT4 \u2192 't17'\n\n- Line: NT9 \u2192 't77'\n\n- Line: NT7 \u2192 't61'\n\n- Line: NT8 \u2192 't48'\n\nHmm, some other lines, like:\n\nLine: NT17 \u2192 't61'\n\nLine: NT8 \u2192 't48'\n\nLine: NT4 \u2192 't17'\n\nWait, this is getting a bit disorienting.

{"custom_id":"request-683","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably parse the grammar to understand what it's generating. The grammar seems complicated with lots of productions. Let me list out the key productions that directly produce terminal symbols because that's where the leaves of the parse tree would be.\n\nI see that certain non-terminals directly produce 't' followed by numbers, like NT12 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't70', NT4 -> 't65', etc. These are the terminal symbols that make up the string. So the string is a sequence of these terminals, each possibly coming from a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: `t26 t95 t29 t77 t16 t70 t16 t48 t40 t16 t19 t29 t16 t77 t43 t17 t77 t53 t43 t16 t65 t29 t40 t17 t19 t12 t65 t39 t48 t40 t53 t26 t82 t65 t12 t70 t48 t17 t81`.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the rules provided.\n\nStarting with S, the grammar has three initial productions:\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, the initial step is choosing one of these. The string starts with 't26', so I need to see how 't26' could be produced. Looking through the productions, I see that NT8 -> 't48' and NT20 -> 't40', but I'm not seeing where 't26' comes from yet.\n\nWait, looking closer, I see NT21 -> 't82' and NT21 also has a production NT21 -> NT8 NT13. Oh, maybe starting from one of the initial productions, I can reach 't26'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each 't' in the string must come from a production that eventually leads to a terminal. So, for each 't' in the string, I need to check if there's a production that can derive it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to parse the string step by step. Let me try to parse the first token 't26'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT8 -> 't48', so that's not 't26'. NT20 -> 't40', not helpful. NT12 -> 't12'. What about NT2? NT2 has productions like NT2 -> NT11 NT17, etc. Hmm, maybe NT17?\n\nLooking up NT17, there's NT17 -> NT8 NT10, and NT10 -> 't53' among others. Wait, perhaps there's a way to get 't26'. Let's see:\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see NT20 -> 't65' and NT8 -> 't48', NT15 -> 't65', and so on. Alternatively, searching for NT26, but I don't see any NT26 in the productions. Wait, the string has 't26', so where does 't26' come from?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. Oh, I see that S has productions like S -> NT12 NT12, which would produce something like t12 t12. So in the string, there are instances like t26 t95, which doesn't fit t12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is S -> NT12 NT12, but that would lead to t12 t12, which isn't present. Or maybe the string is derived via a more complex path.\n\nWait, another approach: each non-terminal must expand into a string that leads to the terminals. So, let me see if 't26' is a terminal or can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT26, so perhaps 't26' must come directly from a production that has NT26 -> t26. But in the given grammar, there is no such production. Wait, let me check again:\n\nAh, I see that NT20 -> 't65', NT8 -> 't48', NT12 -> 't12', etc. Wait, but in the string, the first token is 't26'. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the grammar to see all possible ways 't26' can be formed. Alternatively, perhaps 't26' is a result of a longer expansion, but in this case, I think 't26' must come directly from a production of a non-terminal that is supposed to produce t26. Since I don't see any such production, maybe this string is invalid.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. Looking at NT0: NT0 -> NT6 NT10, and NT10 -> 't73'. So if I have NT0, that could produce something like 't73'. But 't26' isn't present in any of these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for 't26' in the productions: Do any non-terminals directly produce 't26'? Looking through, the only productions that directly produce terminals are of the form X -> tyy, like NT21 -> t82, etc. So unless there's a production NT26 -> t26, which there isn't, I can't derive 't26' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but the first token is 't26', which implies that the grammar must have a non-terminal that can produce it. Since it's not there, perhaps the string can't be derived. Therefore, the answer would be No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the productions to ensure there's no NT26 -> t26. No, I don't see such a rule. So, the string starts with a terminal that the grammar doesn't produce, so it's impossible.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-690","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem in front of me where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces, each of which seems to correspond to a terminal symbol. The grammar has various production rules, each defining how non-terminals can expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst off, let's break down the problem. I'm given a recursive grammar and a string. My task is to check if the grammar can derive the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B are non-terminals and C and a are terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the non-terminals expand into two non-terminals, except for some that directly produce terminal symbols (like 't66', 't17', etc.). So, essentially, each production either branches into two non-terminals or terminates with a terminal.\n\nThe given string is:\n\n`t66 t17 t29 t65 t43 t81 t73 t40 t66 t29 t82 t77 t77 t65 t26 t61 t26 t43 t66 t95 t17 t29 t26 t70 t95 t26 t12 t70 t16 t19 t17 t29 t19 t73 t65 t12 t43 t12 t82 t53`\n\nI'll start by trying to parse this string according to the grammar. Parsing context-free grammars can be done using various methods like the CYK algorithm, but considering the size of the string, that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can try to break the string down step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the production rules that directly produce terminals because these will help in matching parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, here are the rules where the right-hand side is a terminal symbol:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12 (but produces t12 and t12)\nWait, no, actually, some rules produce terminals:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12' (once)\n- NT4 -> 't65' (once)\n- NT16 -> 't70' (once)\n- NT10 -> 't53' (once)\n- NT5 -> 't39' (once)\n- NT12 -> 't12' (once)\n- NT6 -> 't3' or other? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nThe terminal productions are:\nNT12 -> 't12'\nNT4 -> 't65'\nNT16 -> 't70'\nNT10 -> 't53'\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT3 -> 't29' (Wait, looking: \n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't29' and NT3 also has production to NT5 NT14, and NT5 also produces 't39'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the direct terminal productions.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think that whenever a non-terminal is present in a right-hand side, it has to be replaced according to its production rules.\n\nSince the string is long, let's look for possible splits.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to try to find possible leftmost or rightmost derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's helpful to check if the string can be fully broken down using the production rules.\n\nAnother idea is to start from the beginning of the string and see if the first few tokens match any possible expansion.\n\nBut given the size of the string, this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can look for repeating patterns or see which non-terminals expand into which terminals.\n\nAlso, let's note that the string contains a lot of 't' followed by two digits. So, perhaps these correspond to non-terminals that eventually produce specific terminal sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps one thing to look for is whether the number of symbols in the string is compatible with the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of a leftmost derivation would double the number of symbols at each step, but actually, CNF allows for each step to replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, which themselves can be replaced. So, the number of symbols can vary.\n\nWait, let me think. In CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, starting with S, which is replaced by two non-terminals, each of which can either be terminals or more non-terminals. Each replacement of a non-terminal with two non-terminals would increase the count of non-terminals, until they are replaced by terminals. So, the total number of terminals could vary.\n\nBut perhaps the parity (even or odd) might be considered if there are constraints, but in this case, the string is a sequence of terminals, so the entire production must derive exactly this string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better approach is to try to group the string into symbols as per the grammar.\n\nWait, but given the time, perhaps it's better to look for a pattern.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nLooking for 't66' early on. Let's see if 't66' is a terminal or if it's part of a non-terminal production.\n\nLooking back at the grammar: NT4 -> 't65', NT12 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't70', etc. Wait, 't66' in the string is the 12th token. Let's see.\n\nWait, in the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't66'? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that:\n\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT9\n- NT7 -> NT7 NT12\n- NT5 -> NT17 NT4\n- NT4 -> NT11 NT5\n- NT2 -> NT11 NT17\n- NT6 -> NT2 NT10\n- NT1 -> NT5 NT6\n- NT17 -> NT13 NT4\n- NT13 -> NT12 NT19\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT6 -> 't3' or something?\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT10 -> 't53' and NT6 -> 't3' (if looking for 't3'), but in the string, there's a 't3' later.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for 't66', do I see any non-terminal that produces 't66'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, at the end of the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT13 -> 't82'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT5 -> 't66' Wait, no.

So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF), and a string that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is:\n\nt17 t48 t12 t70 t82 t43 t53 t81 t43 t65 t73 t48 t61 t70 t53 t73 t82 t70 t43 t16 t65 t61 t12 t16 t16 t65 t81 t65 t66 t82 t48 t43 t66 t53 t26 t61 t61 t65 t26 t16.\n\nHmm, the grammar is pretty long, with multiple productions. I remember that in CNF, every production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, first, I should check if all the productions in the given grammar follow this rule. For example, I see S -> NT12 NT12, which is A \u2192 BC, so that's fine. But I should also check for any productions that might be more complex, like longer sequences or more than two non-terminals on the right side. In this case, the grammar seems to be in CNF since all right-hand sides are two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, to check if the string is generated by the grammar, I can use the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which is an efficient way to parse context-free grammars. The algorithm works by building a table that keeps track of which non-terminals can derive the substring of the input.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the symbols in the string to analyze them. The string consists of the following terminals:\n\nt17, t48, t12, t70, t82, t43, t53, t81, t43, t65, t73, t48, t61, t70, t53, t73, t82, t70, t43, t16, t65, t61, t12, t16, t16, t65, t81, t65, t66, t82, t48, t43, t66, t53, t26, t61, t61, t65, t26, t16.\n\nThat's 36 tokens. The CYK algorithm builds a table with rows corresponding to the start and end indices of the string and columns for the positions. Each cell (i,j) will contain the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j.\n\nBut given the length, manually computing the CYK table would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to see if each terminal in the string is directly derived by some non-terminal production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some symbols that directly produce terminals:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12, etc. So S is a start symbol, but I need to see how it can derive the entire string.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of CYK, I can break down the string step by step using the given productions.\n\nLet me look for the terminals present in the string and check if they are on the right-hand side of any production. For example, looking at the symbols:\n\nt17: I see in the grammar that S can produce NT7, which in turn produces NT7 with another NT7, etc. Wait, let's look for t17. The string starts with t17, so in the grammar, is there a production for NT17 that produces t17?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT17\nNT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\nNT4 \u2192 t17. Yes! So NT4 can produce t17. So if we have NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, which can then produce t17.\n\nBut wait, how does that fit into the string? Let me take it step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is t17, which can be derived from NT4. So, we might have a production where a non-terminal (like NT17) produces t17 via a chain of productions.\n\nLooking further at the productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT11 NT20\nNT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3\nNT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8\nNT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20\nAnd so on, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should use the given string and see if each token can be connected through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a recursive descent approach or look for possible leftmost derivations.\n\nLet me try to structure the string into chunks that match the productions.\n\nThe string starts with t17 t48 t12 t70 t82 t43 t53 t81 t43 t65 t73 t48 t61 t70 t53 t73 t82 t70 t43 t16 t65 t61 t12 t16 t16 t65 t81 t65 t66 t82 t48 t43 t66 t53 t26 t61 t61 t65 t26 t16.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to look at the entire string and see if it can be built up from the starting symbol S.\n\nThe given grammar's start symbol is S, which can produce combinations like NT12 NT12, etc. Looking at the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12 (Line 1)\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14 (Line 2)\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12 (Line 3)\nSo, S can produce two NT's. Let's see what NT12, NT7, and NT9 produce.\n\nLooking at NT12's productions:\nNT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8 (Line 24)\nNT12 is used in S's production.\n\nIn the string, I see t12 multiple times, and looking at the grammar, NT12 can produce t12 through NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, then NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20, etc. Let's see:\n\nLooking for t12 in the grammar: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So, t12 can come from NT12.\n\nWait, but t12 is a terminal. So I need to see if NT12 can be rewritten into t12. Looking through the productions, I notice that NT12 is a production that might involve more non-terminals, so perhaps t12 is in the language if there's a way to derive it, but in this case, t12 is a terminal in the given string. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for t17 in the production NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, which can produce t17 (as NT4 \u2192 t17). So, starting with t17, which comes from NT17, which comes from NT7, which comes from NT2.\n\nSimilarly, t48 is in the string. Looking for where t48 comes from. In the grammar, I see NT15 \u2192 t48 (Line 20), and NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT12 (but that doesn't produce t48). So, t48 comes from NT15.\n\nSo, t48 comes from NT15, which can be derived from production NT15 \u2192 NT8 NT20 (Line 16: NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT21), wait, or another production. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions for NT15: Line 20, \"NT15 \u2192 NT8 NT20\", Line 22, \"NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT21\". So NT15 can produce t48 if it's a direct production. Wait, NT15 can also produce t48 via NT15 \u2192 NT8 NT20, and then NT8 \u2192 t4 NT20, and so on. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to outline the entire derivation, but with the given string's length, it's impractical. Another approach is to see if the structure of the grammar allows certain patterns that match the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many of the non-terminals produce other non-terminals until they reach a terminal. For example, NT4 \u2192 t17, so that's a way to get to t17.\n\nAnother approach is to see if there's a way to parse the string step by step, but without a CYK table, it's challenging. Let me think about the structure of the string. It starts with t17, then t48, then t12, t70, t82, etc. I need to see if these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first part: t17 t48. Let's see if these can be part of a production."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-698","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form, and we need to determine whether the provided string is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of writing context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow CNF because all the rules are either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. That's a good start.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t77 t82 t95 t12 t40 t19 t26 t82 t43 t65 t26 t43 t39 t65 t12 t16 t48 t66 t73 t29 t53 t16 t77 t53 t19 t73 t95 t95 t53 t73 t61 t17 t70 t19 t43 t26 t26 t81 t66 t43 t29.\n\nI notice that most of these are sequences of numbers. The grammar has several NT rules that expand into terminals and non-terminals. Some of the terminals include numbers like t77, t82, t12, etc., and some are clearly strings of letters. \n\nI think the first step is to map out which non-terminals correspond to the terminals and see if the string can be broken down into allowable parts according to the grammar. For example, many of these 't' terms seem to be fixed, so they must come directly from the grammar. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some rules produce terminals. For instance, NT12 \u2192 't12', NT16 \u2192 't70', NT3 \u2192 't16', and so on. These are fixed-length terminals, so each occurrence in the string must match one of these.\n\nLet me first list out all the terminals in the string:\n\nt77, t82, t95, t12, t40, t19, t26, t82, t43, t65, t26, t43, t39, t65, t12, t16, t48, t66, t73, t29, t53, t16, t77, t53, t19, t73, t95, t95, t53, t73, t61, t17, t70, t19, t43, t26, t26, t81, t66, t43, t29.\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these terminals matches any of the terminal rules in the grammar. For example:\n\n- t95: I see in the grammar that NT12 \u2192 t12, but no rule for t95. Wait, looking back, I see NT12 \u2192 't12', but do any other terminals have numbers like t95? Looking through, I think I might have missed some. Let me check the grammar again. \n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT14 \u2192 't65' (multiple times)\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT21 \u2192 't73' from NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5, and NT5 \u2192 t39, so t73 would be 't17' and 't39', but wait, in the grammar, some rules produce terminal combinations. For example, NT5 might produce 't39' directly, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps some terminals are combinations of multiple non-terminals. For example, NT1 \u2192 NT1 NT8, but when does it produce a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, some rules have terminals, but others don't. For example:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT1 NT8 | NT13 NT2 | NT14 NT6 | NT17 NT7 | NT17 NT12 | NT19 NT2 | NT20 NT13 | NT21 NT8 | NT21 NT5 | NT3 NT2 | NT5 NT2 | NT21 NT9 | NT21 NT3 | NT8 NT13 | NT17 NT4 | NT21 NT6 | NT8 NT1 | NT19 NT4 | NT17 NT11 | NT17 NT12 | NT17 NT17 | ... etc.\n\nBut most of these have non-terminals on the right side, except some:\n\nLooking back, for example:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12' (so it produces t12)\nNT4 \u2192 't65'\nNT20 \u2192 't65'\nNT14 \u2192 't65'\nNH29? Wait, looking through the grammar, some terminals are used in rules. For example, NT5 \u2192 't39', NT2 \u2192 't11' and 't17', but does any rule produce 't29' directly? Wait, looking again, I see:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't53', 't43', 't73' etc. So, in the string, there are multiple t53, t43, t73, etc.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check each terminal in the string and see if they match any terminal rules.\n\nBut this could take a long time. Maybe a better approach is to look for the start symbol and see if the entire string can be generated through a series of productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Let's see what S can produce. From the given grammar:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo S can produce two NT12s, a NT7 and NT14, or a NT9 and NT12.\n\nEach of these is a combination of two non-terminals. So each of these non-terminals must expand into a sequence of terminals or non-terminals.\n\nFor example, let's take S -> NT12 NT12. Each NT12 can produce 't12' or, via the other productions, more non-terminals. So if both NT12s are 't12', the output would be 't12 t12', which is not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, if one NT12 is 't12' and the other is, say, NT9, which could produce 't77' or other things.\n\nBut perhaps constructing the entire parse tree would be time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to look for the initial sequences that correspond to the derived strings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the longer terms in S's productions may match the string.\n\nThe string starts with t77 t82 t95 t12...\n\nLooking at t77: in the grammar, is there a rule that produces t77? Let me check. Well, looking at the grammar, most terminals are part of multiple rules, but some are directly assigned. For example, NT1 \u2192 't19', but is there a place where a non-terminal produces t77? Let me scan:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing t77. Wait, but in the provided grammar, I see NT21 produces 't73' as part of NT21 \u2192 't17 t39' (since NT5 \u2192 't39').\n\nWait, let me look again. For example, NT17 has several productions, such as NT17 \u2192 NT20 NT17, NT17 \u2192 NT7 NT12, etc. So perhaps the string t77 is being produced by a derivation.\n\nBut without a more systematic approach, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into smaller parts that correspond to possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would help, but that would require building a table, which is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, but let me check its length. The string has 42 elements separated by spaces, so it's quite long. That suggests that the grammar might require a significant number of expansion steps.\n\nAnother approach is to look for contradictions. For example, if any of the terminals in the string don't match any possible derivation from the grammar, then it's a 'No'. Otherwise, if all are covered, it's 'Yes'.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps it's quicker to note that many of the terminals in the string (like t95, t82, t77, etc.) don't seem to be directly produced by any single NT rule. So, unless these terminals are the result of multiple steps expanding into their own terminal sequences, the string might not be acceptable.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NTs seem to produce composite terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-696","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol S, which can also appear on the right-hand side. The start symbol here is S. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, each represented by the letters 't' followed by numbers like 't16', 't26', etc. The terminals are the atomic elements, and non-terminals can expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, the string is: `t16 t17 t61 t61 t16 t81 t43 t43 t70 t39 t40 t16 t12 t95 t77 t77 t77 t61 t77 t26 t26 t81 t61 t77 t19 t43 t95 t70 t19 t19 t95 t66 t95 t82 t70 t65 t12 t81 t29 t65 t40`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be produced by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. But wait, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have two non-terminals or a single terminal if it's an epsilon production, but in this case, S seems to only expand into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, etc. So each production for S produces two non-terminals, except maybe in the expansion steps later.\n\nBut the process is recursive, so I'll have to track how the string can be broken down into symbols that match the grammar's rules.\n\nI think the approach is to model the grammar as a parsing table and see if the string can be parsed without any errors. But since this is a complex grammar, maybe I can simplify it by looking for terminals and ensuring that each step of the derivation only produces what's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string corresponds to any possible derivation path starting from S, expanding non-terminals into terminals using the given productions.\n\nBut let's see. The string is a series of terminals, so I need to check if these can be derived from S by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the leaves match the string. However, given the size, this might be too time-consuming manually.\n\nInstead, perhaps I can count the number of terminals at each level. Wait, but the grammar seems to have non-terminals and terminals, and each production either introduces non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, many of the productions for non-terminals end up being just two non-terminals again, or sometimes a terminal if I look closer. Wait, no. Actually, many of these productions are like NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT16, which are still non-terminals. Some of these have a terminal on the right side. For example, looking closer, are any of these productions terminal productions?\n\nLooking through the list, I see some productions like NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, etc. It seems like some non-terminals directly produce terminals. Wait, for example, let me check the productions again:\n\nWait, I see that NT4 \u2192 't65' and some other terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't16' and NT3 \u2192 't29' and others. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't39', NT5 \u2192 't66', etc. So these are terminal productions. So whenever a non-terminal can produce a terminal, that's a terminal symbol.\n\nSo in the given grammar, terminal symbols are any symbol that maps to a terminal string (length 1). So we can check the grammar and see which ones are terminal productions. For example, NT2 \u2192 't95' is a terminal production. So if the string starts with 't95', that's okay if NT2 \u2192 't95' is a production.\n\nSo, the first thing is to map out all the non-terminals and their possible productions. Some non-terminals can only produce terminals, some can produce other non-terminals, etc.\n\nBut mapping all of them would be time-consuming. Instead, perhaps I can create a mapping of each non-terminal to the terminals it can produce. Wait, no, in the given grammar, each production is like NT12 \u2192 NT12 NT12 or NT12 \u2192 't95'.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, each production for a non-terminal is either two non-terminals or a single terminal (as in the case of NT2 \u2192 't95', NT4 \u2192 't65', etc.). So the terminals are those non-terminals that have a production like NT2 \u2192 't95', meaning they can produce the terminal symbol 't95' directly.\n\nSo first, I can create a list of terminal symbols by looking at all the right-hand sides that are terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't95'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16' and 't29' (is this consistent?) Wait, in the grammar provided, there are two entries for NT3 \u2192 't16' and another for 't29'? Or maybe it's the same NT3 and multiple productions. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT3 -> 't16'\n\nNT3 -> 't29'\n\nSo NT3 can produce either 't16' or 't29' (or both), meaning that 't16' and 't29' are terminals. Similarly, NT4 has multiple productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't65', NT4 \u2192 't11 NT5', etc. Wait, no, the NT4 productions are:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe grammar lines include:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nNT16 -> 't70'\n\nNT3 -> 't16'\n\nNT3 -> 't29'\n\nNT5 -> 't39'\n\nNT5 -> 't66'\n\nNT12 -> 't95'\n\nNT10 -> 't53'\n\nNT4 -> 't65'\n\nNT9 -> 't77'\n\nNT1 -> 't19'\n\nNT20 -> 't26'\n\nNT8 -> 't48'\n\nNT15 -> 't82'\n\nNT7 -> 't61'\n\nNT3 -> 't81'\n\nWait, no, the grammar lines are in the format of NTx \u2192 RHS, some RHS are two non-terminals, others are single terminals.\n\nSo, for each NT with a RHS that's a single terminal, that's a possible terminal symbol. So the terminal symbols are:\n\nt95, t65, t16, t29, t39, t66, t16 (again?), but no, that's the same as before, so unique?\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions:\n\nNT2 -> 't95'\n\nNT4 -> 't65'\n\nNT3 -> 't16'\n\nNT3 -> 't29'\n\nNT5 -> 't39'\n\nNT5 -> 't66'\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nNT16 -> 't70'\n\nNT7 -> 't61'\n\nNT8 -> 't48'\n\nNT15 -> 't82'\n\nNT20 -> 't26'\n\nNT19 -> 't43' (Wait, is that a terminal? Let me check.)\n\nLooking through the productions, 't43' appears on the RHS of NT20 \u2192 't26', but NT19 also has NT20 as part of its RHS, like NT19 -> NT11 NT4. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nLooking for any production where a terminal is on the RHS:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT26 probably isn't present, but let's check.\n\nWait, all the RHSs are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo the terminals are:\n\nt95, t65, t16, t29, t39, t66, t12, t70, t61, t48, t82, t26, t43, t77, t19, t4, etc. Wait, that's getting confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-708","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with this problem where I need to determine if a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the grammar provided. It seems a bit complex with multiple production rules. But I notice that the grammar is in CNF. In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar starts with S and has several non-terminals and terminals. The terminals I see are 't53', 't73', etc., so the string given is composed of these terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t53 t73 t48 t19 t12 t19 t12 t82 t70 t61 t40 t39 t66 t48 t12 t65 t26 t53 t40 t12 t17 t39 t29 t40 t39 t66 t26 t39 t61 t12 t26 t95 t43 t70 t17 t19 t26 t17 t70 t53 t66 t48.\n\nI need to figure out if this string can be generated by the given grammar. \n\nOne approach is to parse the string using the grammar rules, checking if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production either combines two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal. So, the parsing process, possibly using a top-down approach like the CYK algorithm, would help determine if the string is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to reconstruct a leftmost derivation for the string. Let's see: The string starts with t53. Looking at the grammar, the rule NT10 \u2192 't53'. So, the first symbol t53 must come from NT10. That means in the derivation, NT10 must be expanded to t53.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT10, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8\n\nSo, to get t53 (which is NT10 \u2192 t53), the NT10 must have been derived from NT16 NT8. But wait, according to the grammar, NT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8, but NT16 might have further productions. So, the string starts with t53, so the leftmost symbol is t53 which corresponds to NT10.\n\nBut NT10 requires NT16 and NT8. So, the next step is to see if NT16 and NT8 can produce the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at NT8, in the grammar, we have several productions:\n\nLooking at NT8's rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20,\n\nNT8 \u2192 't48',\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT15 NT19,\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT12,\n\nSo, the first symbol is t53 (from NT10), and the next is t73, which is from NT20 \u2192 't73'. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT20 has rules:\n\nLooking at NT20, it's stated as NT20 \u2192 't26', but wait, looking closely, I see:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't53', which is a terminal. \n\nBut for NT8, there's a rule NT8 \u2192 't48' which is one of the options. Hmm, but the next token in the string is t73, which must come from NT20, as per NT20 \u2192 't73'. So, perhaps the string starts with NT10, which is t53, then NT8 is t73?\n\nWait, no, because the string is t53 t73... So, the first two symbols are t53 and t73.\n\nBut NT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8, so if the first symbol is t53 (from NT10), then NT16 and NT8 need to produce t73 and what follows.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by parsing the string step by step, checking at each step which production rules can generate the required symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the first symbol is t53, which comes from NT10, so the initial derivation is S \u2192 NT10 NT14. But in this case, the string starts with t53, so maybe S is expanding into NT10 NT14. Then, t53 comes from NT10, which is NT16 NT8.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to parse the string as a sequence of symbols and see if each can be derived from the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list the string with indices for clarity:\n\n1: t53\n\n2: t73\n\n3: t48\n\n4: t19\n\n5: t12\n\n6: t19\n\n7: t12\n\n8: t82\n\n9: t70\n\n10: t61\n\n11: t40\n\n12: t39\n\n13: t66\n\n14: t48\n\n15: t12\n\n16: t65\n\n17: t26\n\n18: t53\n\n19: t40\n\n20: t12\n\n21: t17\n\n22: t39\n\n23: t29\n\n24: t40\n\n25: t39\n\n26: t66\n\n27: t26\n\n28: t39\n\n29: t61\n\n30: t12\n\n31: t26\n\n32: t95\n\n33: t43\n\n34: t70\n\n35: t17\n\n36: t19\n\n37: t26\n\n38: t17\n\n39: t70\n\n40: t53\n\n41: t66\n\n42: t48\n\nSo, 42 symbols in total.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT10 NT14 (since S can be derived from several options, but the first symbol is t53 which is NT10 \u2192 t53).\n\nSo, NT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8.\n\nThus, we have t53 (NT10), and then need to derive NT16 and NT8. So the next symbols should be the expansion of NT16 and NT8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT16 has a production: NT16 \u2192 NT7 NT20. So, NT16 would produce symbols based on NT7 and NT20.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 can produce various things like NT4 NT20, 't48', etc.\n\nBut the string's second token is t73, which is from NT20 \u2192 't73'. So, maybe NT16 is producing something leading to t73, but I think perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first two symbols are generated by NT10 \u2192 t53 and NT8 \u2192 t73? Wait, but in the grammar, NT8 can directly produce 't48', but it can also be part of a production like NT8 \u2192 't73' if that line exists, but looking at the grammar, I don't see such a direct production. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nLooking for 't73' in the grammar... Wait, in the list of productions, I see NT20 \u2192 't73' and other terminals. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, NT20 has several rules, including NT20 \u2192 't73' (line: NT20 -> 't73'). So, when NT20 is used, it can produce t73. So, if the second symbol is t73, then NT20 must have been expanded to produce it.\n\nSo, the initial step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT10 NT14\n\nNT10 \u2192 t53\n\nNT14 produces what? Looking at NT14's productions:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT4 NT0 or 't48' or other?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT14's production is:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n\nAnother rule is NT14 \u2192 't48'\n\nBut I'm not seeing a direct 't73' from NT14, but from NT20. So, perhaps I need to think about how the entire sequence can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string is composed of the terminals present in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-706","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and C can also be a terminal or a non-terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string to evaluate is a series of terminals separated by spaces.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the right-hand sides of the productions are all two symbols. So each step in the derivation will double the length of the string. However, for a more efficient approach, I think it's better to use a parsing method that works backward, like checking if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules.\n\nBut before diving into that, let me look at the string: it's a long sequence of terminals, mostly letters followed by numbers, like t16, t29, etc. I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by examining the structure of the grammar and the string. Let's look at the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo S branches into combinations of NTs. Let's look at each possibility:\n\n1. NT12 and NT12: Each NT12 has its own productions. Looking up NT12 in the rules, for example, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8, etc. So I'll need to see if the string can start with either of these.\n\nWait, actually, each NT can produce other NTs or terminals. Let's take the first production: S \u2192 NT12 NT12, which would mean the string needs to start with the result of NT12 and followed by another NT12.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT7 NT14: So the string could start with NT7 and NT14. Or S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nWait, but S in the grammar has three main productions: NT12NT12, NT7NT14, and NT9NT12. So the string must start with either of the results from these NT pairs.\n\nLet me look at the string: the first four tokens are t29, t16, t19, t39. So it starts with t29. Let me see which NT productions could produce t29.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I'm noticing that NT5 \u2192 NT13 NT7, and NT5 appears elsewhere. Also, NT3 has multiple productions, like NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14, etc. I see that NT5 can produce 't39', which is one of the tokens here.\n\nWait, looking at the string's first token, t29. Let's check if any NT can directly produce t29.\n\nLooking at the list of terminal productions, I see entries like:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT3 \u2192 't39'\n- NT2 \u2192 't12'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT12 \u2192 't19'\n- NT4 \u2192 't17'\n- NT5 \u2192 't77' (I think I may have misread, let me check again: Yes, in the list, NT5 can produce 't66', 't39', etc. Wait no, looking closely, under NT5, there's a rule: NT9 \u2192 't77' but that's under NT9, not NT5.

{"custom_id":"request-725","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the starting symbol which can produce terminal strings directly. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t61 t29 t70 t12 t40 t53 t95 t53 t66 t43 t77 t43 t16 t82 t95 t26 t16 t26 t70 t48 t19 t16 t53 t73 t26 t70 t43 t81 t40 t16 t39 t95 t73 t73 t53 t29 t48 t43 t19 t29 t19 t40 t39`.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the string consists of three-letter tokens like 't61', 't29', etc. I should check which of these are terminals and which are non-terminals in the grammar. Looking through the grammar rules, all the 't' followed by numbers up to two digits are terminals, so each token in the string represents a terminal.\n\nNext, I'll try to reconstruct the parse tree starting from the start symbol S. The grammar has three initial rules for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT9 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo, any valid derivation must start with one of these rules. Let's look at the string and see which of these could fit.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't61'. From the grammar, 't61' corresponds to NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10, and NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4. Wait, from the grammar, NT17 is derived from either NT8 NT10 or NT13 NT4. Let's see which of these would give 't61'.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10 leads to t61 (if NT8 \u2192 t61 and NT10 \u2192 t43). Looking at NT10 in the grammar, it's defined as NT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8, and NT16 can produce NT7 NT20, NT20 can be t65 or other options. Wait, perhaps NT10 can eventually produce t43. Let me check: NT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8. NT16 has rules like NT16 \u2192 NT7 NT20, NT20 \u2192 t65, etc. But I'm not sure if that leads to t43. Alternatively, NT10 \u2192 t43 is a direct terminal.\n\nNo, wait, looking through the grammar, the terminals are explicitly defined as:\n- NT4 \u2192 t17\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT20 \u2192 t65 (multiple times)\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT3 \u2192 t81\n- NT8 \u2192 t48\n- NT15 \u2192 t65\n- NT9 \u2192 t77\n- NT7 \u2192 t77? Wait no, NT9 \u2192 t77?\n\nWait, actually, some of the terminals are assigned to rules like NT4 \u2192 't17', so those are individual terminals. So 't17' in the string might correspond to NT4, but in the string, it's 't17' as a token.\n\nWait, no, the string is a sequence of tokens like 't61', 't29', etc., each is a terminal symbol. So each 't' followed by two digits is a terminal.\n\nSo I need to see if the entire string can be generated by any sequence of productions.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t61 t29 t70 t12 t40 t53 t95 t53 t66 t43 t77 t43 t16 t82 t95 t26 t16 t26 t70 t48 t19 t16 t53 t73 t26 t70 t43 t81 t40 t16 t39 t95 t73 t73 t53 t29 t48 t43 t19 t29 t19 t40 t39`.\n\nThat's 43 tokens. Each token must be produced by some production rule.\n\nStarting from S, which is a non-terminal. S can be NT12 NT8, NT9 NT14, or NT9 NT12.\n\nLooking at the first token 't61', which is the result of NT17 \u2192 t61, so NT17 \u2192 t61, but NT17 has two children, so maybe it's not the start.\n\nWait, perhaps start with S \u2192 NT12 NT8. Let's see what NT12 and NT8 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT12 has two rules: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8 and NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8.\n\nLooking for 't61' as the first token, let's see if that can be produced by NT12. NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So if NT17 produces 't61', and NT8 produces a terminal, then the first token would be 't61'.\n\nNT17 can be NT8 NT10 or NT13 NT4.\n\nIf NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10, then NT8 is t48 (from NT8 \u2192 t48) and NT10 is t43. That would make the first two tokens 't48 t43', but the actual string starts with 't61', so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4. NT13 \u2192 NT8 NT5, and NT4 \u2192 t17. So that would produce 't48 t17', which doesn't match 't61'.\n\nSo maybe NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8. Let's see what NT19 can produce.\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT1 NT2. NT1 can produce various things. Let me see what each non-terminal can produce.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's see if any of the start rules can directly lead to the first token 't61'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't61' is the terminal for NT17's production. So NT17 can produce 't61' if another rule leads to it.\n\nWait, but NT17 itself is a non-terminal, so it can only produce a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. But 't61' is a terminal, so NT17 must be a terminal, but in the grammar, NT17 is a non-terminal. Therefore, the string cannot include 't61' as a terminal because NT17 cannot derive directly to 't61' without other symbols.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. NT17 is a non-terminal, but if a rule for NT17 directly produces 't61', then 't61' can appear in the string as a terminal. Looking back at the grammar, checking the productions for NT17:\n\nNT17 -> NT13 NT4\nNT17 -> NT11 NT12\nNT17 -> NT8 NT10\nNT17 -> NT5 NT2\nNT17 -> NT1 NT8\nNT17 -> NT11 NT12\nWait, I only see that NT17 is defined with these rules, but none of them directly produce a terminal except perhaps in the case of NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT4, etc. Wait, maybe I missed a rule where NT17 directly produces a terminal. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17 is only on the left side of rules:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\nNT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10\nNT17 -> NT5 NT2\nNT17 -> NT1 NT8\nNT17 -> NT11 NT12\n\nSo none of these directly produce a terminal; they all require other non-terminals. Therefore, in any derivation, 't61' cannot appear directly because it's not a production of a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-724","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the CFG. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the rules for S involve combining different non-terminals that eventually derive terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is: `t17 t82 t19 t48 t95 t95 t70 t39 t39 t17 t39 t39 t12 t61 t53 t66 t29 t29 t53 t48 t53 t19 t82 t81 t39 t77 t61 t19 t70 t39 t81 t48 t82 t39 t82 t16 t43 t53 t16 t65 t43 t16 t53`.\n\nI notice that each token in the string is either a number or a combination of numbers, which I assume are the terminal symbols in the grammar. The numbers probably represent specific terminals, so I need to check if the entire string can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or simulate the parsing process, but given the complexity, maybe I can look for a pattern or see if there's a way to parse the string step by step.\n\nI'll start by listing the non-terminals and terminals. The terminals are the t followed by numbers, like t17, t82, etc., which I assume cannot be further expanded. The non-terminals are all the NTs like NT1, NT2, etc., which are the left-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce the following combinations:\n\n1. NT12 NT12\n2. NT1 NT14\n3. NT9 NT12\n4. NT9 NT12 (Wait, that's the same as the third, so maybe a typo, perhaps NT19 or something else, but let's check.)\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the productions for S are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nHmm. So S can produce pairs of non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals will then expand further.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to match the rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can find a way to split the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me check the number of tokens in the string. Counting them: \n\nt17 (1), t82 (2), t19 (3), t48 (4), t95 (5), t95 (6), t70 (7), t39 (8), t39 (9), t17 (10), t39 (11), t39 (12), t12 (13), t61 (14), t53 (15), t66 (16), t29 (17), t29 (18), t53 (19), t48 (20), t53 (21), t19 (22), t82 (23), t81 (24), t39 (25), t77 (26), t61 (27), t19 (28), t70 (29), t39 (30), t81 (31), t48 (32), t82 (33), t39 (34), t82 (35), t16 (36), t43 (37), t53 (38), t16 (39), t65 (40), t43 (41), t16 (42), t53 (43).\n\nSo 43 tokens in total.\n\nSince in CNF, each production is exactly two non-terminals, the parse tree will have a structure where each node has exactly two children. Therefore, the number of tokens in the string must be one less than a power of 2 if the entire string is fully parsed. However, 43 is not a power of 2 minus one (since 2^6=64, 64-1=63, which is larger than 43). So perhaps the string isn't fully parsed, but we need to check if it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by leftmost derivation. Maybe I can try building a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a starting point. Let's look for the beginning of the string and see if it can match any production.\n\nThe first token is t17. I need to see if any production rule starts with t17.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT17 -> NT13 NT4, and NT17 -> NT11 NT12, and NT17 -> NT20 NT17, and others. So t17 can be derived from a combination of NT17 and something else, but t17 is a terminal? Wait, no, t17 is a terminal symbol because it's just t17, which is a token in the string.\n\nSo, wait, perhaps I need to check if any production rule directly has t17 as a terminal, but looking at the grammar, it seems that the productions are all non-terminals combining. So all the tokens like t17 are terminals, meaning they must appear as the result of some non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, that's a key point. The tokens in the string are terminals, so each token must correspond to a production where that non-terminal directly produces that terminal. But looking at the grammar, all productions are of non-terminals into other non-terminals. There are no productions that directly produce a terminal symbol except for the ones that terminate, perhaps.\n\nWait, no, I think all productions are for non-terminals, so each non-terminal eventually must produce one or more terminals. So, for a token like t17, there must be a production where, through some chain, a non-terminal eventually produces t17.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each t-number is a single terminal, so each token in the string must be matched exactly by a terminal in the non-terminal expansion.\n\nSo, the first step is to check each token to see if it is on the right-hand side of any production. Since all productions are non-terminals, the immediate next step is to see if the token is a non-terminal, but since tokens like t17 are terminals, I need to find a path where a non-terminal eventually produces t17.\n\nBut this could get complex. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be produced through some sequence of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying to split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the entire string is a valid derivation, possibly by using a recursive method or memoization, but given the time, maybe I can look for known patterns.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens start with t17, then t82, t19, etc. Let me see if I can find any known sequence in the productions.\n\nLooking at the production S -> NT7 NT14. Let's see what NT7 and NT14 produce.\n\nFrom the productions:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT11\n\nNT2 -> NT11 NT17\n\nNT17 -> NT13 NT4\n\nNT13 -> NT12 NT19\n\nNT12 -> NT19 NT8\n\nNT19 -> NT1 NT2\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT8\n\nNT9 -> NT6 NT9\n\nNT6 -> NT3 NT21\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT14\n\nNT5 -> NT15 NT4\n\nWait, this seems like a chain.

But NT0 -> NT6 NT10. NT6 -> NT3 NT21. NT3 -> NT5 NT14. NT5 -> NT15 NT4. NT15 is a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT15 is on the left of the production NT15 -> 't82' (from the grammar line: NT15 -> 't82'), so t15 is t82.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT15 -> 't82'\n\nYes, so NT15 produces t82.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 -> 't14' because NT3 -> 't14'.\n\nWait, in the grammar"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-735","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's see, where do I start?\n\nFirst, let me take a look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it has specific rules about how the left-hand side and right-hand sides are structured. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo, S can be broken down into two non-terminals connected by a space, and each of those non-terminals can be further broken down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nNext, I should check the string to be analyzed. The string is: \n\nt43 t82 t16 t81 t61 t17 t66 t73 t66 t40 t16 t16 t17 t17 t29 t73 t66 t16 t43 t65 t48 t66 t26 t95 t17 t19 t66 t82 t77 t40 t29 t40 t40 t95 t29 t61 t70 t43 t39 t65 t39 t43 t95 t73.\n\nI notice that each element is a two-letter token like t43, t82, etc. So, the string is a sequence of these tokens. My goal is to see if these tokens can be derived from the grammar, starting from S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step increases the number of symbols. Each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. However, terminals can only appear on the right-hand side as single terminals, so they don't split further.\n\nGiven that, I'll need to build a parse tree for the string, ensuring each step follows one of the provided productions.\n\nLet me list out all the production rules that end with a terminal (since terminals are on the right-hand side as single symbols). This should help in mapping the string tokens to the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are the productions that result in terminals:\n- NT12 \u2192 t12\n- NT16 \u2192 t70\n- NT3 \u2192 t16\n- NT3 \u2192 t29\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT12 \u2192 t26 (Wait, no, looking back, it's NT12->'t12' which is t12, not t26. Maybe I misread earlier. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, some rules produce terminals.

This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain algorithms applicable, like the CYK algorithm. However, I'm not sure I can apply CYK here directly because the string consists of a bunch of terminals, and I need to map how they could have been derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me look more closely at the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all from S to various combinations of non-terminals. For example, S can produce NT12 NT12, or others. Each of these non-terminals has their own productions. The interesting part is that some of these non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols like 't29', 't39', etc.\n\nSo, the approach is to check if each token in the string can be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar through some sequence of productions. Essentially, each token must correspond to a production that directly outputs that token or a non-terminal that can eventually derive it.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't29'. Let me check the grammar to see which non-terminals produce 't29'. Scanning through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT13 -> 't82'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT19 -> 't61'\n- NT20 -> 't10 -> t43' \u2192 Wait, looking back, NT20 has several productions. I see NT20 -> 't65', which is another terminal, so that's not 't29'. \n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see that NT13 has the production NT13 -> 't82', and other rules like NT2 -> 't21', which isn't helpful. Wait, I need to look for 't29' specifically.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't16' (Wait, no, looking more carefully: NT3 has some rules like NT3 -> 't29'?)\nWait, no. Let me scan the grammar again. Wait, in the grammar, under NT3, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT14\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT0\n- NT3 -> NT7 NT20\n- NT3 -> NT4 NT20\n- etc.\n\nHmm, not seeing 't29' directly from NT3. Wait, another look: \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT5 has some productions:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT5 -> NT13 NT7\n- NT5 -> NT15 NT4\n\nHmm. Hmm, is 't29' produced directly by any non-terminal? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several NTs with direct terminals:\n\n- NT2 -> 't21' \u2192 Wait, no, 't21' is another token. Wait, no\u2014looking carefully:\n\nWait, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't16' (Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's go back.)\n\nWait, the user provided a very long grammar. Let me look for any direct terminal productions.\n\nI see lines like:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT14 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29' (Wait, looking through the productions, yes, I see ND3 -> 't29').\n\nYes! So NT3 can produce 't29'. Great. So the first token 't29' can be generated by NT3.\n\nNow, moving to the next token: 't61'. Similarly, I'll check the grammar for NTs that produce 't61'. Looking through the rules, I see NT21 can produce 't61' via NT21 -> 't61'.\n\nWait, let me confirm: in the productions, I see NT17 -> 't61' as well. So NT17 can produce 't61'.\n\nSo, 't61' can come from either NT21 or NT17.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nNext token: 't16'. Let's see. NT3 can produce 't16' via NT3 -> 't16'.\n\nThen 't66'. Checking the grammar, I see NT15 and NT4 can produce 't66':\n\n- NT15 -> 't82' and 't65', but wait, looking carefully, under NT4, there's NT4 -> 't66', so NT4 can produce 't66'.\n\nYes, so 't66' is from NT4.\n\nNext 't66' again, same as above.\n\nNext 't77'. Let's see. Checking the grammar, I see NT7 -> 't77' via NT7 -> 't77'.\n\nThen 't73'. Hmm. Checking, I see NT17 -> 't73' via NT17 -> 't73'.\n\nNext 't66' again from NT4.\n\nNext 't81'. Let's check for NT that produces 't81'. Looking through the productions, I see NT15 -> 't81' via NT20 -> NT10 -> 't43'? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT20 -> 't43' is a direct terminal. But looking for 't81', I see NT15 -> 't81' via NT15 -> NT21 NT8? Or perhaps looking directly for 't81', I see:\n\nWait, in the list, NT5 -> 't39', NT12 -> 't12', NT20 -> 't65', and so on. Wait, perhaps NT15 -> 't81' comes from somewhere else. Alternatively, I might be missing something. Let me look for 't81' in the terminal productions. Hmm, in the list, I see 't81' as a terminal in the production NT15 -> 't81'? Wait, no. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nIn the production NT15-> 't15' doesn't produce anything. Wait, looking again, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammars, under NT20, there's 't81' as a terminal? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT15 -> 't82' (multiple times) and NT5 -> 't39', etc. Wait, perhaps I missed 't81' as a terminal in any production. Alternatively, maybe it's produced via a non-terminal. So let's see, is there a non-terminal that can derive 't81'? \n\nLooking at the productions, perhaps NT15 can produce 't81' via a rule. Wait, I think I see a rule: NT21 -> 't61', but that's already used. Alternatively, perhaps NT15 is derived via other means. Let me think, perhaps via NT19.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, NT19 -> 't61', but that's not 't81'. Hmm. Alternatively, NT19 might produce other things. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, I see in the later lines:\n\n- NT3 -> 't81' (Yes, under NT3 we have NT3-> 't81' via NT3-> 't81'. So yes, NT3 can produce 't81'.\n\nSo, 't81' comes from NT3.\n\nContinuing, next tokens: 't70', 't39', 't17', 't16', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nBut given the length of the string, that's impractical manually. Alternatively, I can look for any tokens in the string that are not directly produced by any non-terminal.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, and the start symbol S can produce two non-terminals, which in turn can eventually produce terminals.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, which can produce different combinations of non-terminals. Each production rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo S can branch into several possibilities. Then each of these non-terminals (NT12, NT7, NT9, etc.) can be broken down further into other non-terminals or terminals, which are represented by letters like t or NT followed by a number.\n\nThe string to verify is a sequence of terminals: t66, t66, t81, t19, t48, t73, t66, t53, t19, t70, t26, t95, t12, t53, t66, t95, t12, t82, t16, t73, t53, t81, t12, t26, t29, t43, t16, t26, t19, t81, t16, t77, t39, t81, t61, t95, t65, t82, t70, t61, t29, t70, t73, t40, t29.\n\nWow, that's a long string. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can try to construct a parse tree step by step. But given the string's length, maybe a recursive approach or seeing if the string can be parsed step by step.\n\nLet me see if I can start by breaking down the string into smaller parts.

Because each production leads to a series of terminals, and since it's CNF, each rule produces two symbols, either both non-terminals or a terminal and something else, but in CNF, each rule is two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So some non-terminals produce two non-terminals, and others produce a single terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, the way it's written seems to break down into rules that sometimes have just a single terminal, but in the provided rules, all appear to have two non-terminals except perhaps some.\n\nWait, for example, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, which are both non-terminals. But for example, I don't see any production like NT3 \u2192 't66' directly, but let's check.\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules, the only terminals I see are:\n\nt66, t66, t81, t19, t48, t73, t66, t53, t19, t70, t26, t95, t12, t53, t66, t95, t12, t82, t16, t73, t53, t81, t12, t26, t29, t43, t16, t26, t19, t81, t16, t77, t39, t81, t61, t95, t65, t82, t70, t61, t29, t70, t73, t40, t29.\n\nSo each of these symbols must be produced by a production that ends in a single terminal.\n\nSo, for the string to be in the language, it must be possible to parse it by starting at S, and each step splitting into two symbols, either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? Wait no, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, where B and C can be non-terminals or terminals, but in the case of terminals, it's considered a single symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a bit more complicated. Let me think again: in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C are each either a terminal or a non-terminal. So, each step in the derivation produces either two non-terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal. But in the case of a terminal, the production would be A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each step must break down the string into symbols that can be produced by the grammar's rules, starting from S.\n\nGiven the length of the string, it's a bit involved, but perhaps I can try to see if the string is even possible by looking at the counts of each terminal symbol and seeing if the grammar can generate them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to try to see if the string can be divided into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet's start by checking the first few symbols.\n\nThe string starts with t66, t66. Let's see if these can be produced by any production.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these starts with a non-terminal. So S produces NT12 NT12, which then can each produce something.

{"custom_id":"request-738","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem in front of me where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's given. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to check if a string follows the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t73 t12 t43 t40 t40 t26 t70 t12 t70 t53 t40 t61 t43 t73 t12 t16 t95 t39 t12 t81 t70 t61 t61 t16 t40 t70 t82 t66 t12 t17 t39 t66 t77 t19 t12 t48 t66 t82 t19 t70 t77 t17 t26 t61 t39`.\n\nI notice that all the elements are two-character tokens, each looking like it's the result of a production that ends in a terminal symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals except for the terminal productions.\n\nLet me list out the productions from the grammar provided. Some key ones to note:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT12 NT14, etc.\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, and so on.\n- There are also several terminal productions, like NT12 \u2192 't12', NT14 \u2192 't43', etc.\n\nWait, hold on. The productions are like A \u2192 NTx NTy, except for when they are terminals, which are A \u2192 'something'. So the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each of which must correspond to the end of a production when it's applied.\n\nI think the strategy here is to work backwards from the string, matching each token to the possible productions.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into individual terminal tokens:\n\nt73, t12, t43, t40, t40, t26, t70, t12, t70, t53, t40, t61, t43, t73, t12, t16, t95, t39, t12, t81, t70, t61, t61, t16, t40, t70, t82, t66, t12, t17, t39, t66, t77, t19, t12, t48, t66, t82, t19, t70, t77, t17, t26, t61, t39.\n\nFirst, let's see what the start symbol S expands into. Looking back at the grammar, the initial productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT12 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nWait, so S can start with NT12, NT14, or NT9. But in the string, the first token is t73. So I need to check if there's a production that starts with NT12, which can expand into t73.\n\nLooking at the productions involving NT12:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\nNT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\nNT4 \u2192 't40' and others. Wait, but NT4 is a non-terminal, which can expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should draw the derivation tree in reverse. Let's start from the end of the string.\n\nThe last token is t39. Let's see what can produce t39.\n\nLooking at the productions, there's NT19 \u2192 ... etc. Wait, looking at the rules for T:\n\nIn the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't39' (But wait, NT5 isn't a terminal. Let's check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, for NT5: `NT5 -> 't39'` appears twice. So NT5 can produce 't39'. So if a part of the string ends with t39, that might correspond to NT5.\n\nBut let's backtrack the string from the end.\n\nThe last token is t39. So perhaps the last part of the string is generated by a production that ends with NT5 \u2192 't39'. So the last step before the string ends might be something that produces t39.\n\nBut looking at the string, the last token is t39, so that's from the production NT5 \u2192 't39'.\n\nNow, before that, we have t70. So before the t39, the string goes ... t70 t39. So t70 is a terminal, but looking at the grammar, t70 is a terminal symbol? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar is given as a series of rules. Let's check which rules have 't70' as a terminal. Looking through the productions, I don't see any rule that directly produces t70. Instead, for example, NT70 is not a non-terminal because I don't see a rule for NT70. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking again, in the list of productions, NT17 \u2192 't61' or 't17', etc. There's a rule NT70 \u2192 't70'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list, yes, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT21\nNT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5\nWait, wait, but I see later on:\n\nLooking more carefully through the rules provided, I see several NT... \u2192 't...', but maybe I need to find if any NT ends with 't70'.\n\nLooking:\n\nNo, in the grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces 't70' as a terminal. So if the string has 't70', that would mean that it's produced by some NT \u2192 't70', which I don't see.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps 't70' is a result of a production like NT70 -> 't70', but I don't see that in the grammar. So maybe this could be a problem.\n\nHmm, wait, but in the grammar provided, let me re-express all the rules to see if any produce 't70':\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT12\n- NT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4\n- The rules for T5 are:\n`NT15 -> 't82'`\n`NT5 -> 't39'` (twice)\n`NT4 -> 't17'` and others\n- Other rules include `NT16 -> 't70'`.\n\nWait, yes! I see a rule `NT16 -> 't70'`. So NT16 can produce 't70'. So the token 't70' in the string must come from NT16 \u2192 't70'.\n\nSo in the string, before 't39', we have 't70 t39'. So the last step is:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't39'\n\nAnd before that, the production must have been S \u2192 NT12 NT14, then NT14 is split into other parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to build the entire string step by step. But given the length of the string, it's going to be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if the string is generated by the grammar by verifying that the length of the string and the structure fit.\n\nIn CNF, the maximum length of any string derived from a non-terminal is 2. Wait no, because in CNF, each production is two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So the derivation tree will have a binary structure, so the length of the derived string will be 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied at each level.\n\nWait, but since the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each must have been expanded from a series of productions.\n\nBut this method might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, let's think about the start variable S and its possible expansions.\n\nFrom the start S, possible expansions are NT12 NT12, NT12 NT14, or NT9 NT12.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't73'. Let's see if any production from NT12, NT14, or NT9 can end with 't73'.\n\nLooking up the productions:\n\nLooking for NT where NT \u2192 ends with 't73'.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nI see NT73 \u2192 ...? Wait, no production for NT73 as a terminal. Wait, does any NT produce 't73'?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nYes, I see NT73 \u2192 ... wait, no, the productions in the grammar are in the form of NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-747","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar. The start symbol is S. Let's see which options S has. The productions for S are:\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\nWait, no, the grammar actually has S -> NT12 NT12, but wait, looking again, the user wrote S -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, and S -> NT9 NT12. So S can generate different combinations of two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals, like NT12, probably leads to a series of productions until they reach terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. I'll list them out as a list to analyze each step:\n['t61', 't29', 't29', 't95', 't29', 't70', 't26', 't81', 't29', 't19', 't48', 't66', 't39', 't29', 't53', 't95', 't61', 't40', 't77', 't26', 't81', 't95', 't61', 't17', 't29', 't81', 't82', 't61', 't81', 't40', 't16', 't65', 't95', 't70', 't82', 't12', 't53', 't82', 't53', 't17', 't39', 't73', 't16', 't16', 't95', 't48']\n\nNow, I'll start breaking down the string by the grammar rules. Let's see if the entire string can be parsed using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. Let's see if the first part of the string corresponds to any of these.\n\nThe first token is 't61'. Looking through the grammar, 't61' occurs in several productions. For example, NT17 -> 't61', NT13 -> 't82', but I don't see 't61' in the left-hand sides of non-terminals. Wait, actually, looking back, the productions do include some terminals. For example, NT17 -> 't61' and NT39 -> 't61'?\n\nWait, let me check. Looking through the grammar rules more carefully, I see NT17 is derived into 't61', and also NT17 -> NT11 NT4, and NT4 can produce 't17', but I'm not sure if that path will take it to 't61'. Alternatively, other non-terminals might produce 't61'.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT17 can be derived into 't61', and NT15 -> 't82', so maybe that's part of the path. Hmm, perhaps I need to backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step, choosing which non-terminals can produce which terminals, and see if the entire string can be built up from S.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's note that each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. Since all productions are in CNF, each step of derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and eventually, these will be terminals.\n\nSo the string length is 41 tokens. Each S production splits into two non-terminals. So starting from S, which is two non-terminals, each of those can split into two each, leading to four, and so on. The total number of leaves (terminals) should be 2^n, where n is the number of splits. However, 41 is not a power of two, which suggests that maybe the string is not possible because each split doubles the number of tokens, leading to a string length that is a power of two.\n\nWait, let's see: the initial S splits into two parts, each of which can split into two, etc. So the number of terminals would be 2^k, where k is the number of steps. For the first step, 2^1 = 2, next 2^2 = 4, up to 2^5=32, 2^6=64. 41 is in between 32 and 64, so it's not a power of two, which is a problem because each production in CNF leads to a binary tree, hence the number of terminals must be a power of two.\n\nIn our case, the string has 41 tokens, which is not a power of two. For example, 32 is 2^5, 64 is 2^6, so 41 isn't a power of two, so it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Is there any possibility that the number of tokens could be 41 for a different starting rule? Wait, regardless of the starting rule, each production splits into two, so the number of tokens after each level is 2^1, 2^2, etc. So 41 can't be achieved because it's not a power of two.\n\nThus, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 41 tokens, which is not a power of two. Each production in the grammar results in a binary tree, leading to a number of terminal tokens that must be a power of two.

{"custom_id":"request-748","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a terminal. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and from the productions, I can see there are a few initial options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12 (but wait, looking again, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT12 NT8, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, and S \u2192 NT9 NT12)\nWait, on closer inspection, the user input has \"S -> NT12 NT12 NT8\" which doesn't look right because in CNF each production should have exactly two non-terminals. So perhaps that's a typo. But looking at the actual productions, S's first production is S \u2192 NT12 NT8, which is two non-terminals. Similarly, S \u2192 NT7 NT14 and S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nSo the start production is S \u2192 NT12 NT8, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, and S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nEach of these options splits S into two non-terminals that need to be expanded further until we reach terminals. Since the string consists solely of terminals (e.g., t17, t40, etc.), each step in the derivation must substitute non-terminals with other non-terminals until the entire string is built.\n\nGiven the string: t17 t17 t40 t16 t26 t48 t81 t29 t43 t40 t16 t77 t73 t26 t70 t53 t82 t95 t53 t65 t48 t39 t12 t65 t16 t17 t65 t53 t77 t81 t16 t19 t12 t26 t16 t73 t73 t95 t82 t17 t81 t12 t17 t17 t39 t16.\n\nMy approach is to build a parse tree that generates this string, using the grammar rules to see if each step can derive the next part of the string. Alternatively, maybe it's too time-consuming to build the parse tree manually, so perhaps looking for patterns or recursion in the grammar could help.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be generated step by step. Let me list the terminals:\n\nt17, t17, t40, t16, t26, t48, t81, t29, t43, t40, t16, t77, t73, t26, t70, t53, t82, t95, t53, t65, t48, t39, t12, t65, t16, t17, t65, t53, t77, t81, t16, t19, t12, t26, t16, t73, t73, t95, t82, t17, t81, t12, t17, t17, t39, t16.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t17 t17. Let's look at the grammar to see where t17 comes from. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT17 appears in several places. Let me list all NT17 productions:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\n- NT17 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12\n- NT17 \u2192 NT20 NT17\n- NT17 \u2192 NT6 NT6\n\nAnd it also appears in the right-hand side of NT17, so the productions are spread throughout the grammar.\n\nWait, let me make a list specifically for NT17:\n\n1. NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\n2. NT17 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n3. NT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12\n4. NT17 \u2192 NT20 NT17\n5. NT17 \u2192 NT6 NT6\n\nSo, t17 could be the result of certain expansions. Let me see if the first two t17s in the string can be generated.\n\nAssuming the first t17 comes from expanding NT17. Let's see: in the grammar, NT17 is derived from NT13 and NT4, or NT5 and NT2, or NT11 and NT12, or NT20 and NT17 (which would require further expansion as NT17 again), or NT6 and NT6.\n\nLet me think. If each t17 is derived from NT17 \u2192 t17. So how does NT17 become terminal t17? Looking through the grammar, I don't see an immediate production for NT17 \u2192 t17. So perhaps t17 is derived from a deeper structure. Let me check each production of NT17:\n\nLooking at NT17's productions, none directly produce t17 as a terminal. Instead, NT17 is split into two non-terminals. So perhaps t17 is built from multiple steps.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, many NTs have productions that result in t17. For example, NT17 appears in NT17 \u2192 NT5 NT2, and NT5 has productions like NT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4, which would then involve more NTs.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Perhaps I should look for which S productions can generate parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a leftmost derivation step by step would help.\n\nLet's try to see if the string can be built starting from S.\n\nS can be replaced by S \u2192 NT7 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12, or S \u2192 NT12 NT8.\n\nLet me check which one fits the start.\n\nThe string starts with t17 t17. Let's see if any of these S's can result in two t17s.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT12 NT8: NT12 and NT8.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT12:\n\n- NT12 has multiple productions, including NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8 (which is t17 followed by t8). Hmm, that would give t17 t8 as a part. But in the string, the first part is t17 t17, so maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT9 NT12: NT9 and NT12.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions: NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9. So that would require more expansions. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT7 NT14: NT7 and NT14.\n\nLooking at NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11, so after expansion, NT7 becomes NT2 NT11.\n\nBut let me check NT7's productions. Looking through the grammar, NT7 is in several places, but specifically, NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11, which is a two non-terminals. However, the string starts with t17, which suggests that either the leftmost or another production starts with NT17.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first production is not S \u2192 NT12 NT8, but S \u2192 NT7 NT14.\n\nWait, if S \u2192 NT7 NT14, then NT7 and NT14 need to generate the two t17s.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions, NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11. Then NT2 and NT11 need to derive parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, if S \u2192 NT12 NT8, and NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, which gives t17 t8. So that would match the first two t17 and t8, but the string starts with t17 t17, so maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe using the CYK algorithm, but that would take a lot of time. Alternatively, let's try to find a possible parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a recursive descent parser or seeing if any part of the string can be recursively generated.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first occurrence is t17 t17 t40 t16... So, perhaps the first two t17s can come from something like NT17 \u2192 t17 NT... but since I don't see a production for NT17 \u2192 t17, that's not possible. So maybe NT17 can be expanded in a way that eventually leads to t17.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t17 is part of a larger production that expands into multiple terminals, including t17.\n\nWait, maybe I should focus on specific parts of the string. Let's see if t17 can be embedded in the grammar.\n\nFor example, let's look at a production where t17 is produced.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the production rules. \n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar. The start symbol is S, and it has several production rules. Looking at the rules, I notice that S can produce combinations of NT followed by other NT symbols. For example, S -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, etc. Each of these NT symbols has their own production rules and some are terminal symbols (like 't95', 't53', etc.). \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols: t43, t61, t77, t29, t43, t48, t17, t40, t40, t26, t12, t26, t95, t43, t29, t40, t48, t53, t65, t17, t12, t53, t12, t61, t12, t12, t53, t19, t17, t81, t12, t26, t73, t77, t70, t12, t73, t16, t95, t48, t70, t77, t40, t29, t70, t66, t82.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is either a terminal or two non-terminals. Therefore, any valid string must be a concatenation of terminal symbols, and each non-terminal in the derivation must split into two non-terminals until we get to terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some NT symbols are terminals, like t43, t26, t53, etc. Others are non-terminals and can produce other NT symbols. So, to parse the string, each segment must correspond to a derivation path.\n\nI'll start by listing all the terminal symbols in the input string: t43, t61, t77, t29, t43, t48, t17, t40, t40, t26, t12, t26, t95, t43, t29, t40, t48, t53, t65, t17, t12, t53, t12, t61, t12, t12, t53, t19, t17, t81, t12, t26, t73, t77, t70, t12, t73, t16, t95, t48, t70, t77, t40, t29, t70, t66, t82.\n\nThat's a lot, but let's look for any that might be impossible. For example, some terminals have multiple derivations:\n\n- t43: Looking at the rules, t43 is the terminal; I don't see any NT43 in the grammar. Wait, NT22? No, NT20 is t65. Wait, looking through the rules, let me check if any NT symbol directly produces t43. It seems there's an NT20 -> 't65', NT10 -> 't53', NT5 -> 't39', NT15 -> 't82', NT7 -> 't77', etc. But I don't see any NT rule that produces t43 except maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking through the rules, some NT rules end with some terminals. Like NT20 -> 't10'... Wait, actually, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nNT8 -> 't48'\n\nNT15 -> 't82'\n\nNT20 -> 't65' and 't10' (I think the 't65' is from another rule). Wait, in the initial grammar, NT12 is defined as NT12 -> 't12', so 't12' is a terminal. Similarly, NT6 -> 't3' and 't21', etc. Also, some NTs produce other NTs, like NT16 -> NT16 NT4, which suggests recursion or multiplication.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, every terminal in the string must be a direct terminal in some NT production.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't43'. Wait, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces t43. The NT rules I see produce things like t12, t43 is actually NT77? Wait, no, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT symbol that directly produces t43.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me look through all the NT rules.\n\nWait, the rule NT19 -> NT1 NT2. Hmm, no, not t43. NT22? No. Let's see: NT7 -> 't77'? Yes, the initial rule is NT7 -> 't77' because in the grammar, NT7 is defined as -> t77. Similarly, I think there are multiple NTs that produce terminals.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, the user listed all the NT production rules, but I need to parse through them to find any NT that produces t43.\n\nLooking through the initial grammar:\n\nLooking for any line where NTx -> 't43'.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n\n- NT7 -> 't77'\n\nLooking through more:\n\nNT10 -> 't43' ?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe initial grammar:\n\nLooking specifically for terminals like t43:\n\nAh! I see here: NT10 -> 't43' (in the line \"NT10 -> 't43'\"). Similarly, NT22: No, it's not in the list. Wait, I need to check all NT rules for t43.\n\nLooking through all lines:\n\nLooking for any NT rule where the right-hand side is 't43' or any other combination that leads to 't43'.\n\nYes, I spot a few places:\n\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n\n- NT22: Not present? Let me check the initial grammar list. Wait, looking through the entire list, no, I don't see NT22. So the only NT that directly produces 't43' is NT10.\n\nSimilarly, t43 appears as NT10.\n\nSo in the input string, the fourth symbol is 't43'. So that could be NT10.\n\nNext, let's look at the structure.\n\nThe string starts with t43, t61, t77, etc.\n\nGiven that t43 is NT10, let's see what the production for NT10 is. The initial grammar has:\n\nLooking for NT10:\n\nIn the initial list, NT10 is written as NT10 -> 't43' and others. Let me find it.\n\nYes, in the initial list, I see:\n\nNT10 -> 't43' and NT10 -> 't53' from multiple rules, but specifically, looking for t43:\n\nYes, one of the lines is \"NT10 -> 't43'\".\n\nSo, t43 can only be directly derived from NT10.\n\nSo, the first symbol 't43' is derived from NT10.\n\nThen, the next symbol is t61. So, after NT10, we'll have another NT production that leads to t61. Let's check what produces t61.\n\nLooking through the NT production rules, I see NT17 -> 't61' (since in the grammar, one rule is NT17 -> 't61').\n\nSo, t61 is from NT17.\n\nNow, so after 't43' comes 't61' which is derived from NT17.\n\nSo, the first two symbols correspond to NT10 -> NT17 something?

So, the grammar's rules must somehow generate a sequence that starts with t43, then t61, etc., all the way through.

{"custom_id":"request-762","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by looking at the grammar and the string carefully.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol. The start symbol here is S. The string we need to evaluate is a series of terminals separated by spaces, each looking like 'tXX', where XX is a number.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the grammar structure. From S, the productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nWait, no, looking again, it's S \u2192 NT12 NT12 and similar for others, but in the initial part, the start symbol might be producing multiple NTs. Each NT eventually derives a 't' followed by a number, which are the terminal symbols in the string.\n\nI need to build a parse tree for the string starting from S. Let's check the first few symbols to see which production of S could generate them.\n\nThe string starts with t65. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce t's. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12', which is present in the string. Similarly, NT14 \u2192 't65' is not in the rule above; wait, looking at the rules, NT4 \u2192 't65' and NT20 \u2192 't65'. Also, NT14 \u2192 't40'... Hmm, need to map each tXX to its possible NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each 't' is associated with specific non-terminals. For example:\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT14 \u2192 't40'\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n- NT7 \u2192 't61'\n- NT4 and NT20 produce 't65'\n- Others: NT21 't61', NT17 't53', NT19 't19', etc.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t65. Which NT produces that? Looking, for instance, NT4 \u2192 t65 and NT20 \u2192 t65. So S \u2192 NT4 and NT20 or any other combination as per the rules.\n\nWait, S's first production is S \u2192 NT12 NT12, which produces two t12's. The first symbol is t65, so the first production of S can't be S \u2192 NT12 NT12 because that would start with t12, not t65. So maybe S \u2192 NT9 NT12?\n\nLooking back, S's productions:\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nWait, that's the only productions for S? No, looking again, the initial part of the grammar shows S having three productions. Let me list them again:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nWait, that's only three rules. But the rest of the grammar is for these NTs, so each NT eventually derives a 't' with a number. So the string starts with t65. So the first NT must be one that produces t65, like NT4 or NT20.\n\nBut S can produce either of those as its first production if it's split appropriately. For example, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, perhaps NT7 is t65 and NT14 is t61? Let's see.\n\nWait, I need to construct a parse tree. Let me consider the string's length and see which S rules can handle it. The string has 35 symbols. Since each S production uses two NTs, which each produce one terminal, that would be 2 per production.\n\nBut wait, some non-terminals might be recursive and produce multiple terminals? No, in this grammar, every NT eventually directly produces a terminal (as per the given list towards the end of the grammar, many NTs like NT21, NT17, etc., have productions leading to terminals). So each NT derivation is a single terminal.\n\nTherefore, each production at each level contributes one terminal. So since the string has 35 terminals, and each S production contributes two, the depth of the parse tree must correspond to 35 \/ 2, but that's not necessarily an integer. Wait, but the grammar can have multiple levels. So perhaps the parse tree has multiple levels, and each NT can be expanded to multiple steps, but ultimately to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, since each NT is directly producing a terminal, the parse tree depth would be equal to the number of NTs, and the string's length would be equal to the number of NTs. But S itself is two NTs, so each time we expand, it's two NTs, each contributing one terminal. Wait, but looking at the rule production, each NT is on the left, but derived through other NTs. For example, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, and then NT17 and NT8 can be further expanded.\n\nWait, no, each production is for a non-terminal to two non-terminals until it eventually becomes a terminal. So each NT is a binary tree of NTs until it yields a terminal.\n\nSo the entire derivation is a tree of productions, each splitting into two NTs until you reach a terminal.\n\nThus, the string length should be equal to the number of terminals, which is 35. Since each NT in the production rules leads eventually to a single terminal, the number of terminal symbols in the derivation would be the number of leaves, which depends on the structure.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for the start symbol and see if the string can be partitioned into substrings that match the possible S productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t65 t61 t12 t77 t73 t19 t39 t65 t53 t19 t43 t40 t26 t40 t77 t39 t39 t61 t17 t53 t77 t40 t53 t66 t73 t77 t81 t39 t82 t53 t29 t19 t43 t81 t81 t66 t66 t53 t81 t16 t43 t48 t19 t19 t16 t61 t73.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, that's 35 terms, right? Let me count again:\n\nt65, t61, t12, t77, t73, t19, t39, t65, t53, t19, t43, t40, t26, t40, t77, t39, t39, t61, t17, t53, t77, t40, t53, t66, t73, t77, t81, t39, t82, t53, t29, t19, t43, t81, t81, t66, t66, t53, t81, t16, t43, t48, t19, t19, t16, t61, t73.\n\nThat's 35 terms. But each S production contributes two NTs, each of which is a single terminal. So a single S production can't produce 35 terminals; that would require multiple recursive expansions. But the start symbol S is just two NTs, both of which must be terminals in the end.\n\nWait, no. The S production is S \u2192 NT ... NT, each NT must ultimately derive to a terminal. So each S application adds two terminal steps. Wait, perhaps the parse tree depth isn't directly tied to the number of terminals, but rather the structure of the NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a parse tree and see if the string can be divided into substrings that fit the possible S productions.\n\nLet me start by considering S's first symbol. The string starts with t65. So the first NT in S's production must produce t65.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NTs produce t65? Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 t65\n- NT4 \u2192 t65\n\nSo, possible NTs for the first symbol t65 could be either NT4 or NT20. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT4 and then NT4 must derive to t65. Wait, no, NT4 is a non-terminal. NT4 directly produces 't65'. So the first production would be S \u2192 NT4 NTsomething.\n\nWait, wait, the S productions are S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12. So for S to produce the string, the first two NTs in S's expansion must be one of these combinations. For example, if S uses S \u2192 NT9 NT12, then the first NT is NT9,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The CFG is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is quite long, so it might take some time to break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has several production rules that directly produce terminal symbols.

Like NT12 -> 't12', NT10 -> 't53', etc. So the string is a sequence of these 't' strings. The string is: 't53 t81 t73 t39 t73 t65 t82 t77 t43 t81 t16 t81 t82 t40 t29 t29 t65 t39 t19 t82 t17 t39 t40 t70 t53 t70 t81 t61 t17 t12 t77 t39 t82 t40 t19 t95 t65 t77 t16 t61 t53 t48 t61 t17 t61 t61 t16 t81'.\n\nI need to check if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll see if the non-terminals correspond to the terminals in the string. But looking at the grammar, some of the production rules have terminals on the right-hand side. For example, NT12 -> 't12', so any 't12' in the string must come from NT12.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, there's a 't12' at the end. So that must come from NT12.\n\nSimilarly, 't53' appears, which comes from NT10 (looking at the grammar: NT10 -> 't53').

Maybe a better approach is to parse the string starting from S.\n\nBut given the length, it's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps we can notice that some sequences are impossible because of the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is made up of certain terminals that can only come from specific NT rules, and whether those can be broken down into the grammar.\n\nBut this seems complex. Another approach could be to try to write a parse tree step by step, but that's time-consuming.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that S branches into two non-terminals, and each branch must produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, the string can be split into pairs of sequences, each generated by each branch of an S production.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT12 NT12 would split the string into two parts, each generated by NT12.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT10 NT14 would split into NT10 (t53) and NT14.\n\nWait, looking at the string, it starts with t53 t81 t73 t39 t73 t65 t82 t77 t43 t81 t16 t81 t82 t40 t29 t29 t65 t39 t19 t82 t17 t39 t40 t70 t53 t70 t81 t61 t17 t12 t77 t39 t82 t40 t19 t95 t65 t77 t16 t61 t53 t48 t61 t17 t61 t61 t16 t81.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT10, NT14.

{"custom_id":"request-770","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and the string provided is a series of terminals and non-terminals separated by spaces. \n\nThe string given is quite long, but I notice that some of the non-terminals in the grammar directly produce terminal symbols. For example:\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n- And so on.\n\nI should probably parse the string by trying to match these terminal symbols to the corresponding non-terminals. The idea is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can apply the productions to generate the entire string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has three productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSince the string starts with 't53', I need to see which production of S can lead to that. Let's check each production:\n\n1. NT12: Looking at the grammar, NT12 can be derived from NT17 NT8.\n2. NT7: NT7 can go to NT7 NT12 or other non-terminals eventually leading to 't77'. But the string starts with 't53', which doesn't match NT7's terminal, so maybe not this path.\n3. NT9: NT9 can be derived from NT9 NT11 or NT6 NT16. Let's see if 't53' is an output. NT10 \u2192 't53', so maybe NT9 can reach NT10 through some productions.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Since NT10 is a non-terminal that produces 't53', perhaps NT9 can derive to NT10 via some chain.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT16\n\nHmm, not directly. NT10 is a different non-terminal. Maybe I'm confusing NT9 and NT10. Oh, no, NT10 is a different symbol. So, perhaps the S \u2192 NT10 NT10 production isn't there, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the original grammar, S has three productions, but I don't see S \u2192 NT10 NT10. So none of the S productions directly yield 't53'. Wait, but then how can the string start with 't53'? That seems impossible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again, the production NT10 can produce 't53'. So the start symbol S must somehow produce a sequence that includes NT10.\n\nWait, no, because the start symbol S only produces NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. None of these are NT10. So unless one of these productions can lead to NT10, which isn't possible because S doesn't produce NT10 directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check. The given grammar includes S \u2192 NT12 NT12, etc., but there's no production for S to NT10. So if the string starts with 't53', which requires some non-terminal that leads to 't53', but S can't produce that directly because none of its productions are NT10...\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let's look for 't53' in the grammar and see where it comes from. I see NT10 \u2192 't53'. So any production that derives to NT10 will produce 't53'. But S doesn't produce NT10. So unless S can somehow produce a string that includes NT10. Is that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps through some intermediate steps. Let's see. If S \u2192 NT12 NT12 and NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, and perhaps NT17 can lead to NT10 via some path. Or maybe NT12 can produce a sequence that includes NT10.\n\nWait, let's look at NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. Then NT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12 or other options. Let me try to find a path where NT17 can eventually lead to something that produces 't53'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT10 can be generated by another non-terminal. Let's see where else NT10 is referenced. Looking back, I don't see any rule that directly leads to NT10 except S producing NT10, which it doesn't. So perhaps the start symbol S can't generate a string that includes 't53' because none of its productions lead to NT10. That would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe via other productions. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with 't53', so we need the leftmost symbol to be 't53'. That requires that the first production in the leftmost derivation starts with a symbol that produces 't53'. Let's see:\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12: Each NT12 leads to... Let's see: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. Then NT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12 (among others). So NT12 can eventually derive strings starting with NT11 or NT12, but none directly produce 't53'.\n\nWait, perhaps the other productions of S:\n\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14. NT7 can go to NT2 NT11, and then maybe more steps, but that would probably lead to 't77' or similar, not 't53'.\n\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12. NT9 can go to NT9 NT11 or NT6 NT16. Not leading to 't53' either.\n\nWait, but if the first symbol in the string is 't53', which comes from NT10, and since S doesn't have any production that starts with NT10 or can derive to it, then it's impossible. So the string can't be generated by the given grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This helps because it means the parse tree will be a binary tree, and the string length should be 2^n where n is the number of productions. In this case, the string seems pretty long, so I might be looking at multiple parses.\n\nLooking at the terminal symbols, the string contains a bunch of 't' followed by numbers. The grammar translates some non-terminals into these 't's. For example, `S` starts with `NT12 NT12 NT NT8`, so the start symbol is S, and from there, each production branches into other non-terminals. Ultimately, these need to expand into terminals like 't29', 't66', etc.\n\nThe strategy here is to start from the start symbol S and see how each terminal in the string can be generated step by step. Since the grammar is CNF, each step appends two symbols, so the number of terminals in the string should be one more than the number of productions. Let me count the terminals: 38, which suggests that the grammar would have 37 productions, meaning the length of the string should be 2^37, which is way too long. Wait, that doesn't add up. Oh, actually, wait\u2014Chomsky Normal Form allows for the string length to be up to 2^n, where n is the number of steps, but perhaps I'm misapplying that here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed via a series of splits in the parse tree. Maybe I can try to parse the string manually using the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't29'. Let me see how 't29' is generated.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Nf, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that it's pretty complex with many non-terminals and productions. The start symbol is S, which has several productions, all splitting into two non-terminals each. For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT12, etc.\n\nThe string provided seems quite long, consisting of 41 tokens: 't48', 't17', 't61', and so on, ending with 't70' and 't66'. My first step is to see if each token in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the grammar to see which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So, NT12 can produce t17 and t8, but from the string, I see t12 appearing (wait, no\u2014the string has 't17', 't61', etc., but looking at the tokens, I don't see t12 itself\u2014it's part of NT12, but the string uses t48, t77, etc.)\n\nWait, I need to make sure I'm parsing terms correctly. The tokens in the string are like 't48', which correspond to specific non-terminals like NT0, NT1, etc. So, I need to know which non-terminals correspond to these tokens.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20. NT4 can be 't17', NT20 is 't65' from some productions. Wait, but looking through the bottom of the grammar:\n\nNT8 is defined as:\nNT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20\nand NT4 is:\nNT4 \u2192 't17' in some cases.\n\nWait, let me go through each terminal:\n\n- t48: From NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20, and NT4 \u2192 't17', NT20 \u2192 't65'. So, is 't48' a terminal? Wait, no, the string has 't48' which is likely a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals have productions that result in specific strings. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12' because in the grammar, NT12 has a production \u2192 't12' under one of its definitions.\n\nWait, let me search through the grammar for terminals:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12' (looking at NT12's productions, yes, one is NT12 -> 't12').\n\nSimilarly, NT8 \u2192 't48' somewhere? Because NT8 is defined as NT4 NT20, and if NT4 \u2192 't17' and NT20 \u2192 't65', that would produce t17 t65, which would be 't17 t65' as a string. But the string has 't48', which might correspond to some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for which non-terminals directly produce each token.\n\nLooking through all the terminals:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't65'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't48\u2019? Let me see. NT8 is defined as NT4 NT20. So, if NT4 is t17 and NT20 is t65, then NT8 produces t17 t65, which would be 't17 t65', not t48.\n\nWait, is there an NT that directly produces t48?\n\nLooking through the grammar, let me check all terminal assignments:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't65'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't70'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't29', 't16', 't81', etc.\n\nNT9 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't48' (Wait, is there an NT that directly produces t48?)\n\nLooking through:\n\nWait, in the bottom of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't17' from NT4 \u2192 't17'? No, wait: NT8 is defined as NT4 NT20. If NT4 can be 't17' and NT20 can be 't65', then NT8 would produce t17 t65, but in the string, there's a t48 which I think might not be directly produced. Alternatively, perhaps NT4 has other productions that result in t48?\n\nWait, no. Looking through the NT4 productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT17 NT2. Then NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT20 (from NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT20), which is a chain. NT2 can produce things like NT5 NT20, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe each token in the string corresponds to a specific non-terminal. Let me try to create a map from the string's tokens to the non-terminals:\n\nThe string is: 't48 t17 t61 t48 t65 t19 t19 t19 t39 t73 t66 t70 t53 t43 t19 t77 t61 t12 t53 t65 t12 t40 t95 t66 t82 t19 t65 t53 t16 t66 t48 t77 t82 t70 t82 t70 t53 t61 t70 t82 t48 t73 t53 t77 t95 t66 t70 t17 t66'\n\nSo each token is a string like 't48', 't17', etc.\n\nI need to check if each token is the result of some non-terminal's production.\n\nLooking for direct terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that some non-terminals have terminal assignments:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't48' (Wait, no, because NT8 is defined as NT4 NT20, but NT4 \u2192 t17 and NT20 \u2192 t65, so NT8 is t17 t65.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe some non-terminals directly correspond to specific tokens. Let's check all the NT productions at the bottom:\n\nAt the very end of the grammar, there's a big list of productions, some direct to strings:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't29'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't82'\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't48'\n\nWait, is that right? Let me look:\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, the last part has:\n\nNT14 \u2192 't48'\n\nYes!

{"custom_id":"request-796","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar provides several production rules for different symbols, NT1, NT2, S, etc. Looking at the productions, each non-terminal seems to produce pairs of other non-terminals or terminals. For example, S can produce NT12 followed by NT12, or NT14, etc. The string provided, however, is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. So, I need to figure out which terminals are produced by which non-terminals.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals have productions that result in terminals. For instance, NT12 -> 't12', which means whenever NT12 is derived, it produces the terminal 't12'. Similarly, NT10 -> 't40', NT14 -> 't65', etc. So, I can map each non-terminal to the terminals they produce directly.\n\nLooking at the string: `t40 t95 t17 t65 t43 t95 t77 t53 t53 t66 t39 t61 t39 t95 t70 t82 t17 t66 t73 t19 t77 t53 t61 t39 t61 t77 t70 t95 t39 t82 t95 t40 t17 t40 t43 t43 t95 t26 t53 t26 t19 t16 t66 t65 t73 t48 t26 t61 t29 t82`.\n\nSo, it's a long sequence of these 't' followed by numbers. Now, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. The only exception would be direct terminals. However, in this grammar, many non-terminals do have direct terminal productions, so that's a bit of a mix.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string using the given grammar. I'll try to break down the string step by step, seeing if I can find a way to split it into the productions.\n\nFirst, looking for the start symbol, which is S. S can produce several things:\n\n1. NT12 NT12\n2. NT7 NT14\n3. NT9 NT12\n\nSo, the first production for S is two non-terminals. Let's see what the string starts with.\n\nThe first token is 't40'. Looking back at the grammar, 't40' is produced by:\n\n- NT10 -> 't40'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n\nSo, 't40' can come from NT10, NT0, or NT1. But how do we get these non-terminals?\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT10 is directly 't40', so NT10 can produce 't40'.\n- Similarly, NT0 and NT1 do too. So 't40' could be the result of any of these.\n\nBut wait, looking deeper:\n\nFor NT10, the production is NT10 -> 't40', which is a direct terminal. But how do you get NT10 in the first place? Maybe through a production that includes NT10.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for where NT10 is produced:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT10 -> 't53', 't73', 't43', etc., but no production for NT10 being derived. So, NT10 must be a terminal, but in reality, since it's a non-terminal, it must be produced by some other rule. But the only production that directly gives NT10 is to a terminal, like 't53'. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT10 -> 't40'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n\nSo, NT10 produces some terminals, but it's also used in other productions, like S -> NT21 NT5.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I don't see any production that generates NT10 except directly via terminals. So, NT10 is not a terminal but a non-terminal, but its only productions are to terminals. That means NT10 is directly a leaf node in the parse tree, producing the terminal 't40', etc.\n\nBut in CNF, the only way to derive a terminal is through a direct production. So, if a non-terminal only produces terminals, it's a terminal itself in the generated language. But since the grammar uses CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. So, that can't be. Therefore, I might be misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals, except for the base cases where A is a terminal. But in this grammar, many non-terminals produce terminals, so it's a bit mixed.\n\nBut let's think differently. Perhaps I can create a parse tree from the string and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nThe first step is to look at the string and see what non-terminals can produce 't40' as the first symbol.\n\nPossible options are:\n\n- NT10 -> 't40'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n\nSo, S can produce these, but S is S -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, S -> NT9 NT12.\n\nSo, the first two symbols must come from the production rules.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe string starts with t40 t95 t17 t65 etc.\n\nAssuming the first production is S -> NT12 NT12, then the first two symbols should be whatever NT12 produces.\n\nFrom the grammar: NT12 can produce 't12' directly, or via other productions. For example, NT12 -> NT17 NT8.\n\nBut 't12' is the terminal for NT12, so if the first symbol is 't40', but the first production of S requires the first symbol to be whatever NT12 produces. Wait, perhaps the first non-terminal is NT12, which would have to produce 't40', but NT12 can produce 't12' directly or through other routes.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't40', which is produced by NT10, NT0, or NT1, but NT12 is a non-terminal that can produce 't12' (direct) or other combinations. So, if S -> NT12 NT12 is used, the first two symbols should both be 't12' if NT12 is directly used. But in the string, the first symbol is 't40', which is not 't12', so that production can't be used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S is using another production. Let's check S's other productions:\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nIf S uses S -> NT7 NT14, then the first two symbols would come from NT7 and NT14.\n\nBut NT7's production is NT7 -> NT2 NT11, and NT14 -> 't65'.\n\nWait, so NT7 can't produce 't40' directly because its production is NT2 NT11, which are non-terminals. Similarly, NT14 can produce 't65' directly. So, if S uses this production, the second symbol would be 't65', but the string starts with 't40 t95...', so that doesn't match.\n\nSimilarly, if S uses S -> NT9 NT12, then the first two symbols would come from NT9 and NT12.\n\nNT9 can produce 't77' or via other rules. Let's see:\n\nNT9 -> NT6 NT9, which is a cycle, but that would derive a string of 't77's, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, NT9 can sometimes produce 't77' directly or through other paths.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for the terminals and see how they can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to find a path from the start symbol S down to the given string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking through the string, the first term is 't40'. As I mentioned, this can come from NT10, NT0, or NT1.\n\nBut if S is using S -> NT0 NT16, for example.

{"custom_id":"request-793","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I have to evaluate is: `t26 t53 t81 t17 t19 t12 t26 t39 t53 t29 t70 t82 t43 t65 t43 t43 t77 t82 t43 t43 t81 t48 t65 t12 t82 t12 t82 t66 t16 t26 t16 t53 t95 t12 t65 t77 t53 t77 t73 t19 t95 t66 t12 t77 t12 t29 t53 t77 t82`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF is a specific form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this since each rule has either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. \n\nNext, the task is to parse the string using this grammar. Parsing can be done using either a top-down approach (like Recursive Descent or the CYK algorithm) or bottom-up (like the Shunting-yard algorithm, though that's more for Reverse Polish notation). However, since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser might be manageable, but that could be time-consuming considering the string is quite long.\n\nAlternatively, I can check whether the string can be generated by tracing possible derivations. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if it can be built by starting from the start symbol S and applying production rules until I reach the entire string.\n\nThe given grammar has S as the start symbol. Let's look at S's productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT12 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo S can expand into combinations of NT12 and other non-terminals. Let's see what each of these non-terminals produce.\n\nLooking further, each non-terminal has its own productions. For example, NT12 can go to NT17 NT8. NT8 is one of the terminals, e.g., 't48', 't95', etc. Wait, actually, looking closer, many of the NTs seem to be terminals now, especially because the productions are to terminals or other non-terminals that ultimately resolve to terminals.\n\nWait, no, the productions are mostly non-terminals on the right. For example, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, and NT8 can produce 't48', 't95', etc. NT17 can produce NT13 NT4, which in turn can produce 't65' or other non-terminals.\n\nSo the approach is to find a derivation path from S to the given string. Let's see the string again: \n\nThe string starts with t26. Looking at the grammar, t26 is the terminal for NT20 \u2192 't26' via NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3, but NT10 \u2192 't43' or others, and NT3's production is 't26', 't39', etc. Wait, perhaps I should list which non-terminals correspond to each terminal.\n\nWait, no, each NT can produce multiple terminals or further non-terminals. Let's try to map each terminal to the possible non-terminals. For example:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT12 \u2192 't12' or other combinations. So, in the given string, the first token is 't26'. Let's check in the grammar which NT can produce 't26'. \n\nLooking through the rules, I see that:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't26' directly? Let me check: \nLooking for NT20: One of the productions is NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3, but not directly 't26'. However, another is NT20 \u2192 NT16 NT5, and that's it. So perhaps 't26' is from NT3, as NT3 has a production 't26', 't39', etc.\n\nYes, looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't26', 't39', 't53', etc. So the terminal 't26' can come from NT3.\n\nWait, but NT3 also has other productions. So, in the string, the first token is 't26' which would need to come from NT3. Now, looking at how NT3 is produced: \n\nFrom the top, the production rules for NT3 are: NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', 't39', 't48', 't53', 't65', 't66', 't70', 't77', 't81', 't82', 't95'. So any of these can be produced by NT3. \n\nIn the string, the first symbol is 't26' which is not directly produced by NT3 as per the given rules. Wait, let me double-check the grammar:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT3, the rule is:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16'\n- NT3 \u2192 't29'\n- NT3 \u2192 't39'\n- NT3 \u2192 't48'\n- NT3 \u2192 't53'\n- NT3 \u2192 't65'\n- NT3 \u2192 't66'\n- NT3 \u2192 't70'\n- NT3 \u2192 't77'\n- NT3 \u2192 't81'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't95'\n\nSo none of these is 't26'. Hmm, that's confusing because the string starts with 't26', but none of the NTs seem to produce 't26' according to the given rules. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each NT for its possible terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't26', 't65', etc.\n- NT3 has various terminals including 't26' no. Wait, let me check: The rules for NT3 are listed as:\n\nAh, under NT3, the rules are: NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', 't39', 't48', 't53', 't65', 't66', 't70', 't77', 't81', 't82', 't95', but wait, am I seeing that correctly? Let me review.\n\nNo, looking again, under NT3, I see some rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16'\n- NT3 \u2192 't29'\n- NT3 \u2192 't53'\n- NT3 \u2192 't66'\n- NT3 \u2192 't26'? No, wait, under NT3, I see:\n\nLooking through, I find:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't26' (no, not in the list)\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's go step by step.\n\nLooking through each production rule under NT3:\n\n1. NT3 \u2192 't16'\n2. NT3 \u2192 't29'\n3. NT3 \u2192 't53'\n4. NT3 \u2192 't66'\n5. NT3 \u2192 't39'\n6. NT3 \u2192 't48'\n7. NT3 \u2192 't95'\n\nWait, I'm not seeing 't26' or 't65' in NT3's productions. Wait, let me check again. Because perhaps I missed it. Let me list all NT3's productions as per the user input.\n\nFrom the user's grammar:\n\nLooking at the NT3 productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16'\n- NT3 \u2192 't29'\n- NT3 \u2192 't53'\n- NT3 \u2192 't66'\n- NT3 \u2192 't39'\n- NT3 \u2192 't48'\n- NT3 \u2192 't95'\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't26', which is not listed as a production for NT3. Hmm, that suggests that the string cannot start with 't26' because none of the NTs (including NT3) produce 't26'. That would immediately mean the string is invalid. Wait, but in the provided grammar, maybe I missed a production for NT3 that includes 't26'?\n\nLooking again through the grammar, I see:\n\n- The user provided a long list of productions, perhaps not all. Let me check if any NT3 production is 't26'.\n\nAh, I looked through all the rules and noticed that 't26' is only present under NT20, not NT3. So, the string starts with 't26', but according to the grammar, 't26' is only produced by NT20 via NT20 \u2192 't26', but let me verify.\n\nWait, under NT20's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, making it easier to apply certain parsing techniques or to manually trace derivations.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar and see what the starting symbol is. In this case, the start symbol is S. The rules for S are:\n\n- S -> NT12 NT12\n- S -> NT7 NT14\n- S -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo S can produce different combinations. But looking at the string we need to generate, \"t77 t12\", I notice that the first part is t77 and the second is t12. I should check which left-hand sides produce these tokens.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the grammar, I see that some rules have terminal symbols. For example, NT12 -> 't12', and NT7 -> 't77'. So let's note which terminals correspond to which parts:\n\n- t77 comes from NT7\n- t12 comes from NT12\n\nSo the string \"t77 t12\" implies that somewhere in the derivation, there must be a production that results in these two terminals in sequence.\n\nSince S has to be the start, the simplest way to get \"t77 t12\" is if S directly produces NT7 and NT12, each of which can lead to these terminals. Let's check the production rules:\n\nLooking at S's rules, the second one is S -> NT7 NT14. But wait, that would be NT7 and NT14, so the second token would be from NT14, which might not be t12. The third rule is S -> NT9 NT12. NT9 is 't77', and NT12 is 't12', so that seems promising. So S can produce NT9 and NT12.\n\nWait, but looking again, the third rule for S is S -> NT9 NT12. So NT9 is t77 and NT12 is t12, so that would directly produce \"t77 t12\". That would imply that S can derive the string in two steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n2.

So I need to make sure that there's a way for these non-terminals to produce the terminals.\n\nLooking at NT9: according to the grammar, NT9 can produce NT11 NT11. But since we need NT9 to produce 't77', I should check if NT9 can eventually produce 't77'. Looking at the rules, NT9 \u2192 't77', so that's a direct production. So NT9 can directly produce t77.\n\nSimilarly, NT12 directly produces 't12'. So yes, the rule S \u2192 NT9 NT12 would allow the string \"t77 t12\" to be derived directly without further expansion.\n\nTherefore, the string is generated by the grammar, so the answer is 'Yes'.\n<\/think>\n\nYes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Then, at the very end, I see several NT9 rules:\n\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT9\n- NT11 -> NT0 NT11 (that's another part)\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, under NT9, there are several options, including \"NT9 -> NT6 NT16\", \"NT9 -> NT6 NT9\" (multiple times), but I don't see \"t77\" as a direct production under NT9. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the production rules under NT9 include:\n\n- NT9 -> NT9 NT6 (multiple times)\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT9 (multiple times)\nWait, in the list, I actually see \"NT9 -> NT6 NT9\" under NT9 rules. That seems recursive, so that might not directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking further down, under NT3, I see NT3 -> 't29', but that's for NT3. Hmm. Alternatively, checking NT19:\n\n- NT19 -> NT1 NT2, but NT2 -> various things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing \"t77\" in the grammar. Wait, looking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT17 -> 't13' and 't4'\nWait, no, perhaps I need to re-examine all rules carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan the rules again for NT that produce 't77' or 't95'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT9 -> 't77' appears once towards the end: \"NT9 -> NT6 NT9\" and also \"NT11 -> NT0 NT11.\" Wait, perhaps the last rule is \"NT9 -> 't77'\", but I'm not seeing it. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT17 -> 't13' and 't4' under \"NT17 -> NT8 NT10\", but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for 't77' in the given grammar. Scanning the given grammar, I see:\n\nAt the end, under NT1, there's \"NT1 -> 't19'\". So 't19' is produced by NT1.\n\nUnder NT2: \"NT2 -> NT5 NT20\", which can produce 't20' perhaps.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at NT7: \"NT7 -> 't2' and 't16'\", no, wait, under NT7, I see \"NT7 -> NT7 NT12\", \"NT5 -> NT17 NT2\", etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for 't95' first. Let me check the rules that produce 't95'. Scanning through the list, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't95'. The closest is 't12' from NT12, but that's 't12'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a way to reach 't95' through production rules. Let me try to see if 't95' can be produced directly or through a chain of rules.\n\nWait, in the initial rules, I see that S can split into different combinations of NTs. For example:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12: both NT12 produce 't12's if followed by other rules, but perhaps their combination could produce more.\n\nAlternatively, S can split into NT12 and NT8. If NT12 -> 't12' and NT8 -> 't48', then S produces 't12 t48' as one of its options.\n\nWait, but our string is 't77 t95'. So neither of the S splits produce 't77 t95' directly unless one of the NTs in the S production splits produces those.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT12 can split into more NTs, perhaps producing 't77' and something else. Let me look back at NT12.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT12: \"NT12 -> NT17 NT8\". So, NT12 expands into NT17 and NT8.\n\nThen, NT17: Let me look for its rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT17, I see:\n\n\"NT17 -> NT8 NT10\" and \"NT17 -> NT5 NT2\". Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should look further up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about building the parse tree for 't77 t95' step by step.\n\nWe need to find a way to derive 't77' and 't95' from the grammar. Let's assume that the start symbol S splits into two NTs, which each split into other NTs until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven 't77 t95', each part must come from an NT that can produce these terminals.\n\nSo, the first step is to find an NT that can produce 't77' and another NT that can produce 't95'.\n\nBut in the grammar, I only see NT9 being associated with 't77' directly, but earlier when I looked, I didn't see an explicit rule like NT9 -> 't77'.\n\nWait, no, under NT9: I don't see 't77' as a direct production. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking through all the NT9 rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT9 (multiple times)\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT16\n- NT9 -> NT11 NT11\nSo, no direct production of 't77'. Hmm. That's a problem because I thought there was a 't77' but it's not in the rules. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, perhaps I missed it. Let me recheck each line:\n\nUnder NT9: 'NT9 -> NT6 NT9', 'NT9 -> NT6 NT16', 'NT9 -> NT11 NT11'. So no direct 't77' in NT9.\n\nWait, then perhaps it's not possible to produce 't77' at all? But that can't be, because 't77' is in the string. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nWait, maybe the rules for NT9 have a missing production. Or perhaps 't77' comes from another NT. Let me check all NTs for terminals.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see several NTs that produce terminals, including:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT1 -> 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the productions are non-terminals breaking down into other non-terminals. The string we're checking has three tokens: t77, t61, t48. These are all terminals, which suggests that each token must be produced directly by a production rule in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by checking which non-terminals produce these terminals. \n\n- t77: I look through the productions and see if any non-terminal directly produce t77. Scanning the rules, I find NT1 -> NT17 NT0 and NT7 -> NT7 NT12. Hmm, wait, but the rule for NT9 says NT9 -> NT6 NT9. None of these directly produce t77. Wait, let me look more carefully. Oh, I see that NT7 -> NT7 NT12 and NT17 -> NT13 NT4. There's also NT17 -> NT20 NT17. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check NT17: Looking at NT17's productions, I see NT17 -> NT13 NT4 and NT17 -> NT11 NT12, and so on. Not directly t77. Oh, wait: does any production directly produce t77? Let me scan all the terminals. \n\nLooking through the terminals, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't95'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT5 -> 't82'\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT13 -> 't82'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n\nWait a minute, I see that NT9 -> 't77' directly. So t77 is produced by NT9. Got it.\n\nNext, t61: looking for a direct production. Checking the terminals, I see NT17 -> 't61'. So t61 comes from NT17.\n\nFinally, t48: looking for direct production. In the list, NT8 -> 't48'. So t48 is produced by NT8.\n\nNow, the string is t77 t61 t48, so the sequence is NT9 producing t77, NT17 producing t61, and NT8 producing t48.\n\nSo the question is, can NT9, NT17, and NT8 be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions?\n\nThe start symbol S can produce several things, like NT12 NT12 followed by NT8, or other combinations. Let's see the possible S productions:\n\n- S -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n- S -> NT7 NT14\n- S -> NT9 NT12\n\nI need to find a path from S through these non-terminals, possibly through other productions, to reach NT9, then NT17, then NT8.\n\nLooking at S's options:\n\n1. S -> NT9 NT12: So if we pick this, S can produce NT9 and NT12. Then, NT9 can produce 't77', and NT12 can produce 't95', but that's not t61. Alternatively, NT12 can go through other productions like NT12 -> NT17 NT8. Oh wait, NT12 -> NT17 NT8. So let me see:\n\nIf S -> NT9 NT12, then from NT12 we can get to NT17 NT8. So the string could be NT9 (t77), NT17 (t61 via NT17 -> t61?), wait no, NT17's production is directly 't61', but wait:\n\nNT17 -> 't61' directly, so from NT12, we get to NT17 and NT8. So the sequence is NT9 (t77), NT17 (t61), NT8 (t48). That matches our string exactly.\n\nSo putting it together: S can produce NT9 NT12. Then, NT12 can produce NT17 NT8, which in turn can produce 't61' and 't48'. So the string would be t77 (from NT9), t61 (from NT17), t48 (from NT8), which is exactly the string given.\n\nWait, but does NT12 produce NT17 NT8? Let me check: NT12's productions are NT12 -> NT17 NT8 and NT12 -> NT19 NT8. So yes, NT12 can produce NT17 NT8, which gives 't61' and 't48', respectively.\n\nTherefore, the string \"t77 t61 t48\" can be derived from S by following these paths: S -> NT9 NT12 -> t77 NT17 NT8, then NT17 -> t61, and NT8 -> t48.

{"custom_id":"request-33","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if the string `t12 t82 t95` is generated by a given context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This structure simplifies parsing and makes certain analyses easier.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the rules are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, which is the A \u2192 BC form. Some have a terminal on the right-hand side, like NT12 -> 't95'. So that part makes sense.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t12 t82 t95`. Since it's split into three separate tokens, I'm guessing each token might correspond to a production that eventually leads to a terminal symbol. But I'm not sure yet; let's break it down.\n\nLet me look at the grammar and see if I can find a way the start symbol S can derive the string `t12 t82 t95`. Since the grammar starts with S, and each production typically involves non-terminals, I should probably see if S can be expanded into the necessary components.\n\nLooking at the productions for S, there are three options:\n1. S -> NT12 NT12 (from the first line)\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, actually, no. Looking closer, the first three lines I see are:\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, wait, no. Upon re-reading, I think I might have misread. The first three lines seem to be:\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nBut perhaps looking at the actual grammar, maybe I should parse each production correctly. Wait, maybe each line starting with S is a separate production. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see three lines starting with S:\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, maybe the initial parsing was incorrect. No, perhaps each line is a separate production, so the S has three different right-hand sides: either NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12.\n\nBut wait, actually, I think the grammar might list all the possible productions for S. Let me confirm. It seems like the first three lines are the possible S productions.\n\nSo S can be NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. Each of these are production rules.\n\nSo to get the string `t12 t82 t95`, which is three tokens, maybe S can derive a sequence of three non-terminals. But then, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded into the correct terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each part of the string corresponds to a separate part of the derivation. Let me think more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each token `t12`, `t82`, `t95` comes from different non-terminals in the grammar. So maybe the derivation involves three steps, each time choosing a production for S, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, wait\u2014the question is about the string `t12 t82 t95`. Since it's split into three tokens, maybe each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. So perhaps the derivation should produce three terminals in the correct order.\n\nWait, but each of the tokens is 't' followed by a number, like t12, t82, t95. Looking at the grammar, I see several rules where NTx -> 't' + number, like NT12 -> 't95', NT7 -> 't17', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo let's see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't95' (from line 14: NT12 -> 't95')\nWait no, line 14: the grammar has NT12 -> 't95'?

{"custom_id":"request-50","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the string `t61 t48 t65 t26` is generated by this grammar. From what I remember, Chomsky normal form has each production rule having exactly two non-terminals or one terminal on the right side. So, let me first look at the grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that some of the non-terminals (like S, NT1, etc.) seem to be rules with two non-terminals. But I'm specifically looking for a way to produce the terminals in the given string. Wait, I also notice that some productions directly produce terminals. For example, rule S seems to be about NT12, NT8, which in the grammar might eventually generate the required terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the string `t61 t48 t65 t26`, I should try to figure out what production rules could derive these terminals. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's see if these terminals appear anywhere in the grammar as directly produced. Oh, I see that NT7 produces 't77', and NT4 produces 't17', but that's not our case. Wait, maybe 't61' comes from some production rule. Looking at the grammar, I see several NT productions that include these terminals.\n\nFor instance, NT17 -> 't61', which means that if NT17 can be derived, it would produce 't61'. Similarly, 't48' could come from NT8 if NT8 has a production that includes 't48'. Looking at the grammar, NT8 has a production to 't48'. Let's see the chain:\n\n- To get 't61', I need NT17 -> 't61'.\n- For 't48', need NT8 -> 't48'.\n- 't65' could come from NT12 -> 't65'? Wait, no, looking back, NT12 -> 't12', not 't65'. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong production.\n\nWait, let me check again. The rule NT12 appears in the grammar and some of the productions. Looking back, I see NT12 -> 't12', so that's not it. Alternatively, NT21 has a production to 't65'? Let me check. Yes, there are several NT21 productions: NT21 -> 't65', so perhaps 't65' comes from NT21.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it's 't61 t48 t65 t26'. Let's try to map each token.\n\n1. 't61': Looking for a production that has 't61' on the RHS. Yes, NT17 -> 't61'.\n\n2. 't48': Looking for a production that has 't48' on the RHS. Yes, in the grammar, I see NT8 -> 't48'.\n\n3. 't65': We've established that NT21 -> 't65'.\n\n4. 't26': Looking for 't26', I see that NT12 -> 't12', but that's not it. Wait, I think I'm missing a production. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT10 -> 't43', and NT8 -> 't48'. But 't26' might come from another production. Let me search through all the grammar rules for a production that directly gives 't26'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT8 has a production to 't48', but where is 't26' coming from? Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan again.\n\nYes! I see this rule: NT20 -> 't26' and another production from NT20: NT20 -> 't65'. So NT20 can produce 't26'.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\n- Yes, in the grammar, there's a production NT20 -> 't65', another production from NT20 might be NT20 -> 't26'? Or is it another rule?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see that NT20 has the following productions:\n\nNT20 -> 't15 NT19' (maybe not, let me check again). Oh, wait, no, I think it's:\n\n- Looking through the rules, I see NT20 has a production NT20 -> 't65' and another rule NT20 -> 't10 NT3'. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Alternatively, perhaps 't26' comes from some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me see if there's a path from the start symbol S to these terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Let's see what S produces. The initial grammar rule for S is:\n\nS -> NT12 NT15 OR S -> NT7 NT14 etc. Let's try to see a path.\n\nWait, let me check the S production. Looking at the first three lines:\n\nS -> NT12 NT15\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, so S produces two non-terminals concatenated. Then, we need to look at how each of these non-terminals can be expanded into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can lead to a longer string, but in this case, the string has four terminals, so perhaps multiple steps are needed.\n\nWait, but the string is only four tokens, so each token must come directly from a single symbol's production. So, to get four tokens, the derivation must have four steps, each leading to a terminal.\n\nLet me try to map each token:\n\n- t61: must come from NT17.\n\n- t48: from NT8.\n\n- t65: from NT21.\n\n- t26: from perhaps NT20 or another.\n\nSo, let's assume that the string is broken down as S -> NT something leading to these.\n\nWait, perhaps the S generates a chain that goes through various steps to produce these terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string can be represented as a sequence of productions leading to four terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I can start by tracing possible derivations.\n\nLet me see: S -> NT12 NT15 (from first production). Now, NT12 can produce 't12' or other non-terminals. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT12's productions:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nBut in the given grammar, I think NT12 -> 't12'. So that can't be, unless I'm missing something. Wait no, looking again:\n\nWait, I see that NT12 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't70', and others. So NT12 can't directly produce 't65'. Hmm, so maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S first becomes NT7 NT14, and then each of those becomes something.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of working backwards, starting from the string and seeing if we can find a path to S by reversing the productions.\n\nThe string is 't61 t48 t65 t26'. Let's reverse the order and try to find how each token could have come from a non-terminal.\n\nSo, working backwards, let's assume that the last token in the string is 't26', so let's see what non-terminals can directly produce 't26'. Looking through the productions, I see that NT10 -> 't43', NT5 -> 't39', and perhaps there's a production for some other NT to 't26'.\n\nWait, looking through, perhaps NT20 has a production to 't26'. Let me check: Yes, I see a production for NT20: NT20 -> 't26' and another for NT20 -> 't65'. So, if the last token is 't26', it must come from NT20.\n\nSo, the previous step would be that before 't26' in the parse, there's NT20. Now, the token before that is 't65'. So, 't65' must come from NT17 (since NT17 can produce 't61', which isn't that. Wait, no, 't65' comes from NT21, as we thought earlier.\n\nWait, maybe the last two tokens come from NT21 and NT20.\n\nLet me try to structure this:\n\nThe string is t61 t48 t65 t26.\n\nSuppose the last token, t26, is from NT20 -> 't26'. Then, before that, t65 comes from NT21, so before that, it's NT21 -> 't65'.\n\nBut wait, that's two tokens back. Let's think:\n\nIf we have S \u2192 ... \u2192 A B C D, where A is t61 (from NT17 -> 't61'), B is t48 (from NT8 -> 't48'), C is t65 (from NT21 -> 't65'), D is t26 (from NT20 -> 't2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-52","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string \"t26 t61 t48 t48\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and it uses a top-down approach. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I see that it's a set of production rules where each non-terminal can only produce two other non-terminals. Chomsky Normal Form typically requires each production to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. In this case, I see that some productions have terminals on the right side, like S \u2192 NT12 NT12, but wait, no, actually, looking closely, most of the productions are of the form NT... \u2192 NT... NT..., with a few having terminals on the right.\n\nWait, for example, NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8, which is a production that goes to a terminal symbol 't19'? Or is it 't12'? Wait, I see in the rules that NT12 can produce 't12' sometimes. For instance, in the rules, NT12 -> 't12'. So, some non-terminals directly produce terminal strings. So, the terminals are things like 't95', 't61', etc., which are the tokens in the string we're evaluating.\n\nLooking at the string \"t26 t61 t48 t48\", I notice that each token is a terminal. So the problem is to see if the grammar can produce this string starting from the start symbol S, using the productions.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the start symbol S. In the grammar, S can produce several things:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, the first production is S \u2192 NT12 NT12, the second is S \u2192 NT7 NT14, and the third is S \u2192 NT9 NT12. So let's see which of these could help in generating t26, t61, t48, t48.\n\nFrom the terminal rules, I notice that S can only produce t12? No, let me check. Wait, looking through the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT3 -> 't39'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\nWait, wait, no, let me actually parse all the terminal rules. Looking through the grammar, the rules that end with a terminal are:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT5 -> 't82'\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT13 -> 't82'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n\nWait, so each of these rules has a single terminal on the right. So NT12 can produce 't12', which is part of our string. Similarly, NT20 can produce 't26', which is the first token in the string. NT8 can produce 't48', which is also present.\n\nSo the string is t26 t61 t48 t48. So let's check if each of these is produced by some non-terminal.\n\nt26: produced by NT20.\nt61: produced by NT17.\nt48: produced by NT8.\nAnother t48: again, NT8.\n\nSo perhaps the derivation would involve S \u2192 something that can derive into NT20, NT17, NT8, NT8.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol S can produce NT12 NT12, which is one possibility, but let's see if that can lead to the target string. But NT12 can derive to 't12', which is a single character, but our first token is t26, so that would require a different production.\n\nAlternatively, looking at S's other productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\nLooking at NT7 and NT14. Let's see if they can produce the needed terminals.\n\nWait, but looking through the rules, what does NT7 produce? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the list, there's NT7 -> NT2 NT11. So NT7 can't directly produce a terminal. So it needs to go through further productions.\n\nSimilarly, NT14 can be found: NT14 -> NT4 NT0. NT4 produces 't17', and NT0 can produce 't40'. So NT14 would produce t17 and t40, which is 't17 t40', which doesn't match any part of our target string. Therefore, this path might not be useful.\n\nAnother option is S \u2192 NT9 NT12. Let's see NT9 and NT12. NT9 -> NT11 NT11, so that would produce t11 t11. But t11 is a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, I don't see any NT11 \u2192 't11'; in fact, NT11's productions are:\n\nNT11 -> NT5 NT14\nNT11 -> 't4'... Hmm, wait, looking carefully:\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list all the NT rules and their terminals. Perhaps the correct approach is to find for each terminal in the string, which NT can produce it, and trace the possible paths.\n\nGiven the string is t26 t61 t48 t48. Let's map each token to the NT that produces it.\n\nt26: Only applicable if NT20 \u2192 't26', so NT20 would produce this. So one part could come from NT20.\n\nt61: This comes from NT17 \u2192 't61'.\n\nt48: This can come from NT8.\n\nSo one possibility is that the string is a concatenation of derivations: NT20, NT17, NT8, NT8.\n\nEach of these comes from NT20 \u2192 T26, NT17 \u2192 T61, NT8 \u2192 T48.\n\nBut how do these NTs get generated? Let's see how each NT20, NT17, NT8 can be reached from S.\n\nLooking at S's production:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nBut NT12 \u2192 T12. So NT12 can produce 't12', but we need 't26' as the first token, which is from NT20.\n\nTherefore, maybe S \u2192 NT20 NT something else? Wait, looking at S's productions, none of them directly produce NT20. So perhaps the derivation goes through more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the production S \u2192 NT17 NT21 could be involved? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, S does not have a production of NT17 NT21. The productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nSo S doesn't directly produce NT17 or NT20. Therefore, the NT17 and NT20 must be generated via other rules. But that would complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the rules inside NT7 or NT20 can lead to T26, etc. Let's explore.\n\nWait, for example, perhaps NT17 can be generated via another NT.\n\nLooking at NT17:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT17 appears in several productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT7 NT16\nNT17 \u2192 NT5 NT12\nAlso, NT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12 in another place?\n\nWait, looking in the grammar, for NT17, the productions are:\n\nNT17 -> NT7 NT16\nNT17 -> NT5 NT12\nNT17 -> NT11 NT12\nWait, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe those are the options.\n\nSo if NT17 can produce 't61', that's good because that's the second token.\n\nBut then how does NT17 get generated? Since S doesn't produce NT17, it must come from other non-terminals.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol S must produce something that can lead to NT17.\n\nLooking at the S productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12: So this would likely result in something like 't12 t12' if both NT12s produce 't12's, which isn't our string. So not useful.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14: Let's see what NT7 and NT14 can produce.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11\nNT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17\nWait, so NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11.

{"custom_id":"request-68","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is \"t65 t61 t48 t65 t95\". \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Also, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, which can produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that there are several productions that produce terminals directly. For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT8, but also many other rules produce 't' followed by numbers, like NT3 \u2192 't16', etc. So, the terminals are the words like 't65', 't61', etc.\n\nThe string given is \"t65 t61 t48 t65 t95\". Each of these is a terminal symbol because they match one of the productions in the grammar. For instance, 't65' is a result of NT16 \u2192 't70' or other rules, but in the grammar, some NT's produce specific terminals. Wait, looking more closely, for example, NT12 \u2192 't12', so 't12' is a terminal. But 't65' is produced by NT4 in some rules, like NT4 \u2192 't65'. So 't65' must be a terminal in this grammar.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals: t65, t61, t48, t65, t95. Now, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce NT12 NT8, etc. Each of these productions branches into two non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. The string starts with 't65', which must come from either NT4 \u2192 't65' or another production. So I need to see where 't65' appears. Looking at the rules, NT4 \u2192 't65' and NT3 \u2192 't65' possibly? Wait, looking again, I see NT4 \u2192 't65' and NT16 \u2192 't70', but I don't see a NT3 that directly produces 't65'. Hmm, let's check. The productions for NT4 include NT4 \u2192 't65'. So 't65' must come from NT4.\n\n2. So the string starts with NT4 \u2192 t65. Now, the next symbol is 't61'. Let's see where 't61' comes from. Looking at the grammar rules, I don't immediately see a NT that directly produces 't61'. Wait, no, actually, some rules produce terminals, like NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17 and so on. Oh, wait, checking further, NT17 \u2192 't61'. Yes, looking at the rules, NT17 \u2192 't61'. So, the second symbol 't61' must come from NT17.\n\n3. Now, the second part of the production for S is something else. Wait, no, wait, S can produce various combinations. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe string is t65 t61 t48 t65 t95. So each of these must come from the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet me try to see how this can be constructed. Let's see if each symbol in the string can be generated by some path in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first 't65', which comes from NT4 as NT4 \u2192 't65'. So after that, the next symbol is 't61', which comes from NT17. So how do we get 't61'? We need a production that leads to 't61', which is NT17 \u2192 't61'.\n\nSo the second symbol comes from NT17. Now, in the grammar, NT17 is involved in several productions. For example, NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4. So, if NT17 \u2192 't61', but looking at the rules, I think NT17 might have a rule NT17 \u2192 't61', or is that another NT?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list the NTs that produce 't61' or other terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT17 \u2192 't61'. Yes, in the production NT17 \u2192 't61'.\n\nSo, 't61' comes from NT17. Now, in the grammar, we can have S \u2192 NT... Let's think about how S can split into these NTs.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce NT12 NT8, etc. Let's pick the first production: S \u2192 NT12 NT8. So the first part is NT12, which can produce 't12' as per NT12 \u2192 't12' or other rules. Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is 't65', but S's first production is NT12. Hmm, that's a problem because NT12 doesn't produce 't65'.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. S can produce various combinations, so maybe the first part is NT4 \u2192 't65', and then the second part is another NT that needs to produce the rest of the string.\n\nWait, the string is t65 t61 t48 t65 t95. So the first 't65' must come from some NT, say A, and the second 't61' comes from another NT, B, and this must be because S \u2192 A B. So in the grammar, we need to find an S production that has A and B as the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see if there's an S production that splits into A and B where A produces 't65' and B produces 't61'.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT12 NT8\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT15\n4. S \u2192 NT21 NT5\n5. S \u2192 NT5 NT20\n6. S \u2192 NT21 NT17\n7. S \u2192 NT3 NT21\n...and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a production where the first NT is NT4 (since it produces 't65') and the second NT is NT17 (since it produces 't61'). Let's check if S has a production like S \u2192 NT4 NT17. Looking through the productions, I don't see any such rule. The S productions all have two NTs that each produce other things, but not directly 't65' and 't61'.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to parse the string step by step, considering the possible derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to see what each symbol can be traced back to.\n\nLet's process the string from the start:\n\n- t65: must come from a non-terminal that directly produces it. So possible NTs: NT4, NT20, others? Let's see, NT4 \u2192 't65', yes. So first symbol is NT4.\n\nNow, the production for S may have split into NT4 and another NT, let's call it X. So S \u2192 NT4 X.\n\nNext symbol is t61: so X must produce 't61' which requires X \u2192 't61'. So X must be NT17, because NT17 \u2192 't61'.\n\nSo now, S must have a production that is S \u2192 NT4 NT17. Is there such a production in the grammar? Looking at the list, I don't see any S rule that produces NT4 and NT17. Hmm. So this path might not work.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT something else that can lead to NT4 NT17.\n\nLet me check all the S productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT12 NT8\n3. S \u2192 NT21 NT5\n4. S \u2192 NT5 NT20\nWait, perhaps S can produce a combination that leads to NT4 and NT17.\n\nBut looking at the S productions, there's no rule that directly produces NT4 and another NT that leads to NT17, I think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first symbol is from a different production.\n\nWait, maybe the first symbol comes from S \u2192 NT12 NT8. So NT12 would be the first part, and NT8 the second. But NT12 produces 't12', which isn't the case here. So that's not matching.\n\nLooking further, perhaps the string starts with a production that's not directly producing a terminal. Wait, no, because the string only has terminals, so each position must be derived directly from a terminal in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived through multiple steps, not in one step.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and then analyze the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are:\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nWait, looking again, the user's grammar has multiple S productions, but in the initial part, it's written as S -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, and S -> NT9 NT12. So the start symbol S branches into different combinations of non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the detailed productions, I see more S rules: S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar rules provided. I see that some non-terminals produce terminal symbols directly, like `NT12 -> t12`. So, during the parsing of the string, each 't' followed by a number likely represents a terminal symbol derived directly from a non-terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t26 t26 t61 t48 t17 t65`. Let me list the tokens in order: t26, t26, t61, t48, t17, t65.\n\nI notice that the grammar has rules where certain non-terminals produce strings of terminals. For example, NT21 can produce t65 or sometimes longer strings. Wait, looking closer: NT12 \u2192 t12. In the string, 't26' appears first. So how does t26 get generated? Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT20 \u2192 t65. But t26 is a different terminal. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rules.\n\nWait, let me check: looking through the grammar, I see that NT20 \u2192 t65 (wait, is that correct? Let me scan the rules again. Oh, yes, there's a rule NT20 \u2192 t65. So how do I get 't26'? Is there a rule that produces 't26'?\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see that NT10 \u2192 t53, NT10 \u2192 t73, etc., but I don't see any rule that directly produces 't26'. So that's a problem. Because 't26' must come from some non-terminal that can derive it. But if there's no production rule leading to 't26', then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe through a series of steps. Perhaps a non-terminal can produce a string that contains 't26' as part of it. Let me check. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce 't26'. Wait, perhaps it's possible that a non-terminal can generate a larger string that includes 't26'.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the rules. For example, NT8 can produce 't4 NT20', but I'm not sure. Or, maybe looking at the rules for NT10: NT10 can produce 't53' or 't73', but I don't see 't26' being produced.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't26' comes from NT20. But NT20 produces 't65' only. Hmm, that's a problem. So if 't26' is present in the string, but there's no rule that produces 't26' directly, and no non-terminal that can derive it, that would mean the string is invalid. So that would mean the answer is 'No', because 't26' isn't present in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules for any non-terminals that might produce 't26'. Scrolling through the rules, I see that:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't53' or 't73'\n- NT21 \u2192 't65', etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 't65', etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 't61'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1 NT2', but not t26.\n\nWait, what about NT20? Oh, I see NT20 \u2192 't10 NT3' and other rules, but that doesn't directly produce 't26'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to see if the string can be generated step by step. Let me see:\n\nThe first token is 't26'. To get 't26', there must be a rule that ends in 't26', but in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that ends with 't26'. So that's a red flag. Perhaps the production NT10 can somehow generate 't26', but looking, NT10's production is NT10 \u2192 NT6 NT10. Wait, no, NT10 has rules like \u2192 't53', \u2192 't73', etc. So no, NT10 doesn't produce t26.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me see: all the non-terminals that are on the left side of the arrow are non-terminals, but the right side can consist of two non-terminals or a terminal. So if I see a non-terminal on the right, that can further expand.\n\nSo maybe I need to start building the string recursively, applying the rules to see if I can derive 't26 t26 t61 t48 t17 t65'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to check if the tokens can be derived using the grammar. Since 't26' isn't produced by any rule, the string can't be generated. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps 't26' is part of a larger production. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I don't see any production that results in t26. So, the string can't be generated because it contains 't26' as a terminal that the grammar doesn't allow.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the terminal 't26', which is not directly produced by any rule in the grammar.

The grammar is provided, which is quite extensive, and the string to evaluate is `t53 t81 t82 t53 t65 t95`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems most rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, which fits, and there are some terminals as well, like 't53', so that's consistent.\n\nThe string I need to check is a sequence of terminals: t53, t81, t82, t53, t65, t95. I need to see if this can be derived from the starting symbol S by applying productions step by step.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string using the grammar, ensuring that each symbol in the string can be produced by some rule. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So for a string to be generated, the entire string must be produced by a sequence of these productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I can split it into individual terminals:\n1. t53\n2. t81\n3. t82\n4. t53\n5. t65\n6. t95\n\nNow, each of these must correspond to a production. I'll go through each terminal and see what possible productions can generate it.\n\nStarting with t53. Looking at the grammar, I see a rule:\nNT10 -> 't53'\n\nSo, t53 can be directly produced by NT10.\n\nNext, t81: Checking the grammar, I see that NT20 -> 't82', but I need t81. Looking further, there's NT6 -> 't103' which isn't relevant. Wait, let me search the grammar. Oh, I don't see a rule that produces t81 directly. Hmm. That might be an issue. Maybe I'm missing it. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar, seeing 't39' is NT5, and 't16' is NT3. Wait, where else? Oh, wait, the grammar's end is filled with 't's like 't53', 't82', etc., but I don't see a rule for NT81. That might be a problem because t81 is in the string but the grammar doesn't have a production for NT81.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let's check each rule line by line.\n\n scrolling through the rules, I see NT10 -> t53, NT3 -> t16, NT5 -> t39, NT12 is terminal t12, NT16 is t70, NT3 is t29, NT5 is t66, NT15 is t82, etc. But I don't see any rule that produces t81. That's a red flag because if the string contains t81, and it's not produced by any rule, the string can't be generated by the grammar. So if the grammar doesn't have a production for NT81, then t81 can't be part of any string, unless it's part of a larger production involving non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in CNF, the only way to produce a terminal is through a production A \u2192 a. So if there's no production for t81, then t81 can't appear in the string. Hence, if the string contains t81, unless it's being produced via some non-terminal that can derive t81 through multiple steps, but in this case, the grammar doesn't have such a rule. So perhaps the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but the string includes t81. So, let's go back. The grammar provided has the following rules:\n\nLooking for 't81'... Hmm, in the last lines:\n\n\"NT13 -> NT12 NT19\"\n\n\"NT21 -> NT11 NT5\"\n\n\"NT19 -> NT1 NT2\"\n\nBut I don't see any production for NT81. So, seems like t81 is not directly produced by any NT, which means that the string has a terminal t81 that can't be derived from the grammar. Therefore, the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any rule. I'm going through each line:\n\nNT20 -> 't65', NT10 -> 't53', NT5 -> 't66', NT12 is 't12', NT16 is 't70', NT3 is 't29', NT13 is 't82', NT21 appears but ends with t17 or t3, etc. I don't see any 't81' anywhere.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side. Let's start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and it has several productions:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, S can generate strings that are combinations of these two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals has more productions. I need to see if any of them can produce the tokens in the string.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: t77, t82, t43, t82, t73, t39, t48. Since it's written as tokens, each must correspond to an expansion of a non-terminal.\n\nI should start by checking which non-terminals can produce these tokens. Looking through the grammar rules, some non-terminals directly expand into the token 'tXx', where X is a number. For example:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT3 -> 't16' (Wait, that's t16, but in the string we have t77, t82, etc.)\nBut wait, I think I need to check all the rules where a non-terminal expands directly into a token.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals that directly produce the tokens:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12' (matches one 't12' in the string as the last token)\n- NT4 -> 't65' (matches 't48' is t48, not t65. Hmm)\n- NT7 -> 't77' (the first token is t77)\n- NT14 -> 't82' (the second token is t82)\n- NT10 -> 't53' (the third token is t43, not 53)\n- NT5 -> 't39' (the fifth token is t73, which doesn't match)\n- NT3 -> 't16' (not matching any token)\n- Other non-terminals expand into other non-terminals.

Let's see the rules:\n\n- t77: possible via NT7 -> 't77'\n- t82: possible via NT14 -> 't82'\n- t43: Hmm, I don't see any direct production that gives t43. Wait, looking at the rules for NT10: NT10 -> 't53', but in the string it's t43. Did I miss any rule for t43? Let me check the rules again. Oh, there's NT16 -> 't70', but nothing for t43. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a binary tree, so the string can be broken down into non-terminals that expand into the tokens.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each token is generated by some rule that doesn't require further expansion. For example, if any rule directly expands to one of the tokens.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't77', so 't77' is possible.\n- NT14 -> 't82', so 't82' is possible.\n- Looking for 't43': Is there a rule that directly produces 't43'? Looking through the rules, I see NT10 -> 't53', NT4 -> 't65', NT16 -> 't70', NT3 -> 't16', 't17', etc. It seems none of the non-terminals directly produce 't43'. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the rules under NT20: NT20 -> 't48' (so t48 is possible via NT20 -> 't48' because in the string, the last token is t48).\n\nSo for t43, I'm not seeing a direct rule, but maybe it's possible that it's generated via some production that eventually reaches 't43', but let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the tokens are generated through multiple steps, so it's possible that each token in the string is the result of some expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be represented as a sequence of productions.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe string has seven tokens: t77, t82, t43, t82, t73, t39, t48.\n\n- t77: Could be from NT7 -> 't77'.\n- t82: From NT14 -> 't82'.\n- t43: Hmmm, not directly. Perhaps generated via some production. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce t43.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT10 -> 't53' and NT4 -> 't65', not t43. So perhaps t43 is from NT5? Let me check: is there any rule for NT5 that ends with 't43'? Looking at the rules for NT5:\n\n- NT5 -> NT17 NT2\n- NT17 -> NT11 NT12\n- NT12 -> NT12 NT8, but that's recursive. Wait, no, maybe NT17 can be expanded further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string backward to see which non-terminals could produce these.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the grammar is in CNF, so every production is of the form A -> BC, except for the start symbol which can have two symbols on the right. But in our case, all productions are two non-terminals, meaning the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is two non-terminals. So each step of the expansion produces two symbols.\n\nWait, but if the string has seven tokens, that would mean six production steps starting from the start symbol S, as each step replaces one non-terminal with two, increasing the count by one each time.\n\nLet me see the initial count and the target string:\n\nThe target string is 7 symbols long.\n\nBut in CNF, each production increases the length of the string by one. So starting from S (1 symbol), we need 6 productions to reach 7 symbols. So that's possible.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model this by seeing if each token can be derived from some starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols t77, t82, etc., correspond to specific non-terminals that can be reached through the productions.\n\nWait, t77 is only from NT7->t77. So perhaps the t77 is one of the leaves in the derivation. Similarly, t82 is from NT14->t82.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to write the parse tree or see if each token can be matched.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be built starting from S.\n\nLet me consider that S can produce either NT12NT12, NT7NT14, or NT9NT12.\n\nSo the entire string must be a concatenation of these pairs.\n\nSo the string is t77 t82 t43 t82 t73 t39 t48.\n\nIf I group these into pairs, but it's 7 tokens, which is an odd number. Since each production step adds one token, starting from S, perhaps the derivation is longer.\n\nWait, no: the number of symbols in the string is 7, which is 1 + 6 expansions. So, the derivation would have 6 expansions. But in the way CNF works, each expansion replaces one non-terminal with two, so the length increases by 1 each time. So from 1 to 7 requires 6 expansions.\n\nSo, starting from S, each expansion step increases the count by 1. So the parse tree will have 7 leaves, which correspond to the tokens in the string.\n\nSo I need to see if the string can be generated by a series of expansions starting from S.\n\nLet me try to find a possible parse tree.\n\nThe string is: t77, t82, t43, t82, t73, t39, t48.\n\nLet me consider possible starting productions from S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-110","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is `t81 t65 t65 t82 t53 t65 t12`. \n\nFirst off, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars such that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar fits this structure, so that's a good start.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of NT symbols like NT9, NT21, etc., each eventually deriving into strings starting with 't' and some numbers. Some of these non-terminals derive directly into terminals. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12', NT10 \u2192 't53', NT4 \u2192 't65', and so on.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t81 t65 t65 t82 t53 t65 t12`. Let's break this down. The first three tokens are t81, t65, t65. Then t82, t53, t65, and ends with t12.\n\nI think the approach here is to see how these terminals can be generated from the non-terminals. Since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, I can work backwards from the string into the grammar.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree for this string. Starting from the left:\n\nt81, t65, t65, t82, t53, t65, t12.\n\nI know that NT12 is t12, so t12 is directly a terminal. Similarly, NT10 is t53, NT4 is t65, and BT12 is t70, BT3 is t16, BT5 is t66, BT15 is t82, BT8 is t48, etc.\n\nLooking at the string, t81. I need to find a production that can derive t81 as a terminal. Checking the grammar, I see NT13 \u2192 NT11 NT14, but that doesn't directly produce t81. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me see. Hmm, looking through the productions, I notice that NT13 \u2192 NT5 NT14, but NT5 has productions that lead to t66, t77, etc. Wait, maybe I should see the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me list the non-terminals and see their direct productions as terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't53', 't43'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't65', 't17'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't65', 't48', 't26'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't61', 't48'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't61', 't70'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't77'\n\nWait, I think I need a better approach. Maybe it's better to see which non-terminals derive into which terminals. Let me see the productions step by step.\n\nLooking for t81: I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t81. So maybe t81 is a result of a combination of non-terminals. Looking deeper, perhaps NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14, NT5 \u2192 't39', 't77', etc. Wait, maybe it's better to map each possible path.\n\nAlternatively, since t81 is at the beginning, perhaps it's derived from NT13. Checking the productions for NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT11 NT14. Then, NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT10, and NT15 is from NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8. NT21 has productions like NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5, and so on.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be formed by the grammar step by step.\n\nStarting from the given string: t81 t65 t65 t82 t53 t65 t12.\n\nLet me break it down into parts:\n\nt81 t65 t65 = T1, T2, T3\n\nt82 = T4\n\nt53 = T5\n\nt65 = T6\n\nt12 = T7\n\nI think I can approach this by seeing how the non-terminals can be combined into these tokens.\n\nT1: t81 is likely from NT13, as NT13 \u2192 NT11 NT14, and then NT11 leads to NT15 NT10. Then NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8, which is t71? Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the possible steps:\n\nTo get t81, perhaps NT13 \u2192 NT11 NT14. Then NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT10, and NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8. Then NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5, which can be t17 or something else. Hmm, this doesn't directly give t81.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12. NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT10, NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8, etc. Still not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the possible ways to split the string into two parts that are each derived from two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t81 t65 t65 t82 t53 t65 t12\n\nMaybe the string can be divided as:\n\nFirst part: t81 t65 t65 (which is T1, T2, T3), then t82 (T4), t53 (T5), t65 (T6), t12 (T7).\n\nBut each step in the grammar can only produce two symbols at a time. So perhaps I should think of the entire string as a series of steps where each step combines two non-terminals into the next part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string can be generated by starting from the start symbols S \u2192 NT12 NT16, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which branches into multiple options:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT16\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT14\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, looking at the productions:\n\nS\u2192 NT12 NT16?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar as given is:\n\nS -> NT12 NT16\n\nWait no, looking back: the user wrote it as S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, but that seems incorrect. Wait, the original grammar is a bit confusing. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT12 NT16?\n\nWait, looking at the initial list, I see:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, that can't be right because S should be a single symbol. Wait, maybe the user made a typo. Let me look again.\n\nWait, here's the grammar as given by the user:\n\n```plaintext\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nS -> NT9 NT14\n. S -> NT9 NT12\n```\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because S is a single symbol but has multiple productions. So S can produce:\n\n- NT12 NT12 NT8\n\n- NT9 NT14\n\n- NT9 NT12\n\nBut that would mean S is a start symbol that can derive into three different sequences. But that seems odd because S is a single symbol, and cannot have multiple productions except in sequences.\n\nWait, but the way it's written, S can produce multiple sequences, which might not fit the standard Chomsky Normal Form, where the start symbol produces a single pair of non-terminals. Maybe the user made a mistake in the formatting, but proceeding with the assumption that the grammar is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the productions are meant to be:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nS -> NT9 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nBut that would make S produce three different strings of non-terminals. However, in Chomsky Normal Form, the start symbol typically produces a pair of non-terminals, not three. So perhaps this suggests that the grammar isn't in proper CNF, but regardless, we'll proceed.\n\nGiven that, I think I might be overcomplicating this. Maybe I should consider that the string must be derived by some left or right derivations from the non-terminals.\n\nGiven the string `t81 t65 t65 t82 t53 t65 t12`, let's see:\n\nLooking at the end, t12 is directly produced by NT12. So perhaps the last part of the string is derived from NT12.\n\nBefore that, we have t65. That can be either from NT4 \u2192 't65' or from NT20 \u2192 't65"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the grammar, I see that each non-terminal S and NTx (with x from 0-21) has productions that either split into two non-terminals (left-hand side is a non-terminal) or directly produce a terminal. \n\nThe string to check consists of several tokens: t82, t53, t82, t43, t82, t17, t65, t48. I notice that t53, t43, t65, and t48 are all terminals, while others like t82 and t17 are also terminals. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, I see that some NTs produce terminals as per the rules. For example, NT12 \u2192 't95', NT10 \u2192 't53', NT4 \u2192 't65', etc. So some non-terminals directly correspond to these terminals.\n\nI need to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules.

Let's see which NT can produce t82.\n\nNT15 and NT13 both have production to 't82'. So S starts as NT... Let me think about the structure.\n\nThe start symbol is S. S can expand into NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. So S \u2192 X Y, where X and Y are NTs.\n\nEach X and Y must produce a string of terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of 8 tokens, so perhaps the derivation results in a string of 8 terminals, each from X and Y expansions.\n\nWait, but how? Because each X and Y would each expand into a number of symbols. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, considering that S \u2192 X Y, each X and Y are non-terminals.

So perhaps each X and Y produce 4 symbols each.\n\nBut looking at the NTs that produce 't82', like NT15 and NT13, each produces a single 't82'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X and Y are more complex.\n\nWait, let me see if t82 can be part of a longer expansion.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT20 \u2192 't65', but also NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3.\n\nSimilarly, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nWait, perhaps the string comes from a longer initial expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\nt82 t53 t82 t43 t82 t17 t65 t48\n\nI can try to split this into possible sequences that match the grammar.\n\nLet me think of possible ways to split the string.\n\nLooking at the start, t82 can come from NT15 \u2192 't82' or NT13 \u2192 't82'.

{"custom_id":"request-125","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t65 t53 t82 t43 t48 t53 t65 t65`. I remember that CNF is a specific form where each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Since the original grammar is in CNF, that should help simplify the analysis.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the given string. The string starts with `t65` and has other tokens like `t53`, `t43`, etc. It seems like a series of terminals, some repeated, so the string is `t65 t53 t82 t43 t48 t53 t65 t65`. Since it's a string of terminals, I need to check if it can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has a few production rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these S rules results in two NT-terminals. The string has eight tokens, which is even, so that might make sense, but I need to dig deeper.\n\nI should consider the structure of the string. Each unit in the production rules may correspond to specific sequences in the string. For instance, if S \u2192 NT12 NT12, then each NT12 can produce certain tokens. Let's look at the productions for NT12:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 ... (other productions, but the first two are key)\n\nLooking at that, each NT12 can expand into NT17 and NT8. Then, let's see what NT17 and NT8 produce.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT7 NT12\nNT7 \u2192 NT7 NT12 or NT7 NT2 or others\nWait, but NT17 leads back to NT7, which might be a loop. Alternatively, perhaps we need to follow a different path.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other nodes, like NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9, which could lead to a repeated production. But I'm getting a bit lost here.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to look for each token in the string and see if there's a production path that leads to it. For example, the first token is `t65`. Scanning through the productions, I notice:\n\nLooking at the last parts of the productions:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't65' is defined as NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT8.\nWait, no, actually, the last lines of the grammar include several terminals, such as:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\nNT3 \u2192 't16'\nNT1 \u2192 't19'\nNT19 \u2192 't61'\nNT20 \u2192 't26'\nNT8 \u2192 't48'\nNT21 \u2192 't65' is not in the list, but wait, I see NT21 productions leading to t65?\n\nLooking back:\n\nLooking for NT21 \u2192 something that leads to t65.\n\nIn the productions, for example:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5\nBut looking at NT17 and NT5, which might not directly lead to t65. Alternatively:\n\nWait, let's look for production rules where the right-hand side can produce t65. For example:\n\nLooking at the end of the productions, I see NT20 \u2192 't65' in some of the last lines. Wait, actually:\n\nHere are some of the terminal productions:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16'\n- NT1 \u2192 't19'\n- NT19 \u2192 't61'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65' (twice)\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT15 \u2192 't82' (twice)\n- NT4 \u2192 't17'\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n- NT17 \u2192 't61'\n- NT13 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't81'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT8 \u2192 't48'\n\nSo, specific terminals like t12, t16, t17, t48, t43, t53, etc. are defined as the right-hand sides of certain non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t65, which is defined by NT20 as NT20 \u2192 't65' (appears twice). So the last NT in a production like S \u2192 NT12 NT12 could perhaps produce t65 if one of the NT12s expands to 't65'. So, let's check if NT12 can lead to any of the terminal tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at NT12:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\nAnd NT17 \u2192 NT7 NT12, which could lead to further recursion but perhaps not directly t65. Alternatively, looking at NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT4.\n\nWait, NT16 \u2192 NT16 NT4? That seems like a potential loop. But looking at NT4, it's not a terminal. Alternatively, there's NT4 \u2192 't65'?\n\nWait, in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n\nYes, indeed, NT4 \u2192 't65'. So, if a production of NT4 is 't65', then if any non-terminal can produce NT4, that would produce 't65'.\n\nSo, for example, if NT16 \u2192 NT16 NT4, and NT4 can lead to 't65', then perhaps this can produce a 't65' after some steps.\n\nBut let me try to think about the string. The string is a sequence of 8 terminals: t65 t53 t82 t43 t48 t53 t65 t65.\n\nEach production in the grammar adds exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, since the string is 8 terminals, that suggests 7 production steps (each step adds a terminal or non-terminal, but since it's a string, each production in the S rule adds two non-terminals, which in turn get expanded).\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire derivation.\n\nSince the string is t65 t53 t82 t43 t48 t53 t65 t65, that's 8 tokens. It might help to build a parse tree from the start symbol S, expanding the productions step by step until I match the tokens.\n\nLet's consider possible derivations:\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. Each production of S gives two non-terminals.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nLet me pick one path. Let's try S \u2192 NT12 NT12.\n\nSo, the first part is NT12, and it needs to expand into the first part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t65 is first. So, if NT12 can derive t65, that's promising.\n\nLooking at NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. Wait, but that would need to somehow produce t65. But both NT17 and NT8 are non-terminals.\n\nBut NT17 \u2192 NT7 NT12, which might go on, but I don't see a direct way to get t65 yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT12 has another production, like NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT4, which we saw earlier.\n\nWait, yes: NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT4.\n\nSo, if NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT4, then let's see what NT16 and NT4 produce.\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT16 NT4.\n\nWait, that's a loop unless it can terminate. NT16 can only produce NT16 NT4, which are non-terminals. So this would suggest that NT16 can only be a sequence generating more NT16 and NT4, which doesn't help. So perhaps that production is a dead end unless there's a way for NT16 to lead to a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT16 \u2192 NT16 NT4, but maybe I'm missing other productions.\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions, the last part of the grammar for NT16 is:\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT16 NT4\n\nBut there's also this line:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT17 NT20\n\nWait, perhaps that's not directly relevant.\n\nWait, I see more lines, like:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7\n\nBTW, but perhaps there are other NT4 productions.\n\nLooking at the entire list:\n\nLooking for NT4:\n\nYes, multiple NT4 production rules:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT11 NT20\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 ... others?\n\nWait, here's the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, Chomsky normal form usually has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand into terminals directly. For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT8, and NT12 \u2192 't12', NT8 \u2192 't48'. Wait, but the string starts with 't26', which is from NT20 \u2192 't26'. So maybe the string starts with NT20\u2192't26', then perhaps a production that leads to the rest.\n\nWait, let me parse the entire string step by step. The string is: t26, t65, t40, t65, t43, t95, t48, t82, t95. So 9 tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps we can find a sequence of productions that leads to this string. Let me check the non-terminals and see if they can generate these tokens.\n\nStarting with S, the first production from S seems to go to NT12 NT8 or others. But the string starts with t26, which is generated by NT20. So maybe S goes to something that eventually leads to NT20.\n\nWait, S can also go to NT9, NT7, or NT13 via other productions, but nt7 might not be the right path here. Let's see: S \u2192 NT12 NT12 or S \u2192 NT13 NT8? No, the initial productions for S are S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12. The string starts with NT20, which is a terminal. So maybe we need a chain of productions that eventually leads to these terminals.\n\nLet me check the possible paths for NT20. Looking at the grammar, NT20 can expand into 't26' (which is terminal), but also into NT10 NT3 or NT14 NT21, etc. So, for the first 't26', that would be NT20\u2192't26', so the first part of the string is 't26', so the start would be NT20.\n\nSo, S must have a production that eventually leads to NT20. Let me see S's productions: S can go to NT20 NT15, right? Wait, in the initial productions, S is:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nLooking through the top-level productions, I don't see S \u2192 NT20... Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me scan the productions:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, S is the start symbol, but looking at the initial four lines, S's productions are S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12. Are there more? Let me check: the grammar given has multiple lines, but the top-level S productions are not all there. It seems like the initial three are the main ones, and perhaps the others are other non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking through the grammar, I think S is only in those three initial productions. So, S can't directly produce NT20. So maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps NT20 has a production that leads back to S? No, looking at the grammar, the productions for NT20 are: NT20 \u2192 't26' or NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3 or ... So, the initial S doesn't directly go to NT20.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to find another path. Alternatively, perhaps the string is more than one NT20, but not sure. Let me try to break down the string into segments that can be generated by non-terminals.\n\nThe first token is t26, which is NT20. So perhaps there's a path where S eventually expands into NT20 followed by other non-terminals. Let me think about the production chain for S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, maybe S can go through some intermediate steps. For example, maybe S \u2192 NT9 NT12, then NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9, and NT6 can expand further. Let me see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT2 NT10\n\nNT2 can go to NT11 NT17, etc.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be generated by the given grammar by tracing possible steps.\n\nAnother approach is to try to build the parse tree for the string step by step. Let's list the tokens: t26, t65, t40, t65, t43, t95, t48, t82, t95.\n\nStarting with S, what can produce t26? Maybe through NT20. So, let's assume that the first production is S \u2192 NT20 NT15, but wait, I'm not sure. Wait, looking at the grammar, S's initial productions don't include NT20 directly. So perhaps we need a path where S \u2192 something \u2192 NT20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT71 NT8 or other routes, but I don't think so. Wait, the initial productions for S are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nAre there any other productions for S? I don't think so because the rest are for other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the initial part of the string is t26, so perhaps the string is part of a larger derivation that comes from a different production, not the initial ones. Because none of the initial S productions start with NT20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is generated by another non-terminal that's not S, but given that it's a C-F grammar, only S can be the start. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with \"t26 t65 t40 t65 t43 t95 t48 t82 t95\" corresponds to multiple expansions, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider the length of the string: 9 tokens. Let's see if it's possible to derive 9 tokens from S.\n\nEach step in the leftmost derivation would consume some non-terminals and replace them with more symbols until only terminals remain.\n\nBut with 9 tokens, the derivation would require 8 productions, as each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. But since we're dealing with C-F, each production splits into two, so the number of steps would relate to the number of productions needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some non-terminals can expand into multiple terminals in one step, but in the given grammar, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, so each step produces either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to parse the string by working backwards, checking if all tokens can be replaced by non-terminals using the productions.\n\nLooking at the last token, t95. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t95.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT19, NT9, and others might produce t95. For example, NT19 \u2192 NT11 NT4, NT4 could produce t17 or t65, t20, etc. Wait, perhaps NT9 \u2192 NT12 NT8, which is t12 and t48, but not t95.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for a production that has a terminal t95.

Looking at NT15, which can go to 't82' or NT21 NT8, which could go to t26 and others.\n\nWait, perhaps NT17 \u2192 't61' or NT13 \u2192 't82'.\n\nAlternatively, looking for any non-terminal that can reach 't95' directly.

{"custom_id":"request-146","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string `t19 t82 t40 t70 t40 t82 t40` is generated by the provided context-free grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It's in Chomsky normal form, which has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each rule either splits into two symbols or produces a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and it has several productions. But looking closer, most of them go to NT9, NT7, etc., but the main ones that produce terminals are the rules that have 't' followed by a number, like NT12 \u2192 't12', NT16 \u2192 't70', NT5 \u2192 't65', and others. Also, some NT symbols split into two NT symbols that might eventually produce these terminals.\n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of terminals: t19, t82, t40, t70, t40, t82, t40. There are 7 elements, which is odd. Grammars in Chomsky NForm produce strings where each step reduces symbols, maintaining a certain structure.\n\nI think I should use a parsing approach, either top-down (using the grammar) or bottom-up, but given the complexity, maybe top-down would be manageable.\n\nLet me break down the string into its components and see which symbols could match the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't19'. Looking at the grammar rules, 't19' is produced by NT19. So I need to see if NT19 can derive to 't19' and then the remaining string.\n\nLooking at NT19's productions: From the grammar, I see NT19 can split into NT1 and NT4. So NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT4.\n\nNext, let's look at NT1 and NT4. NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT2, and NT4 \u2192 NT11 NT20, among others. Hmm, this could go on, but let me see if we can find a path that leads to the next tokens.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to work from the string and see if each step can be matched by a production.\n\nStarting string: t19 t82 t40 t70 t40 t82 t40\n\nFirst, 't19' comes from NT19. So we have NT19 \u2192 't19' and we're left with 't82 t40 t70 t40 t82 t40'.\n\nNow, NT19 splits into NT1 and NT4. So we need to match NT1 and NT4 with the next tokens.\n\nWhat's NT1? From the grammar: NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT2, and also NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT8. Hmm, not immediately obvious. Let's check NT1's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT1's rules include: NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT2, NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT21, etc. Maybe another rule: NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT8. Wait, that's an 't82' as 't95'? Or maybe I should check the NT9 and NT8 rules.\n\nWait, from the grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9 and also NT9 \u2192 NT11 NT11. So it's recursive until it hits NT11, which might have a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps NT9 can derive 't82' as per the rules provided. Looking at the grammar, for example, NT9 \u2192 NT11 NT11. Then NT11 might go to NT0 or other NTs.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think step by step.\n\nStarting with NT19 \u2192 t19, then NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT4. So after 't19', we need to parse 't82 t40 t70 t40 t82 t40' as NT1 followed by NT4.\n\nLooking at how NT1 and NT4 can be produced:\n\n- NT1 can be NT5 NT2, which are more rules.\n- NT4 can be NT11 NT20 or others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT19 can be followed by another NT production. Wait, the initial string is 't19 t82 t40 t70 t40 t82 t40'. So after 't19', the next could be 't82' as part of another NT rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for other ways. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me list all the possible productions that result in 't19'. NT19 \u2192 't19', as per the rules provided.\n\nSo the first token is matched by NT19. Now, the remaining string is 't82 t40 t70 t40 t82 t40'.\n\nNow, the next step is NT19 splitting into NT1 and NT4. So 't19' is followed by NT1 and NT4's derivations. So after 't19', the next tokens should be matched by NT1 and NT4's combinations.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- NT1 can be, for example, NT5 NT2. Let's see if 't82' can be generated by NT1.\n\nWait, maybe NT1 can lead to 't82' via another path. Let me check NT1's rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see a production like NT1 \u2192 't82' directly. Instead, NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT2, which in turn have their own rules.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to look for the start symbol S and see if it can generate the string, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe the string can be split into parts that match different NT rules.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the string: t19 t82 t40 t70 t40 t82 t40. It's 7 tokens, which is odd. If the grammar is structured in a way that requires even number of non-terminals, but perhaps the string can be broken down correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' in the string is a terminal, so the string has 7 terminals. Starting with 't19', which is generated by NT19. Then, after that, we need NT19's split into NT1 and NT4, which must together produce t82, t40, etc.\n\nBut NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT4 needs to produce t82, t40, t70, t40, t82, t40. Wait, perhaps NT1 and NT4 each contribute parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built in a way that each 't' comes from a terminal production, but it's possible that some NT symbols might split into other NTs which then produce more symbols.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string using a recursive descent method.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible parse:\n\n1. Start with S, which has rules like S \u2192 NT12 NT12 NT12 or others. Wait, the initial S productions are:\n\n   S \u2192 NT12 NT12 NT12 (but wait, looking back, no. The first line is S \u2192 NT12 NT12 NT12? Or wait, actually, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, S \u2192 NT12 NT12 NT12? Let me check. The first line after the grammar is \"S -> NT12 NT12 NT12 NT12\", but no. Wait, perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, the user wrote:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo the initial S can produce three different sequences.\n\nWait, no, I think it's a typo. Let me look again.\n\nUnder the grammar, the first line is S -> NT12 NT12 NT12? Or S -> NT12 NT12 NT12?\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT12\n\nWait, actually, let me recount. Looking back, the user actually wrote:\n\nThe grammar lines are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT12\n\nBut no, that can't be right because in Chomsky NForm, each production's left side must have a single non-terminal, and the right side must be two symbols. So S -> NT12 NT12 is a possible production, but the line says S \u2192 NT12 NT12 NT12, which would imply three symbols on the right, which is not allowed in CNF. Hmm, perhaps the user made an error.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the user's message, the first line after the grammars is:\n\nFirst three grammar rules:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT12\n\nWait, that can't be right because in CNF, each production must consist of at most two non-terminals. So this seems incorrect. Let me check if I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps it's S -> NT12 NT12 and another rule. No, the first three lines say"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-169","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to evaluate whether it's generated by the grammar. The string is 't65 t73 t40 t82 t53 t12 t17 t65 t65 t53'. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like the right-hand sides of the non-terminals mostly expand into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. Some of the rules have terminals as their right-hand sides, which suggests that some symbols in the string might correspond directly to leaves in the parse tree.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, the initial symbol is S, which can produce three options: NT12 and NT8, etc. Each of these non-terminals has their own production rules, some of which involve other non-terminals, and some eventually produce terminal symbols like 't65', 't73', etc.\n\nThe string is composed of ten tokens: t65, t73, t40, t82, t53, t12, t17, t65, t65, t53. My task is to determine if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI notice that some of these terminals are assigned to non-terminals, like NT12 -> 't12', NT4 -> 't65' and so on. So, I can think of these as direct production steps where a non-terminal becomes a terminal.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into parts that match these terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, t65 appears three times. In the grammar, NT4, NT12, NT16, NT20, and others produce 't65'. For example, NT12 -> 't12', but there's also S -> NT12 NT8, which might produce 't12' and another symbol. But wait, in the string, t65 is in position 2 and 6 and 9.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for each non-terminal that can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT21 -> 't82' (multiple times)\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT4 -> 't65', but also other terminals.\nWait, looking closer:\n\nNT4 -> 't65' in multiple rules: look for the ones.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't65' appears a few times, like NT14 -> 't4', NT14 -> 't4 NT5', wait no.

No, looking again:\n\nLooking up NT4: I see that NT4 -> 't65' is present twice:\n- NT14 -> 't4' happens twice, but NT4 itself isn't directly producing 't65'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me list out NT4's rules:\n\nNT4:\n- \u2192 NT17 NT2\n- \u2192 NT17 NT2 (twice)\n- \u2192 NT7 NT20\n- \u2192 NT7 NT20 (twice)\n- \u2192 NT11 NT20\n- \u2192 NT11 NT20 (twice)\n- \u2192 t65 once\n- \u2192 t65 once\nSo yes, NT4 can produce 't65' twice.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 has rules leading to 't10' and 't15'?\n\nWait, let's look for 't73' in the string. Where does 't73' come from? Looking through the rules, NT10 has 't53'? Wait:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT10 -> 't53' once, and another NT10 -> 't43' once.\n- Wait, in the rules: NT10 -> 't43' once, NT10 -> 't53' once. So 't73' must come from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, the string has t73. Let me check the grammar for rules producing 't73'.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any non-terminals directly producing 't73'. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps 't73' is produced by a combination of steps.\n\nWait, let's go methodically. Let's parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t65, t73, t40, t82, t53, t12, t17, t65, t65, t53.\n\nI need to find a derivation path from S to this string.\n\nStart with S. S has three production rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\nWait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT8\nBut wait, looking back, the first rule for S is S \u2192 NT12 NT12? Or is it S \u2192 NT12 NT12?\n\nWait, the first S rule says S \u2192 NT12 NT12? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the user's grammar:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nThe first three S rules are:\n\n``` \nS -> NT12 NT12 \nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n```\n\nWait, no, let me check the user's input.

Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, for NT14, the rules are:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT4 NT5, etc. So perhaps not directly t65. Wait, I got a bit confused earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-171","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the string `t43 t16 t82 t40 t82 t73 t65 t53 t61 t48` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that the left-hand side can also be a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is two non-terminals. But in this case, I see some rules where the right side is a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Wait, no, looking again, all the terminals are single tokens, so the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the rules like S \u2192 NT12 NT12, but then there are other symbols like 't43', which are terminals. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the grammar has both non-terminals and terminals. Because some rules have non-terminals and others have terminals. So it's actually a modified CNF, perhaps, because in standard CNF, all productions except the terminals are non-terminals. So maybe the grammar is not pure CNF but includes terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, but the problem states it's in Chomsky normal form, which typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. However, I also recall that sometimes CNF can include cases where a production can have a single terminal on the right side for the case of dealing with the empty string, but that's more for leftmost derivations. Wait, no, in standard CNF, the right-hand side can only produce one terminal, but in the problem, some rules have two non-terminals on the right side, but others have a single terminal. So perhaps this grammar isn't in strict CNF but has some rules where the right side is a terminal. Alternatively, maybe the terminals are being used to represent single-character strings, so the right side can have either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the given grammar, I see that some rules have a mix, like NT21 -> NT17 NT5, which seems to be two non-terminals. But then I also see NT20 -> 't103', which is a terminal, so that's a single terminal on the right side. Hmm, so perhaps the grammar allows for productions where the right side is a single terminal, thus making it not strictly CNF but a variant. Alternatively, perhaps the terminals are being treated as single-character strings, and the grammar's productions allow for that.\n\nIn any case, the goal is to derive the given string using the grammar. Let's look at the string: `t43 t16 t82 t40 t82 t73 t65 t53 t61 t48`. There are 10 tokens, each being a terminal, so the string is length 10. We'll need to see if a derivation starting from S can produce this string in 10 steps (since each production either introduces two non-terminals, but in the case of a terminal, it's a single terminal).\n\nWait, no, in a typical left-derivation, each step introduces either one terminal or two non-terminals, but since the string is all terminals, we need to see how each terminal could be derived.\n\nWait, to make it clearer, let's note the positions:\n\n1. t43\n2. t16\n3. t82\n4. t40\n5. t82\n6. t73\n7. t65\n8. t53\n9. t61\n10. t48\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, there are a number of rules where a terminal appears, like NT12 -> 't12', etc. So each terminal is the production of some non-terminal. So first, let's map each terminal to its corresponding production.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- t43: Looking through the rules, I see NT10 -> 't43' (rule: NT10 -> 't43'). So t43 comes from NT10.\n\n- t16: Check where 't16' comes from. In the rules, I see NT3 -> 't16'.\n\n- t82: Looking for 't82'\u2014wait, I see NT13 -> 't82' and NT3 -> 't82', and NT14 -> 't65' doesn't help. Wait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT13 -> 't82' (rule: NT13 -> 't82')\n- NT3 -> 't82' (rule: NT3 -> 't82')\n- Also, NT15 -> 't82' (from NT15 -> 't82')?\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. The provided rules include:\n\nNT13 -> 't82'}\nNT3 -> 't82'}\nNT15 -> 't82'}\n\nHmm, so t82 can be derived from NT13, NT3, or NT15.\n\nSimilarly, the other terms:\n\n- t40: Looking through the rules, I see NT0 -> 't40' (rule: NT0 -> 't40').\n- t73: Looking for 't73'\u2014the rule is NT5 -> 't73' (from NT5 -> 't73').\n- t65: NT20 -> 't65', and NT7 -> 't65'.\n- t53: Looking for 't53'\u2014rule is NT10 -> 't53' (from NT10 -> 't53').\n- t61: Hmm, let's check. I see NT17 -> 't61' (rule: NT17 -> 't61').\n- t61 comes from NT17.\n\n- t61: As above, from NT17.\n- t48: Looking for 't48'\u2014that's NT3 -> 't48' (rule: NT3 -> 't48').\n\nSo let's write down the required non-terminals that need to derive each terminal:\n\n1. t43 \u2192 NT10\n2. t16 \u2192 NT3\n3. t82 \u2192 NT13, NT3, or NT15\n4. t40 \u2192 NT0\n5. t82 \u2192 NT13, NT3, or NT15\n6. t73 \u2192 NT5\n7. t65 \u2192 NT20 or NT7\n8. t53 \u2192 NT10\n9. t61 \u2192 NT17\n10. t48 \u2192 NT3\n\nOkay, so starting from S, we need to see a way to split the string into a derivation of these non-terminals, each step expanding the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nBut since the string is a sequence of terminals, each terminal must come from a production in the grammar.\n\nLet's try to see if the grammar can produce this string.\n\nThe first step is to choose which production to use for S. Looking at the given grammar:\n\nS has three productions:\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nEach production of S has two non-terminals as the right-hand side. So from S, we'd have to derive a string of two non-terminals, each of which will eventually produce their own string, and the combination will have to match the given string, which is 10 terminals. Wait, but each production for S would start with two non-terminals, so in a leftmost derivation, we'd take each of those two non-terminals, and each would expand into more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut wait, our string is 10 terminals. So starting from S, each step would involve expanding non-terminals into more symbols until we reach terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's more manageable to look for a way to split the string into parts that each correspond to the non-terminals derived from S's productions. Since S has three possible productions, each with two non-terminals, each production would split the overall string into two parts, each part corresponding to the two non-terminals. But the given string is 10 terminals, which is even, so maybe each part of a split could account for a certain number of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production for S could lead to a certain structure. Let's explore each option.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n\nIf S is split into two NT12's, then each NT12 would have to derive a string of 5 terminals each, because 5+5=10.\n\nLooking at NT12's productions, there is NG12 \u2192 NT17 NT8 (rule: NT12 -> NT17 NT8). So NT12's production is two non-terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side except for the start symbol, which might produce a terminal directly. \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar to see the structure. The start symbol is S, and from S, it can go to several options like NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, etc. Each non-terminal (NTs) then has productions that eventually lead down to terminals like 't53', 't82', etc.\n\nSo the string I have is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces.

Let me break this down: it's a sequence of 11 terminals, all lowercase except for the number parts. Each token is a terminal. The question is whether the S start symbol can derive this entire string through a series of productions.\n\nFirst, I notice that S can produce either NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT12 NT12\nSo the string would start with NT12 NT12. Let's see what NT12 can produce. Looking at rule 6: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So each NT12 can split into NT17 NT8.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t61, so let's see what NT17 can produce. From rule 72, NT17 \u2192 't61'. So yes, NT17 can derive t61. Then, the next part would be NT17 producing t61, followed by NT8. What does NT8 produce? From rule 19: NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20. So each NT8 can produce NT4 NT20.\n\nNow, let's go back. The first production is S \u2192 NT12 NT12, each producing NT17 NT8. So the first two NT12s are each producing NT17 NT8, so the first four symbols would be t61 (from NT17) and then perhaps another NT17 \u2192 t61, followed by NT8s.\n\nBut the given string starts with t61, then t17, which is t17, not t61. Wait, that doesn't match. Because if NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, then when you derive two NT12s, you get four symbols: NT17, NT17, NT8, NT8, which translate to t61, t61, then whatever NT8s produce. But the string starts with t61, t17, t73, etc.\n\nSo this option might not fit. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, Option 2: S \u2192 NT7 NT14\nSo the string starts with NT7 and NT14. Let's see what these produce.\n\nLooking at rule 13: NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11. So NT7 can split into NT2 and NT11.\n\nNT2 has multiple productions:\nFrom rule 10, NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17\nRule 16, NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20\nRule 18, NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT16\n\nBut in the string, the second token is t17. Let me see.\n\nIf NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11, and NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17 (rule 10), then NT2 can produce NT11 NT17.\n\nNow, looking at NT11: rule 28 says NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT10. NT15 is rule 66: NT15 \u2192 't82' (from rule 73: NT15 \u2192 NT82?), wait, wait, looking back, rule 73 says NT15 \u2192 't82'. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at rules, NT15 \u2192 't82' is rule 73? Wait, rule 73 says NT15 \u2192 't82' (assuming the last number is 73, but I might have miscounted). Let me count again.\n\nWait, the rules are numbered up to 78, so rule 73: NT3 \u2192 't81' is 74, and rule 75: NT0 \u2192 't4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The grammar has several non-terminals: S, NT0, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT8, NT9, NT10, NT12, NT13, NT14, NT15, NT16, NT17, NT19, NT20, NT21. \n\nThe start symbol is S. The string consists of a series of terminals: t26, t82, t73, t53, t95, t65 twice, etc. I need to break down the string into components and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, many non-terminals directly produce a single terminal. For example, S seems to be producing combinations of these NTs. Let me look into how S can be expanded. \n\nThe productions for S are:\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo S can branch into different combinations. Let's pick one option for S and see if the string can be derived from it.\n\nLet's take S \u2192 NT12 NT12. Then, each NT12 can be replaced by their own productions. Looking at NT12's production: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So each NT12 becomes NT17 NT8. The string starts with t26, which seems like a direct terminal. Let me check if NT12 can produce t26.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT10 \u2192 't73' and NT20 \u2192 't65' among others. There's also NT6 \u2192 't39', but t26 is not directly produced by any NT as a single terminal. Wait, looking again, maybe I missed it. Let me scan through the productions again.\n\nWait, in the given productions, NT20 is sometimes 't65', and NT21 can produce 't65'. But I don't see any NT directly producing 't26'. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. \n\nLooking through the productions for NT2-21, the only terminals are under NT10, NT12, NT14, NT15, NT16, NT17, NT19, NT20, NT21, and some others. I notice NT12 can produce t12, which is the string 't12', but in our string, we have 't26'. Hmm, maybe t26 is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, could t26 be a result of a longer production? Let me check the productions again. I don't see any NT that directly produces 't26', so perhaps t26 is part of a non-terminal expansion. Maybe it's an intermediate part of a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider different branches of the grammar. Let me think about other options for S. There's S \u2192 NT7 NT14 and S \u2192 NT9 NT12. Maybe one of these can lead to the string.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT7 NT14. Let's expand NT7 and NT14. \n\nNT7 has the production: NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11. NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17 and also NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20. NT11 has NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT15 and also NT11 \u2192 other things. This seems a bit complex, but let me try.\n\nWait, let me see. The string starts with t26, which I'm not sure how to get. Let me look for other S options. Let me check S \u2192 NT12 NT12 again. So S expands to NT12 NT12, each of which expands to NT17 NT8. So S would be (NT17 NT8) (NT17 NT8). So the full string from this expansion would be NT17 NT8 NT17 NT8.\n\nEach NT17 can expand into several options. Looking at NT17's productions: NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10, NT17 \u2192 NT7 NT20, and NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4. Hmm. None of these seem to directly produce the required terminals.\n\nFor example, if NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10, then we have NT8 and NT10. NT8 can be 't48' or 't26' (wait, in the productions, NT8 has: NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20, and elsewhere, looking back, NT20 \u2192 't65' and other possibilities. Wait, in the productions under NT20: some instances are 't65' as terminal? Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at the production list, there are several instances where NT12 is replaced by 't12', NT16 is sometimes 't70', but I'm not seeing 't26' directly. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me re-examine the list.\n\nLooking through the productions, for example, NT20 \u2192 't65' and also NT6 \u2192 't39'. But not sure about 't26'. Maybe I need to look further. Wait, in the production list, NT5 \u2192 't66', which might not help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is too complex. Maybe a better way is to represent the string as a sequence and see if it can be broken down into the grammar's production rules.\n\nThe string is: t26 t82 t43 t82 t73 t82 t53 t82 t53 t95 t65 t65.\n\nLet me split it into parts. The first element is t26, which isn't directly a terminal of any NT I see. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Some non-terminals have multiple productions, some have single terminals. Maybe t26 is part of a longer production.\n\nWait, looking back at the production list: NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20. So if NT8 is replaced by NT4 and NT20, and if NT4 can produce t17, and NT20 can produce t48 or other things, but we have t26 in the string. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some NTs produce multiple terminals in a single step. Wait, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or a single terminal. So if I have a non-terminal that can produce a string of multiple terminals in one step, that's allowed in CNF, but in the given grammar, each production is only into two non-terminals, so the derivation is step by step replacing each non-terminal with two.\n\nWait, in the grammar, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, any terminal string must consist of a series of terminals that can be derived in this way.\n\nSo the string starting with t26 must come from a terminal production of some NT. Looking through the productions, none of them have a terminal as t26. That's a problem. Because if t26 is an initial terminal, it would have to come from a production where a non-terminal is replaced by t26. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t26.\n\nWait, but maybe t26 is part of a chain. Let me check if any NT expands into t26 through a chain. For example, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. Then NT17 can be NT8 NT10 or others. If I follow this chain:\n\nSuppose we have NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10.\n\nThen NT8 could produce 't48' or something else, but in our case, the first element is t26. So perhaps that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t26 comes from another NT. Let me see: NT20 is sometimes 't65' or 't26'? No, I don't think any production directly has 't26' as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake. Let me re-examine the production list more carefully.\n\nIn the production list, I see NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17, NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20, etc. I don't see any NT that directly has 't26'. So perhaps 't26' is part of a longer production, but that's unlikely because in CNF, each step only expands a non-terminal into two parts.\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals eventually lead to a string that includes 't26'.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has productions where each non-terminal (A) expands into two non-terminals, or terminals can be terminals themselves. But in this grammar, some of the productions are terminating because they have terminals like 't82', 't17', etc.\n\nI notice that some NTs (non-terminals) have productions that directly produce terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't12', NT10 -> 't53', and so on. So the leaves of the derivation trees will lead to these terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with \"t82 t17 t48...\". I need to find a way to derive this string using the grammar. Let's start by trying to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nStart with the overall structure. The grammar starts with S -> NT12 NT12, but looking closer, I think the start is S -> NT12 NT12, right? Wait, no, actually, looking back, the user wrote the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 is not directly, but the first option is S -> NT12 NT12, wait no, the first option is S -> NT12 NT12? Wait, no, in the given grammar, the first rule is S -> NT12 NT12. Wait, actually, looking at the user's message, the first line after the initial line is:\n\n\"Grammar:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nNT9 -> NT11 NT11\n\n...\"\n\nWait, but that might be a typo because the user may have intended the S production to be something else. Wait, actually, no, looking again, it's the full grammar provided, so S has multiple productions.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The grammar is a set of rules, each line represents a production.\n\nSo the grammar starts with S having three productions:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nThen comes the rules for NT9, etc.\n\nSo S can expand into combinations of NTs. The string in question starts with t82, which is a terminal, so I need to find which NTs can produce t82.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT12 -> 't12', but t82 is different. Let's see:\n\nLooking at all the production rules, when a non-terminal is followed by a terminal, like 't82', 't17', etc., these are direct productions. Let's list all the direct terminals and their NTs:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT12 -> 't12' (so when NT12 is derived, it results in 't12')\nNT10 -> 't53'\nNT4 -> 't65' (appears multiple times)\nNT20 -> 't65'\nNT3 -> 't16'\nNT3 -> 't29' (multiple options, but they both result in different t's)\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT1 -> 't19'\nNT17 -> 't61'\nNT13 -> 't82' (so NT13 can produce 't82')\nNT21 -> 't61' (from NT21's rules, I think, since one of the options is NT21 -> NT17 NT5, but not directly 't61')\nWait, looking again:\n\nNT21 has rules like NT21 -> NT17 NT5, but other rules like NT21 -> 't82' or 't61'?\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFrom the grammar, the user wrote:\n\nNT13 -> 't82'\n\nSo NT13 directly produces 't82'. Also, looking for other NTs that produce 't82':\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see that NT21 has a rule NT21 -> 't82', NT21 -> 't61', NT21 -> 't17 NT5'? Wait, no, looking back, the NT21 rules are:\n\nNT21 -> NT17 NT5\n\nNT21 -> NT17 NT3\n\nNT21 -> NT8 NT13\n\nWait, but I see that NT21 also has NT21 -> NT17 NT5 and other NT combinations.\n\nWait, maybe I should make a list of all non-terminals that can directly produce 't82' and 't17' and so on.\n\nLet me scan the grammar:\n\nLooking for NTs that end with a terminal:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT9 -> NT11 NT11 (nt, not terminal)\n- NT21 -> 't82' (so nt21 can produce t82)\n- NT13 -> 't82' (nt13 can produce t82)\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16', 't29', 't39'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT2 -> 't12', maybe others\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nNT12: S has productions involving NT12, so NT12 can produce 't12', but in the user's grammar, does any NT12 have a terminal? Looking:\n\nIn the grammar user provided, under NT12, the production is:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nYes, so NT12 can produce 't12'.\n\nSimilarly for NT10 -> 't53', NT4 -> 't65', etc.\n\nLooking for all NTs that produce 't82':\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT21 -> 't82' (so when NT21 is derived, it becomes t82)\nNT13 -> 't82'\n\nSo NT21 and NT13 can produce 't82'.\n\nSimilarly, for 't17':\n\nLooking for NTs:\n\nNT17 -> 't61' (one of the rules)\nBut also, maybe others? Let me check.\n\nWait, also, in the grammar, the rule NT21 -> NT17 NT5, which would involve NT17, but that's a combination, not a direct terminal.\n\nAnother rule for NT17 is NT17-> NT8 NT10, so NT17 is a combination of two other NTs.\n\nBut wait, I'm looking for NTs that directly produce terminals. So NT17 itself doesn't directly produce a terminal, but the rules that lead to t17 would come from other NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that t82 is a terminal. So in our string, the first token is t82, which must come from either NT21 or NT13.\n\nSimilarly, the second token is t17, so we need an NT that can produce t17 or leads into t17.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t17: from the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't17', except through their rules.\n\nWait, wait. Looking again:\n\nNT17 -> 't61' (from somewhere). Also, other rules for NT17: NT17-> NT8 NT10, which are NTs that might produce terminals.\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nFrom the grammar, in the rules for NT17, it's:\n\nNT17 -> 't61'\n\nAlso, NT17 -> NT8 NT10, right? So NT17 has two productions: one that directly produces t61 and another that combines other NTs.\n\nSo, if we have t17 in the string, that would have to come from an NT that can directly produce t17. Wait, in the grammar, does any NT directly produce 't17'? Looking back:\n\nYes! Let's check NT17 has a production NT17 -> 't61'. So NT17 can directly produce 't61', but maybe other NTs can also produce 't17'? Let me check all the NTs.\n\nLooking through all non-terminals:\n\nI see NT12 can produce 't12', which is not the same as 't17'. NT21 can produce 't82' or 't61', which are not 't17'. NT13 produces 't82'. NT20 produces 't65', which is not 't17'. What about NT5: in the grammar, NT5 can produce 't39', which isn't helpful. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.

{"custom_id":"request-233","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token corresponds to a production rule in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, every production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That helps because it simplifies parsing; each step replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's quite extensive with many non-terminals. There are productions where non-terminals are broken down into other non-terminals and terminals. My goal is to check if the string `t53 t65 t82 t40 t82 t73 t70 t48 t17 t73 t82 t40 t48` can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nLet me start by examining the string. The string is a sequence of terminals: 't53', 't65', and so on. The first few tokens are 't53', which I notice appears in the grammar as S \u2192 NT10 \u2192 't53' (since in the grammar, NT10 -> 't53'). Similarly, 't65' is another terminal that appears in several productions.\n\nLet me try to map each token to possible productions. Starting with the first token, 't53' comes from NT10. So, the derivation must start by expanding S into NT10, which is S \u2192 NT10.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, S has three productions: S \u2192 NT12 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12, and S \u2192 NT9 NT12 again (wait, no, actually looking back, it's S \u2192 NT9 NT12, S \u2192 NT12 NT14, and S \u2192 NT9 NT16? Wait, let me check: No, looking back, the grammar is written with multiple lines. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nLooking more carefully, the grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT12 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\nS -> NT9 NT16 ?\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me look again. The initial part is:\n\n```\nS -> NT12 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\nS -> NT9 NT12\nNT9 -> NT11 NT11\nNT21 -> NT19 NT20\n...\n```\n\nWait, no, the third line is S -> NT9 NT12, but I think that's a typo because the second line is S -> NT9 NT12 again. Maybe there were duplicates. Regardless, for now, assuming S has three productions: S\u2192NT12NT14, S\u2192NT9NT12, and another S\u2192NT9NT16? Hmm, perhaps that's not correct. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the entire grammar, it's a bit confusingly written with line breaks. Let me extract the S productions correctly.\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\n- S -> NT12 NT14\n- S -> NT9 NT12\n- S -> NT9 NT16\n\nWait, no. Looking at the top, the first three lines are S -> NT12 NT14, then S->NT9 NT12, then S->NT9 NT12 again? Or maybe it's a typo and the third is S->NT9 NT16. That's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended three distinct productions for S. I think I might have misread the productions. Let me check again more carefully.\n\nThe initial lines after S are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\nS -> NT9 NT12\nNT9 -> NT11 NT11\n...\n\nWait, that's three separate productions for S, but two of them are S -> NT9 NT12 and the third is also S -> NT9 NT12? Or is it S -> NT9 NT16? It's a bit ambiguous. Maybe the third line is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended S to have multiple productions, including some withNT16 or other NTs.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps the safest approach is to note that S can produce different combinations of NTs, and to see if the given string can be generated by any sequence of productions from S.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Let me see if the string can be derived by starting from S and expanding step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can work backwards, trying to see if the string can be reduced to S using inverse productions.\n\nGiven the string is a sequence of terminals, working backward would be efficient. Let's see.\n\nThe string is: t53 t65 t82 t40 t82 t73 t70 t48 t17 t73 t82 t40 t48\n\nFirst token is t53, which comes from NT10 \u2192 't53'. So, the last step must have produced 't53' which is the leftmost terminal in the string. So, perhaps the string ends with NT10.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is t53, so perhaps the string starts with NT10 which must have been expanded earlier in the derivation. Let me think in terms of derivations.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string from left to right, expanding non-terminals as per the grammar.\n\nBut looking at the string, let's list out the tokens:\n\n1. t53\n2. t65\n3. t82\n4. t40\n5. t82\n6. t73\n7. t70\n8. t48\n9. t17\n10. t73\n11. t82\n12. t40\n13. t48\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific non-terminals or terminals. Let me try to match these tokens to the grammar.\n\nt53 is produced by NT10 \u2192 't53'\n\nt65 is produced by several NTs: NT12, NT20, etc. Looking at the grammar, it's better to note that some NTs directly go to terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-226","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's see... The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The string I have is a sequence of tokens with 't' followed by numbers. Hmm, those could be terminal symbols because they look like specific terms rather than non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar rules to see if I can break the string down step by step. Let me start by identifying which non-terminals can produce these terminals. For example, looking at the grammar, I see that certain non-terminals like NT16, NT20, NT3, etc., have productions that result in specific 't' terms. \n\nWait, for instance, NT16 -> 't70', so when NT16 is derived, it becomes 't70'. Similarly, NT20 -> 't65', so it becomes 't65' when derived. Also, NT3 -> 't81', so that would explain the first 't81' in the string. \n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string is: t70 t65 t26 t81 t82 t70 t53 t16 t61 t65 t43 t65 t65.\n\nI'll start from the beginning. The first token is t70. That must come from NT16. So I can replace t70 with NT16. So the string now looks like NT16 t65 t26 t81 t82 t70 t53 t16 t61 t65 t43 t65 t65.\n\nNext, the second token is t65. Looking at the grammar, NT20 and NT4 and NT5 and others produce 't65'. Let's see, NT20 -> 't65' and NT4 -> 't65' and NT5 -> 't65'? Wait, no, looking back: \n\nWait, the grammar has NT4 -> 't17', NT5 -> 't39', NT14 -> 't43', NT0 -> 't40', etc. Hmm, no, actually, I think I might have misread that. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT14 -> 't43' and NT0 -> 't40', etc. Wait, but NT20 has two rules: NT20 -> 't65' and also NT20 -> 't26', etc. So actually, NT20 can produce several things. But for the second token, which is t65, let's see which non-terminals produce 't65'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT10 -> 't53', NT10 -> 't73', NT5 -> 't66', NT3 -> 't81', NT3 -> 't29', NT5 -> 't82', NT15 -> 't82', etc. Wait, actually, looking more closely, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT4 -> 't17', NT5 -> 't66', NT12 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't70', NT3 -> 't81' and 't29', NT5 -> 't82', and so on. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the initial part, each production for a non-terminal has specific terminals attached, like NT12 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't70', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the non-terminals and their terminal productions. Let me go through each rule:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- S -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, S -> NT9 NT12\n- NT9 -> NT11 NT11\n- NT21 -> NT19 NT20 or NT20 NT15, etc.\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8, and further down, NT12 -> 't12'\u2014Wait, yes! Let me check.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see that several non-terminals have terminal symbols as productions:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT5 -> 't82' (twice)\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT14 -> 't43' (since NT14 -> NT14 NT0, and looking further, NT0 -> 't40'? Wait, no, let me re-examine.)\n\nWait, actually, perhaps it's easier to note the direct terminal productions from the grammar:\n\nFrom the rules, the terminals are:\n\n- t12 via NT12\n- t16 via NT16\n- t26: looking at the rules, do any non-terminals produce 't26'? Yes, NT2 -> 't26' (from NT2 -> NT20 NT15, but also looking through the rules, perhaps not. Wait, looking through all rules, I see that NT20 -> 't65' and 't26' as separate rules:\n\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n\nSo NT20 can become both 't65' and 't26'.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 -> 't39' and 't82'.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out all the non-terminals that can produce terminal symbols:\n\n- NT12 can produce 't12'\n- NT16 can produce 't70'\n- NT20 can produce 't65' and 't26'\n- NT3 can produce 't81' and 't29'\n- NT5 can produce 't66' and 't82'\n- NT14 can produce 't43' and 't40' (since NT14 -> 't43' and NT0 -> 't40')\n- Wait, no, let me check NT14: looking at the rules, I don't see NT14 being a terminal; instead, NT14 has a production NT14 -> NT4 NT0, and then NT4 and NT0 have their own productions. So NT14 doesn't directly produce a terminal; only NT12, NT16, NT20, NT3, NT5, etc., do.\n\nSo, step by step, the string is:\n\nt70, t65, t26, t81, t82, t70, t53, t16, t61, t65, t43, t65, t65.\n\nLet's try to parse this string.\n\nFirst token: t70. This must come from NT16. So, the first half of the string is generated by NT16. So the next symbols after 't70' must be derived from NT16's right-hand side.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to start from the beginning and try to match the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: The first symbol is t70, which must come from NT16, so we can replace t70 with NT16. Now, what's the production for NT16? From the grammar, NT16 -> NT16 NT4. Wait, no, looking again: NT16 -> NT16 NT4? Wait, no, checking carefully, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT16: \n- NT16 -> NT4 NT7, but wait, no, earlier in the rules, I see NT16 -> NT16 NT4.\n\nWait, no, let me go through the rules again. I'm a bit confused because there are a lot of rules, so perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their possible derivations.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- S -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, S -> NT9 NT12\n- NT9 -> NT11 NT11\n- NT21 -> NT19 NT20, NT20 NT15\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8\n- NT16 -> NT16 NT4\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT2 NT10\n- NT1 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT20 NT15\n- NT12 -> NT19 NT8\n- NT2 -> NT11 NT17\n- NT21 -> NT17 NT5\n- NT21 -> NT17 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT20\n- NT19 -> NT1 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT11 NT20\n- NT16 -> NT7 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-248","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either a single terminal symbol or two non-terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, which has several productions:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nThen, there are a bunch of other productions for the NT terminals. The string I need to analyze is \"t82 t43 t40 t82 t73 t61 t65 t65 t40 t43 t16 t82 t26 t65\".\n\nI notice that several production rules for non-terminals directly produce a single terminal, like NT12 -> 't12', NT10 -> 't53', etc. So, if I can break down the string step by step using these productions, it will help.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from left to right.\n\nThe string starts with t82. Looking at the productions, NT3 can produce t82. Also, NT13 can produce t82. Let me choose one; maybe NT3.\n\nSo, I'll take the first t82 as NT3. Now, looking at NT3's productions, it can generate t16 and t29, or t5 and t14. Wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions for NT3 are: NT3 -> NT5 NT14, and previously it also had NT3 -> 't29' and NT3 -> 't16'. So, in the provided grammar, I think NT3 has two terminal productions: 't16' and 't29'. So, when I see t82, I need to check which NT produces t82.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I realize that the NTs with direct terminal productions are:\n\nNT12 -> 't12',\n\nNT10 -> 't53', but in the string, it's t43, which might not match. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT productions that produce terminals:\n\nNT9 -> 't77'\n\nNT1 -> 't19'\n\nNT17 -> 't61'\n\nNT13 -> 't82'\n\nNT20 -> 't65'\n\nNT8 -> 't48'\n\nNT15 -> 't82'\n\nWait, the string has t82, t43, t40, etc. Hmm, t43 isn't directly a terminal in any NT production as far as I can see. So perhaps t43 is from an NT that is generated by another NT.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all NTs and their direct terminal outputs:\n\nNT9: t77\n\nNT1: t19\n\nNT17: t61\n\nNT13: t82\n\nNT20: t65\n\nNT8: t48\n\nNT15: t82\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t43. So t43 is part of the string, but I don't see any NT that directly produces t43. That seems problematic because in CNF, each step can only produce two non-terminals or a terminal. Since t43 isn't a terminal, it must come from a non-terminal. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any NT that can derive to t43 through a chain of productions. Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT10: in the grammar, NT10 has productions like -> NT20 NT8 and -> 't43'. So, for NT10, 't43' is a terminal. Therefore, if there's a t43 in the string, it must come from NT10.\n\nSo, in the string, t43 would be from NT10. So the substring t43 is 't43', which is terminal and comes from NT10.\n\nSo, let's proceed. The string is t82 t43 t40 t82 t73 t61 t65 t65 t40 t43 t16 t82 t26 t65.\n\nLet me parse it step by step.\n\n1. The first symbol is t82. Looking for NTs that produce t82. From the grammar, NT3 can produce t82: NT3 -> 't82' (if I'm correct). Also, NT15 -> 't82'. Let's pick NT3 for the first step.\n\n2. The next symbol is t43. Looking for NTs that produce t43. From the grammar, NT10 -> 't43'. So, the second symbol comes from NT10.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol is t82, which would have a corresponding NT, say NT3. Then the second symbol is t43, which would come from NT10.\n\nSo, the first two symbols would be from NT3 producing t82 and NT10 producing t43. Now, looking at the string, we have t82 t43. So, after NT3 -> 't82', the next symbol comes from NT10 -> 't43'.\n\nSo now, I have the string broken into t82 (NT3) followed by t43 (NT10). Then, the next symbol is t40.\n\nNow, looking at NT4's productions. From the grammar, I see NT4 -> 't65', but that's not helpful. Wait, looking for t40. Do any NTs produce 't40'?\n\nHmm, I look through the grammar and see that NT20 -> 't40'. So, perhaps NT20 can produce t40.\n\nSo, after t43 (NT10), the next symbol is t40 (NT20). So, that would be NT20 -> 't40'.\n\nSo now, we have NT3, NT10, NT20 so far: t82, t43, t40.\n\nWait, but let's think: in the grammar, each production is two NTs. So, the entire string is a series of symbols, each coming from some NT production. Since the string has 14 symbols, we need to have a derivation where each symbol is the result of an NT production, either a terminal or another NT that can derive to the next symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree that matches the string, ensuring that each step aligns the symbols correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language, but since I don't have the details, maybe I can do a manual parsing step.\n\nLet me try to break down the string:\n\nt82 t43 t40 t82 t73 t61 t65 t65 t40 t43 t16 t82 t26 t65\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. t82: comes from NT3 or NT15. Let's pick NT3.\n\n   So, starting with NT3.\n\n2. Next, t43: comes from NT10.\n\n   So, after NT3, we have NT10.\n\n3. Next, t40: comes from NT20.\n\n   After NT10, we have NT20.\n\n4. Next, t82: again, from NT3 or NT15.\n\n5. Next, t73: Hmm, I don't see any NT directly producing t73. So, t73 must come from an NT that can derive to 't73', but in the grammar, I don't see any NT with a terminal 't73'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the NTs. Maybe I missed an NT that produces t73.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT20: NT20 -> 't40' and other things. Wait, perhaps t73 comes from NT20? No, because NT20 produces 't40' as a terminal, but there's also NT20 -> NT6 NT6 and other options. So, perhaps t73 is from NT2?\n\nWait, no. Let me look at all NTs and their terminals:\n\nNT10: 't43'\n\nNT20: 't40'\n\nNT15: 't82'\n\nNT9: 't77'\n\nNT3: 't82'\n\nNT17: 't61'\n\nNT13: 't82'\n\nWait, t73 isn't appearing as a terminal in any NT production. So maybe I'm wrong earlier. Maybe t73 is a result of an NT that can derive to 't73'. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through NT12: NT12 -> 't12'\n\nNT16: NT16 -> 't70'\n\nNT4 -> 't65'\n\nWait, perhaps t73 is a result of a longer derivation from an NT.

The string is `t40 t65 t53 t65 t82 t43 t26 t65 t43 t40 t65 t43 t61 t48`.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. CNF is useful because it simplifies the parsing process, but since we're determining membership, we'll need to see how the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice some terminals are attached to non-terminals. For example:\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n- NT17 \u2192 NT7 NT12\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT12\n- NT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17\n- NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT11\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT10\n- And some others have terminals tied to them, like NT12 \u2192 't12', NT10 \u2192 't53', NT4 \u2192 't65', etc.\n\nSo the terminals are 't's followed by numbers. The string has these t-values: 40, 65, 53, 65, 82, 43, 26, 65, 43, 40, 65, 43, 61, 48.\n\nI'll start by checking if these terminal symbols appear in the grammar. Each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So for the string to be generated, each terminal must be a terminal in the grammar, which they all are in this case except maybe some larger numbers, but looking back, I see:\n\nWait, the grammar does have rules like NT12 \u2192 't12', NT10 \u2192 't53', NT4 \u2192 't65', NT20 \u2192 't65', NT3 \u2192 't16', etc. Let me check each terminal in the string:\n\nt40, t65, t53, t65, t82, t43, t26, t65, t43, t40, t65, t43, t61, t48.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 \u2192 't40', NT4 \u2192 't65', NT10 \u2192 't53', NT12 \u2192 't12' (but in our case, we have 't40', 't65', etc., which are covered). However, let's see if these terminals are present as terminals in the grammar. From the list:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', etc., but in our case, we don't have these.\n- NT6 \u2192 tied to NT3 via NT3 rules, but the string has t26, which isn't listed. Wait, looking back, is there a terminal t26? In the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 't17', NT5 \u2192 't39', NT9 \u2192 't12', NT12 \u2192 't12', but no terminal t26. Hmm, the string includes t26, which isn't present in the grammar. That's a problem. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the string includes t26, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any rules ending with 't26'. So that's a big red flag. If the grammar doesn't have a production rule that leads to 't26', then the string can't be generated. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through each production rule, I see:\n\n- NT20: 't65', NT4: 't65', NT12: 't12', NT10: 't53', NT9: 't12, t65, t77', etc. I don't see any terminal 't26' in any of the rules. So if the string has 't26', it's impossible because the grammar doesn't produce 't26' as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan through the terminals again:\n\nThe terminals listed are 't40', 't65', etc., under various non-terminals. Let me list all the terminals present in the grammar:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT9 \u2192 't12', 't65', 't77' (but t77 is a production, I think, because in the rules, NT9 \u2192 't65' etc.)\nWait, looking more carefully: the initial part of the grammar has a lot of rules like NT12 \u2192 't12', but in the list of productions, under NT12, there's also NT12 \u2192 't12', and others:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- Other NT rules may have terminals as well.\n\nWait, the initial grammar starts with S \u2192 NT12 NT12, etc., and some NT rules have terminals:\n\nAt the end of the grammar, there are numerous rules where the left-hand side is a non-terminal and the right-hand side is a terminal, for example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't77'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', etc.\n- NT14 \u2192 't4', 't0'?\n- Wait, no, looking again, the last part has:\n\nAt the end of the grammar, under the NT3's, there's NT3 \u2192 't81' and others. Also, in the latter part:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't13', 't2'\n\nWait, maybe I misread.

{"custom_id":"request-271","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. CNF is a specific form of CFG where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. However, in the given grammar, I notice that some productions have more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side. For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT12, which seems to have two non-terminals, but others might have more. Wait, actually, upon closer look, the productions are all of the form A \u2192 BC except for those that produce terminals. Wait, no, some of the productions have only one non-terminal on the right, which might be allowed in CNF if we allow epsilon productions or unit productions, but usually, CNF requires A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So perhaps this grammar isn't in proper CNF because some productions have more than two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe that's a point to consider, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the grammar is in CNF as per the given rules.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t82 t73 t65 t70 t65 t77 t65 t40 t40 t65 t53 t17 t40 t70 t12`. Each token separated by spaces is a terminal symbol. The grammar's productions have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Each non-terminal eventually must derive into terminals, and the structure of the string must follow the grammar's structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly map to terminals. For example, S appears to have productions that lead to other non-terminals until they eventually reach terminals. So, each production in the grammar either introduces a terminal or another non-terminal that will eventually lead to a terminal.\n\nThe process to check if the string is generated by the grammar is similar to parsing. I can try to build a derivation starting from S and see if I can reach the given string.\n\nLet's look at the string: it starts with t82. Looking at the grammar, I see that production NT12 can produce t12. But the string's first token is t82. Wait, does any non-terminal directly produce t82? Looking through the rules, I see NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', 't59' (wait, no, looking more carefully, the grammar has several entries for NT3. For example, NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', etc. Wait, actually in the given grammar, the lines have 't82' in a few places. Let me check:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT12 NT14; NT14 \u2192 NT4 NT0; NT4 \u2192 't65'; NT0 \u2192 't40'; so maybe NT7 can produce 't65', or other paths.\n\nWait, looking at the string's first token, t82. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce 't82'. Scanning through the grammar, I notice that NT13 has a production where it goes to NT12\u2192NT16, which eventually goes to 't70' or other terminals. Alternatively, NT15 \u2192 NT21\u2192 't65' or 't82' perhaps? Looking more carefully, in the given grammar, there's a production for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8. And NT21 has productions like \u2192 NT17 NT5, which has several options. Alternatively, looking for 't82', I see that NT13 has a production as NT12\u2192something, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each token in the string to possible non-terminals that can produce them, then see if the sequence of productions can form the string.\n\nLet's list the tokens in the string:\n\n1. t82\n2. t73\n3. t65\n4. t70\n5. t65\n6. t77\n7. t65\n8. t40\n9. t40\n10. t65\n11. t53\n12. t17\n13. t40\n14. t70\n15. t12\n\nSo, each token must be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach is to see if the sequence of terminals corresponds to a leftmost derivation from S.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to break down the string into parts and see if it makes sense according to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t82, t73, t65, t70, t65, t77, etc.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the start symbol S and see what S can produce. From the given grammar, S has several productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo S can produce two NT12's, one NT7 and one NT14, or one NT9 and one NT12.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t82 and t73. So after S, the next non-terminals must produce t82 and t73 or whatever leads to it.\n\nBut perhaps the first S \u2192 NT12 NT12, so the first two steps would be NT12 and NT12.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens, t82 and t73. But wait, in the given grammar, NT12's productions:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, then NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, and so on. Wait, but looking at the first two tokens t82 and t73.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to see if any of the non-terminals produce these tokens directly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I spot several direct terminal productions. Let's collect them:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't65'\nNT5 \u2192 't39'\nNT7 \u2192 't77' (look at the line NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT0)\nWait, no, looking more carefully.

{"custom_id":"request-264","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string belongs to the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to write CFGs where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. From the given grammar, I can see that all productions seem to fit CNF because each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides (RHS) consist of two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t26 t82 t73 t82 t43 t26 t82 t53 t65 t53 t40 t82 t43 t26 t40`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many productions directly correspond to terminals, meaning those non-terminals eventually produce single terminal symbols. For example, NT12 \u2192 t12. So, when I parse the string, I should be able to replace these terminals step by step, working my way back from the string to the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string from the beginning. The string is a sequence of terminals:\n\nt26, t82, t73, t82, t43, t26, t82, t53, t65, t53, t40, t82, t43, t26, t40.\n\nI can treat the entire string as a sequence of production steps, starting from S and trying to generate the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step either introduces two non-terminals or terminates with a terminal. So, working backwards, I can attempt to split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet me begin by checking if the string can be generated by the grammar. I'll start from the beginning and see which productions can produce the initial t26.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT12 \u2192 t12, which doesn't match t26. Then, NT20 \u2192 t65 and NT10 \u2192 t53. Wait, that's not t26. Let me see, NT2 \u2192 which has several productions, like NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17, NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT20, etc. Alternatively, looking for NT that produce t26, let's check the productions:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT10 \u2192 t43, NT4 \u2192 t65, etc. Wait, perhaps looking for NT productions that result in t26. Scanning the productions, I see NT2 \u2192 t26 is not present. Instead, looking at S productions, S \u2192 NT12 NT12 (from S \u2192 NT12 NT12, etc.). Let me check NT12 productions.\n\nIn the grammar, NT12 has two main productions: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8 and NT12 \u2192 t12. So to produce t26, I think I need to look for some NT that can split into terminals or non-terminals leading to the needed production.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by building a parse tree from the string. Let me see.\n\nThe string starts with t26. So, the first step would be to find a production that starts with t26. Looking for NT that have a production ending with t26. Checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT10 \u2192 t43, NT17 \u2192 t61, etc. Are there any NTs that produce t26 directly? Scanning the productions, I notice that NT2 is part of some productions, like S \u2192 NT21 NT5, but in the grammar, NT21 and NT5 might relate to t26. Alternatively, perhaps looking for a production rule that produces t26, but in the given grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce t26 except maybe through some chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the list again. I spot that NT20 \u2192 t65, NT10 \u2192 t53, NT4 \u2192 t4, NT3 \u2192 t3, etc. Wait, perhaps considering that t26 is not explicitly in the terminals, but is an intermediate. So perhaps it's produced by a non-terminal NT which then leads to t26 through some steps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the given grammar, each step can only produce one terminal. So, the string is a concatenation of terminals, so perhaps we can break the string into individual steps.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: since the string is a sequence of tokens, each token is a single terminal, so each must be generated by a production with exactly that terminal. Or is it possible for non-terminals that produce multiple terminals through several production steps?\n\nWait, no, because in CNF, each production is either a non-terminal replacing two non-terminals or a non-terminal replacing a single terminal. So, any string in the language is a series of terminals, each corresponding to a leaf in the parse tree. So each terminal in the string must be produced by a production that directly outputs it.\n\nWait, but looking back, I'm not sure because the given grammar seems to have several non-terminals that directly produce single terminals. For example, NT12 \u2192 t12, NT10 \u2192 t53, NT4 \u2192 t65, etc. So, those are terminals, and others, like NT2, have productions like NT2 \u2192 NT1 NT0 or others.\n\nWait, so in this grammar, if there are non-terminals that produce a single terminal, then the string we have must contain a production for each terminal that matches directly. Let me list the terminals in the string and see if any grammar rule produces them:\n\nThe string is: t26 t82 t73 t82 t43 t26 t82 t53 t65 t53 t40 t82 t43 t26 t40.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let me match each terminal:\n\nt26: Needs to find a non-terminal NT where NT \u2192 t26. Looking at the production list, I don't see any NT \u2192 t26 directly. Wait, that's a problem because without such a production, t26 can't be part of any string generated by this grammar, which would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, that seems possible. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I can see NT12 \u2192 t12, NT16 \u2192 t70, NT3 \u2192 t3, etc. I don't see any NT \u2192 t26. So, does any NT eventually produce t26, perhaps through a chain of productions? Let me think.\n\nLet me see: for example, some production chain that ends with t26. Let's say we have NT producing a production leading to another NT, which eventually leads to t26.\n\nFor example, if NT17 \u2192 NT5 and NT5 \u2192 t3, but then t3 is not t26. Hmm, perhaps another chain. Let me see NT10 \u2192 t53, so t53 is generated from NT10.\n\nWait, NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17, so t26 can't come from NT2 directly. Alternatively, maybe a production chain like:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17, and one of those NTs produce something that eventually leads to t26.\n\nWait, more systematically, perhaps using the given grammar, I can track if any of the non-terminals ultimately generate t26.\n\nLooking down, for example, NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT0. Let's see:\n\nLooking for NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT0. Now, NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT2. So NT1 is split into NT5 and NT2.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4. So NT5 is NT17 and NT4.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4. So NT17 splits into NT13 and NT4.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19. Wait, NT12 \u2192 t12. So NT12 is t12, and NT19 can be something else.\n\nAlternatively, let's think step by step.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t26. So perhaps the first step is that the start symbol S generates a non-terminal that produces t26, but since I don't see any NT producing t26, that would mean it's impossible, thus the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps through a chain. Let me see.\n\nAnother way: perhaps the start symbol S \u2192 NT12 NT12, as in S \u2192 NT12 NT12. So the start symbol generates two non-terminals, each of which is NT12, which then may produce t12 or other things. So, t12 is generated, but the string starts with t26, which isn't t12, so that would be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for other productions"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

From the grammar, NT12 can produce NT3 NT11, and NT14 can produce NT3 NT2.\n\n3. **Expand NT12 (NT3 NT11):**\n   NT3 has multiple production rules. One of them, NT3 -> 't53', is a direct terminal. NT11 also has a production NT11 -> 't19', which is another terminal. So, NT12 can produce 't53 t19'.\n\n4. **Expand NT14 (NT3 NT2):**\n   NT3 can produce 't29' according to the grammar. Now, NT2 offers several options. Looking closely, NT2 can produce 't82' through some production paths. Specifically, NT2 -> NT7 NT16 -> NT13 NT4 -> ... eventually leading to a terminal.

The string to evaluate is: `t65 t53 t40 t82 t65 t73 t73 t48 t82 t65 t53 t82 t26 t53 t17 t40`.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) are defined by a set of production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side can be any combination of terminals and non-terminals. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) specifies that every production rule must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that many of the production rules end with terminals, like S \u2192 NT12 NT12, where NT12 might eventually resolve to 't12'. This suggests that each terminal is derived from non-terminals through a series of productions.\n\nThe string to check starts with a series of 't's, which are terminals. The first step is to see if each 't' in the string is a direct production from some non-terminal.\n\nI'll start by examining each terminal in the string to find possible non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLooking at NT12, the production is NT12 -> NT17 NT8, but I don't see NT17 or NT8 directly resolving to the terminals in the string. However, further down the rules, NT12 can produce 't12', which isn't in the string, so maybe NT12 isn't the right path.\n\nWait, I see that NT12 is directly producing 't12' as a terminal. Looking through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n\nYes, that's a production rule. So in the string, any occurrence of 't12' can come from NT12.\n\nNow looking at the string: I see 't12' appears once. Let's see where else 't12' is in the string.

Looking again:\n\nWait, no, the productions are more like NT12 \u2192 't12', which is a terminal, so for NT12, you can derive 't12'.\n\nBut in the string, I don't see 't12', so perhaps NT20, NT2, etc., produce some of the terms.\n\nWait, let's try to see each terminal in the string and see if there's a non-terminal that can produce it:\n\nThe string is: t65 t53 t40 t82 t65 t73 t73 t48 t82 t65 t53 t82 t26 t53 t17 t40\n\nLooking at each:\n\n- t65: produced by NT4\n- t53: do I see any non-terminals that produce 53? Let me check the rules for NT53. Wait, the rules don't have NT53 directly as a terminal, but perhaps through some steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. All terminal symbols in the production rules are being assigned directly as 't' followed by a number, like 't65', 't40', 't82', etc. So, each 't' in the string must be the result of a production that directly resolves to that 't'.\n\nSo, for each 't' in the string, we can see if there's a non-terminal that can produce it directly.\n\nLooking:\n\nt65: Yes, NT4 \u2192 t65.\n\nt53: Is there any NT that directly produces 't53'? Looking through the given rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly becomes 't53'. Maybe I'm missing it. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't53'. Hmmm. Maybe 't53' is derived through a chain of productions. Like, an NT that eventually resolves to 't53' through multiple steps.\n\nFor example, if I have a production like NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3, and if NT10 \u2192 't40' and NT3 \u2192 't13', but wait, 't13' is another terminal. So NT3 might produce 't3' or something else. Alternatively, perhaps NT20 is used in the string somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reconstruct possible derivations starting from S.\n\nLet's try.\n\nThe starting symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the production rules for S:\n\nS can produce:\n- NT12 NT12\n- NT7 NT14\n- NT9 NT12\n\nWe need to see if starting from any of these, we can derive the given string.\n\nLet's take S \u2192 NT12 NT12 first.\n\nEach NT12 \u2192 't12' as per the rule, but in the string, there is no 't12', so this path might not be correct.\n\nWait, but I might have misread the string. Let me recount the string: It starts with t65, t53, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT7 NT14 is the starting point.\n\nLooking at NT7: it has a production NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11, but that might get complex.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThen NT9 \u2192 NT11 NT11, and NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nWait, but again, these produce more NTs, and the first term is 't65', which is NT4's production.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nLet me list all the 't's in the string and see if their terminal symbols can be produced by any NT directly.\n\nBut 't65', 't53', 't40', 't82', 't65', etc.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t65\n- NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT2 (I don't see any direct terminal for NT19, unless it's through other production steps)\n- NT9 \u2192 t77\n- NT20 \u2192 t65 (I think I saw earlier that NT20 might have a production leading to 't65'? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3 (from production NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3)\n- Then, NT10 \u2192 't40' (from NT10 \u2192 t40)\n- NT3, however, has a production... I see NT3 \u2192 t39? No, wait: In the rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t39? Or am I looking incorrectly.\n\nWait, no. Looking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT21 NT4 (from NT3 \u2192 NT21 NT4)\n- NT4 \u2192 t65 (So NT3 \u2192 NT21 NT65...)\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look more carefully.\n\nFrom the given rules, the only direct terminals are:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT19 \u2192 't61' (from NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT4; NT4\u2192 t65, but wait, wait, no: Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nI found:\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17 ("}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-304","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t40 t82 t65 t43 t16 t61 t48 t19 t82 t43 t40 t53 t65 t53 t17 t48 t48`. Hmm, that's a long string. Let me start by understanding the grammar rules and how they might generate strings.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has specific rules: each production is a non-terminal deriving two non-terminals, or a terminal. So every production looks like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That means every production in this grammar is either a two-step process or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has three productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo from S, the first two steps would be to produce pairs like NT12, NT12 or NT7, NT14 or NT9, NT12. These are all non-terminals, so the string starts with these. Each of these non-terminals will then be replaced by other non-terminals according to the productions.\n\nLet me think about how these non-terminals can be expanded into terminals. The end of the string shows several terminals: t40, t82, t65, etc. I need to see if these can be produced by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI notice that the grammar has a lot of productions. Each non-terminal on the left is mapped to two non-terminals on the right. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n- NT9 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11\n- NT13 \u2192 NT11 NT14\n- And so on.\n\nI should try to build the string step by step, from S down, replacing non-terminals with their productions until I get to terminals. Let's see how many symbols the string has. The string is `t40 t82 t65 t43 t16 t61 t48 t19 t82 t43 t40 t53 t65 t53 t17 t48 t48`. That's 17 symbols.\n\nWait, since the grammar is in CNF, each production adds an even number of symbols when fully expanded, except when a non-terminal is a terminal. But since the grammar has many non-terminals, it's probably that each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So each step increases the length by 1, because each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, so the number of symbols doubles each time. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each replacement is two symbols, so if you have n symbols, replacing one non-terminal would make it n+1, because two non-terminals plus the rest. But it's a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, since each step is a single reduction (replacing one non-terminal with two), the number of symbols can vary by one each time. For example, starting from S, each application of a production increases the number of symbols by one, because each non-terminal is replaced by two, so 1 \u2192 2, which is +1.\n\nBut the string has 17 symbols. Starting from S (1 symbol), the next step would be 2, then 3, etc. But 17 is an odd number. Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the initial string comes from S, which is either NT12-NT12 (two symbols) etc. But perhaps the way the grammar is set up, the tree could have a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each production can produce a terminal, so perhaps in the reduction, some non-terminals emit terminals while others continue splitting. So the string can have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Therefore, the number of symbols in the generated string can vary.\n\nBut regardless, perhaps I should look for possible replacements that create the string step by step.\n\nI can try to parse the string from the start, trying to match possible derivation paths.\n\nLet me break the string into parts and see which non-terminals produce what.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt40 t82 t65 t43 t16 t61 t48 t19 t82 t43 t40 t53 t65 t53 t17 t48 t48\n\nFirst, let's look at the beginning. The first symbol is t40. Looking at the grammar, I see NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, and NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT10, etc. Wait, maybe I should find all non-terminals that can produce a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-330","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and the string is a sequence of tokens like 't65', 't43', etc. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to see how the string can be formed. The grammar starts with S, which branches into various combinations of NT and other symbols. The string begins with 't65' twice, so I should check which grammar rules produce 't65'.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice several where certain NT symbols expand directly to tokens. For example, NT4 -> 't65' and NT9 -> 't77', among others. So, I need to see if the string can be broken down using these rules.\n\nThe string is: t65 t43 t39 t26 t40 t65 t73 t65 t65 t65 t73 t48 t53 t40 t82 t43 t65 t40.\n\nI'll start by trying to split the string into parts that match the grammar's productions. Since S is the start symbol, the entire string should be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that S can be NT12, NT14, or NT9. Let's check each possibility.\n\n1. If S is NT12, then according to the rule NT12 -> NT17 NT8. So, the string needs to start with the expansions of NT17 and NT8.\n\nBut the string starts with t65. Let me see if any NT symbols expand directly to 't65'. NT6 -> 't65'? Wait, no, looking back, the rules don't have 't65' as a terminal for NT6. Hmm, maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, I see rules like NT3 -> 't29', NT5 -> 't39', etc. So, 't43' is also a terminal. So, perhaps I should map the tokens to NT symbols.\n\nFor example, t43 could come from NT20, since NT20 can produce 't43'. Similarly, t73 comes from NT10 (since NT10 -> 't73'). \n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is t65. Looking at the grammar, NT10 -> 't73', NT9 -> 't77', NT4 -> 't65', so one possibility is that the first NT is NT4. So, S could be producing NT4.\n\nBut wait, looking at the production rules for S, S can be NT12, NT14, or NT9. But if the first token is t65, which is produced by NT4, then perhaps the first part is NT4? But looking at S's rules, none of them directly produce 't65'. So maybe the first NT in S's production must eventually lead to 't65'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with a production that S makes through multiple steps. But S is the starting point, so the string is directly derived from S, meaning S must produce the entire string in one expansion sequence.\n\nWait, maybe the string is 't65 t43 t39 t26 t40 t65 t73 t65 t65 t65 t73 t48 t53 t40 t82 t43 t65 t40'. Let's count the tokens: that's 19 tokens.\n\nNow, considering the grammar, each NT production either expands to another NT or a terminal. So the number of symbols in the derivation might not directly correspond, but since it's a context-free grammar, the derivation can be any length.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to construct a parse tree for the string. Let me attempt that.\n\nFirst, the top symbol is S. Let's see which production of S can match the start. Looking at the rules, S can produce:\n\n- NT12 NT18 (Wait, no, the first rule is S -> NT12 NT18? No, wait, looking again, yes, S has several rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nS -> NT12 NT18? No, wait, no, the first line says S -> NT12 NT18. Wait, but in the first set, it's S-> NT12 NT18? Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the user's message, the first line is:\n\nS -> NT12 NT18\n\nWait, no, looking again: the first line is S -> NT12 NT18?\n\nWait, no, let me re-examine the grammar as presented by the user. The first three lines show:\n\nS -> NT12 NT18\n\nS -> NT7 NT14\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, S has three possible first steps. So, in the string, the first two tokens must be the expansion of either NT12 and NT18, NT7 and NT14, or NT9 and NT12.\n\nBut the string starts with t65 t43. So, I need to see if the first two tokens can be matched by any of the first expansions.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT9 NT12. So, NT9 and NT12. If NT9 expands to t43 and NT12 to t65, then the first two tokens would be t43 t65, but the string is t65 t43, so that doesn't fit.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT7 NT14. So, NT7 and NT14. If NT7 can be t65 and NT14 t43? Not sure.\n\nWait, no. The string starts with t65 t43. So, we'll check which production starts with t65 and t43 in order.\n\nLooking at the possible NT productions that expand directly to these tokens. \n\n- NT12 can expand to 't12', not relevant.\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT9 -> 't77', etc.\n\nWait, so 't65' is produced by NT4, 't43' by NT20.\n\nLooking for a production where NT symbol leads to 't65' followed by 't43'.\n\nLooking through NT rules:\n\nNT17 -> NT11 NT12. Does NT17 produce 't65'? Not directly. NT20 -> 't65'. Wait, so NT20 can produce 't65', and perhaps NT20 can eventually lead to 't43' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the first part of the string is derived from NT20, which then splits.\n\nWait, no. Let me approach it differently. Let's see if the entire string can be broken down by the grammar's rules. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStart with the string:\n\nt65 t43 t39 t26 t40 t65 t73 t65 t65 t65 t73 t48 t53 t40 t82 t43 t65 t40\n\nLooking for a split where the first part matches an S production.\n\nOption: S can be NT12, which produces NT17 NT8. So, the first two symbols after S would be NT17 and NT8, each producing their own terminals.\n\nLooking for 't65 t43 t39...'. Let me see if NT17 can produce 't65' and NT8 can produce 't43'.\n\nLooking at NT17's rules: NT17 -> NT11 NT12. Neither of these directly produce terminals except NT12, which produces 't12'. So, perhaps NT17 never leads to 't65', so that production can't be the start.\n\nAnother production for S: S -> NT7 NT14. So, NT7 and NT14.\n\nLooking at NT7's rules: NT7 -> NT2 NT11 or PT4 NT2. Wait, no, the exact rule is:\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list all the NT7 productions:\n\nLooking back, the user's grammar has:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT11\nNT7 -> NT2 NT16\nNT7 -> NT5 NT2\nNT7 -> NT2 NT11\nWait, actually, the user's grammar includes for NT7:\n\nWait, let me parse through the grammar lines again. Oh, here's part of NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT11\nNT7 -> NT2 NT16\nNT7 -> NT5 NT2\nNT7 -> NT2 NT11\nWait, perhaps this is a typo, but in any case, NT7 can expand into various combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for NT7 producing something that can lead to tokens.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for S -> NT9 NT12. NT9 can expand into NT6 NT9, which may eventually lead to terminals.\n\nBut I'm getting lost; perhaps another approach is to work backwards from the string and see if each token can be generated"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-333","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to check is `t12 t40 t40 t40 t82 t17 t43 t29 t53 t43 t43 t40 t82 t73 t43 t65 t17 t40 t65`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has two conditions: every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, which can go directly to terminals. Also, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. \n\nLooking at the grammar, most productions seem to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT12 is in CNF because it's two non-terminals. But wait, I notice that some symbols like NT12, NT0, etc., are non-terminals but some strings are just terminals. At the end of the grammar, I see that some rules like NT12 \u2192 't12' are given. So 't12' is a terminal, not a non-terminal.\n\nSo the idea is that the derivation of the start symbol S will eventually produce the string by expanding non-terminals into terminals. The string provided is made up of these terminals, so I need to see if there's a leftmost or rightmost derivation that can produce this string.\n\nI also recall that one way to approach this is to work backwards from the string, using the given grammar rules in reverse. Each step would contract a pair of terminals into a non-terminal that replaces them according to a production rule.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t12, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT12 \u2192 't12' is a production. So the start symbol must have a production that includes NT12. Looking back, S \u2192 NT12 NT8, which fits CNF and allows for NT12 and NT8 to be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSince the string starts with t12, the last step in the derivation before that would have been NT12 followed by something that expands to the remaining string. So after t12, the next term is t40. Since t40 is also a terminal, I check if there's a way for a non-terminal to produce these. Looking up the grammar, I don't immediately see any non-terminal that goes directly to 't40', but perhaps through further expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step. Let's try to break the string down and see if each pair can be matched by a production.\n\nStarting with the entire string:\n\nt12 t40 t40 t40 t82 t17 t43 t29 t53 t43 t43 t40 t82 t73 t43 t65 t17 t40 t65\n\nThe length is 19. Since each production in CNF either introduces two non-terminals or terminals, the tree should have a certain structure. But without knowing the exact steps, it might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each part of the string corresponds to a production in the given rules. For instance, looking at the initial t12, that suggests that this must come from NT12. According to S \u2192 NT12 NT8, so after S, we have NT12 followed by NT8. The string starts with t12, which is NT12, so the next part would be what NT8 expands to.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, in the grammar I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't48', but that's not present. Wait, no, let me check the grammar provided. Oh, I see that some of these symbols have replacements that become terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 't48', but in the given string, the second token is t40, not t48, so maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT8.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another path. Let me make a list of all the rules that lead to terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't29', 't30', etc. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\nNT13 \u2192 't16'\nNT5 \u2192 't39'\nNT4 \u2192 't65'\nNT9 \u2192 't77'\nNT2 \u2192 't17' (appears twice)\nNT4 \u2192 't17', 't20'? Wait, looking back: NT9 \u2192 't77', NT1 \u2192 't19', NT3 \u2192 't29', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should jot down all the terminal substitutions:\n\nNT12 \u2192 t12\nNT20 \u2192 t26, but in the string, I don't see t26.\nNT5 \u2192 t39\nNT12 \u2192 t12\nNT4 \u2192 t65\nNT9 \u2192 t77\nNT1 \u2192 t19\nNT2 \u2192 t17\nNT3 \u2192 t29\nNT0 \u2192 t40\nNT20 \u2192 t10 is 10, but  is it a terminal? No, because the grammar has NT20 \u2192 t26, which is a terminal. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see multiple terminals.\n\nIn particular, looking at the string:\n\nt12 t40 t40 t40 t82 t17 t43 t29 t53 t43 t43 t40 t82 t73 t43 t65 t17 t40 t65.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- t12: this must come from NT12.\n- t40: could come from NT0, which appears in the grammar as NT0 \u2192 't40'.\n- t40 again: same as above.\n- t40 again: same again.\n- t82: perhaps from NT3 or other NT that goes to t82.\n- t17: from NT2 or other NT.\n- t43: looking for a terminal replacement; checking the grammar, I see that NT6 \u2192 t3, but that's not right. Wait, in the given grammar, I see NT15 \u2192 t82, but perhaps not. Wait, perhaps NT15 is part of the non-terminals, so maybe t43 comes from a non-terminal that expands to t43, but in the grammar, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps another path.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse the string step by step using the given grammar. Since it's a CNF grammar, every production is two non-terminals, so in each step, one non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, until we reach terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can expand to NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. Let's see which of these can produce the string.\n\nLet me try to see which of the productions in S could produce the given string as the first two symbols: S \u2192 NT12 NT12.\n\nSo the first symbol would be the first part of the expansion of the first NT12. Since the string starts with t12, NT12 \u2192 t12. So the first symbol is t12.\n\nNow, the second symbol is also t12. But in S's first production, after S, we have NT12 and NT12. So both would expand into t12, so after the first step, we have t12 t12. But in the string, the second symbol is t40, which is different. So the first production of S (NT12 NT12) cannot lead to the second symbol being t40. So maybe the next production for S.\n\nLet me check the next option: S \u2192 NT7 NT14. NT7 needs to expand into something. Looking at the grammar, NT7's productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT7 NT12 or NT7 NT3.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, the rules for NT7 are:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT12\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT3\n\nWait, but in CNF, only productions of the form A \u2192 BC are allowed, except for the start symbol. Here, NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11, which is fine. But now, if after S \u2192 NT7 NT14, the first symbol would be NT7's expansion.\n\nNT7 can be expanded as per its production, and since the first symbol is t12, that might not fit unless NT7 expands to t12, but looking into the grammar, I don't see NT7 going directly to t12. The terminal t12 only comes from NT12.\n\nSo maybe this production S \u2192 NT7 NT14 can't produce the first t12. So let's move to the next production of S: S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nNT9's productions are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9\nNT9 \u2192 NT11 NT11\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT16"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-345","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t95 t12 t82 t73 t65 t65 t81 t61 t39 t48 t82 t53 t65 t65 t43 t40 t65 t53 t82`.\n\nI notice that several of these are terminals, each is a two-digit number. The grammar has several terminals, like t95, t12, etc. So each of these in the string must be derived from a terminal production rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the productions are for terminals. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12', NT4 \u2192 't65', NT5 \u2192 't39', etc. So the strategy should be to find a derivation path for each symbol in the string using the grammar.\n\nThe approach is to start with the start symbol S and see if we can produce the string through a series of derivations.\n\nThe string has 19 tokens. Let's list them for clarity:\n\n1. t95\n2. t12\n3. t82\n4. t73\n5. t65\n6. t65\n7. t81\n8. t61\n9. t39\n10. t48\n11. t82\n12. t53\n13. t65\n14. t65\n15. t43\n16. t40\n17. t65\n18. t53\n19. t82\n\nEach of these is a terminal production. So, I need to check if each of these terminals is present in the grammar and if the grammar can generate such a sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some terminals appear:\n\n- 't95' is from NT12 \u2192 't12'. Wait, no, NT12 is 't12'? Let me check: NT12 is indeed 't12' in the grammar. So t95 must come from some other terminal production.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar rules. For each NT symbol, I need to see which ones directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12' (already listed)\n- NT16 \u2192 't70' (But not in the string)\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', 't82'\u2014Wait, no, let me check each:\n\nLooking for terminals in the grammar:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t12 (t12)\n- NT4 \u2192 t65\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT10 \u2192 t53\n- NT15 \u2192 t82 (multiple)\n- NT20 \u2192 t65\n- NT2 \u2192 t11 t17 or others? Wait, no\u2014wait, some rules might produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT15 \u2192 't82'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'\n- NT8 \u2192 't48'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1 nt2' Hmm, wait, wait. Let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The grammar has multiple production rules, some of which produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t39 (line 55)\nNT1 \u2192 t19 (line 10)\nNT2 \u2192 t11 t17 (multiple rules)\nWait, no, 't11' is another non-terminal. Wait, looking for direct terminal productions:\n\nFrom the rules, I can see that several non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12' (line 12)\n- NT4 \u2192 't65' (line 51)\n- NT5 \u2192 't39' (line 55)\n- NT10 \u2192 't53' (line 68)\n- NT15 \u2192 't82' (multiple lines)\n- NT20 \u2192 't65' (line 83)\n- NT8 \u2192 't48' (line 89)\n- NT19 \u2192 't1 nt2' Hmm, that's a production but 't1' and 'nt2' are a mix of terminal and non-terminal. Wait, no\u2014NT19 produces 't1 nt2'. That would mean a production like NT19 \u2192 t1 nt2, but that's mixing terminals with non-terminals, which isn't a direct terminal production. So perhaps that's not a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The rule might be NT19 \u2192 t1 nt2, meaning it produces 't1' followed by 'nt2'. But 'nt2' is a non-terminal, so it would require further expansion. So 'nt2' could produce, for example, t12 or t53 or others.\n\nWait, so in the string, let's look at each terminal and see if it's present in the grammar.\n\nThe string includes:\n\nt95, t12, t82, t73, t65, t65, t81, t61, t39, t48, t82, t53, t65, t65, t43, t40, t65, t53, t82.\n\nSo I need to check each of these.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT12 produces t12. So t12 is a terminal. So in the string, t12 occurs as the second token. That's fine.\n\nBut what about t95? In the grammar, is there any production that directly gives 't95' as a terminal? Looking through the rules, I don't see any terminal productions producing t95 directly. So perhaps that's a problem because the string has t95, but the grammar doesn't have a rule where NTn \u2192 t95. So unless some non-terminal can be expanded through multiple steps to produce t95, but since t95 is a terminal, it must be directly derived from a production rule.\n\nSo if the grammar doesn't have any rule that directly produces t95, then the string can't be generated.\n\nLooking again at the grammar, is there a NT that directly produces t95?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT12 \u2192 't12' (so t12 is a terminal), NT4 \u2192 't65', NT5 \u2192 't39', NT10 \u2192 't53', NT15 \u2192 't82', NT20 \u2192 't65', NT8 \u2192 't48', NT3 \u2192 various things, like t16, t29, t82, etc.\n\nI don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't95'. So unless t95 can be built through some path, but since it's a terminal, it must be directly produced by one of the grammar's rules.\n\nTherefore, the presence of 't95' in the string suggests that 't95' must be produced by a direct rule, but since it's not in the grammar, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe 't95' comes from some other expansion. For example, perhaps some NT produces 't95' through multiple steps.\n\nWait, let me see. For example, if a non-terminal A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, and eventually, during expansion, some step produces 't95'.\n\nBut 't95' is a terminal, so it must be directly produced by a production rule. Since the grammar doesn't have any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't95', the string contains a symbol that isn't in the grammar's terminals, so the string can't be generated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF is useful for certain parsing algorithms but might not be as straightforward for generating strings manually, especially with a long string.\n\nThe initial grammar has various start symbols like S, NT12, NT9, etc., and multiple production rules connecting them. Some symbols lead directly to terminal tokens, like NT12 -> 't95', but others are non-terminals that break down further.\n\nThe string starts with `t29`, which I notice is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT3 has two productions: NT3 -> 't16' and NT3 -> 't29'. The first rule takes NT3 directly to 't16', and the second to 't29'. So the first token `t29` must come from NT3 production, specifically the second rule.\n\nNext, the second token is `t40`. Looking for ways to get 't40', I check the grammar.

Let's track:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 can produce 't29' or 't16'. So first, NT3 is 't29', then next is NT0 as 't40'. So the initial part is S -> NT9 NT12 or others, but perhaps it's via NT3 somewhere. Wait, maybe S is built from combining other non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps a path like NT9 -> NT6 NT9 could lead to more tokens.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step, looking for how each token could be generated from the grammar. Since the string is long, it might be time-consuming.\n\nStarting with the entire string, let's consider it as a sequence of tokens: t29, t40, t82, t73, t17, t26, t53, t70, t70, t65, t53, t26, t26, t70, t26, t61, t17, t43, t81.\n\nEach token is a terminal, so each must be produced by a rule that directly outputs that terminal.

NT3 is good here.\n- 't73' is from 'nt5' rule (looking back, NT5's production is `-> nt5 nt2`).

Let's make a list of all terminal options:\n\nLooking through each production, whenever a symbol leads directly to a terminal, that's a potential candidate.\n\nList of terminal productions:\n\n- S can go to some non-terminals, not terminals.\n- NT9 -> 't77', 't6' (wait, in the grammar above, looking again, there are multiple NT9 productions.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and then break down the string step by step to see if it can be derived.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It's in CNF, so each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. The productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nor S \u2192 NT7 NT14\nor S \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nI need to see if the given string can be derived starting from S.\n\nThe string provided is: t17 t65 t53 t61 t53 t73 t82 t53 t65 t61 t65 t53 t70 t65 t73 t65 t43 t40 t48 t48\n\nThat's 20 tokens. Since the grammar uses productions that combine symbols into two others, or terminals, the number of symbols in the sentential form reduces by one each time a production is applied until all symbols are terminals. So a string of n terminals can be generated if the derivation uses (n-1) productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which is a non-terminal. To produce a string, S needs to be expanded until all non-terminals become terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several NTs that eventually resolve to terminals. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12' directly. Other NTs produce other NTs until they reach terminals.\n\nI'll start by seeing which production starts the derivation. The string starts with t17, which is a terminal. Let me check which NTs can produce t17.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT17 appears a few times:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10\nNT17 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12\nNT17 \u2192 NT20 NT17 (recursive, but we might not need this)\nNT17 \u2192 NT6 NT6 (probably not relevant now)\nNT17 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n\nSo, NT17 can produce terminals like t61, t43, t70, etc. Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking for where t17 is produced.

{"custom_id":"request-365","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens: `t40 t40 t65 t43 t65 t53 t40 t73 t70 t40 t82 t43 t26 t53 t39 t65 t40 t43 t70 t95`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. I notice that many rules start with NT and end with specific tokens. For example, I see `NT12 -> 't12'`, `NT10 -> 't53'`, `NT4 -> 't65'`, etc. So some of these are terminals, which are the actual symbols in the string.\n\nThe string is a sequence of these terminal tokens. I need to see if this sequence can be derived starting from the start symbol S, following the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. S has three productions:\n1. S -> NT12 NT12\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these produces two NT symbols, which need to be further expanded until we reach terminals.\n\nSince all the given tokens are terminals, I can check if the string can be derived from S by breaking it down step by step.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to see how the string can be split using the production rules. Each production from S gives two NT symbols, so the entire string should be generated by a series of these productions followed by further terminals.\n\nLet me first count the tokens: there are 20 tokens in the string. Since each S production leads to two NTs, and each of those can further expand until terminals, I'm expecting that each expansion step will combine these into longer sequences, but ultimately the string must be a valid combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be viewed as a concatenation of certain NT symbols that are expanded to certain terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, I see several rules where NTs directly map to terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't12', NT10 -> 't53', NT4 -> 't65', and so on.\n\nLet me try to identify what parts of the string correspond to which NT rules.\n\nLooking at the string: `t40 t40 t65 t43 t65 t53 t40 t73 t70 t40 t82 t43 t26 t53 t39 t65 t40 t43 t70 t95`.\n\nI notice that t40 appears multiple times, which is similar to how NT9 and other rules produce t40. Let's see:\n\n- t40 could be from NT9 -> 't77' but that's not t40. Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT9 -> 't77', but also NT9 can produce other NTs like NT9 -> NT6 NT9. Hmm, perhaps it's better to go step by step.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, there's a rule `NT9 -> NT6 NT6` but also `NT9 -> NT11 NT11`.

{"custom_id":"request-389","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t48 t73 t48 t65 t19 t40 t40 t40 t82 t43 t70 t65 t65 t82 t65 t26 t53 t40 t82 t73 t12`.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right, except for maybe the start symbol. But here, the start symbol S has productions that lead to terms ending in 't's, which are terminal symbols.\n\nI notice that many of the non-terminals on the right side of the productions eventually lead to these terminal symbols. For example, `S -> NT12 NT12`, and so on. So, I think the approach should be to parse the string from left to right, trying to match the non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet's check each part. The string starts with `t48`, which from the grammar can come from NT8, since one of NT8's productions is `NT8 -> NT4 NT20`, and looking for NT8 that directly produces 't48'. From the grammar, I see NT8 -> 't48', so 't48' can appear as a leaf node.\n\nSimilarly, the next tokens are `t73`, which probably comes from NT21, as NT21 can produce 't73'. Let me confirm: in the grammar, NT21 has production `NT21 -> NT17 NT5`, and both of these non-terminals can produce 't73' and 't53', respectively? Wait, NT17 might produce 't61' or something else, but maybe I need to look at the actual rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some of the NT rules have terminal symbols already. For example, NT12 -> 't12', so 't12' is directly produced by NT12.\n\nWait, the string starts with t48 t73 t48 t65 t19 t40 t40 t40 t82 t43 t70 t65 t65 t82 t65 t26 t53 t40 t82 t73 t12.\n\nSo, the first token is t48, which I think comes from NT8. Then, t73 comes from NT21, since one of the productions of NT21 is `NT21 -> NT5 NT'53'? Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT21 has these productions: `NT21 -> NT17 NT5`, `NT21 -> NT17 NT3`, etc. Wait, there's a list at the end that says NT21 can produce NT17 NT5 or NT17 NT3? Or wait, looking back, let me find all NT21 rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT21 has these rules:\nNT21 -> NT17 NT5\nNT21 -> NT17 NT3\nNT21 -> NT17 NT5 again?\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar, I see lines that say NT21 -> NT17 NT5 and NT21 -> NT17 NT3. So NT21 can produce NT17 NT5 or NT17 NT3.\n\nBut wait, from the grammar, NT3 can produce various terms. For example, from the top, NT3 can lead to t29 or t82 via NT13, etc. Hmm, but in the string, after t73 comes t48, t48, t65, t19, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this as a parse tree. Let's see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: the string is a sequence of terminals, so perhaps we can try to match them step by step.\n\nFirst, 't48' is from NT8, as NT8 -> 't48'. So the first step is NT8.\n\nThen comes 't73', which could be from NT21, as one of NT21's rules is NT21 -> 't73' NT5? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some NT symbols directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16', 't29', 't53', 't82'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT5 -> 't65', 't66'\n- NT20 -> 't65', 't26', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct a parse tree. Let's start with the string and see if it can be broken into parts.\n\nLooking at the first token: t48. From the rules, NT8 produces t48. So the first step is NT8.\n\nNext, after t48, we have t73. Let's look for which non-terminal can produce t73 followed by something. Looking at NT21, which can produce 't73' as part of a production. Wait, actually, looking at the NT21 rules:\n\nNT21 -> NT17 NT5 and NT21 -> NT17 NT3. But in the grammar, NT17 can produce 't61', but 't73' is directly produced by NT5.\n\nWait, from the top, NT5 can produce 't39', 't66', etc. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT5 -> NT13 NT7\n- NT5 -> 't66'\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't66'?\n\nWait, looking back: yes, the grammar has \"NT5 -> 't66'\", so NT5 can produce t66. Similarly, NT3 can produce 't16', 't29', 't53', 't82'.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t48 comes t73, then t48, etc. So perhaps the first part is NT8 (t48), then something else.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe I should use a table-driven parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is in CNF, maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be split into a series of productions.\n\nLet me try to write the string as a sequence and see where it might break down.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt48 t73 t48 t65 t19 t40 t40 t40 t82 t43 t70 t65 t65 t82 t65 t26 t53 t40 t82 t73 t12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent it as a list:\n\nList = [t48, t73, t48, t65, t19, t40, t40, t40, t82, t43, t70, t65, t65, t82, t65, t26, t53, t40, t82, t73, t12]\n\nLet me see if I can match this step by step.\n\nStarting with t48: that's NT8. So the first production is S -> NT12 NT12, etc., but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's see which S production can produce this.\n\nWait, S can produce NT12 NT12, NT9 NT14, NT12, etc. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to think recursively.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which NT rules can produce the given terminals in the string.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. t48: comes from NT8. So the first step is NT8.\n\n2. Next is t73: where does t73 come from? Looking at the grammar, I see NT3 can produce 't73' (from \"NT3 -> 't73'\")? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT3 has a production to 't73': \"NT3 -> 't73'\". Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT3, there's \"NT3 -> 't73'\". So yes, NT3 can produce t73.\n\nBut wait, in the string after t48 is t73. So the sequence so far is [t48, t73]. So perhaps after the first NT8, which is t48, the next symbol is t73, which can come from NT3.\n\nWait, but then, how do they connect?

This should help in parsing or generating the string efficiently.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: `t81 t48 t82 t43 t40 t53 t53 t82 t53 t65 t40 t19 t26 t61 t66 t48 t70 t40 t65 t61 t48`. I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce two NT12 NT8 or other combinations. Since the string starts with t81, I should look for production rules that directly produce t81 or see if it's a terminal from a non-terminal expansion.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that NT3 can produce 't16' or 't29' or 't81' I think I need to check each production for NT3. Wait, looking back, NT3 has several productions: NT3 -> 't16', 't29', or something else? Wait, let me check again.\n\nAh, I see: NT3 has two rules: NT3 -> 't16' and NT3 -> 't29'. Wait, no, looking more carefully: the rules for NT3 are:\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n\nSo, NT3 can produce t16, t29, or t81. But in the string, the first token is t81, so that's possible.\n\nNow, where does t81 come from? Let's see. In the production rules, NT3 can produce t81. So, to have t81, the parser must come from NT3. So, I need to see if the string can be broken down into t81 followed by other symbols, but looking at the string, it's a single t81 as the first token, followed by t48, t82, etc. Hmm, but wait, perhaps the t81 is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, maybe the t81 is part of a chain where the first NT3 is followed by another NT3 or something else. Alternatively, maybe the breakdown starts with S -> NT9 NT12, which then must produce t81 somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the possible expansions. Since the string starts with t81, let's see which NT can produce t81.\n\nLooking again at the production rules for NT3, it can produce t81. So that's a possibility.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT3 is a non-terminal, so t81 must be derived from NT3. So, does NT3 appear on the left side of any production? Let me check the NT productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT7 -> NT1 NT0, NT9 -> NT6 NT9, NT3 -> NT5 NT14, etc. Wait, but is there a production where NT3 appears on the left? Or is NT3 only on the right side.\n\nYes, I see NT3 on the right side in several productions: NT3 -> NT5 NT14, which produces t81 if NT5 produces something that leads to t81.\n\nWait, let me re-express the productions more clearly:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that several NTs can produce multiple things, but focusing on NT3:\n\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n\nSo, NT3 can produce t16, t29, or t81 directly. So, in the context of generating the string, t81 must come from direct production from NT3. That means that the first part of the string must have come from NT3, but how does the grammar combine the symbols?\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which can produce things like NT9 NT12. Let's see which parts of the string could come from NT9 and NT12.\n\nThe string starts with t81, so that's the production from NT3. But if that's the case, then the NT3 production must be part of a larger chain. Wait, maybe the initial NT3 is followed by another NT3 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S production S-> NT9 NT12 is the one that will produce the first part of the string. Let me look at the possible S productions:\n\n- S -> NT12 NT14 (from line 2)\n- S -> NT7 NT14 (line 3)\n- S-> NT9 NT12 (line1)\n\nSo the S can split into two non-terminals. Let's consider S-> NT9 NT12 first because the string starts with t81, which could be NT3, but how does that tie into NT9 and NT12?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me approach it by parsing the string.\n\nThe string is: t81 t48 t82 t43 t40 t53 t53 t82 t53 t65 t40 t19 t26 t61 t66 t48 t70 t40 t65 t61 t48.\n\nThis is a sequence of 21 tokens.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated step by step.\n\nStarting with S, it's a context-free grammar, so each step produces two non-terminals on the left which expand into the right.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production has two non-terminals on the right, so each step could produce smaller chunks, but the string is a linear sequence.\n\nBut perhaps the string is broken down by each production.\n\nAlternatively, think of each step as expanding a single non-terminal into a pair of non-terminals, each of which would be further expanded.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps we can use a top-down approach or bottom-up (like parsing).\n\nAlternatively, start from the string and see if it can be reconstructed by the given productions.\n\nFor example, look for tokens that can be produced directly by a non-terminal.\n\nt81 is directly produced by NT3 (the third rule: NT3->t81).\n\nSo, perhaps in the string, the first token t81 comes from NT3, which would require that earlier there's an NT3 that expanded into t81.\n\nBut in context-free parsing, each production is a split into two non-terminals. So perhaps the first token t81 is part of the expansion of NT3, and the next part is another symbol.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to try to find if the string can be broken down step by step using the productions.\n\nLet me list the possible NTs and see which tokens they can produce.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT9 can produce NT11 NT11, so that would be two NT11s, each of which might produce letters.\n- NT21 can produce things like t82 or t65 etc.\n- NT4 can produce t65, etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be generated starting from S.\n\nLet me see if the string can be generated by S.\n\nThe string starts with t81, which would have to come from either NT3 (since NT3 can produce t81) or perhaps a non-terminal that can break down into something that starts with t81.\n\nWait, S can expand into NT9 NT12. Let's think of S -> NT9 NT12.\n\nThen, if NT9 -> NT6 NT9 and NT12 -> NT17 NT8.\n\nBut wait, that might be getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps looking for t81 in the string and seeing how it could be generated from a non-terminal.\n\nt81 can come from NT3.

{"custom_id":"request-406","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is `t17 t40 t40 t40 t81 t61 t16 t73 t40 t65 t53 t77 t48 t65 t43 t17 t82 t61 t39 t48 t70 t12`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF looks like. CNF is a form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, which can produce terminals. Also, the start symbol shouldn't be on either side of any production. So, all the productions given are of the form S \u2192 NT... and so on, leading to terminals. So, the grammar seems to be in CNF except for the individual terminals.\n\nNext, I think about the approach. Since the grammar is given, I can probably parse the string using the given productions. Alternatively, I can construct a parse tree based on the string and see if it matches any sequence of productions leading back to the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, all separated by spaces. The numbers seem to be the actual terminals in the grammar. So, my goal is to see if this string can be broken down into a series of productions according to the grammar.\n\nI should list all the productions and terminals available. Let's see, the non-terminals seem to be S, N, T, and others with numbers. The terminals are all combinations starting with 't' followed by numbers like t12, t16, t17, etc. \n\nWait, in the given grammar, each production is like S \u2192 NT12 NT8, which I assume means that S is replaced by two non-terminals NT12 and NT8. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 NT11 NT11, and so on. \n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. I need to see if these terminals can be produced by the grammar. \n\nBut wait, actually, the string may consist of multiple terminals, and the grammar's productions can generate sequences of these. So, each token in the string must be matched by some production of a non-terminal.\n\nLet me look at the string again: `t17 t40 t40 t40 t81 t61 t16 t73 t40 t65 t53 t77 t48 t65 t43 t17 t82 t61 t39 t48 t70 t12`.\n\nThat's quite a long string. I need to see if there's a way to break this string into parts where each part corresponds to a production in the grammar. \n\nLooking for the first token: t17. So, somewhere in the grammar, there must be a production that produces t17. Looking at the productions, I don't see any direct production of t17 as a terminal. The productions of the non-terminals like NT17 generate other non-terminals or another pair of non-terminals, not t17 as a terminal. Wait, no, actually, the string has t17 as a terminal, but I don't see any direct production of t17. Let me check again.\n\nWait, checking the productions:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. For example, NT20 \u2192 't10' 't3'? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, actually, the productions like NT12 \u2192 't12', which is a terminal. Similarly, some non-terminals produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT12 appears in the first production: S \u2192 NT12 NT8. NT12 \u2192 't12'. So, the non-terminal NT12 can produce the terminal 't12'. Similarly, NT10 \u2192 't53', and so on.\n\nSo, each non-terminal has associated derivations that can produce a terminal or other non-terminals. If I can find a way to have the string consist of a series of these terminals, then the string is in the language.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step. The string starts with t17, t40, t40, t40, t81, etc.\n\nFirst, t17: Looking for a production that can generate t17. Looking at the productions, I see that NT17 appears in some of them. For example:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5\n- NT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12\n- NT17 \u2192 NT20 NT17\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n\nAdditionally, there's NT17 \u2192 NT6 NT20, etc.\n\nBut none of these directly produce t17 as a terminal. Instead, NT17 is a non-terminal that's produced by other non-terminals, such as NT2 and NT7, etc. So, t17 must come from some deeper derivation.\n\nWait, looking for any production where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. Maybe some NTs produce t17. Let me check all the productions for any NT that directly produces a terminal starting with t17.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I find:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't17' 't2'\n\nWait, actually, I don't see that. Looking back at the productions:\n\nThe list is quite extensive. Wait, maybe I'm missing a line. Let me scan through the list again. I see lines like:\n\nNT4 -> 't17' 't2'\n\nWait, no, looking through the given productions again, I see that:\n\nLooking for 't17' as a terminal, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't61' 't16'\n\nWait, that's not it. Let me check each production for NT or non-terminal that directly produces a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Maybe t17 is only produced by NTs that derive other NTs, but perhaps indirectly. Alternatively, maybe t17 is a terminal only if it's directly produced by an NT production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this differently.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals which can appear directly. So, for the first token, t17, it must be produced by some non-terminal NT that directly produces t17 as a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking through all the production rules, I don't see any that directly produce t17. For example, NT17 \u2192 't61' 't16' is a production from NT17, which is an internal production, not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I missed a production where a NT directly produces t17.\n\nWait, looking again, for example, NT17 \u2192 NT6 NT20. So, from NT17, we derive other NTs. None of the NTs produce t17 directly.\n\nSimilarly, looking for the terminal t17, I don't see any NT that directly produces it. Therefore, it might not be possible to generate t17 as a terminal in this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe t17 is produced indirectly through longer derivations. For example, perhaps some NTT produces a terminal through multiple steps.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to produce a terminal, a non-terminal must have a direct production to that terminal.\n\nSo, in this case, since there is no production where any NT directly produces t17, perhaps the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's go through the productions systematically.\n\nLooking for NTs and their productions:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\nNT10 \u2192 't53', 't73', 't43', 't17'\nWait, no, NT10 appears in the productions as NT10 \u2192 't53' 't43' and so on, but wait, actually in the given productions, I see:\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nI see that NT10 has productions:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't53' 't43' (from NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, etc.? No, let's search differently.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should systematically list all the NTs and see if any directly produce t17.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't65', 't84'? Wait, let me check the given productions.\n\nLooking at the provided productions:\n\nWait, for example, NT20 appears in the production: NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3, and several others, but I don't see any direct production to a terminal starting with 17. Similarly, NT17 is used in multiple productions but doesn't produce t17 as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for NT17 in the productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT6 NT20\nNT17 \u2192 NT20 NT17\nNT17 \u2192 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

My task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me map out the string and see if it fits into the grammar's structure. The string has 21 tokens, so the derivation probably involves many steps.

Let me check that again. Wait, looking back, I see NT11 has several productions, but none directly produce terminals. Hmm.)\n\nWait, let me look for NT12. The string starts with 't19 t40 t12...'.

It looks like this is a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule on the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side consists of exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. The given grammar has several rules, but some of them produce terminals directly, like NT12 -> 't12' and NT10 -> 't53', etc. So, some of these rules are for terminals, and others are combinations.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so we can start from the string and see if it can be broken down into the grammar's rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one. The process should continue until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by listing the string step by step:\n\n1. t40 t40 t48 t95 t82 t43 t65 t82 t82 t82 t43 t40 t66 t43 t82 t48 t82 t17 t65 t73 t65 t53 t12\n\nWait, it seems like the string is composed of elements where each is either generated by a production or a terminal. I think I need to map each terminal to a production that leads to it.\n\nFor example, any occurrence of 't40' must come from a production that includes NT0 -> 't40', which is in the grammar. Similarly, 't53' is from NT10 -> 't53', 't65' could come from NT3, but looking at the grammar, I see multiple rules for 't65', like NT16, NT15, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps I can start from the start symbol S and apply productions step by step to see if I can generate the string.\n\nBut the string is pretty long, and applying all possible productions manually would take time. Maybe I can find a way to break it down.\n\nLet me look at the string and see if there are any segments that I recognize from the grammar. Let's see: the beginning is t40 t40.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t40 is from NT10 -> 't40'. So, perhaps the start S can produce NT10, which then produces t40 t40... Wait, no, because the grammar uses CNF, so S would have to split into two non-terminals and then each of those into terminals.\n\nWait, the start symbol S can produce NT10 and NT? Let's check the rules for S:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 (no, that's S -> NT12 NT10 according to the first part of the grammar? Wait, no, looking back: the user wrote the grammar with multiple S rules. Let me parse that again.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nWait, no, let me check again. The user wrote the grammar as S -> NT12 NT10, no, wait, the user's grammar starts as S -> NT12 NT12? Wait, no, looking closely, the grammar was pasted as:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nWait, the user's grammar was:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nWait, no, that can't be right because NT12 doesn't produce t8. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar has S producing combinations like NT12 NT10, but I might have misread it.\n\nWait, let me check the user's grammar again. The user wrote S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, which is S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, but then later S -> NT7 NT14, etc. But in any case, each S production is two non-terminals. Wait, no, perhaps the user made a typo. Let me recount.\n\nWait, on second thought, perhaps the initial S productions are S -> NT12 NT10, S -> NT7 NT14, etc., but wait, the user wrote:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, that's three different production rules for S. The first one is S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, which would actually produce three parts, but CNF requires two non-terminals on the right side. So maybe that's incorrect, perhaps it's a typo.\n\nWait, maybe I should read the grammar correctly. The user wrote:\n\n- S -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n- S -> NT7 NT14\n- S -> NT9 NT12\n- ...\n\nThis is confusing because the first production for S has three non-terminals, which isn't allowed in CNF. That suggests the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps that's a typo, and it's supposed to be S -> NT12 NT10 or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the entire grammar again, perhaps I misread it. Let me make sure.\n\nLooking back, it seems that the grammar is structured as S having several production rules, each producing two non-terminals or terminals. For example, looking at S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, that can't be, because it would have three parts, violating the CNF structure which requires exactly two symbols on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, maybe each S production is just two symbols, but I'm seeing it as three. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, upon closer inspection, the user wrote the grammar with each production under a separate line, perhaps indented, which could imply that each line is a separate production. For example, the first few lines are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT10\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the number of symbols on the right side. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at the user's grammar as presented:\n\nThe first line after 'Grammar: ' is:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nWait, that's three non-terminals. That would break the CNF rule because each production must have exactly two symbols on the RHS. So that would be a mistake unless it's allowed. But since the user is using that, I must consider that perhaps it's a typo and it's supposed to be two symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a way to represent a single symbol split into multiple parts, but that might not make sense. Wait, maybe the user intended S -> NT12 NT8, but wrote it as three. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the user has a typo, and I should assume that each S production is correctly written as two non-terminals or a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for three symbols if they are all terminals. That complicates things because in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So perhaps the initial S productions are correct as they are, but I'm misinterpreting the way they're presented.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a formatting error when presenting the grammar. Let me see:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nBut it's unclear how many symbols each production has. For example, the first line is S->NT12 NT12 NT8, which is three symbols, but CNF requires two. So that suggests either a typo or perhaps I should proceed with that and see.\n\nBut perhaps I should proceed, maybe it's a mistake but the rest are okay. Alternatively, perhaps the first line is S->NT12 NT10, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial line is S-> NT12 NT8, but with a typo of an extra NT12.\n\nIn any case, given that this is an error-prone initial step, perhaps I can proceed by trying to see if the terminal string can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is to map each token in the string to possible non-terminals that can generate it, then find a path through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt40 t40 t48 t95 t82 t43 t65 t82 t82 t82 t43 t40 t66 t43 t82 t48 t82 t17 t65 t73 t65 t53 t12\n\nLet me first try to identify which non-terminals generate which terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT4 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF is a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol expands into two non-terminals, or a terminal symbol. The start symbol doesn't produce the empty string.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that some symbols in the non-terminals do produce terminal strings. For example, some of these end with 't' like `t95`, `t53`, etc. So, the production rules where the non-terminal expands into a terminal symbol followed by another non-terminal might end up yielding the string.\n\nBut the production rules given seem to involve multiple symbols. Let me look at the start symbol, S. It can produce NT12 NT8, NT7 NT14, or NT9 NT12. Wait, but NT12 can produce NT17 NT8, which could be a terminal string. Similarly, S expands into two non-terminals. So the entire string generated by S will consist of two parts, each part being the expansion of NT something.\n\nWait, no.

Since the string consists of terminals, I need to see if the non-terminals can be expanded step by step to produce the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t17`, which I know appears in several productions on the right-hand side of the rules. For example, NT17 can produce `t81` or `t82` or other combinations. But since it's a terminal, it must correspond directly to a production where the left-hand side (LHS) equals the terminal.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see that many of them can produce terminals. For example, NT7-> t65, etc. But the string starts with `t17`, which isn't a terminal but a result of a production. Wait, no, `t17` must come from NT17.

Let me check: NT17 is defined as NT7 -> NT17 NT5 or NT17 -> NT7 NT16. Wait, no, looking back, actually, in the grammar, after the first part, I see:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I notice that some of the non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT12 -> t12, NT10 -> t53, NT4 -> t65, etc. So to produce a string of terminals, the entire expansion must result in a sequence of these terminal productions.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, which must be the result of expanding the start symbols (S) through a series of non-terminals leading to terminal symbols.\n\nThe grammar has S -> NT12 NT12 or S-> NT7 NT14 etc. But looking again, I realize that the given grammar is not in proper CNF for all non-terminals because some have more than two non-terminals. Wait, no, all the productions are either single symbols or two non-terminals, so it is indeed in CNF.\n\nBut wait, in the string, it's a sequence of 24 tokens. Each of these must come from a terminal production in the grammar. So, for example, `t17` must be generated by some production. Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce t17?\n\nLooking through the productions: yes, NT17 can produce t61 (since in the last part of the grammar, NT17->t61), and also NT4 can produce t17. So both NT17 and NT4 have terminal options.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 -> NT6 NT6\nNT17 -> NT7 NT16\nNT17 -> NT5 NT2\nNT17 -> NT8 NT10\nWait, no, actually, wait: Let me re-examine the given grammar. Starting from NT17, according to the last part:\n\nNT17 -> NT5 NT2\nNT17 -> NT21 NT5\nHmm, no, maybe I'm getting confused because the grammar is very long. Alternatively, from the initial part, NT17 is defined as NT7 -> NT17 NT5 or NT17 -> NT7 NT16.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar systematically.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\nNT17 has a production NT17 -> NT5 NT2.\n\nWait, let me find all NT17's productions.\n\nLooking through the first part:\n\nNT17 -> NT7 NT16\nNT17 -> NT5 NT2\nNT17 -> NT21 NT5\nYes, so NT17 can produce NT7 NT16, NT5 NT2, or NT21 NT5. None of these are terminals; they are further non-terminals except where specified.\n\nLooking now at the last part of the grammar, I see that:\n\n- NT17 can also produce NT8 NT10\nWait, no, let me check the entire grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar is quite long, so perhaps I should look for NT17's productions. Let me go through the list:\n\nLooking through each line, only some relevant parts:\n\n... NT7 -> NT7 NT12\n...\nThen towards the end:\n\nNT15 -> NT82 NT8\nNT17 -> NT61\nWait, yes! Looking at the end of the grammar:\n\nHere's the part: NT17 -> t61.\n\nYes, so NT17 can produce t61. So, to produce `t17`, wait no, the string is t17, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the string, it starts with t17, which would have to come from a production where NT17 directly produces t61, but that's not t17. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no, in the grammar, there's actually a NT17 -> t61, not t17.\n\nSo how does `t17` appear in the string? That suggests that it's not directly a production of any non-terminal, which would be a problem because all terminals have to be produced by a single-step production from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces 't17'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't17' as a product in the RHS of any production.\n\nWait, the first part of the grammar:\n\nNT7-> t65, so nope.\n\nLooking later on:\n\nIn the last part, I see NT5->t39, NT4-> t65, NT2-> t21's production is split into NT2-> t12 or others.\n\nWait, looking through all the lines, I notice that NT17 can produce t61, but I don't see any production that directly gives t17. So that's a problem because the string starts with t17, but if there's no production that creates t17, it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed some production. Let me re-examine the grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nAt the end, I see:\n\nNT17 -> t61\n\nNo 't17' anywhere else. So if the string starts with t17, and that can't be produced by any rule, the string is invalid. Thus, it's impossible for the grammar to produce a string starting with t17, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but hold on: maybe NT7 can produce t17 indirectly? Let me check if any of NT7's productions lead to t17.\n\nWait, NT7 has productions like NT7-> NT7 NT12, NT5-> etc. But do any of them result in t17? Looking for 't17' in the RHS of NT7 or other non-terminals:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any production that results in 't17' as a terminal. So any occurrence of t17 in the string is impossible because it's not in the set of terminal symbols defined by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string must contain a symbol that's not present in the grammar's terminal symbols, which is 't17' at the start.\n\nSo, the conclusion is: the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because it includes a terminal 't17' that is not in the grammar's terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all possible non-terminals to see if any produce t17. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in parsing.\n\nLooking back, I only found NT17 producing t61. So, in the entire grammar, there's no rule that produces t17 as a terminal, which would be required for the string's first token.

{"custom_id":"request-471","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which helps because each production is binary, except maybe for starting symbols. The string I need to check is: `t40 t66 t40 t82 t40 t65 t82 t53 t65 t70 t65 t65 t17 t43 t82 t73 t82 t43 t40 t70 t48 t70 t48 t82 t12`. \n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. CNF requires that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals, except that A can't be a terminal. The start symbol can also be a terminal, but I don't think that's the case here. Also, the right-hand side can't be a single terminal; it must be two. Wait, but in the grammar given, I notice some rules like S \u2192 NT12 NT18, but I think I might have misread the original grammar.\n\nWait, looking back, the user wrote the grammar and the string. The grammar has rules like S \u2192 NT12 NT18, but the original string doesn't have 't18' or 't13', but instead has 't70', 't65', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals in the grammar have productions that eventually lead to terminals. So, the non-terminals like NT12, NT18, etc., must derive into a sequence of terminals that match the string.\n\nGiven that, I think the approach is to parse the string from the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string must be derived via a leftmost derivation with the productions expanding two symbols at a time.\n\nBut the string is a series of 't' followed by two-digit numbers. The first step is to list all the symbols in the string. Let's count them: t40, t66, t40, t82, t40, t65, t82, t53, t65, t70, t65, t65, t17, t43, t82, t73, t82, t43, t40, t70, t48, t70, t48, t82, t12. So that's 24 symbols. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, any string generated must have a derivation where each production step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols. So, the length of the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. Starting from the start symbol S, each step adds one more level, so the length goes from 1 to 2, 4, 8, etc.\n\nLooking at the string, I count 24 symbols. Let's see if that fits 2^n. 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. 24 is between 16 and 32, so it's not a power of two. Therefore, the string length doesn't fit, which suggests that it's not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Starting from S, which is a non-terminal, each production expands it into two symbols. So, the number of symbols at each step doubles, but the start can go directly to two terminals if it's a final step. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Actually, the number of symbols can grow as a binary tree: if S expands into two non-terminals, each of those can expand into two, and so on. So, the total number of terminal symbols would be 2^n, where n is the depth of the derivation. But wait, if S starts as a single non-terminal, the first step makes it two, the next step could make each of those into two, so after k steps, you have 2^k symbols, assuming each production only creates two non-terminals. But if the grammar allows for some productions to result in terminals, that complicates things.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is binary. So, in the case where a non-terminal expands into two terminals, then that step would contribute two symbols. So, the total number of symbols should be either 2^n or perhaps a different form if some of the productions produce mixed symbols.\n\nBut in our case, the string must be a sequence of terminals derived from starting with S and expanding each non-terminal into exactly two symbols each time, and this repeats until only terminals remain. So, the length of the string must be a binary number, meaning length is 2^n for some n.\n\nIn our case, 24 is 2^4 * 1.5, which isn't a power of two. 24 is 2^4 + 8, right? 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. 24 is in between, so it's not a power of two. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar, which requires that the length is a power of two.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The string is t40 t66 t40 t82 t40 t65 t82 t53 t65 t70 t65 t65 t17 t43 t82 t73 t82 t43 t40 t70 t48 t70 t48 t82 t12. Counting each token, that's 24 symbols. \n\nIs 24 a valid length for a string derived from S in CNF? Let's see: The start symbol S would produce two something, then each of those could produce two more, and so on. So, the total number of terminal symbols should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 two non-terminals A B: length 2^1 = 2.\n- A \u2192 two terminals, B \u2192 two terminals: length 4.\n- A \u2192 two terminals, B \u2192 two terminals: length 4.\nWait, no, that's 2^2=4.\n\nWait, the number of symbols is 2 at each level. If the derivation has depth k, the number of symbols is 2^k.\n\nSo, for a string of length 24, that's approximately log2(24) \u2248 4.58. So, the number of non-terminals would be 5, but the length is 2^5=32, not 24. So, it's not a power of two, which means the string length doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows for some non-terminals to produce a mix of terminals and non-terminals, so the total number of terminals isn't exactly 2^n. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see that many rules produce terminals. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT16 \u2192 't70', NT3 \u2192 't16' and so on. So, if a non-terminal expands into terminals, those would contribute to the string length. But in CNF, each production is an expansion, so if a non-terminal expands into a terminal and another non-terminal, the next step would involve expanding that non-terminal into two symbols.\n\nWait, for example, if a non-terminal A \u2192 B t, where B is a non-terminal and t is a terminal, then in the next step, B must expand into two symbols, say t1 and t2, making the entire expansion t1 t t2, which is three symbols. But in CNF, all productions are binary, so each step can only replace a non-terminal with two symbols. Therefore, the number of symbols can only grow in powers of two. Let me explain:\n\n- Starting with S, it's one non-terminal (length 1).\n- After one production (S \u2192 NT12 NT18), length becomes 2.\n- Each subsequent step expands non-terminals into two symbols. So, if you have a string of length L, the next step would increase it to 2L if all non-terminals in the string are expanded in parallel.\n\nHowever, in this case, the string is being parsed from the leaves up, so the number of terminals would be a function of the number of terminal productions. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me think differently. Each time a non-terminal is expanded, it contributes its entire expansion. So, if a non-terminal expands into two terminals, that's a fixed contribution of two symbols. But if it expands into a non-terminal and a terminal, then the next step would need to expand the non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, so it's only two non-terminals. So, each production replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, in the first step, S (1 non-terminal) becomes two non-terminals, total symbols: 2 (all non-terminals). Then, each non-terminal could either expand into two non-terminals (total symbols: 4)"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-472","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string given is a series of tokens separated by spaces: `t12 t82 t65 t43 t65 t73 t40 t40 t40 t40 t40 t40 t82 t73 t95 t40 t40 t73 t16 t65 t73 t82 t53 t73 t29`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that some symbols are terminals. For example, there are rules like NT12 \u2192 't12', NT10 \u2192 't53', etc. So these terminals are atomic and cannot be broken down further. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands into various combinations of non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT12, etc.\n\nNow, the string starts with t12, which is a terminal. So, according to the grammar, where is this t12 defined? Looking through the rules, I find NT12 \u2192 't12'. So 't12' is derived from NT12.\n\nThe next token is t82. Looking for a production where the right-hand side is t82. I see NT13 \u2192 't82', but looking further, I see that NT3 has multiple rules, but I don't immediately see a NT82. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nHmm, I don't see a rule where NT16 is t82. Wait, no, looking again, I see that NT13 has a production NT13 \u2192 't82'. Wait, that can't be right because NT13 is a non-terminal, but the string has t82, which is a terminal. So that suggests that NT13 must be able to produce t82. So, looking at NT13's production, yes, NT13 \u2192 't82'. But wait, that can't be because NT13 is a non-terminal, meaning it would have to expand into other symbols. So if there's a rule NT13 \u2192 't82', that makes it a terminal as well. Wait, no, in the grammar, each production for a non-terminal is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So if NT13 \u2192 't82', then NT13 is a terminal, which is fine.\n\nWait, but in the given string, after t12 comes t82, which is possible if the grammar has a production NT12 \u2192 t12 and then somehow NT12 can produce t82. Wait, but looking at the grammar, I need to see how NT12 can produce t82. Let me look at the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at NT12, I see that it has several rules. One of them is NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. Another is NT12 \u2192 't12'. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nAh, yes, indeed, NT12 \u2192 't12' is a production. So when NT12 is expanded, it could directly produce 't12' or go through other rules like NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, etc.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t12, so that would require NT12 to produce 't12' directly. So after that, the next token is t82. So perhaps after T12 (which is 't12'), the next symbol is produced by another NT that can produce 't82'. Let's check the rules for other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that NT3 can produce 't16', 't29', etc., but where does 't82' come from? Let me check all non-terminals that have a rule ending with 't82'. I see NT13 \u2192 't82', as well as NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT15, but that's non-terminal. Wait, no, NT13 is a non-terminal because it's on the left side of a production.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with 't12', which must come from a production of NT12 \u2192 't12'. So NT12 can produce t12 directly. So that's the first part.\n\n2. The next token is 't82'. So how can 't82' be produced? Looking through the rules, I see that NT3 can produce 't29', 't16', etc. Wait, but 't82' is derived from which non-terminal?\n\nLooking back, perhaps I missed a rule. Wait, looking at the rules for NT13: NT13 \u2192 't82'. So if NT13 can produce 't82', then the next token could be from NT13. But in the grammar, NT13 is a non-terminal that's only defined in one rule: NT13 \u2192 't82'. So to produce 't82', the grammar would need to have a production where a non-terminal produces 't82'. So, for example, if we have a production like NT13 \u2192 't82', but NT13 can't derive anything else, so 't82' comes from NT13.\n\nSo in the string, after 't12', the next is 't82', which could come from NT13, but NT13 \u2192 't82' is a production, so that's possible. But what about the context? Because NT12 \u2192 't12' is a production that doesn't require anything else. So after 't12', perhaps the next symbol comes from another production.\n\nWait, but the string is a concatenation of the terminals, so each part must be derived correctly. So after 't12', we have 't82'.\n\nSo to have 't82', it must come from a production where a non-terminal A expands to 't82'. Looking at all rules, the only production that directly gives 't82' is NT13 \u2192 't82'.\n\nWait, but then where does 't82' come from? Because in the grammar, NT13 \u2192 't82', so to produce 't82', we need a non-terminal that can expand to it. So for example, if a production is NTxxx \u2192 NT13 ... and then NT13 \u2192 't82', that would generate 't82'.\n\nBut in the string, after 't12', 't82' comes next. So perhaps the first step is to have S expand into a combination that includes NT12 (to get t12) and another non-terminal that can expand into t82.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S can produce NT12 NT12, or NT9 NT14, etc. So maybe the string starts with S \u2192 NT12 NT12, which gives 't12' and then something else.\n\nWait, let's consider the production S \u2192 NT12 NT12.\n\nSo S expands into NT12 and NT12. So the first part is NT12 \u2192 't12', giving us 't12' as the first symbol. Then, the second NT12 must expand into something else. Wait, but the second token is 't82', so maybe the second NT12 expands into 't82'? But wait, NT12 has a rule NT12 \u2192 't12', but does it also have a rule that allows it to produce other things, like NT17 NT8?\n\nWait, looking back, I don't see a production for NT12 that starts with anything other than 't12'. For example, do I have NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8? Let me check.\n\nYes, I see a production NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So NT12 can also expand into two non-terminals. So perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT12 NT12, and then the first NT12 goes to 't12', and the second NT12 goes to NT17 NT8. Then, NT17 and NT8 would need to expand further.\n\nBut wait, the string after the first 't12' is 't82', so perhaps NT17 and NT8 produce 't82' in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first NT12 goes to 't12', and the second NT12 goes through another production, say, NT12 \u2192 NT9 NT14, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

The grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, which means all production rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce NT12 NT16, or other combinations, but it's quite involved. My approach will be to check if each part of the string can be derived from the grammar. \n\nLet me list the terminals present in the string to see which non-terminals might correspond to them. For example, 't26' must come from a production of some non-terminal that eventually reduces to 't26'. I need to see which non-terminals have productions that produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that several non-terminals are directly producing terminals. For instance:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't53'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT16 \u2192 't70'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16' or 't29' or 't39' or 't43' or 't53' or 't65' or 't66' or 't61' or 't73' or 't77' or 't81' or 't82' or 't86' or 't91' or 't93' or 't95'\n\nWait, let me scan the rules again for each terminal. For example:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12' (rule: NT12 \u2192 't12')\n- NT16 \u2192 't70' (rule: NT16 \u2192 't70')\n- NT20 \u2192 't65', 't26', 't48' (there are multiple rules for NT20)\n- NT4 \u2192 't17', 't20', 't48', 't65' (several production rules)\n- NT5 \u2192 't39', 't66'\n- NT10 \u2192 't43' (two rules: NT10 \u2192 't43' and NT10 \u2192 't73'?)\nWait, looking again: the grammar has a rule NT10 \u2192 't43' and another NT10 \u2192 't73'. So NT10 can produce either of these.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me list each terminal and see which non-terminals can produce them:\n\n- 't26': NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- 't82': NT3, NT5, NT8, etc.\nWait, looking through the rules: NT3 can produce 't16', 't29', 't39', 't43', 't53', 't65', 't66', 't61', 't73', 't77', 't81', 't82', 't86', 't91', 't93', 't95'. So 't82' is an option for NT3.\n\nSimilarly, 't70' is a terminal for NT16, so NT16 \u2192 't70'.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't70' comes another 't82', so let's break down the string into individual tokens and see if each can be generated.\n\nLet me list the string as a list of tokens:\n\n['t26', 't82', 't70', 't82', 't70', 't82', 't53', 't65', 't73', 't40', 't12', 't82', 't73', 't65', 't73', 't66', 't40', 't65', 't73', 't61', 't65', 't65', 't82', 't53', 't12', 't48']\n\nHmm, that's quite a long string. Now, I'll go step by step.\n\n1. 't26': Must come from NT20, as NT20 can produce 't26'.\n2. Next, 't82': This can come from NT3 or any non-terminal that produces 't82'. From the grammar, NT3 is one option.\n3. 't70': This is a terminal from NT16.\n4. 't82': Again, from NT3 or another source.\n5. 't70': From NT16 again.\n6. 't82': Repeating.\n7. 't53': From NT9 or other non-terminals. Wait, NT9 can produce 't77', but others like NT5, NT10, etc., can produce 't53'? Looking back, I see that NT5 \u2192 't66' and 't39', not 't53'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again for NT5:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, there are several rules for NT5. For example, NT5 \u2192 't39' and NT5 \u2192 't66'. There's also a rule NT3 \u2192 't39'. So 't53' isn't directly listed as a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I missed that NT6 can produce 't53'?\n\nLooking through the rules for NT6: NT6 \u2192 't21', 't10', or other rules like NT6 \u2192 't3' and others. Wait, in the grammar, I see 'NT6 \u2192 't3' in a later rule. But wait, another rule: NT6 \u2192 't21'? Or perhaps I'm misparsing.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rule NT6 \u2192 't3' is not correct because earlier, I saw that NT6 has a rule like NT6 \u2192 't21 NT8', which might resolve to a single token. Alternatively, perhaps 't53' is produced by NT21? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT20 can produce 't53' in some rules. Let me find where 't53' is produced. For example, NT20 \u2192 't53'? Scanning the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, some rules produce 't53'? Looking back, I can see:\n\nLooking for 't53' in the end productions. I recall a rule like NT5 \u2192 't39' and 't66', and NT9 \u2192 't77'. It seems that 't53' is not directly produced by any terminal. Maybe it's produced by a non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps 't53' is a result of a longer derivation. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing 't53' with another terminal. Wait, let me check all the terminal productions in the grammar. Hmm, perhaps 't53' isn't a terminal, but rather a non-terminal. No, looking back, it seems that some non-terminals may produce multiple terminals, including 't26', 't82', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps 't53' is produced by a non-terminal, but I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given string contains 't53' and 't66', which are produced by non-terminals.\n\nWell, regardless, let's proceed step by step for the given string.\n\nGoing back to the string, after 't70' and the next 't70', then 't82', 't53'(1), 't65'(1), 't73'(1), etc. \n\nI think I'm complicating this. Perhaps a better approach is to consider the structure of the grammar and see if each token in the string can be derived. Alternatively, maybe the string is too long, but perhaps it's generated by certain rules.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: the first four tokens are 't26', 't82', 't70', 't82'. Let's see:\n\n- 't26' must come from NT20 \u2192 't26'.\n- After 't26', the next token is 't82', which could come from NT3 (if NT3 can produce 't82').\n- Then 't70' from NT16 \u2192 't70'.\n- Then 't82' again, perhaps from NT3 again.\n\nSo far, it's possible.\n\nBut let me check if NT3 can produce 't82' because looking at the grammar rules, some of the productions for NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-508","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is quite long, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because that means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the top-level productions for S. They are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo the string starts with S, which is a combination of two NTs. The first character in the string is 't26', which corresponds to which production? Looking at the NT productions, I see that NT12 is 't12', NT7 is 't7', and so on. Wait, actually, some of the NTs have terminal strings. For example, NT12 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't65', etc.\n\nSo let's map the string to the NT symbols. The string is:\n\nt26 t65 t70 t48 t66 t82 t82 t19 t48 t65 t65 t40 t39 t65 t66 t65 t43 t73 t65 t53 t26 t82 t73 t40 t40 t65 t40\n\nLet me break this down into how each part could fit into the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't26'. Which NT produces 't26'? Checking the NT21 productions, I see NT21 -> NT6 NT6, and looking down, there's NT21 -> 't82' and also -> 't26'. Wait, no, checking the list:\n\nLooking through the NTs, under NT21, there's a production: NT21 -> 't26'. So 't26' is derived from NT21.\n\nSo the first part is NT21 t26. Now, I need to see how NT21 is produced. Looking through the grammar, NT21 has several productions. I see:\n\nNT21 -> NT17 NT5\nNT21 -> NT17 NT3\nNT21 -> NT8 NT13\nNT21 -> NT6 NT6\nSo it can be production 6, which is 't26' directly.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT21 -> 't26' is only one of its productions. So to derive 't26', NT21 can be replaced with 't26'.\n\nBut wait, no. Looking at the last block of NT productions, I see:\n\nNT21 -> 't26' is listed, but also other possible productions. So 't26' is produced by NT21, so the first step is to take NT21 and replace it with 't26'.\n\nSo we have the string t26.\n\nNow, the string after t26 is t65 t70 t48 t66 t82 t82 t19 t48 t65 t65 t40 t39 t65 t66 t65 t43 t73 t65 t53 t26 t82 t73 t40 t40 t65 t40.\n\nWait, but the grammar doesn't have an S -> t26, it only has S producing combinations of NTs. So S must start with NT21 because the first part of S is NT12 NT12, which would require t12 t12, but the string starts with t26, so that's not possible. Therefore, the initial production must be S -> NT21 NT5, NT21 NT3, etc.\n\nWait, looking again, the NT21 production can produce t26, so if S starts with NT21, which can be replaced with t26, then the rest of the string should match the rest of NT21's expansion.\n\nBut S is followed by another NT, so the production would be S -> NT21 NT21, but in the string, after t26, I have t65. So perhaps wait, perhaps the production for S is S -> NT21 NT5, but then the rest would have to match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nWait, the first symbol is 't26', which is from NT21. So perhaps the first production is S -> NT21 NT5. Then, NT21 is 't26' and NT5 produces something.\n\nLooking at the other parts of the string after 't26' is 't65', which would be produced by which NT? Let's see. The NT5 can produce several things. Looking at the NT5 productions:\n\nNT5 -> NT13 NT7\nNT5 -> NT3 NT20\nNT5 -> NT17 NT2\nNT5 -> NT15 NT14\nNT5 -> NT13 NT7 (again)\nNT5 -> NT15 NT0\nNT5 -> NT20 NT4\nNT5 -> NT17 NT4\nNT5 -> NT21 NT8\nNT5 -> NT6 NT6\nSo, the second symbol is 't65', which comes from NT21 again because NT21 -> 't26' and also can be directly 't21'? Wait, no. I see in the NT21 part:\n\nNT21 can produce 't26' and other NT combinations. Wait, in the last block, I see:\n\nNT21 -> 't26'\nNT21 also has:\nNT21 -> NT17 NT5\nNT21 -> NT17 NT3\nNT21 -> NT8 NT13\nNT21 -> NT6 NT6\nNT21 -> NT8 NT13\nNT21 -> NT7 NT5 (earlier, under NT17)\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, the string starts with t26, which is directly from NT21, so the first step is S -> NT21 NT5. Then, NT21 is replaced by 't26', and NT5 is replaced by its production.\n\nSo the NT5 production after 't26' is 't65', which is the second symbol. So what produces 't65'? Looking through the NTs:\n\nNT7 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> several things, including 't77'\nNT12 -> 't12'\nNT16 -> 't65'\nNT21 -> 't65'\nNT20 -> 't65' and 't43', 't73', 't82', etc.\n\nWait, 't65' is produced by NT16 and NT21, I believe. So looking at the NT6 production: NT6 can produce several things, including NT21, but in the last block, I see:\n\nLooking for NT5:\n\nWait, in the 'NT5' section, does it produce t65? Looking through, I don't see NT5 directly producing t65. But looking at NT20, which is part of the grammar, under NT20:\n\nNT20 -> NT10 NT3\nNT20 -> NT21 NT4\nNT20 -> NT14 NT21\nNT20 -> NT7 NT20\nNT20 -> NT19 NT19\nNT20 -> NT7 NT22 (but no, wait, in the earlier part, NT7 is connected to others)\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string using the grammar. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t26 t65 t70... So maybe the first NT21 (t26) is followed by another NT that starts with t65. Looking through the grammar, what's after NT21 in S's production? S can be NT21 NT5, which would be t26 followed by something. So the second symbol is t65. So NT5 must produce something that starts with t65.\n\nLooking for NT5 productions that produce t65. From the grammar, I don't see NT5 directly producing t65. Hmm. Let me check each NT5 production.\n\n1. NT5-> NT13 NT7: produces NT13 and NT7, which could eventually produce 't13' and 't7's, but that's not 't65'.\n2. NT5-> NT3 NT20: 't3' and 't20's, but 't20' is possible, but not t65.\n3. NT5-> NT17 NT2: 't17' and 't2's, no.\n4. NT5-> NT15 NT14: 't15' and 't14's, no.\n5. NT5-> NT13 NT7: same as first.\n6. NT5-> NT15 NT0: 't15' and 't0's.\n7.

Hmm, so perhaps I missed that t19 comes from another production. Wait, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT1: NT17, and also NT19? Wait, maybe it's NT17 that produces 't61' because NT17 -> NT6 NT20, and then each of those can produce further things. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that specific term.\n\nWait, perhaps the production NT17 -> 't61' is not present. Let me re-examine the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT17's productions:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT7 NT12 (is this correct? Or are there other productions?)\n\nWait, the initial grammar seems extensive. Let me list the relevant productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39' and NT5 \u2192 't66' (duplicate)\n- NT10 \u2192 't43', 't40', 't16'\n- NT12 \u2192 't12', 't82' (as in S -> NT12 NT12 producing two t12 or via other rules)\nWait, the production for NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. NT17 can produce 't61'? Or is it that NT12 has a production 't29' or something else?\n\nWait, I might be making a mistake. Let me look at each non-terminal and their productions, focusing on those that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't16' and NT13 \u2192 't82', NT5 \u2192 't39' and 't66', NT10 \u2192 't43', 't40', 't16', NT12 \u2192 't12', 't82', NT16 \u2192 't70', NT3 \u2192 't29', NT0 \u2192 't40', NT20 \u2192 't65' and 't40', NT8 \u2192 't48', NT15 \u2192 't82', NT7 \u2192 't77', etc.\n\nWait, actually, many non-terminals have a mix of rules where some are to other non-terminals and some are to terminals.\n\nI think a better approach is to start by looking at the string and try to break it down into the production rules that could generate it.\n\nThe string is a series of terminals: t16 t82 t43 t40 t19 t53 t29 t65 t53 t70 t40 t65 t53 t65 t73 t17 t19 t40 t53 t82 t40 t70 t65 t17 t40 t65 t40.\n\nHmm, this is a long string. Let me count the tokens:\n\nt16 (1), t82 (2), t43 (3), t40 (4), t19 (5), t53 (6), t29 (7), t65 (8), t53 (9), t70 (10), t40 (11), t65 (12), t53 (13), t65 (14), t73 (15), t17 (16), t19 (17), t40 (18), t53 (19), t82 (20), t40 (21), t70 (22), t65 (23), t17 (24), t40 (25), t65 (26), t40 (27). So 27 tokens in total.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each token in the string corresponds to a production of a non-terminal to a terminal (if it's a terminal rule) or to two non-terminals otherwise.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation will be a leftmost derivation with steps corresponding to the length of the string minus 1. So, 27 tokens would require 26 production steps.\n\nLet me try to map the string step by step.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for the presence of each terminal in the production rules and see how they can be generated.\n\nFor example, starting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12. So S is producing two NT12s. Let's look at NT12's productions:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8 or NT12 \u2192 't82'.\n\nWait, from the initial grammar, I see NT12 has two types of productions: one is NT17 NT8, the other is a terminal? Or wait, in the initial grammar, some NTs have direct terminal productions.\n\nWait, in the initial list, under NT12, the productions are:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\n\nand\n\nNT12 -> NT8 -> t48? Or wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, let me recheck the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n\nAnd:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 t48?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. NT8 is another non-terminal. Let me see NT8's productions. From the given grammar, NT8 has multiple productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT13 \u2192 't82', NT5 \u2192 't66', etc., but specifically for NT8, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT2 \u2192 t something?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine for each terminal in the string what non-terminal can produce it.

{"custom_id":"request-523","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: `t73 t65 t82 t19 t48 t82 t40 t65 t43 t65 t65 t82 t82 t19 t40 t70 t17 t70 t82 t40 t65 t53 t17 t40 t40 t12 t65 t40`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a CNF grammar, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except the start symbol S which can go to other non-terminals. The terminals in the grammar are those tokens that appear in the productions, such as 't73', 't65', etc.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't73', which must correspond to NT10. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT10 has a production rule: NT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8. So, the first step is to replace 't73' with NT10, which splits into NT16 NT8.\n\nNext, I process each of these non-terminals. NT16 has the production NT16 \u2192 NT16 NT4, which means it's recursive. So, I replace NT16 with NT16 NT4, resulting in NT16 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7. Again, recursive. So, replacing NT4 with NT4 NT7 gives NT16 NT4 NT7 NT8.\n\nNT7 has the production NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT12 and also NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT0. The former is recursive, so I can replace NT7 with NT7 NT12, making it NT16 NT4 NT7 NT12 NT8.\n\nContinuing this line, I can keep expanding recursively, but this seems cumbersome. Maybe there's a better way. I should consider the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the non-terminals' productions.\n\nLooking at the entire string, perhaps I can split it into the components that match the right-hand sides of the main start rule, which is S \u2192 NT12 NT14 or S \u2192 NT9 NT12 or S \u2192 NT9 NT12 again. Wait, no, the start symbol S can be replaced by any of the rules, so the entire string must be covered by a combination of these rules.\n\nWait, looking more carefully: the start rules for S are S \u2192 NT12 NT14, S \u2192 NT9 NT12, and another possibility. Wait, no, looking again, the start rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT14\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12 again? Wait, no, looking again, the initial rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT14\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12 (wait, no, I think I'm misreading it. Let me check the initial grammar:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n```Grammar: \nS -> NT12 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\nS -> NT9 NT12\n```\n\nWait, that's a typo. It's the same rule twice. So, S \u2192 NT12 NT14 or S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must consist of two parts, each part generated by NT12 NT14 or NT9 NT12.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. I need to find a way to split this string into two parts, each of which can be generated by the productions of NT12 NT14 or NT9 NT12.\n\nBut given the length of the string, it's 32 elements long. So splitting into two parts each around 16 elements might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be generated by a single S rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the production rules that lead to the first element 't73'.\n\nWait, earlier I saw that 't73' is NT10, which goes to NT16 NT8. Then NT16 \u2192 NT16 NT4, and NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7, etc. But this seems to get into a chain of recursive rules that could lead to a lot of 't's.\n\nLooking back at the string, after 't73' comes 't65', which is NT10 again, because NT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8, and the second part is 't65' which is NT10 again? Wait, no, the productions don't have 't10' as a terminal; 't10' isn't in the right-hand sides of any terminals. Wait, the string has 't73', 't65', etc., but wait the grammar's terminals are 't73', 't65', 't82', 't19', etc., as I saw earlier.\n\nWait, the grammar's terminals are in the productions. So for example, NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5; but the string only has terminals, so where do the NTs go? Wait no, the string is entirely in terminals. That can't be because the grammar only has certain terminals. Looking back, the grammar has some rules like NT3 \u2192 't16', NT5 \u2192 't39', etc. So, if the string has 't73', that must correspond to one of the NT rules.\n\nBut in the provided grammar, for example, NT10 \u2192 't53', NT4 \u2192 't65', NT9 \u2192 't77', etc. Wait, in the initial problem, the grammar is provided in a tabular format, but it's easy to get lost. Let me list out all terminal usages:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, the terminals used are:\n\n't73', 't65', 't82', 't19', 't48', 't40', 't65', 't43', 't65', 't44', 't65', 't82', 't82', 't19', 't40', 't70', 't17', 't70', 't82', 't40', 't65', 't53', 't17', 't40', 't40', 't12', 't65', 't40'.\n\nSo each of these corresponds to a specific NT production.\n\nFor example:\n\nt73 is NT10\n\nt65 is NT4\n\nt82 is NT13, NT16, etc.\n\nt19 is NT14\n\nt48 is NT12 \u2192 't12' ?\n\nWait, in the grammar,\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12' \n\nBut looking at the rules, the grammar says:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nSo 't12' is NT12.\n\nSimilarly, the string contains 't12' at the end.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of various terminals. The question is: can this entire sequence be generated by the given CFG?\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals. So the derivations will expand non-terminals into smaller non-terminals until reaching terminals.\n\nGiven the string's length, it's perhaps feasible to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me try to see the overall structure:\n\nThe string has 32 terminals. Since each application of a rule splits a non-terminal into two, the derivation tree will have a certain structure. The total number of steps is related to the number of symbols, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated by the grammar starting with S and applying the productions step by step.\n\nLet me try to map the string into the grammar.\n\nFirst, S can be either NT12 NT14 or NT9 NT12.\n\nSo, the entire string must be a combination of these two.\n\nLooking at the string, if we split it into two parts, each part must be generated by NT12 NT14 or NT9 NT12.\n\nBut to know which, let's see.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nBut perhaps looking for the root symbol S:\n\nS can be S \u2192 NT12 NT14 or S \u2192 NT9 NT12.\n\nSo, the entire string is a concatenation of the expansions of NT12 and NT14, or NT9 and NT12.\n\nLet's check the string for whether it can be split into two parts, each matching the expansion of NT12 NT14 or NT9 NT12.\n\nThe string is [t73, t65, t82, t19, t48, t82, t40, t65, t43, t65, t65, t82, t82, t19, t40, t70, t17, t70, t82, t40, t65,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t40 t40 t16 t19 t40 t82 t43 t26 t48 t53 t26 t43 t40 t82 t82 t53 t40 t82 t43 t65 t65 t65 t53 t65 t40 t82 t43 t95`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The grammar rules are quite extensive, so I'll need to map them to the tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several rules where terminals (like 't40', 't16', etc.) appear on the right-hand side. These are the places where the string can be broken down. For example, I see that S can produce NT12 NT8, which in the string translates to t12 and t8. Wait, but looking at the string, the first two tokens are t40 and t40, which don't match t12 or t8. Hmm, maybe I need to check other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the start symbol S and see if it can derive the given string through some sequence of productions. The S symbol has several productions, like S -> NT12 NT8, S -> NT7 NT14, S -> NT9 NT12, etc. None of these produce t40 directly. So maybe S is part of a longer derivation.\n\nLooking deeper, I notice that several non-terminals are replaced by a string of terminals. For example, NT12 -> NT17 NT8, but NT17 and NT8 in the grammar are replaced by more terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see that some of these terminals are not in the string, so I'm probably not considering all the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map all the terminal symbols in the grammar to their corresponding strings. Let me list them:\n- NT12 -> t12\n- NT14 -> t43\n- NT8 -> t48\n- NT4 -> t17\nBut wait, in the string, I have t40, t16, etc. So maybe some non-terminals produce combinations of these terminals.\n\nWait, let's try to parse the string step by step. The string is a sequence of terms, each being a terminal (like t40, t16), and the grammar has production rules that can generate these sequences.\n\nLet's take the first token, t40. Looking at the grammar, which production rules result in t40? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT20 could produce t26 and t43, but not t40. Hmm, maybe it's part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree. Alternatively, since this is time-consuming, maybe I can check the sequence in parts.\n\nLooking at the string, the first three tokens are t40, t40, t16. Maybe these are part of a production chain. Let's see if S can split into something that generates these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of several NT productions. For example, each NT symbol can expand into a sequence of terminals. Let's see.\n\nBut this might get too complex. An alternative approach is to use the CYK algorithm for context-free grammars, as it's designed to parse such strings. However, given the complexity of the grammar, it might be easier to simplify.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the entire string is a concatenation of several known sequences from the grammar. For example, looking at the rules where terminals appear:\n\n- NT12 -> t12 (from grammar: NT12 -> NT17 NT8; NT17 -> NT13 NT4, NT13 -> NT12 NT19, etc., leading to terminal t12)\n- Similarly, NT14 could generate t43\n- NT8 could generate t48\n- NT4 -> t17\n- NT5 -> t39\nWait, but the string has t40, which I don't see in the grammar. Hmm, that's an issue. Did I miss a rule that leads to t40?\n\nLooking through the grammar: Wait, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t40 as a terminal. All rules with a terminal seem to produce specific other terms. For example, NT12 -> t12, NT14 -> t43, etc. So maybe t40 is part of a longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps the string includes t40 multiple times, and each occurrence is generated by a different rule. So let's list all the t40s in the string: positions 1, 2, 4, 12, 20, 22. That's seven times t40.\n\nIf t40 isn't a terminal, but comes from a non-terminal, I need to find a rule where a non-terminal produces t40 as part of a derivation. But looking at the grammar, none of the NT rules directly produce t40. Therefore, t40 must be derived through a series of steps from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar. No, I don't see any NT that directly produces t40. So perhaps the t40 in the string is a typo, but assuming it's correct, perhaps the grammar hasn't been provided properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar's NT20 could eventually produce t40 through a chain. Let's see: NT20 -> NT10 NT3 (grammar rule: NT20 -> NT10 NT3). Then, NT10 -> NT14 NT8. Wait, no, actually the rule is NT10 -> NT16 NT8. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT10's rules: For example, NT10 -> NT16 NT8, NT10 -> 't43'. Wait, in the string, t43 appears as tokens 6 and 20.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Since the grammar doesn't have any directly producing t40, it's unclear how t40 can be generated. Therefore, the string might contain a term that the grammar can't produce, leading to the conclusion that the string is not in the language.\n<\/think>\n\nLooking at the string and the grammar rules, none of the terminal symbols in the string (like 't40', 't16') are directly generated by the provided grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-545","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a series of tokens: \"t65 t82 t73 t40 t40 t40 t82 t43 t26 t40 t82 t73 t65 t40 t65 t43 t65 t53 t16 t19 t40 t12 t17 t26 t82 t73 t61 t65 t26\". \n\nFirst, I remember that when a grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That means every production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that some rules seem a bit off. For example, I see rules like S -> NT12 NT8, which is fine because it's two non-terminals. But then there are rules that immediately produce terminals, like S -> something with 't'. Wait, no, S is the start symbol and S itself isn't a terminal, so S would start the derivation. Hmm, perhaps I need to parse the string starting from S.\n\nWait, actually, the start symbol in a CFG is S, so any derivation starts with S. So the string provided is a series of terminals, and I need to see if the entire string can be generated by S through a series of productions.\n\nOne approach is to parse the string top-down, trying to match it against the non-terminals and terminals in the grammar. Alternatively, bottom-up parsing or using the CYK algorithm could work, but since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser might be efficient.\n\nAnother point: the grammar's productions are in CNF, but when I look at some of the rules, they produce multiple terminals in a single step, which isn't allowed in strict CNF. Wait, no\u2014strict CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals, not terminals. So the grammar might have a problem because some rules have mixed terminals and non-terminals. Or maybe the way they're written, each production is strictly replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, looking again: The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT12 NT8, which is two non-terminals. Then S \u2192 NT7 NT14, etc. But other rules like NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8: NT17 and NT8. Are they non-terminals or terminals? If NT8 is a terminal, then that production would allow a terminal in the expansion, which is allowed in many cases. But in CNF, I think each production must have exactly two non-terminals or a terminals. Wait, no\u2014some sources say that in CNF, productions can have two non-terminals, but during the parsing process, each production can have two symbols (non-term or terminal) as output.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, I'm seeing some productions that seem to have more than two symbols on the right side, which would not be in CNF. For example, looking at the given grammar lines:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8: okay, two non-terminals.\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20: two non-terminals.\n- NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT3: two non-terminals.\n- NT10 \u2192 NT16 NT8: two non-terminals.\n- Wait, but then I see NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7. Oh, that's weird because that would be A \u2192 A A, which could cause infinite recursion, but that's allowed in CFGs, just not in Chomsky Normal Form, as it's strictly A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So the grammar isn't in strict CNF because it has productions where a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, but some of the non-terminals might still be producing more than that in a single step.\n\nWait, no. Looking again, each production seems to be replacing a non-terminal with two symbols that are either non-terminals or terminals. So as long as they don't have more than two symbols, it's okay. So maybe the grammar is in CNF, but with some rules that have terminals on the right side.\n\nBut regardless, I need to process the string \"t65 t82 t73 t40 ...\" and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nSo, let me think about how to approach this. One way is to parse the string from the beginning, trying to match the leftmost non-terminal and apply the appropriate production.\n\nLet's start by trying to parse the first token, which is t65. So I need to see which non-terminals can produce t65. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't65' (as per the last line: NT4 -> 't65')\n- NT9 \u2192 't77' (but that's t77, so not helpful)\n- NS6 \u2192 't65'? No, wait, NT6 \u2192 something like NT0, which then might produce t65? Let's see: looking through the grammar, there's a production NT4 -> 't65', and NT10 -> 't43', NT12 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't70', etc. So NT4 is a non-terminal that can produce 't65' directly.\n\nSo starting the parse, the first symbol is 't65', which must come from a production of NT4, which is S \u2192 NT12 NT8, but wait, S is the start symbol, so the first step is to expand S into two non-terminals, say NT12 and NT8. Then each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire string as a single symbol sequence and see if I can split it into substrings that match the productions.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to break down the string into tokens and see if they can be produced by the non-terminals starting from S.\n\nThe string is: t65 t82 t73 t40 t40 t40 t82 t43 t26 t40 t82 t73 t65 t40 t65 t43 t65 t53 t16 t19 t40 t12 t17 t26 t82 t73 t61 t65 t26.\n\nI notice that t65 appears multiple times, t82 is also frequent, and some like t40 are common in several rules.\n\nLet me try to see where t65 can come from. Looking at the grammar, NT4 \u2192 't65', so that's one way. Also, NT20 \u2192 't65' (since NT20 \u2192 't65'), and NT30? Wait, looking through the grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 't65' (as per the line NT20 -> 't65'), and also NT10 \u2192 't43', etc.\n\nWait, looking back, here are some key points:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't65' (so can produce t65)\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39', 't66', etc.\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT17 \u2192 might produce t17, but not directly matching any terminals.\n\nSo, the first token is t65. So the first non-terminal could be NT20 or NT4. Let's assume it's NT4, but wait, in the grammar, NT4 \u2192 't65', which is a single terminal. So if the first token is t65, the parser would look for a production that directly outputs t65, which is either NT4 or NT20, but in the grammar, NT4 and NT20 both have rules that produce t65.\n\nSo, perhaps starting with S \u2192 NT12 NT8, then each of these can be expanded.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach: build a parsing table or look for reductions. Alternatively, think of the entire string and break it into possible units.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps it's structured in a way that certain non-terminals correspond to specific sequences.\n\nFor example, looking at the production NT20 -> 't65', so any occurrence of 't65' is from NT20. Similarly, t82 comes from NT8 -> 't82'? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't82' (as per line NT8 -> 't82'), so t82 can come from NT8.\n\nWait, but earlier in the grammar, I saw that NT8 was also in a production that goes to NT4 NT20, which is two non-terminals. So maybe the initial 't65' is from NT4, followed by a 't82' from NT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-541","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is made up of a lot of \"t\" terms followed by numbers, like \"t82 t43...\" and so on. \n\nFirst off, I need to understand the grammar. It's given in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S. Looking at the productions, S can be replaced by various combinations of NT and NT things. For example, S can become NT12 NT12, or NT7 NT14, and so on. \n\nLooking at the terminals, I see that some of the non-terminals are replaced by these \"t\" terms. For example, some production rules have \"t\" followed by a number, like \"t82\", \"t43\", etc. These are terminal symbols, so the grammar can generate strings composed of these terminals.\n\nMy string is: t82 t43 t43 t66 t17 t40 t40 t65 t82 t66 t65 t82 t73 t40 t65 t82 t26 t82 t65 t26 t73 t17 t40 t65 t26 t53 t40 t82 t40.\n\nThat's 31 tokens. Each token is a terminal symbol, so I need to see if these can be generated by the grammar through a series of productions, starting from S.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step in the derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So each derivation step increases the number of symbols by one. The initial string (with only S) has 1 symbol, so after n steps, the number of symbols is 1 + n.\n\nGiven that the string has 31 symbols, the derivation must have taken 30 steps starting from S. That seems possible, but I'm not sure. I'll have to check the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly replace into \"t\" terms, which are terminals. For example, NT3 can be 't16', 't29', etc. Similarly, NT4 can be 't17', 't65', 't66', etc.\n\nThe string starts with t82, so I need to see if t82 is a terminal produced directly by some non-terminal. Looking through the productions, I see NT3 -> 't16', 't29', 't39', etc. But none of them produce t82. Wait, looking closer, I do see NT3 -> 't16', but that's not 82. Hmm, actually, looking at the last part of the grammar, I see some rules where NT15 -> 't82', and NT7 -> 't77', etc. So t82 is indeed a terminal symbol that can be produced by certain non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check: in the grammar, I see NT15 -> 't82', so yes, that's one way t82 is generated. Also, NT8 can produce t82? Let me check the rules. OH, in the grammar, one of the rules is NT8 -> 't48', but another rule is NT15 -> 't82', which is a production. So yes, t82 can be generated by NT15.\n\nSo the start symbol S is a non-terminal. Let's see the productions for S: S -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, S -> NT9 NT12.\n\nSo to get to the string, S must be expanded into something that then leads to t82, t43, etc.\n\nSo let's start constructing a possible derivation. Since the first symbol is t82, which comes from NT15, I need to see how S can lead to NT15 or something that leads to NT15.\n\nWait, let me check: the S productions are NT combinations. So S can go to NT12*2 or NT7*NT14, etc. So to get a t82 at the end, maybe the last production involves NT15, but I need to see how the string leads to that.\n\nThis might get complicated, but perhaps it's easier to work backwards. Using the method of phrase structure trees or looking for possible sub-strings that can be generated by single productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t82 t43 t43 t66. Let's see if any of the grammar rules produce these sequences. For instance, does any rule produce t82 followed by something? Or maybe t43 followed by t43?\n\nLooking for a production rule that starts with t82. Hmm, I don't see any, because in the productions, the left-hand side is non-terminals, and the right-hand side are combinations of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the entire string as a sequence that can be built by replacements. Each \"t\" symbol must come from a production where the non-terminal on the left becomes that terminal.\n\nSo, the string starts with t82, t43, t43, t66. Let's think about what could produce t82. Looking at the grammar, NT15 -> 't82', so that would be a production of NT15. So to get t82, the corresponding non-terminal must be NT15.\n\nSimilarly, the next two symbols are t43 and t43. So what non-terminals produce t43? Looking at the grammar, NT7 -> 't77', NT4 -> 't17', 't65', etc., but where does t43 come from? Wait, in the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that directly produces t43. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't12' (probably a terminator)\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16', 't29', 't53', 't81'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT19 -> 't1', but wait, that's a non-terminal, so it's not a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, many non-terminals are defined with two non-terminals on the right-hand side, meaning they will eventually be replaced step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT17 -> NT11 NT12, among others. The NT15 rules include NT15 -> NT21 NT8 and NT15 -> 't82'. Oh, so NT15 can produce 't82', which is t82. Similarly, NT15 can be replaced by NT21 NT8. So perhaps to generate 't82', the NT15 is used.\n\nSimilarly, for the first symbol, S must derive a sequence that eventually produces t82. So perhaps S -> NT12 NT12, but what does NT12 produce?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT12 has the rule NT12 -> NT17 NT8. NT17 has rules like NT17 -> NT11 NT12, NT17 -> NT7 NT16, etc. So NT12 eventually can branch into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe another approach is to see what the string is made up of and see if it can be divided into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t82 followed by two t43s, which would require that these t43s come from somewhere in the grammar. Maybe t43 comes from NT4 or NT19 or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check again the grammar. NT4 has rules like NT4 -> NT11 NT20, but none of these directly produce t43. NT20 -> 't26', 't82', etc. Wait, I don't see a production that creates t43. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the terminal list at the end of the grammar, I see:\n\nt82, t43, t43, etc. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t43.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT where rhs is 't43 NT...' or 'NT...' -> 't43'. So that might be a problem. So if the grammar doesn't have any non-terminal that can produce t43 as a terminal, then the string containing 't43' cannot be generated.\n\nWait, then the string has t43, which would mean it's a terminal, so somewhere there must be a production where a non-terminal is replaced by 't43'. But looking through the grammar's terminal replacements, I don't see any.

{"custom_id":"request-561","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is a long sequence of symbols ending with t95. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It looks pretty complex with many rules, but I notice some terminals and non-terminals. The starting symbol is S, and all the rules on the left side of \"->\" are non-terminals. The right side has other non-terminals and terminals. The terminals seem to be the 't' strings followed by numbers, like t95, t40, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t12 t40 t40 t40 t65 t43 t65 t40 t61 t65 t40 t66 t48 t43 t65 t70 t48 t95 t40 t40 t40 t40 t65 t53 t40 t70 t17 t40 t65 t40`.\n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar's production rules for each non-terminal to see which ones produce the string. Sometimes, it's helpful to try to find the leftmost derivation or the rightmost derivation.\n\nFirst, the starting symbol S can produce:\n1. NT12 NT8\n2. NT7 NT14\n3. NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these NTs have their own productions. Let's see if any of these can lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t12. Now, I check which NTs can produce a t12. For example, looking at NT12's productions, one of them is `NT12 -> NT19 NT8`. But wait, in the string, after t12, we have t40, t40, t40, t65, etc. That might not directly match, so maybe another NT is needed.\n\nWait, another rule I notice is `NT12 -> 't12'`. So directly, NT12 can produce 't12'. That's useful because the string starts with t12. So, starting with S -> NT12 NT8, and NT12 produces t12.\n\nNow the other part is NT8. Looking at NT8's productions, one is `NT8 -> 't48'`. But in the string, after t12, we have t40. That doesn't directly match, so maybe we need to look deeper.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar more carefully. Oh, wait, there's a production `NT8 -> NT4 NT20`, and NT4 can produce t44? Wait, no, looking at NT4's rules. Hmm, wait, I see NT4 has a rule `NT4 -> 't17'`, but I also see `NT4 -> NT11 NT20` and `NT4 -> NT16 NT7` and so on. Maybe I can trace this further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find a path from S down to t12 and then see how to get from t12 onwards.\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT12 NT8, which becomes t12 (from NT12) and then NT8's production. Let's see what NT8 can do. NT8 has a production `NT8 -> 't48'` and others like `NT8 -> NT4 NT20` and `NT8 -> NT15 NT19`. But in the string, after t12 comes t40, not t48. So perhaps the direct production isn't the way. Maybe I need to expand further.\n\nWait, so perhaps NT8 can produce a longer sequence. Let me see: NT8 can produce NT4 NT20, but then NT4 can have multiple production paths. Let me look at NT4: It can produce NT17 NT2, or NT11 NT20, or NT7 NT2, or even NT4 NT4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can see if the string can be built by using certain rules recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire derivation step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t12, which is produced directly by NT12. So, S -> NT12 NT8.\n\nNow, after t12, we have t40, t40, t40, t65, etc. So, the next part is 't40', but NT8 currently has a direct t48, but that's not t40. So, maybe NT8 needs to be expanded further.\n\nWait, let me double-check NT8's productions. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT20\n- NT8 -> NT15 NT19\n\nIn the string, the second symbol is t40, but none of the immediate productions of NT8 produce t40. Wait, maybe in the expansion chain, some non-terminal will produce t40.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the order. Wait, maybe I should consider the string as a sequence after 't12', but that's followed by t40. Hmm. So perhaps 't12' is the first symbol, then 't40' comes from another part of the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for the non-terminals that can produce 't40'. Let's look through the entire grammar to find which non-terminals have 't40' in their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT4:\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT4 -> NT11 NT20\n- NT4 -> NT16 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT2 -> NT11 NT17\nWait, no t40 there. What about NT5? NT5 has `-> 't39'` and other productions, no 't40'. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking further, perhaps NT17: `-> NT7 NT12` and other rules. Maybe NT7 can produce t7, or some other NT can produce t40.\n\nWait, perhaps I should search for any NTs that can produce 't40'. Let me check NT1: no, looks like NT17 might be involved because its production includes t40. Wait, looking at NT17's rules, I see `-> NT11 NT12` which might not. Alternatively, NT17 -> 't61' which is not 40.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I can see that 't40' is a common symbol in the string, appearing multiple times. Let me see what produces 't40' in the grammar.\n\nLooking back, I see that NT12 may not directly, but NT8's production includes 't40'?\n\nWait, no, NT8 is 't48' or products leading to it. Wait, but maybe the non-terminals that lead to 't40' are somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, it's clear that each non-terminal is defined in terms of other non-terminals and sometimes directly as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's time-consuming, but maybe I can model the parse trees.\n\nStarting with S: S can go to NT12 NT8. Let's assume S -> NT12 NT8.\n\nThen NT12 -> 't12', so that's the first symbol.\n\nNow, the next symbol must be the expansion of NT8. NT8 can be 't48' or expand into NT4 NT20, or NT15 NT19.\n\nLooking at the string, after t12 is t40. So, if NT8 directly is 't48', that won't work. Therefore, it must expand. So, NT8 must be expanded into NT4 NT20 or NT15 NT19.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: it has rules leading to 't17', 't11', etc., but no 't40'. Looking at NT20's production: `->'t10','t3'?` Wait, looking back, NT20:\n\nFrom the grammar: `-> NT10 NT3`\n\nWait, looking back, I think there's a `NT20 -> 't10','t3'` but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, in the grammar, looking back, I see:\n\nNT20 -> 't10','t3'\n\nWait, no, according to the grammar at the beginning:\n\nLooking back at the grammar provided, I see several NT20 productions.\n\nYes, for example:\n\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT20 -> 't10','t3'\n- NT20 -> 't70'\nWait, let me check the exact list. I see:\n\n\"NT20 -> 't10','t3'\"\n\"NT15 -> 't82'\"\n\"NT20 -> 't70'\"\n\"NT16 -> 't70'\"\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, so NT20 can produce 't10', 't3', or 't70'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-560","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the productions seem to fit this form.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t39 t40 t17 t26 t61 t81 t73 t65 t82 t53 t65 t82 t73 t40 t40 t40 t65 t73 t40 t40 t40 t40 t65 t43 t17 t48 t65 t73 t26 t40`.\n\nI'll need to break this string down into the constituent non-terminals and see if there's a way to derive it using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The string only contains terminals, so every step in the derivation must eventually replace non-terminals with terminals.\n\nLet me map out the terminals in the string and see how they might correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nStarting with the first few symbols: t39, t40, t17, t26, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar's productions, many terminals correspond to specific non-terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't39', NT4 \u2192 't65', NT5 \u2192 't53', etc. So, if we can find a path where each terminal in the string is matched by a production from the grammar, that would indicate the string is generated.\n\nWait, but each production in CNF can only derive two non-terminals at a time. However, since the string is a sequence of terminals, I might need to see how they can be generated step by step.\n\nLet me try to see if the first few symbols can come from a single production. The first symbol is t39, which comes from NT3. So, perhaps we need to see if there's a way to derive t39 in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 can produce 't39' directly. So in the derivation tree, the root (top-level non-terminal) might produce NT3, which then becomes t39. But the string is much longer, so the root must produce multiple NTs.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S. Let's look at the productions for S:\n\nS can produce:\n- NT12 NT12\n- NT7 NT14\n- NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these would produce two non-terminals, which then need to be expanded further until we get a terminal string.\n\nSo the string starts with t39, which is from NT3. So the first part of the string must come from an NT that eventually becomes t39. Let's see where NT3 is defined.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 has multiple productions. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14, but also other terminals. Wait, in the grammar, NT3 can directly produce 't39', so that's possible. But to get t39 as the first symbol, perhaps the entire string starts with a production that eventually leads to t39.\n\nWait, let's consider that the entire string is generated by a single S \u2192 NT... production. Let's check each S production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12: Each NT12 is replaced with two non-terminals. Let's see what NT12 produces. NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. Each of these can produce more non-terminals until we hit terminals. Let's track:\n\nNT17 can produce NT8 NT10 or NT5 NT20. NT8 can produce 't48', which is a terminal. NT10 is 't43'. But how does that fit with the string starting with t39?\n\nHmm, perhaps another S production. Let's try S \u2192 NT9 NT12. NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT16. NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT21. NT3 \u2192 't39'. That would give us t39 early on. Let's see how this plays out.\n\nWait, the string starts with t39, which is from NT3. If S produces NT9 NT12, and NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT16, then NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT21, which is NT3 (t39) and NT21. Then NT21 can produce, for example, NT8 NT13 or NT17 NT5, etc.\n\nBut let me map the entire string into a possible derivation tree. The string is 30 symbols long, so it's a bit complex, but let's try to break it down.\n\nThe first symbol is t39, which could come from NT3. So the root S must produce something that eventually becomes NT3 somewhere in the expansion.\n\nLooking at the S productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT12: So each NT12 would produce a sequence ending with terminals. If both NT12s eventually produce t39 and other symbols, but how?\n\nAlternatively, S could produce NT9 NT12. Let's see NT9 first: NT9 can produce NT6 NT16. NT6 can produce NT3 NT21. NT3 is 't39'. Then NT21 could produce, for example, NT17 NT5. NT17 can produce NT8 NT10 or NT5 NT20. Let's see if that leads anywhere.\n\nNT8 can produce 't48' or 't4' (wait, looking back, NT8 has 't48' and 't20' as terminals? Or maybe I messed up. Wait, in the grammar, NT8 has productions:\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, NT8's productions are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't48'\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n- Also, other productions like NT20 \u2192 't65', etc.\n\nSo NT8 can produce 't48' directly, which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 \u2192 't39' if NT3 is 't39', but wait, NT3 is 't39' in the grammar? Let me confirm:\n\nYes, in the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't39'\n\nSo NT3 produces 't39' directly.\n\nSo, the first symbol 't39' would come from NT3, which is derived from NT6 NT16 (from NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT16).\n\nWait, let me try to trace a possible derivation path:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT16\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT21\n\nNT3 \u2192 't39'\n\nThen NT16 \u2192 NT7 NT20\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11\n\nWait, but the string starts with t39, then t40. Hmm, perhaps we need to see how it all connects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should map the entire string into a possible sequence of productions.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for specific terminals and see if they can be generated.\n\nWait, another approach: the start symbol S can produce NT12 NT12. Let's see what NT12 produces: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. NT17 can produce, for example, NT8 NT10 or NT5 NT20.\n\nIf NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10, then NT8 is 't48' and NT10 is 't43' (from NT10 \u2192 't43').\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t39, so this path might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if S \u2192 NT9 NT12, then NT9 can produce NT6 NT16. NT6 can produce 't39' and NT16 can produce NT7 NT20. NT7 can produce NT2 NT11, etc. But I'm getting lost here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string starts with t39, which is from NT3. So the first production must involve NT3 somewhere in the expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t39, which is N3. So perhaps S must produce a chain that eventually leads to N3. But S can only produce two non-terminals, and each of those must further be expanded into more until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since the string is linear and consists of terminals, I can model this as a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal and each leaf is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-577","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Hmm, okay, first, I should understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, so each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, there are a few production rules. The first one is S \u2192 NT12 NT8. So the entire string must be a combination of two non-terminals, NT12 and NT8. \n\nNow, I need to check if both NT12 and NT8 can derive into certain terminal strings. Let me look up where NT12 and NT8 are defined. \n\nND12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So NT12 becomes NT17 and NT8. Now, NT17 and NT8 need to be broken down. NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4. Then NT13 is NT12 NT19, and NT12 is again NT17 NT8. Wait, this seems like a loop. Let me try to write this out step by step.\n\nSo starting from NT12:\n1. NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n2. NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\n3. NT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19\n4. NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8 again. So this seems like it's going into a loop. Hmm, maybe there's another way. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, wait, I have to track each part separately. So after expanding NT13, I have NT12 and NT19. Let's expand both:\n\nNT12 from step 3 \u2192 NT17 NT8, and NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT4.\n\nNow, for NT17 (from NT19):\n5. NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\n6. NT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19 again.\n\nThis seems like an infinite loop. Maybe I should consider if there's a way to break this cycle. Alternatively, maybe one of these non-terminals has a direct terminal. Let me look up NT17 and NT8's expansions to see.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT17 can also expand into NT11 NT12. Let's see if that's helpful. So NT17 \u2192 NT11 NT12. Then NT11 is NT5 NT21. Hmm. Wait, but earlier steps were leading to loops. Let me try to outline all the expansions step by step, maybe in a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by checking the terminals in the given string and see if they can be matched according to the grammar. The given string is t73 t82 t65 t16 t48 t40 t65 t53 t19 t40 t40 t65 t43 t77 t82 t43 t26 t65 t17 t73 t81 t53 t40 t82 t53 t65 t40 t43 t65 t77 t12.\n\nThat's a long string, but let's break it down into pairs since the start rule is based on two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start rule S \u2192 NT12 NT8, the first two non-terminals produce part of the string. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT12 and NT8.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by splitting it into possible pairs from NT12 and NT8. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backwards, checking if each terminal in the string matches the possible terminals from the grammar, but I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is to check if each token is present as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several terminals: t73, t82, t65, t16, t48, t40, t53, t19, t43, t77, t26, t81, t12. Also, there are duplicates: t82, t65, t40 multiple times.\n\nSo the string is composed of these terminals, which is a good sign. Now, the key is to see if the grammar can generate this sequence.\n\nI know that the start symbol is S, which divides the string into two parts: NT12 and NT8. The part after NT12 is NT8.\n\nLooking at the production for NT8: NT8 can be 't40' or NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20. Wait, in the grammar, NT8 is defined as 't40' or NT4 NT20. So NT8 can either be the terminal 't40' or two non-terminals, NT4 and NT20.\n\nBut in the string, the last production would need to match exactly. Looking at the string, after the first NT12, the rest is a long series that ends with t12. Wait, the string is 31 tokens long. Let me count:\n\nt73 t82 t65 t16 t48 t40 t65 t53 t19 t40 t40 t65 t43 t77 t82 t43 t26 t65 t17 t73 t81 t53 t40 t82 t53 t65 t40 t43 t65 t77 t12.\n\n31 tokens, which is odd. But S \u2192 NT12 NT8. So the entire string should have even number of terminals since each production of S is two non-terminals. Wait, that's a problem. 31 is odd, so it's impossible. Because S expands into two non-terminals, each of which will expand into terminals, so the total number of terminals should be even. But here we have 31, which is odd. So the string must be invalid.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT12 NT8, which is two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals can produce various things, but every time they expand, each non-terminal contributes a certain number of terminals.\n\nWait, but the production could result in more non-terminals. For example, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, and NT8 can be 't40' or NT4 NT20. So when you go recursively, the total number of terminals might not necessarily be even or odd?\n\nWait no, because each production adds a certain number. Let me think: Each step, when you expand a non-terminal, you replace it with two things, each of which could be a terminal or non-terminal. So for S, expanding S gives two non-terminals, which themselves might expand into more. So the total number of terminals could be more, but whether it's even or odd depends on the number of expansions.\n\nWait, but in the given string, there are 31 terminals, which is odd. If S generates two non-terminals, each of which expands into n and m terminals, respectively, the total is n + m, which could be even or odd depending on n and m. So the string length being odd doesn't automatically make it invalid. I ruled it out earlier because I thought 31 is odd, but maybe it's possible.\n\nTherefore, the parity argument isn't sufficient. I need to proceed further.\n\nSo the string is:\n\n1 t73\n2 t82\n3 t65\n4 t16\n5 t48\n6 t40\n7 t65\n8 t53\n9 t19\n10 t40\n11 t40\n12 t65\n13 t43\n14 t77\n15 t82\n16 t43\n17 t26\n18 t65\n19 t17\n20 t73\n21 t81\n22 t53\n23 t40\n24 t82\n25 t53\n26 t65\n27 t40\n28 t43\n29 t65\n30 t77\n31 t12\n\nSo 31 tokens, which is a problem because each S expansion contributes two, but perhaps the structure doesn't strictly enforce evenness because non-terminals can produce terminals and other non-terminals, leading to varying numbers.\n\nBut, more importantly, let's look at the start symbol and the derivation.\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT8.\n\nSo, the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT12 and NT8.\n\nSo NT12 and NT8 each produce a sequence of terminals. Let's see what each could produce.\n\nFirst, NT12:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nSo NT12 breaks into two parts: NT17 and NT8.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT12 NT19.\n\nWait, so now we have NT12 and NT19.\n\nWait, this is getting recursive. Let me try to track each.\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8.\n\nThen, NT17 becomes NT13 NT4.\n\nSo now, for the first NT12"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-573","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a series of tokens. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see how the non-terminals and terminals are structured. The top-level rule starts with S, which branches into various combinations of NT and T (I think T might represent terminal symbols). However, looking closely, I notice that in some cases, a rule is followed by a number like NT12 -> NT12 NT8, which seems a bit redundant. Maybe that's a typo or just part of the given grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a list of tokens: t40 t39 t40 t82 t73 t48 t73 t40 t40 t65 t73 t65 t82 t43 t61 t48 t70 t65 t48 t81 t82 t73 t17 t65 t61 t29 t43 t82 t43 t70 t95.\n\nMy first thought is to parse this string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal. This suggests that the derive process will involve breaking down each part into smaller pieces, ultimately matching the tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several production rules that directly map non-terminals to terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't12', NT4 -> 't65', etc. So, some non-terminals can immediately produce specific terminal tokens.\n\nThe string starts with t40, t39, t40. I'm going to check if any production rules for non-terminals produce these tokens. Let's look at the rules provided:\n\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT9\n- NT1 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT17 -> NT13 NT4\n- NT2 -> NT11 NT17\n- NT13 -> NT12 NT19\n- NT19 -> NT1 NT2\n- NT5 -> NT17 NT4\n- NT4 -> NT11 NT20\n- NT16 -> NT7 NT20\n- NT7 -> NT7 NT12\n- NT5 -> NT13 NT7\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT14\n- NT1 -> NT14 NT6\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT16\n- NT14 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT0\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT8\n- NT20 -> NT10 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT20\n- NT19 -> NT11 NT4\n- NT17 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT13\n- NT11 -> NT0 NT11\n- NT1 -> NT1 NT8\n- NT9 -> NT0 NT19\n- NT2 -> NT21 NT4\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT5 -> 't82'\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT13 -> 't82'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n\nOkay, starting from the terminals:\n\n1. t40: Looking at the rules, NT0 produces 't40' and also has a production NT0 -> NT6 NT10. So, possibly part of the way is NT0.\n\n2. Next is t39: That's produced by NT5 (from NT5 -> 't39').\n\n3. Then t40 again: Another NT0 or possibly another chain.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree. But since it's in CNF, each step splits a non-terminal into two parts, and we can represent the string as a series of steps that derive it from S.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since the string is long, maybe there's a pattern or something that can be validated quickly.\n\nWait, let's see the start symbol S. The grammar seems to have multiple productions from S, like S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, but checking the provided rules, S actually has S -> NT12 NT12 NT8? Wait, no, looking back, the provided rules for S are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nWait, wait. Let me check again. The user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nBut that's not in Chomsky Normal Form because CNF requires each production to have at most two non-terminals. So, a production like A -> B C D would have three non-terminals, which isn't allowed. So, either the user made a typo, or perhaps they included a typo in the grammar. Wait, looking again, the grammar is presented in the initial message as:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nWait, that would be a problem because CNF allows only two, not three. So, perhaps that's a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be S -> NT12 NT8 or something else with two non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe NT12 -> NT12 NT8 is a rule, but wait, that's for a non-terminal.\n\nWait, I see in the provided grammar, some rules have multiple non-terminals on the RHS. For example:\n\nNT9 -> NT6 NT9\n\nNT2 -> NT11 NT17\n\nand so on. So, all these are in CNF except possibly the S productions, which seem to have three non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, S is split into three parts for some rules, like S -> NT12 NT12 NT8. But in CNF, each production can only have two. So perhaps that's a mistake, or maybe the input has a typo. Alternatively, maybe those S rules are supposed to be two. Wait, maybe the user made a typo in the initial grammar, but in the following, they have rules like NT12 -> 't12', so perhaps the S productions are correctly written as multiple rules.\n\nWait, looking again, the initial grammar lines for S are:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nS -> NT9 NT14\n\nWait, that would be three non-terminals in each production for S, which isn't CNF. That's a problem. So, perhaps the user made a mistake in the grammar. Alternatively, maybe I've misread the initial content. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, in the initial problem statement, the grammar starts with:\n\nGrammar: S -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nS -> NT9 NT14\n\nWait, that can't be correct because each production in CNF can only have up to two non-terminals. So, perhaps the correct version is that each S production is split into two, perhaps S-> NT12 NT12 NT8 is actually S-> NT12 NT14, but that's speculation.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the grammar is correct as given, even though some S rules have three non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps the rules are miswritten, and S's productions are each two non-terminals. But as per the user, the first line of the grammar lists three NT's. That might be an error in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to write each production as two non-terminals, but perhaps one is on the right-hand side. For example, S -> NT12 NT9, etc. So perhaps I should ignore that for now and proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S is allowed to have three symbols in CNF, but that's not standard. So maybe there's a typo in the initial problem.\n\nHowever, perhaps this is an error and the user wanted to present the grammar correctly. Alternatively, maybe some rules have three symbols because of something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mistake and all S productions are supposed to be two non-terminals each. For example:\n\nS-> NT12 NT8\n\nS-> NT9 NT12\n\nS-> NT14 NT9\n\nand so on.

{"custom_id":"request-605","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of t-terms, and the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, which has productions like S \u2192 NT12 NT8, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, and others. The NT symbols eventually produce t-terms or other non-terminals. Each production seems to split into two symbols, which suggests that the strings generated will be sequences built by combining these step by step.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t17 t65 t82 t65 t65 t43 t65 t53 t65 t17 t40 t40 t70 t73 t82 t40 t12 t65 t53 t82 t40 t65 t43 t73 t65 t82 t73 t82 t65 t73 t12 t66 t73.\n\nLooking at the grammar, several NT symbols produce t-terms. For example, NT12 \u2192 't12', NT8 \u2192 't8', and so on. Also, some NT symbols produce other NT symbols, like NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. So, I probably need to see if the string can be decomposed into a sequence of such productions.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into chunks that might match the grammar. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t17, which could come from NT17's production. Looking at the grammar, NT17 produces productions like NT7 NT2, NT13 NT4, NT11 NT12, etc. So, to have t17, perhaps NT17 must produce a t-term later, but looking at the t-terms, I don't see a t17 except from NT17 itself, which can produce t61, etc. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the string has t17 at the fifth position. Let me list the t-terms in order: t17, t65, t82, t65, t65, t43, t65, t53, t65, t17, t40, t40, t70, t73, t82, t40, t12, t65, t53, t82, t40, t65, t43, t73, t65, t82, t73, t82, t65, t73, t12, t66, t73.\n\nHmm, maybe I should start from the end and see if it can backtrack. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can try to represent the string as a series of steps using the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to model the production steps. The start symbol S produces combinations of NT rules. Let's see:\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT12 NT8. So, the first part of the string could be NT12 and NT8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT12 produces either NT17 NT8 or NT19 NT8. Wait, in the grammar, NT12 is actually: NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, NT19 NT8, and others. Let me check the given grammar again. Oh, in the user's grammar, NT12 has two productions: NT12 -> NT17 NT8 and NT12 -> NT19 NT8. So, the first symbol could be NT12 and NT8.\n\nLooking at the string, starting with t17. If NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, then the first part could be t17 and t8. But wait, in the string, the first symbol is t17. So, could NT12 produce t17, but looking at the grammar, NT17 only produces t-terms eventually. So, perhaps NT17 \u2192 some t-term combined with another.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with a production that starts with NT12, which could split into NT17 NT8. So, we have t17 and t8. Let's see the first symbols: t17, t65, t82, etc. That might not align.\n\nWait, maybe the string is too long. Each symbol might come from a chain of productions. Let me try to map the string by seeing possible splits.\n\nThe first symbol is t17. Let's see if any NT symbol directly produces t17. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT symbol that produces t17 directly. All the t-terms are different: t17 is only a terminal, so it must come from an NT that eventually produces t17. So, perhaps some NT rule leads to t17.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9 and NT1 \u2192 NT1 NT8. So, maybe somewhere in the derivation, a production leads to t17. Let's check: the t17 appears at the fourth position. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, let's consider that the string starts with t17, which would come from some NT symbol that eventually generates t17. Another approach: let's see which productions end with t17. Looking at the grammar, NT17 has a production NT7 NT2, NT13 NT4, NT11 NT12, etc. So, perhaps t17 is in the middle of a longer derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the string being built step by step using the grammar. Let me start from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is t17. Maybe this comes from NT17, which can produce t61, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps t17 is part of a longer sequence. Wait, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT7 NT14. Let me check if that could fit.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT7 NT14, then the string starts with NT7 and NT14's productions. Let's see: NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11 (multiple productions). So, NT7 could produce combinations leading to t61 or other t-terms.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for the possible breaks between symbols. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the structure. The start symbol S produces two NT symbols. Each of those produces two more, and so on, recursively. Since the string is a concatenation of t-terms, it could be that each symbol in the string corresponds to an NT production.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string can be broken down into a series of NT productions. Let me try:\n\nFirst, t17 must come from some NT symbol. Looking at the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT7 NT2. Then NT7 could produce other symbols.\n\nWait, this might take too long. Alternatively, I can note that the grammar includes several t-terms, and the given string is a concatenation of specific t-terms. Let me see if the string can be decomposed into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t17, t65, t82, t65, t65, t43, t65, t53, t65, t17, t40, t40, t70, t73, t82, t40, t12, t65, t53, t82, t40, t65, t43, t73, t65, t82, t73, t82, t65, t73, t12, t66, t73.\n\nIf I group parts, perhaps some sequences correspond to certain NT productions. For example, t17 t65 t82 t65 t65... So, maybe this corresponds to a chain like NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8, and then NT17 produces t17, NT8 produces t8, but the string has more terms. It's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is too long, and the production rules might not directly map to each t-term. Maybe the string contains t-terms that cannot be derived because they appear in impossible sequences. For example, if S \u2192 NT12 NT8, then the first symbols should be from NT12 and NT8. Let's see:\n\nThe start symbol S is S \u2192 NT12 NT8 (and other options). Let's take the first option: S \u2192 NT12 NT8. Then NT12 could split into NT17 NT8 or NT19 NT8. Let's say NT12 \u2192 NT17 NT8. Then the first two symbols would be t17 t8. But the string starts with t17 t65 t82..., which doesn't fit. So perhaps this is not the correct initial production.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT7 NT14. Then NT7 could produce NT2 NT11, and NT14 could produce NT4 NT1.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe start symbol is S, and the grammar has several productions from S, NT9, NT12, etc. The string consists of a bunch of tokens like t73, t82, etc. I notice that some of these are terminals, others are non-terminals since they have numbers that might be part of the grammar rules.\n\nI need to see if I can derive this string from S using the grammar. Since it's CNF, any valid string will have a derivation tree that matches the structure. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some symbols like NT2, NT4, etc., are used in multiple productions. For example, NT12 produces t12, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT10 can produce 't53' or 't73'. Wait, no, looking closer, NT10 can produce 't73' and 't53', but that's a typo, right? Or maybe I misread it. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT10 has two rules: one with NT7 and NT5, another with NT16 and NT8. But also, I see NT10 has productions that end with 't73', 't43', etc. Hmm, perhaps I need to see which NT symbols produce which terminals.\n\nWait, actually, I need to list all the terminal symbols. Scanning through the grammar, I see that some NTs produce terminals like:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73' and 't43'\n- NT4 \u2192 't17'\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n- NT3 \u2192 't16', 't29', 't82'\n- NT5 \u2192 't66', 't82'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65', etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 't61'\n- NT19 \u2192 't61'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65', 't48', etc.\n- NT21 \u2192 't82', 't53'\n- NT1 \u2192 't19'\n  \nWait, but some of these are confusing because, for example, NT10 can produce both 't73' and 't43'. So, the string has 't73', which would come from NT10, and 't43', which also comes from NT10. Then again, NT10 can also produce other things, but in the string, after 't73 t82 t26...', let's see.\n\nWait, but let's break down the string piece by piece:\n\nThe first token is 't73', which comes from NT10 \u2192 't73', and then 't82' from NT3, as per the grammar, since NT3 can produce 't82'.\n\nBut wait, the grammar for NT3 is: NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14, or other rules. Hmm, but looking back, I think some of the rules for NT3 are 't82', but maybe the productions for NT3 are more than that. Let me scan the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3 has several rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT0\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT13 NT2\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n\nWait, I also see later:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14 (again)\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT0\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT13 NT2\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT20 (again)\n\nBut also, in the grammar, NT3 had some more rules:\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me see again.\n\nLooking at the end of the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT0\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT13 NT2\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n\nWait, but in the initial part, earlier, in NT3's rules, I think it's written as \"NT3 -> t16\" and \"NT3 -> t29\", but upon checking the grammar, it seems:\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t16\n\nNT3 \u2192 t29\n\nNT3 \u2192 t51\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the grammar entry says:\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT14\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT0\n\nNT3 -> NT4 NT20\n\nNT3 -> NT13 NT2\n\nNT3 -> NT4 NT20\n\nAnd then:\n\nNT3 -> t29, etc. Wait, no, let me get this straight.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT3 is defined as:\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT14\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT0\n\nNT3 -> NT4 NT20\n\nNT3 -> NT13 NT2\n\nNT3 -> NT4 NT20\n\nThen, later:\n\nNT3 -> t29\n\nWait, but looking again, I think the user might have made a mistake.

Perhaps, but for the sake of this, let me assume that some NT symbols produce specific terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT3 can produce 't16', 't29', etc.\n\nBut back to the string: the first token is 't73', which must come from NT10. Then 't82' from NT3. Then 't26'\u2014where does that come from? Looking through the grammar, I see NT26 is not mentioned, so maybe it's a typo? Wait, looking back, perhaps. Wait, no. Wait, looking through the grammar, do any rules produce 't26'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that there are NT12 and others:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't48', 't65', etc.\n\nBut where does 't26' come from? Hmm, perhaps it's NT17 \u2192 't40'? No, t26 is a terminal. Wait, wait, in the initial rules, the user wrote:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the last few lines have rules like:\n\n\"NT20 -> t53 t53\"\n\nWait, perhaps that's a typo or something. Alternatively, perhaps the terminals have two letters? Like 't73', 't26'\u2014are these single terminals or multi-symbol?\n\nWait, no, in standard CNF, each symbol is a single terminal. So, 't73' would be a single terminal token, as would 't82', etc. So, in the grammar, are any of the NT symbols defined to produce two-terminal strings? Because in the given grammar, I only see productions where NTs produce other NTs or single terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, in fact, every production is of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 terminal. So each terminal token is a single token. Therefore, in the string, each token like 't73' is a single terminal.\n\nSo, back to the string:\n\n\"t73 t82 t26 t61 t40 t82 t48 t82 t43 t16 t43 t70 t17 t48 t40 t40 t40 t70 t53 t53 t82 t53 t65 t26 t48 t70 t48 t65 t82 t48 t43 t65 t48\"\n\nEach of these is a terminal symbol.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is quite large with many symbols. The string to test is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces, so each 't' followed by numbers must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, some symbols like NT12, NT20, etc., expand into these terminals such as 't65', 't53', etc. \n\nLet me parse the string: \nt65 t43 t40 t65 t65 t61 t29 t48 t73 t48 t73 t82 t43 t40 t26 t65 t73 t82 t73 t65 t26 t12 t40 t65 t43 t65 t65 t73 t82 t29 t48 t53 t17 t40\n\nI think each token represents a terminal derived from a non-terminal via a production. So, I need to see if there's a path from the start symbol S down to this string using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by identifying where each token can come from. For example, t65 might be from NT4, as per the grammar: NT4 -> 't65'. Similarly, t43 might be from NT20, since NT20 -> 't43'. I can make a list mapping each token to its possible non-terminal source.\n\nt65: NT4\nt43: NT20\nt40: NT20 (since NT20's production includes 't40'?)\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT20 has two rules: one that goes to NT10 (which is 't43') and to others, and another rule that goes to NT3 (which is 't82'), but wait, in the given grammar, NT20's production rules are:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the grammar:\n\nFrom the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nNT20 -> 't26'\n\nNT10 -> 't40' (I think; let me check the grammar lines: yeah, there's a line NT10 -> 't40').\n\nWait, no, in the grammar given, there are lines like NT12 -> 't12' and NT10 -> 't40', etc. So each 't' is from specific non-terminals.\n\nSo, let me make a list of each token and which non-terminals can produce them:\n\nt65: NT4, NT20, NT3, NT15, etc. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT4 has several rules: NT4 -> NT17 NT2, NT4 -> NT11 NT5, NT4 -> NT4 NT7, and a terminal rule NT4 -> 't65'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar lines, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> 't65' (from line NT4 -> 't17'... Wait, no. Let me re-examine the lines carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a line:\n\nNT4 -> 't65'\n\nAnother line:\n\nNT15 -> 't82'\n\nAlso, NT14 -> 't40' (NT14 is 't40', etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to make a detailed list.\n\nLet me compile all the terminal symbols and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nFrom NT14: NT14 -> 't40' (I think, because I see a line: NT14 -> 't65', no, wait. Looking again: \n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT14 -> NT4 NT0 (line: NT14 -> NT4 NT0)\n\nAlso, there's:\n\nNT14 -> 't40' because I see a line: NT14 -> 't40'\n\nWait, but in the list above, I see a line: NT14 -> 't65', no, actually, in the user's grammar, looking at the lines, for example:\n\nNT15 -> 't82'\n\nNT4 -> 't65'\n\nSo, each token is the result of a specific non-terminal. For example:\n\nt65 = NT4\nt43 = NT20\nt40 could be NT20 or NT14 or others, depending on which production rules produce t40.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to note each token's possible sources:\n\nt65: NT4 (from NT4 -> 't65')\nt43: NT20 (from NT20 -> 't43')\nt40: NT14 (from NT14 -> 't40')\nt65 again: NT4\nt65: NT4\nt61: perhaps from NT17? Let me check NT17's rules.\n\nLooking at NT17:\n\nNT17 -> NT13 NT4 and also NT17 has two production rules to NT5 and NT2, etc. Wait, I think NT17 is from NT5: NT5 -> NT17 NT4, so NT17 could be a non-terminal leading to 't61' perhaps because NT17 can expand to other things. Alternatively, perhaps NT17 can produce a terminal 't61'? I'm not sure. Let me check the grammar lines:\n\nI see NT17 -> NT13 NT4 (line: NT17 -> NT13 NT4), and also NT17 -> NT5 NT2 (another line), and NT17 -> NT11 NT12 (another). Hmm, so NT17 itself isn't a terminal; it's non-terminal. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I can find NT17 being a terminal. Let me scan through the grammar lines for NT17 as a terminal:\n\nLooking for any line where NT17 is on the left side with a terminal on the right. I don't see any such line. All the NT17 rules are productions to other non-terminals. So, NT17 is a non-terminal. Therefore, it must expand into other symbols.\n\nSo, t61 would have to come from somewhere. Maybe from NT17? But since NT17 can expand into various combinations, perhaps one of its productions leads to 't61', but I don't see that in the grammar. Wait, the grammar has lines for NT17:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 -> NT5 NT2\n\nNT17 -> NT13 NT4\n\nNT17 -> NT11 NT12\n\nSo, NT17's productions are all non-terminals. Therefore, 't61' must come from another non-terminal that expands to 't61'. Looking through other non-terminals:\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT17 -> 't61' because in a line: NT17 -> 't61'? Let me check the grammar:\n\nNo, I don't see that. Maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT17 -> NT5 NT2\n\nNT5 is a non-terminal. Are there any terminals derived from NT5? Let me see.\n\nNT5 has lines:\n\nNT5 -> 't65'\n\nNo, wait, looking through the grammar lines:\n\nI see NT5 -> 't65' (line: NT5 -> 't65'), which I think is correct. So, when NT5 is expanded, it produces 't65'.\n\nSo, t61 must come from somewhere else. Maybe from NT17? But NT17 only expands into non-terminals, so I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, another line in the grammar is NT17 -> 't61'?\n\nNo, looking through the grammar lines, I don't see 't61' anywhere except perhaps from NT7: NT7 -> 't77' or other.\n\nWait, I might be wrong. Let me make sure. Let me list all the terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt65, t43, t40, t65 again, t61, t48, t73, t48, t73, t82, t43, t40, t26, t65, t73, t82, t73, t65, t26, t12, t40, t65, t43, t65, t65, t73, t82, t29, t48, t53, t17, t40.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find each token's possible source.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to find a way to build the string step by step, using the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT12 NT14, or other rules, but looking at the first production, S can produce NT12 followed by NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and each token is a 't' followed by two digits. My first step is to understand what the grammar looks like and how it might generate the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, which is typical for CNF. The start symbol is S, and from there, S can produce several combinations of NTs (non-terminals). For example, S \u2192 NT12 NT12, S \u2192 NT7 NT14, etc. Each of these NTs eventually leads down to terminals, which are these 't' followed by numbers.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from left to right, trying to find a sequence of productions that can break down the string into the grammar's rules. However, given that the string is quite long, I might look for patterns or repeated sequences that match parts of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: `t95 t82 t26 t65 t77 t40 t82 t53 t95 t65 t82 t73 t82 t17 t40 t65 t53 t95 t12 t40 t70 t65 t65 t61 t82 t17 t40 t40 t65 t70 t17 t65 t48 t65`.\n\nI notice that some tokens repeat, like t82, t65, and t40, which suggests that these might be part of non-terminals that have multiple productions. For example, looking at the grammar productions, I see that NT12 can produce t12, and NT21, NT15, etc., produce other tokens.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that NT12 -> NT17 NT8. Then NT17 can produce other non-terminals. Let's see: NT17 -> NT13 NT4, and NT4 can produce more NTs, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nWait, but some of the non-terminals like NT20 produce 't65' (from the grammar: NT6 -> 't39', NT12 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't70', NT3 -> 't16', etc.). Hmm, perhaps I should map each non-terminal to the terminals it can produce.\n\nFor example, NT12 -> 't12', NT20 -> 't65', NT10 -> 't53', NT17 -> 't61' or t53 or t70 from other rules. Wait, NT17 has several productions: NT17 -> NT21 NT5, NT17 -> NT8 NT10, NT17 -> NT11 NT12, etc. So NT17 can lead into various non-terminals that eventually produce terms like t65, t53, t70, etc.\n\nLooking again at the string, I see a 't95' at the beginning. From the grammar, only NT9 can produce 't95' (since looking at the rules, NT9 -> 't95'), but wait, in the grammar, what does NT9 produce? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT4 -> 't17' etc., but I need to see where 't95' comes from.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I see:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nNT10 -> 't53'\n\nNT4 -> 't17' etc., but I don't see 't95' directly. Wait, the last production for NT12 in the grammar is 't12'. Looking through the productions, I see NT9 -> 't95', but when does 't95' appear?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the only place I see 't95' is in NT12, and in the string, 't95' appears multiple times. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the non-terminals and their terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a parse tree for the given string. Let's see:\n\nStart with S. S can be NT12 NT12, NT7 NT14, etc. Since the string starts with t95, which comes from NT12 -> 't12'\u2014 but wait, that's 't12', not 't95'. Wait, I might be getting the NTs confused. Maybe I should list all the NTs and their corresponding terminals.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and the terminals they produce:\n\nFrom the grammar rules:\n\nNT12 -> 't12'\n\nNT7 -> 't2' NT16, but also in other productions, like NT7 -> NT2 NT11, which may produce more non-terminals. Similarly, NT12 has multiple paths.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list each NT and what it can produce in the string:\n\nLooking at all the productions where NTs lead directly to terminals:\n\n- NT9 -> 't95' (from line: NT12 -> 't12' is a production, but I might have misread that.

{"custom_id":"request-629","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long and filled with symbols like 't40', 't43', etc. My goal is to figure out step by step whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific way of structuring CFGs where all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for simplifying the structure of the grammar, making it easier to apply certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm for parsing, but since the problem doesn't involve parsing, maybe I can approach it more manually.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, most of the productions are of the form NT followed by two other non-terminals (e.g., S \u2192 NT12 NT12). However, some productions, like some NT rules, have terminal symbols on the right-hand side. For instance, NT12 \u2192 't12' (from the list, NT12 is a production that generates 't12'). So, many of the non-terminals directly produce a single terminal character.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminal symbols. My first thought is to check whether each symbol in the string is present in the terminals of the grammar. Looking through the grammar, I see symbols like 't40', 't43', etc., and they all appear in the productions. So, that's a good start. Each symbol in the string corresponds to at least some production in the grammar.\n\nNext, I need to see if the sequence can be generated by starting from S and applying the productions step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either a combination of two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the parse tree for the string should consist entirely of non-terminals at internal nodes and terminals at leaves.\n\nI can approach this by trying to parse the string symbol by symbol using the grammar. Let's start breaking down the string into parts that might correspond to the non-terminals in the productions.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t40 t40 t40... I notice that in the grammar, there are production rules that directly output t40, like NT1 \u2192 't19', etc., but more specifically, looking at the grammar, I see that NT9 produces 't77', NT3 produces 't16', 't29', 't48', etc. I need to find a path where a non-terminal can produce a sequence of t40's followed by other terminal symbols.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions that directly produce t40. In the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't61'\n- NT19 \u2192 't61'\n- NT21 \u2192 't82'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT9 \u2192 't77'\n- NT17 \u2192 't61' (and also NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4, which can eventually produce t16 and t20)\n- NT6 \u2192 't3' which is NT20's production and so on. Hmm, perhaps I should look for all NT symbols that have 't40' in their productions.\n\nWait, looking again, in the grammar, I see that several NTs produce terminals, but t40 is produced by NT9 -> NT6 NT9. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT19 \u2192 NT11 NT4\n- NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT5\n- NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n- NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT2\n- NT17 \u2192 NT13 NT4\n- NT21 \u2192 NT8 NT13\n- NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT8\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT12\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT14\n- NT5 \u2192 NT17 NT4\n- NT1 \u2192 NT14 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT21\n- NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT15\n- NT4 \u2192 NT11 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT16\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT13\n- NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT11\n- NT1 \u2192 NT1 NT8\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT19\n- NT2 \u2192 NT21 NT4\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53', 't43', 't73', 't10'\u2014wait, some of these may produce t43 or t53.\n\nLooking at the string, the first three symbols are t40, t40, t40. So, perhaps the initial step is NT9 \u2192 t40. But wait, looking at the grammar, I need to find a production for a non-terminal that produces t40.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The grammar provided has some productions with terminals, but t40 isn't directly produced by any NT. Let's check again:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT10 \u2192 't53', 't73', 't43', 't...'\n\nWait, I need to check all the NT rules to see which ones produce t40. Let me go through the list:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT12 NT12 \u2192 can't be, since NT12 produces 't12', which isn't t40.\n2. S \u2192 NT7 NT14 \u2192 NT7 is NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11, which then may produce 't43' via NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT16 (if NT0 is 't43'? Wait, no, looking at the NT0 productions: NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT10, and NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT21, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the string starts with t40, let's see which NTs can produce t40. Looking at the grammar, the NT symbols may have productions that include 't40'.\n\nLooking through the list, the only NT symbols that directly produce terminals are:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT12 appears again as producing 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16', 't29', 't48'\n- NT13 -> 't82'\n- NT21 -> 't82'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT19 -> 't61'\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't77'\n- NT2 -> 't43' because NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT16, and if NT7 produces 't77' and NT16 produces 't70', that's not t43. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, perhaps looking again, perhaps t43 is produced by NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT11 or something else. Let me check NT2's productions:\n\nNT2's rules are:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT17\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT16\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT16\n- NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT17 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT17 NT3\n\nSo, none of these directly produce t43. Instead, t43 might be generated by one of the NTs that have a production leading to NT2, which then can generate t43.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the overall approach.\n\nThe key is that each production in the grammar is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, the parse tree can be built bottom-up, checking if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, it might take a lot of steps. Alternatively, perhaps we can look for patterns or repeated substructures that fit the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t40 t40 t40 t70 t73 t53 t40 t65 t65 t53 t82 t65 t48 t39 t48 t73 t40 t65 t70 t48 t43 t29 t65 t48 t43 t26 t48 t73 t40 t82 t53 t65 t43 t39 t40.\n\nThe string is 36 symbols long, with"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is:\n\nt43 t17 t17 t40 t61 t82 t65 t73 t82 t73 t81 t48 t40 t65 t43 t82 t43 t65 t40 t53 t40 t65 t73 t95 t82 t48 t53 t12 t70 t65 t53 t65 t65 t82 t43.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This simplifies parsing because each production step either consumes a terminal or combines two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. Each production rule starts with S and produces combinations of NT and terminals. However, it's important to note that some of the non-terminals produce strings of terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't12', NT10 -> 't53', NT4 -> 't65', etc.\n\nSo, the strategy is to break down the string into parts that match the possible terminal productions in the grammar. Since the grammar can lead to multiple ways of deriving the string, I need to find a sequence of productions that exactly matches the string.\n\nThe given string is quite long, but let's see if it's possible to split it into the allowed productions.\n\nFirst, let's look for the simplest possible steps. Each production in CNF is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, the string must be a concatenation of terminals and non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each production in the grammar either directly leads to a terminal or is composed of two non-terminals. So, the entire string must be decomposable into such sequences.\n\nBut the string is given as a series of terminals, so I need to see if it can be formed by the grammar. Each of these terminals must be generated by some rule in the grammar. Alternatively, the non-terminals could produce these terminals, but each non-terminal's production must align with the grammar.\n\nWait, no. If the string consists only of terminals, then each symbol in the string must be produced by a production that results in that terminal. But in the provided grammar, there are some non-terminals that produce terminals, like NT12 -> 't12', NT10 -> 't53', etc. So, as long as each terminal in the string is among those that appear as right-hand sides of some production, it's possible.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of these terminals, so each must be either directly produced or part of a more complex derivation.\n\nWait, but the grammar only has strings where some non-terminals directly produce terminals, and other non-terminals combine to produce other non-terminals. So, the entire string is built up by substituting non-terminals with their productions. Therefore, the entire string must be a result of a series of such substitutions.\n\nWait, but the string itself is a sequence of terminals, so the derivation must end in a sequence of terminals. That means, during the derivation, all non-terminals must be replaced by their terminal expansions. So every step must eventually resolve to a terminal.\n\nBut some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, while others produce terminals. So, the string must be built by expanding all non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nSo, perhaps I can try to parse the string step by step, replacing combinations that match non-terminal productions.\n\nSince the string is quite long, it's not feasible to manually parse it step by step. However, perhaps I can look for substrings that correspond to direct productions.\n\nFor example, looking at the string, there's a 't43' at the beginning. Let's see if 't43' is a terminal production. Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT43 in the right-hand sides. But perhaps 't43' is a result of expanding another non-terminal. So, perhaps T43 is produced by some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, but the question is whether each 'tX' in the string is a valid terminal in the grammar, meaning it must appear as a terminal on the right-hand side of some production, either directly or indirectly through other non-terminals.\n\nLooking again, in the grammar, various non-terminals produce the given terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't12', NT10 -> 't53', NT4-> 't65', etc. So, all these 't...' in the string are valid productions.\n\nBut is there a way to get the entire string by combining these? Each step involves substituting non-terminals with other non-terminals or terminals. So, the string must be a concatenation of the results of such substitutions.\n\nBut perhaps the string is too complex or contains a combination that cannot be formed.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem where we try to split the string into parts that correspond to the allowed productions.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's better to look for the presence of certain patterns.\n\nWait, for example, consider the start symbol S. Looking at the production rules, I notice that S has multiple options:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, S expands into two non-terminals and a terminal, but wait, each production is two non-terminals because in CNF, each production is two symbols. Wait, looking again at the grammar:\n\nIn the grammar, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, S is the start symbol, but in the problem statement, it's written as S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, but that's actually three symbols which might be a typo because CNF requires each production to have exactly two symbols.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the user provided the grammar in a way that S has multiple production rules, each separated by arrows. For example:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\n\nWait, that would mean S expands to three symbols, which contradicts the CNF definition where each production has exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, but wait, no\u2014 actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A-> a, where BC are non-terminals. So, each production is exactly two symbols on the right. So, if the user wrote S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, that's a production with three symbols, which would be illegal for CNF. Therefore, perhaps it's a typo. So, I should check if all productions are valid CNF.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, I see S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, which suggests three symbols. Similarly, S -> NT9 NT12 is two symbols, but others like S -> NT7 NT14 are two symbols. But the first S rule seems to have three, which would be invalid in CNF. Hmm, maybe there's a typo, or perhaps it's correct as written. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be two symbols.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me re-examine the initial part. The user wrote:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT12 NT12 NT8\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nIf S can produce three symbols (NT12, NT12, NT8), that would mean it's a production with three non-terminals or terminals, which is not allowed in CNF. CNF requires each production to have exactly two symbols on the right. So, this may indicate an error in the grammar provided. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be S -> NT12 NT8.\n\nWait, that would make more sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write S -> NT12 NT8, but due to formatting, it's written as NT12 NT12 NT8. So, perhaps it's supposed to be S -> NT12 NT12 NT8\u2014 but that's three, which is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and the correct grammar has two symbols each. So, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So, I need to check each production in the grammar.\n\nLooking again at the grammar, most productions are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, and some are terminal productions where NTx -> 't...'. For example, NT12 -> 't12', NT10 -> 't53', etc.\n\nBut if some of the productions have more than two symbols on the right, then the entire grammar isn't in CNF. So, perhaps the user made a mistake in writing some of the productions, e.g., S -> NT12 NT12 NT8, which would have three symbols, violating CNF.\n\nThis would complicate things because, in such a case, the given string may not be derivable at all, or the question is invalid. Alternatively, perhaps the production was intended to have two symbols, and it's a typo.\n\nAssuming that all productions have either two non-terminals or one terminal, then let's proceed.

{"custom_id":"request-641","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to figure out how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions that generate either terminal symbols or two non-terminals. The start symbol can't be on the right side. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which is rewritten into combinations of other symbols, eventually leading to terminals like t, which I assume are terminal symbols. The grammar has a bunch of non-terminals (like S, NT12, NT7, etc.) and right-hand sides that are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is quite long: a sequence of t followed by numbers, but I think each token in the string is a separate element. Wait, no, in the context, each token is separated by spaces, so each \"t\" followed by a number is a separate token? Wait no, the string is written as \"t40 t43 t65...\" which I think represents a sequence of terminal symbols. So the string is a series of terminals separated by spaces, and I have to check if this sequence is derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because looking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals produce terminals, like NT12 -> 't95' or NT20 -> 't65'. So each time those non-terminals appear, they expand into a specific terminal. So the first step is to find a way to parse the given string against the grammar.\n\nOne approach is to construct a parse tree starting from S and see if it can generate the string. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string step by step, checking which non-terminals could produce the corresponding sequence.\n\nLet me list out the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT12 -> 't95'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT5 -> 't82'\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT13 -> 't82'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n- NT7 -> 't61'\n- NT17 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n- NT21 -> 't8' or other variations, but in the grammar, I don't see 't8' as a terminal, but maybe it's part of another expansion.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, like NT21 -> NT17 NT5, etc. So I can't directly expand all NT21; I have to see which NT21's eventually produce a terminal.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the beginning of the string and try to match each token with a production, ensuring that the entire string is parsed without leftover symbols.\n\nLet's try to break down the string into parts that might correspond to the productions. The string is:\n\nt40, t43, t65, t82, t82, t53, t61, t82, t17, t26, t70, t48, t39, t26, t48, t53, t17, t19, t77, t40, t12, t95, t53, t29, t65, t53, t12, t82, t17, t65, t19, t40, t70, t53, t17, t26.\n\nSo 39 tokens in total. That's a bit long, but let's see if I can find a possible derivation.\n\nStarting with S, which has two productions:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these splits S into two non-terminals. Let me check each possibility.\n\nFirst, let's try S -> NT12 NT12.\n\nEach NT12 could potentially expand into various things. Looking at NT12's productions:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\nNT12 -> NT16 NT8\nNT12 -> NT19 NT8\nNT12 -> NT8 -> NT48 NT20, possibly?\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me list the productions for NT12.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT12 -> NT17 NT8\nNT12 -> NT16 NT8\nNT12 -> NT19 NT8\nNT12 -> 't95'\n\nSo the third option is NT12 -> 't95', which is a terminal. So if I start with S -> NT12 NT12, to produce 't95' and 't95', but in the string, the first token is t40, not t95. So that might not fit. Unless there's a way to derive t40 via other productions.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT0 -> 't40', so perhaps one of the non-terminals expands to 't40'. Looking at where NT0 appears. For example:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT0 -> NT6 NT10, and also NT0 -> NT20 NT15, but both of those are non-terminals. So unless they further expand to terminals, they can't produce 't40'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I see that NT0 -> NT20 NT15, and looking for NT20:\n\nNT20 -> NT10 NT3, and NT10 can expand to 't53', 't73', etc., but I'm not seeing 't40' in the terminal list. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT0 -> 't40', but no. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT10\nNT9 -> NT6 NT9\nNT1 -> NT9 NT8\nWait, but looking through the list again, I see NT21 has several productions, but I don't see any production that directly gives me 't40' except perhaps NT15 or others. Hmm.\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT15 -> 't82' and 't65' via some productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\n- Some NT* -> 'tX' where X is a number.\n\nLooking for 't40' in the terminals:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't40'\n\nYes, there is NT0 -> 't40'.\n\nSo that production directly gives 't40'. So if a non-terminal can expand into NT0, and then NT0 -> 't40', then that's a way to get 't40'. But how?\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals expand into NT0? For example, NT9 -> NT6 NT9, but that doesn't reach NT0.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the case. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT10 (Production 10)\n- NT0 -> NT20 NT15 (Production 25)\n- Other productions involve NT20, NT15, etc., but not producing NT0 directly.\n\nWait, no production in the grammar seems to have NT0 on the right-hand side except where it's being produced by other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misplacing. Let me re-examine the productions:\n\nLooking throughout the list:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT10\n- NT0 -> NT20 NT15\n- NT10 -> NT16 NT8 (Production 9)\n- NT20 -> NT10 NT3 (Production 20)\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8 (Production 7)\n- NT12 -> NT16 NT8 (Production 8)\n- NT12 -> NT19 NT8 (Production 14)\n- NT12 -> 't95' (Production 15)\n- NT16 -> NT7 NT20 (Production 17)\n- NT7 -> NT7 NT12 (Production 19)"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two on the right, except for the start symbol which can have one non-terminal initially. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure.

Maybe I can approach it differently. Let me see which non-terminals can produce 't66', 't26', etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's compile a list of all the terminal symbols and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16', 't29', 't39', 't82'\n- NT5 -> 't39', 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't26', 't43', etc.\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- NT10 -> 't53', 't43', 't73'\n- NT12 -> again 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT20 -> 't26', 't48', 't65'\n- NT21 -> various terminals\n- Others like NT4, NT9, etc., lead to other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, so for example, NT15 can produce 't82' as well as other terminals. Hmm.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't66'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't66'? From the production rules, NT5 -> 't39', 't66'. So either NT5.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nFor NT5, the production is: NT5 -> NT17 NT4. But in the terminals, when do we get 't66'? Looking through the terminals in the grammar, I see that NT5 can produce 't66' because in one of the productions, NT5 is replaced by 't66'. Wait, in the list above, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't39', 't15'? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nActually, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT5 -> NT17 NT4\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me check again. The user provided the entire grammar, but in the latter part, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't39', 't66'\n\nWait, no, looking through, let me scan the grammar for terminals under NT5:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT5 -> NT17 NT4\n- NT5 -> NT17 NT20\n- NT5 -> NT19 NT4\n- etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Looking carefully:\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example, NT3 -> 't16', 't29', 't39', 't82'\n\nNT5 -> 't39', 't66' \u2014 Yes, in the grammar, I see under NT5:\n\n\"NT5 -> 't39', 't66'\"\n\nYes, so NT5 can produce 't39' and 't66'. So 't66' could come from NT5.\n\nSo the first token is 't66' which can be generated by NT5.\n\nNext, looking at the string: the second token is 't26'. Let's see what can produce 't26':\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT7 -> 't26', 't43', etc.\n\nSo 't26' can be generated by NT7, which is a non-terminal. So the second token is 't26' from NT7.\n\nThen the third token is 't53'. Looking for 't53' in the grammar terminals:\n\nIn the grammar, 't53' is produced by NT10: NT10 -> 't53' etc.\n\nSo 't53' is from NT10.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nYes, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n\"NT10 -> 't53', 't43', 't73'\"\n\nSo 't53' is an option for NT10.\n\nSo now, the first three tokens are 't66' (NT5), 't26' (NT7), 't53' (NT10).\n\nNow, I have to see if these can be part of a production chain starting from S.\n\nWait, but S produces two non-terminals. So the entire string is a sequence of terminal symbols that must be generated by a sequence of productions starting with S and expanding two symbols at each step until all terminals are consumed.\n\nAlternatively, the string must correspond to a leftmost derivation from S.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as a parse tree, checking at each step whether the symbols can be formed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, 43 tokens, and considering time constraints, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be the way to go, but given that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, but before diving into parsing, maybe I can check for conflicts or inconsistencies.\n\nWait, the first symbol is 't66' which comes from NT5. The production for NT5 is 't39' or 't66'. So the first token consumes 't66' and the NT5 is active. Then, the next symbol is 't26', which comes from NT7's production (e.g., NT7 -> 't26' etc.). Then, the third token is 't53' from NT10's production.\n\nBut in the CYK algorithm, you process the string in chunks, looking for possible non-terminals that can produce sequences of terminals. But since S starts the derivation, perhaps I should consider whether the string can be generated by S.\n\nAlternatively, building a parse tree step by step:\n\nStart: S\n\nS -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, S -> NT9 NT12\n\nBut the string starts with 't66', which is NT5, which is derived from S's productions? Wait, no. Because S's productions don't directly produce 't66'; the initial S must produce non-terminals which eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: S can produce NT12 NT12, which themselves can produce terminals. For example, the string starts with 't66', which would have to come from expanding one of the non-terminals in the S's productions.\n\nBut S's productions produce two non-terminals each. So perhaps the first two symbols come from the first two non-terminals of S's production. For example, take S -> NT12 NT12. Then, the first token is 't66', which is a terminal. So to get 't66', it must come from the terminal production of one of the NT12's.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT12 has the production: NT12 -> 't12'\n\nBut nowhere does NT12 produce 't66' except if there's a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error earlier. Looking at the grammar rules again, under NT5:\n\n\"NT5 -> 't39', 't66'\"\n\nSo NT5 can produce 't39' or 't66'. But for S -> NT12 NT12, each NT12 can only produce 't12', so the first symbol from S's first production would have to be 't12'. But our string starts with 't66', which doesn't match 't12'.

{"custom_id":"request-674","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar. The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. The string I need to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, which can produce a few different options. The first rule is S -> NT12 NT8. Then S can also produce other combinations like NT7 NT14, etc. So the first step is to see if the entire string can be broken down into parts that match these productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a long sequence of tokens: t43, t82, t48, etc. I need to see if this can be derived from S by applying the grammar rules step by step. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, all non-terminals eventually derive into terminals. Each production has exactly two non-terminals, so each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, eventually leading to the terminals.\n\nI'll start by breaking the string into parts that might match the start symbol S's initial productions. S can produce NT12 NT8, or other similar combinations. Let's consider the start production S -> NT12 NT8, which is one of the first options. So if the string can be split into NT12 and NT8 as the first two symbols, we can proceed from there.\n\nLooking at the string: t43 t82 t48 ... The first token is t43. So if NT12 can produce t43, that's a hint. Then NT8 should produce the next token, which is t82. So I'll check the rules for NT12 and NT8 to see if they can derive t43 and t82, respectively.\n\nFrom the grammar, looking at NT12 rules:\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT19 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT16 NT8\n\nNone of these directly produce t43 or t82. But wait, perhaps NT12 can eventually derive t43 and t82 through further productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another production for NT12 exists. Let's check all NT12 rules again:\nLooking through the grammar, the rules for NT12 include:\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT19 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT16 NT8\n\nWait, but none of these seem to produce t43 or t82 directly. Let me look for any NT12 rules that can lead to t43.\n\nWait, I notice that NT12 has the production NT12 -> 't12'. So if NT12 can be a terminal, then t12 is one of the terminals. Looking at the string, the first token is t43, not t12. So that's a problem. Unless t43 is somehow derived from NT12 through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The grammar rules for NT12 include NT12 -> 't12', which is a terminal. So if the string starts with t43, which is not t12, maybe we need another production for NT12 that includes t43.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules for NT12 include:\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT19 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT16 NT8\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n\nSo unless t12 is t43, which it's not, because in the string, the first token is t43, not t12. So that suggests that maybe the initial production isn't using NT12 -> 't12', but perhaps another part of the string is.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the entire string should be broken down step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each rule splits into two parts, so the string's length should be 2^n where n is the number of productions applied. The given string has 40 tokens, so 2^6=64, which doesn't match, but maybe it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, the string could be generated in a way that each step splits into two, eventually leading to all terminals. So let's try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the initial productions.\n\nLet me try to look at the string: t43, t82, t48, t43, t39, t40, t48, t73, t77, t82, t73, t65, t17, t70, t17, t48, t65, t43, t66, t40, t73, t95, t40, t40, t65, t43, t40, t53, t43, t65, t53, t65, t19, t40, t95, t66, t73, t16, t65.\n\nLet me consider the first two tokens: t43 and t82. Perhaps S -> nt12 nt8, so nt12 should produce t43, and nt8 should produce t82. So let's check if nt12 can derive t43 and if nt8 can derive t82.\n\nLooking at nt12's rules: It can produce 't12', or split into nt17 and nt8. If nt8 can produce 't82', then that's possible. But I don't see a rule for nt8 -> t82 directly. Let me check the rules for nt8:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the rules for nt8 are:\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT20\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT19\n- NT8 -> NT5 NT20\n- NT8 -> NT15 NT19\n- NT8 -> NT19 NT4\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT20\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT20\n- NT8 -> NT20 NT14\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT20\n- NT8 -> NT15 NT19\n- NT8 -> NT5 NT20\n- NT8 -> NT19 NT4\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT20\n- NT8 -> NT20 NT14\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT20\n\nNone of these rules directly produce t82. They all involve non-terminals. So that suggests that nt8 is not a terminal, which would mean that the initial production might not be S->nt12 nt8, unless one of the non-terminals can derive t82.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look further down the productions for nt8. Wait, in the grammar, there's a line that says NT8 -> 't82'. Yes, here's a rule: NT8 -> 't82'. So that means nt8 can directly produce t82. So that's promising.\n\nSo, for the first pair, S->nt12 nt8, where nt8 produces t82 directly. So the first token should be the result of nt12. But the first token is t43. So nt12 needs to derive t43.\n\nLooking at nt12's rules, does it have a production that can derive t43? Let's check.\n\nFrom the grammar, nt12 has the rule: NT12 -> 't12', NT12 -> NT17 NT8, etc. So if nt12 derives t12, that's another terminal. But the first token is t43. So unless t43 is the result of another derivation from nt12, perhaps via multiple steps.\n\nLet me check whether any rule for nt12 can produce t43. Looking at the nt12's rules again:\n\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT19 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT16 NT8\n\nNone of these directly produce t43. So that's a problem. That suggests that the initial production might not be S->nt12 nt8, because the first token is t43, which nt12 can't directly produce.\n\nSo perhaps the initial production is S->nt9 nt8. Let's check that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, another production for S is NT9 NT4, etc. Wait, no, the first rule is S->nt12 nt8. Wait, looking again: the S production is S-> NT12 NT18? No, let me check:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a typo earlier. The user provided the grammar, and it's possible that I misread it. Let me go back.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT12 NT18? Wait, no, it's S->NT12 NT12.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the tools available to me.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in a specific format with productions, and the string to test is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. My goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals have productions that directly correspond to specific tokens. For example, some NTs like NT12, NT10, NT4, etc., have productions that produce a single terminal symbol (like 't95', 't53', etc.). These terminals are part of the string provided, so I can use them to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t26 t82 t39 t70 t82 t65 t73 t65 t40 t40 t65 t43 t65 t53 t65 t61 t40 t81 t82 t73 t65 t40 t65 t43 t39 t40 t43 t53 t19 t40 t26 t73 t70 t95`\n\nI'll approach this by trying to apply the grammar rules in reverse, starting from the string and trying to reduce it to the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the string and look for any tokens that match the terminals in the grammar. The tokens in the string include t26, t82, t39, t70, etc. Let's list out the relevant productions where a non-terminal (NT) produces a single terminal:\n\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT12 -> 't12' (but in the string, no 't12')\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't12' (not in string)\n- NT14 -> 't40' is not direct, but NT20 -> 't65', etc.\n\nWait, looking again, NT5 -> 't39' so any 't39' in the string can be matched by the non-terminal NT5.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 -> 't73', as NT3-> 't73'?

Or does any NT produce 't70'? Looking at the list, yes! NT16 -> 't70'.\n\nSimilarly, check for other 't's:\n\nLooking for 't53': NT5 -> 't53' is one of the productions.\n\nt39: NT5 -> 't39'\n\nt70: NT16 -> 't70'\n\nt61: NT17 -> 't61'\n\nWait, no.

Let's look again.\n\nThe user provided a long list of rules. For example, there are entries like:\n\n\"NT12 -> 't12'\"\n\nNo, looking more carefully, I think I might have misread.

Let's check the full list:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules provided:\n\nNo, the rules provided don't seem to have any NT directly mapped to a terminal. All the rules either split into other NTs or are part of a chain leading to terminals indirectly. For example, I see:\n\nNT12 -> 't70'\n\nWait, let me check. \n\nLooking through all the rules line by line, I see at one point:\n\n\"NT12 -> 't70'\"\n\nYes, here it is: \"NT12 -> 't70'\"\n\nSimilarly, there is \"NT5 -> 't39'\", \"NT17 -> 't61'\", \"NT8 -> 't48'\", etc.\n\nSo some NTs have direct terminal mappings.

{"custom_id":"request-685","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: `t73 t65 t40 t65 t43 t65 t70 t61 t82 t40 t17 t26 t19 t81 t82 t40 t17 t65 t65 t73 t19 t82 t66 t40 t70 t48 t73 t39 t40 t82 t53 t82 t53 t40 t81 t65 t53 t82 t43 t39 t48`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and how it can generate the string. The CFG starts with the start symbol S, and from there, it branches into three different rules:\n\n1. S -> NT12 NT8\n2. S -> NT7 NT14\n3. S -> NT9 NT12\n\nEach of these intermediate symbols (NT12, NT8, NT7, NT14, NT9) then produce other symbols, which can either be terminal symbols (like 't73', 't65') or other non-terminals. The grammar seems to be fully in CNF, meaning every production is of the form A -> BC, where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, I'll need to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of such productions. The only terminal symbols present in the string are those like 't73', 't65', etc. The non-terminals are the NT segments, such as NT12, NT8, etc.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't73'. I need to find which non-terminal can produce 't73'. Looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT symbols that produce 't73', I see NT21 -> NT17 NT5, but that's not it. Another production: NT11 -> NT15 NT10, which also doesn't produce 't73'. Let me check the non-terminals:\n\nWait, the problem is that I have to find which non-terminals can derive 't73'. So, I'll check all the NT rules for 't73'. Looking through the list, I spot NT11 -> NT15 NT10, but that doesn't help. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me go through the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- NT21-> NT17 NT5\n- NT17-> NT13 NT4\n- NT13-> NT5 NT14\n- NT5-> NT17 NT4\n- NT14-> NT4 NT0\n- NT0-> NT6 NT10\n- NT9-> NT6 NT9\n- NT7-> NT2 NT11\n- NT12-> NT17 NT8\n- NT8-> NT4 NT20\n- NT20-> NT10 NT3\n- NT3-> NT16 NT5\n- NT16-> NT7 NT20\n- NT7-> NT7 NT12\n- NT5-> NT13 NT7\n- NT3-> NT5 NT14\n- NT1-> NT14 NT6\n- NT6-> NT3 NT21\n- NT9-> NT6 NT15\n- NT4-> NT11 NT20\n- NT2-> NT11 NT17\n- NT2-> NT5 NT20\n- NT2-> NT7 NT16\n- NT2-> NT0 NT16\n- NT6-> NT2 NT10\n- NT17-> NT8 NT10\n- NT3-> NT0 NT13\n- NT11-> NT0 NT11\n- NT1-> NT1 NT8\n- NT9-> NT0 NT19\n- NT2-> NT21 NT4\n- NT12-> 't95'\nWait, wait! Oh, I see. There are some rules where the NT symbol is directly connected to a terminal symbol. For example:\n\n- NT12 -> 't95'\n- NT10 -> 't53'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't16'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT15 -> 't82'\n- NT5 -> 't82' (duplicate)\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT4 -> 't17'\n- NT9 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT17 -> 't61'\n- NT13 -> 't82'\n- NT3 -> 't81'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT8 -> 't48'\n- AND SO ON... Wait, no, actually, checking through all the rules, only certain ones produce terminal symbols, like NT12 -> 't95', NT10->'t53', etc.\n\nSo, the string has 't73', which would correspond to NT10 -> 't73', since looking through the rules I see NT10 -> 't73' (the second occurrence: NT10 -> 't73').\n\nSo, the first token is 't73' -> NT10. Now, the production for NT10 is: NT10 -> 't73'. Since it's a direct production to a terminal, that's the way it goes. So, the first step is S->S needs to produce something. But wait, in the grammar, the top-level productions are S->NT12 NT8, S->NT7 NT14, S->NT9 NT12.\n\nSo, our string starts with 't73', which is from NT10. So, where does NT10 come from? Looking at the rules, does any of the S productions lead to NT10 as part of the string? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the S rules, none of them directly produce NT10. S produces combinations of NT12, NT8, etc. So maybe our approach should be to work backward from the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the parse tree starting from the string and trying to see if it can be derived using the grammar. So the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, and we need to see if they can be produced by the given CFG.\n\nAnother approach is to check whether the string can be split in a way that each part matches the production rules. Since it's a context-free grammar with CNF, each step is replacing a non-terminal with two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals), and ultimately, the entire string is built by combining two symbols at each step.\n\nBut starting with the string, perhaps it's easier to see if the entire string can be divided into pairs of symbols that match the productions. For example, if the entire string can be split such that each pair of consecutive symbols is a production from the grammar.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is A->BC, so in the string, each unit is a B and C. So the string should be split into pairs where each pair is the result of a production.\n\nSo, for example, the string \"t73 t65 t40 t65 ...\", perhaps the first pair is t73 and t65, which if they form a production, that's possible.\n\nLooking through the grammar, which NTs produce t73 and t65?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nt73 is produced by NT10: NT10 -> 't73'\n\nt65 is produced by NT4, for example, NT4->'t65'\n\nWait, but NT4 can also be generated by other rules, such as NT4-> NT11 NT20, which is a production.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t73->NT10, and t65 as produced by, say, NT4->'t65'.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the way to split the string. Alternatively, maybe some longer sequences can be built by combining non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a parsing problem. Starting from the overall structure, seeing which non-terminals can produce sequences that correspond to the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find an analysis of the string by recursively applying the grammar rules.\n\nWait, maybe the easiest way is to consider that the string must be a concatenation of terminal symbols that can be generated by the grammar, with each symbol being either directly generated by a non-terminal or part of a derivation sequence.\n\nBut this might be too complex. Let me see if I can outline the possible steps:\n\n1. The string starts with t73. So, the first symbol t73 corresponds to NT10->'t73'.\n\n2.

Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule will either produce two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see it's a bit extensive. Let me list some of the production rules for clarity. I notice that the start symbol is S, which has several productions, each involving NT12 and other non-terminals leading to terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given seems to consist solely of terminal symbols, so I need to check if there's a derivation sequence that can transform S into this string using the provided rules. Since the string is quite long, I should look for patterns or repeated segments that might correspond to certain non-terminals.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into parts and see if they can be matched with any terminal productions in the grammar. For instance, I see 't95' appears at the beginning. Looking at the grammar, there's a rule NT12 \u2192 't12' and another NT12 \u2192 't12', but 't95' isn't directly a terminal in any NT12 production. Wait, actually, looking again, there are several NT12 productions:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT12 \u2192 NT12 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT8\n- NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT8\n\nBut I don't see 't95' in any of these. Wait, looking more carefully, under NT3, I see NT3 \u2192 't95'. So 't95' is produced by NT3. So in the string, the first 't95' must come from NT3.\n\nNext, looking at the next part after 't95', we have 't65'. Does 't65' appear as a terminal elsewhere? Yes, under NT4: NT4 \u2192 't65' (among others), and also NT5 \u2192 't17' etc. So 't65' seems to be a terminal in NT4.\n\nNow, after 't95 t65', the next is 't48 t26 t65 ...' So after 't95' (from NT3), perhaps it goes to 't65' which could be from NT4. But I need to see how the productions work.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the entire string can be generated by expanding S step by step, ensuring that each step follows the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the string using the given grammar. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to reconstruct a parse tree that breaks it down according to the grammar.\n\nI'll try to split the string into smaller parts that correspond to the terminals each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has several productions from S. For example, S can produce NT12 NT12 followed by other symbols. Wait, but in the given grammar, looking at S, it's written as S -> NT12 NT12, S -> NT7 NT14, etc. Wait, actually, the way it's written seems a bit confusing, but each production starts with S and is followed by two non-terminals. For example:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nWait, but perhaps the production S -> NT12 NT12 would produce something like ... So to get a string of terminals, each non-terminal will eventually produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't95', which as I noticed earlier comes from NT3 \u2192 't95'. So maybe the first step is to consider that S \u2192 ... and one of those non-terminals is NT3.\n\nWait, no. Let me see. The S productions all start with S \u2192 NTx NTy, so each production of S is two non-terminals, each of which must expand into one or more symbols to get the string of terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to backtrack from the string. Let me see the first few tokens: t95, t65, t48, t26, t65, t82, etc.\n\nt95 is from NT3, as per the grammar. So perhaps part of S's expansion involves NT3. Similarly, t65 could be from NT4.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal corresponds to certain terminals, so I can create a map:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t19\nNT2 \u2192 t17, t65, t53, etc.\nNT3 \u2192 t95, t82\nNT4 \u2192 t65, t4, etc.\nNT5 \u2192 t39, etc.\nNT6 \u2192 t21, etc.\nNT7 \u2192 t77, t73, etc.\nNT8 \u2192 t48, etc.\nNT9 \u2192 t77, t66, etc.\nNT10 \u2192 t53, t43, etc.\n\nSo perhaps each step in the derivation would involve choosing a production for a non-terminal, and then expanding further until only terminals remain.\n\nHowever, since the string is quite long, it's impractical to manually expand it. Instead, I can use dynamic programming to check if the string can be parsed according to the grammar. Alternatively, I can look for any known patterns or repetitions in the grammar that can help.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals might be recurrent. For example, NT4 \u2192 't65' as a terminal. Also, NT12 has several productions, including NT12 \u2192 't12', NT12 \u2192 NT12 NT8, etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with t95, which is from NT3, and the next is t65, which could be from NT4. Alternatively, perhaps the derivation is:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12 (from the production S -> NT12 NT12)\nBut wait, looking back, S is initially written as S -> NT12 NT12? Or is it written correctly? Wait, the given grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT12 NT12\nS -> NT7 NT14\nS -> NT9 NT12\n\nYes, the first production of S is NT12 NT12, not NT12 followed by something else. So perhaps the first expansion is S \u2192 NT12 NT12, which would then each NT12 can expand further.\n\nLet's consider that S \u2192 NT12 NT12. Then, the first NT12 would produce something, perhaps t95, and the second NT12 would produce the next part.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe first part is 't95', which is from NT3, but in the production chain from S, we have NT12, not NT3. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.\n\nWait, maybe I need to correct myself. The productions of S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT12 NT12\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\nS \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nSo perhaps the first step is that S expands into two non-terminals, say, A and B, each of which can expand into more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut to produce the string, which is all terminals, eventually, each non-terminal must resolve into a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps S can be expanded into NT7 and NT14. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT14\n\nNow, NT7 can produce various things. Looking at NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT11\nNT7 \u2192 NT7 NT12\nNT7 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n\nSimilarly, NT14 \u2192 NT4 NT0, and so on.\n\nWait, but this seems complex. Maybe I should approach this by identifying segments of the string that match the possible terminals of certain non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t95, t65. From earlier, t95 is produced by NT3, but S's productions involve NT12, NT7, etc. Wait, perhaps there's a way through the grammar to get t95 from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.
