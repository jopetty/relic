{"custom_id":"request-3","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string 't26' to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production has at most two symbols on the right. The starting symbol is S.\n\nThe given grammar has multiple non-terminal symbols like S, NT0, NT1, up to NT84, and some terminals like 't' followed by numbers, and a few are 't25', 't8', etc.\n\nThe string to check is 't26'. So, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me look for any production that directly produces 't26'. Scanning through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> 't26'.\n\nSo, if NT36 can be derived, then 't26' is a terminal string from that production.\n\nNow, I need to check if NT36 is reachable from the start symbol S. So, let's trace back how NT36 can be formed.\n\nLooking for NT36 production rules, I see:\n\n1. NT36 -> 't84 NT77'\n2. NT36 -> 't50 NT44'\n3. NT36 -> 't84 NT53' (Wait, that's from NT36 -> NT84 NT53)\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, the production NT36 has multiple rules. Let me list them:\n\n- NT36 -> NT84 NT53\n- NT36 -> NT50 NT36\n- NT36 -> NT42\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\nNT36 -> NT50 NT36\nNT36 -> NT42\n\nSo, the third option is NT36 -> 't42' (Is that correct? Or did I misread? Wait, looking back:\n\nActually, in the given grammar, I see lines:\n\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\nNT36 -> NT50 NT36\nNT36 -> NT42\n\nBut wait, looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n\nYes, in the line:\n\nNT36 -> 't42'\n\nSo, the third production is NT36 directly producing 't42'. That's helpful because it means if I can derive NT36, I can get 't42' as part of the string. But wait, I need to get 't26'. Hmm, but I thought we had a production NT36 -> 't26', and another to 't42'. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the given productions, under NT36:\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe given NT36 productions are:\n\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\nNT36 -> NT50 NT36\nNT36 -> NT42\nAnd also:\n\nWait, I missed some. Let me list all NT36 productions:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT36 -> NT84 NT53\n- NT36 -> NT50 NT36\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n\nWait, is there a 't26' production? Checking the provided grammar:\n\nWait, under NT5-> 't9 NT53'\n\nUnder NT7-> 't11'\n\nUnder NT2-> 't5'\n\nUnder NT47-> 't84'\n\nUnder NT23-> 't14'\n\nLooking for 't26', I see under NT9 -> 't26'. Oh, that's a different NT9.\n\nWait, but I'm focusing on NT36. So, from NT36, the possible terminals are 't26' and 't42'? Wait no, let me check the given productions again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the provided grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't26' (so production 1 for NT9)\n- NT36 -> 't42' (production 2 for NT36)\n- Then, under NT36, it also has:\n\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\nNT36 -> NT50 NT36\n\nWait, so in the given grammar, under NT36, there are three productions:\n\n1. NT36 -> NT84 NT53\n2. NT36 -> NT50 NT36\n3. NT36 -> 't42'\n\nSo, when can NT36 derive a terminal string like 't26'? It doesn't seem directly. Unless 't26' is derived through another NT.\n\nWait, but the string is 't26' (a single terminal symbol). So, in the grammar, we have NT9 -> 't26'. So, if somewhere in the derivation, we have NT9, then it can produce 't26'.\n\nSo, can NT36 be derived into NT9?\n\nLooking at the productions, is there a way for NT36 to derive NT9?\n\nLooking at the productions for NT36:\n\nNT36 has rules:\n\n- NT36 -> NT84 NT53\n- NT36 -> NT50 NT36\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n\nThese are all terminal or non-terminal. So, starting from NT36, can we reach NT9?\n\nHmm. Let's see if there are any productions that link NT36 to NT9 or if NT9 can be derived from other symbols.\n\nLooking through the grammar, maybe NT9 can be reached from other NTs.\n\nFor example, looking at NT5's production:\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53\n\nSo, NT5 can produce NT9, which could be a path.\n\nLet me see if NT5 can be derived from NT36.\n\nSo, if NT36 can derive NT5, then from NT5 we can get 't26' via the production.\n\nSo, can NT36 derive NT5?\n\nLooking at the NT36 productions again, the first two are non-terminals.\n\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\n\nSo, NT36 can't directly go to NT5 here. But perhaps via the second production.\n\nNT36 -> NT50 NT36 (so, it can be represented as NT50 NT36 NT50 ... recursively, which would lead to an infinite loop unless it eventually reaches a terminal.)\n\nWait, but NT50's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT50 in the given list except for the NT47 production: which is NT47 -> 't84', etc.\n\nWait, actually, let's look for NT50.\n\nIn the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT40 -> NT58 NT39\n- NT44 -> NT83 NT7\n- NT27 -> NT60 NT47\n- NT23 -> NT61 NT74\n- NT9 -> NT36 NT45\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT53\n- NT71 -> NT12 NT84\n- NT52 -> NT9 NT0\n- NT61 -> NT53 NT12\n- NT45 -> 't84'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT39 -> 't28'\n- NT13 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT81 -> 't71'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't83'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't59'\n- NT52 -> 't71'\n- NT81 -> 't30'\n- NT60 -> 't84'\n- NT81 -> 't3'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't52'\n- NT50 -> 't49'\n- NT83 -> 't30'\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT22 -> 't42'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT61 -> 't13'\n\nWait, looking for NT50:\n\nIt's not directly in the list, except perhaps in the NT27 production.

{"custom_id":"request-6","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string 't11' that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the application of parsing algorithms, but for this problem, I just need to check if 't11' can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are several non-terminals (like S, NT5, NT9, etc.) that eventually produce terminals like 't25', 't8', 't77', etc. The string I'm checking is 't11'. I'll need to see if 't11' is directly produced by any non-terminal. \n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT75 produces 't32', not 't11'. NT50 produces 't49'. NT45 has a production to 't60' and 't77' among others, but I don't see 't11' there. Wait, looking deeper, there's an NT77 production which leads to 't8'. Hmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again. The non-terminals that directly produce terminals are the ones ending with 't', like NT45 \u2192 't25', NT77 \u2192 't72', NT50 \u2192 't49', etc. I'm specifically looking for where a production directly results in 't11'. \n\nScanning through all the productions, I don't see any direct production that results in 't11'. All terminals are for 't' followed by numbers like 25, 77, 78, etc., but 't11' isn't listed. \n\nIs there an indirect way? Maybe through a series of productions that lead to 't11'? Let's think about the start symbol S. S produces NT45 NT81. Each of these is a non-terminal. Let's see what each produces. \n\nNT45 \u2192 't25' (from NT45 \u2192 't25'), NT81 \u2192 't30' (from NT81 \u2192 't30'). Wait, so S \u2192 't25' 't30', which is 't25t30', not 't11'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a path. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the productions. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar: Oh, there's NT71 \u2192 't52' and NT40 \u2192 't39', but I don't see how any of these connect to 't11'. Maybe I need to follow the derivations. \n\nLet me think about possible derivations. The string to derive is 't11'. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting from S \u2192 NT45 NT81, leading to 't25' and 't30', which gives 't25t30'\u2014definitely not 't11'. \n\nBut maybe there's another way. Wait, perhaps S can produce other combinations. Looking at S's rules, another option is S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So NT19 and NT67. Let's see what they produce. \n\nLooking at NT19 \u2192 't84' and 't8' (from NT19 \u2192 't84' NT8, and NT8 \u2192 't83'). Oh, wait, I think I'm getting tangled here. Let me parse this carefully.\n\nWait, actually, NT19 produces 't84' and another non-terminal. So breaking down S \u2192 NT19 NT67, we have NT19 \u2192 't84' and 't8'. Wait, no, let me see: NT19's productions are NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, which then the right-hand side would need to produce 't11'. \n\nThis seems too convoluted. Let me approach this differently. Since the string is 't11', it must be a terminal symbol. Therefore, it must be directly produced by some non-terminal A \u2192 a. So, I need to check if any production's right-hand side directly includes 't11'.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't11'. All terminals are combinations like 't25', 't77', 't84', etc. Therefore, 't11' cannot be directly derived from any single production.\n\nTherefore, since there's no production that directly generates 't11', the string is not in the language.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production is A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start which might produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and its productions lead to combinations of two non-terminals.

Actually, in CNF, each production should have two non-terminals on the right. So the only way a terminal can appear in the string is through a production that directly produces that terminal. Wait, but looking at the right-hand sides, I see that some productions have a terminal as part of more than two symbols. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. So perhaps the way this is structured, the terminals are derived from specific non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check again. For example, looking at NT45 \u2192 't25' isn't a production\u2014it seems that those non-terminals are directly producing terminals. Oh, no, actually, looking back, each production in CNF for this grammar must have exactly two non-terminals except for the base case. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must have two non-terminals except the start symbol which can go to a terminal. Wait, but in the given grammar, I see rules like S \u2192 NT45 NT81, which is okay because it's two non-terminals. Then, for example, NT45 \u2192 't25' seems to directly produce a terminal, which doesn't fit CNF since CNF requires each production on the right to be non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the grammar.\n\nWait, but the user provided the grammar, so perhaps some rules are exceptions, or maybe the grammar isn't in pure CNF. Let me double-check. The user said the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production must be of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal directly. So perhaps certain non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the last step where the start symbol can produce a terminal. So perhaps in this grammar, there are some non-terminals that directly produce terminals, making it a slightly different form but consistent with CNF where the base symbols can produce terminals without decomposition.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, many rules have a terminal on the right side, which contradicts CNF. For example, NT45 \u2192 't25' is a rule where a terminal is on the right, which isn't allowed in CNF because each production must have two non-terminals. Therefore, I must have misread the grammar or perhaps it's mixed up.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the grammar carefully. Oh, I think I see the issue. Each production in the grammar should have exactly two non-terminals on the right. So if any production has a terminal and a non-terminal, that would not be in CNF. Therefore, perhaps the right-hand side of the productions must consist of two non-terminals only.\n\nWait, let's check the given grammar again. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81: that's two non-terminals, fine. S \u2192 NT19 NT67: two non-terminals. Then NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75: two non-terminals. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 NT47 NT53: two non-terminals. NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13: two non-terminals. NT74 \u2192 NT72 NT5: two non-terminals.\n\nContinuing: NT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53: two non-terminals. NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45: two non-terminals. NT36 \u2192 NT50 NT36: two non-terminals. Wait, this is problematic because NT36 appears on both sides. So production NT36 \u2192 NT50 NT36 is a loop, which is allowed, but in CNF it should be decomposed further until terminals are reached.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81: two non-terminals. NT71 \u2192 NT9 NT75: two non-terminals. NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT47: two non-terminals. NT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52: two non-terminals. NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8: two non-terminals (wait, NT8 is a terminal? But in CNF, this would be a problem unless NT8 can decompose further into non-terminals only.\n\nSimilarly, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77: two non-terminals. NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44: two non-terminals. NT40 \u2192 NT14 NT71: two non-terminals. NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5: two non-terminals. Wait, so some NT rules have a terminal on the right, which isn't allowed in CNF.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe the confusion is that the grammar isn't in pure CNF but perhaps a mix. Regardless, perhaps the user intended it to be in CNF, so I need to proceed accordingly.\n\nAnyway, the string is \"t77 t8\". So let's build the parse tree from the bottom up.\n\nFirst, the string has two tokens: \"t77\" and \"t8\". Each of these can be terminals derived from non-terminals.\n\nStarting with \"t77\". Looking for a production in the grammar where a non-terminal produces 't77'. Scanning the rules, I see NT75 \u2192 't32', but that's different. NT27 \u2192 't35'... Not helpful. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't8' ? Let me check. Looking through the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces 't77'. Wait, no, so how can 't77' appear in the string?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't77' is part of a larger production that is reduced step by step. For instance, perhaps through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45. Then NT36\u2192 NT84 NT53, and NT45\u2192't25'. So 't25' wouldn't contribute to 't77'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look for any non-terminal that directly produces 't77'. Scanning all rules, I don't see any. The only one I can think of is perhaps NT44 \u2192 't59' or something else. Hmm, this suggests that 't77' might not be directly produced by any non-terminal, which would mean it's impossible to derive 't77' in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through a combination.

{"custom_id":"request-14","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t25 t82\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. The start symbol is S, which can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So, any string generated by this grammar must start at S.\n\nLooking at the given string \"t25 t82\", it's two terminals separated by a space. That means the entire string should be derived from applying productions until all symbols are terminals. In CNF, the only place a terminal can appear is in a production that directly outputs a symbol, like A \u2192 a.\n\nStarting from S, let's see the possible derivations. S can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Both are non-terminals, so the first step is to substitute one or the other.\n\nLet's try S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Now, NT45 and NT81 need to be expanded. Let's look at NT45's productions. From the grammar, NT45 can go to NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44, or directly to 't25' if any of these productions have a terminal. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, I see NT45 \u2192 't25' is one of the rules. So, NT45 can produce 't25'. \n\nIf NT45 is replaced by 't25', then we have 't25' followed by NT81. Now, NT81 can produce 't30' or other non-terminals. Let's check NT81's rules. Looking at the grammar, NT81 \u2192 't71' is a rule. Wait, no, looking back, the NT81 rule is actually two lines: NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT82 and NT81 \u2192 't3'. So, 't3' is a terminal production for NT81. \n\nSo, if NT81 is replaced by 't3', then the string becomes 't25 t3'. But the given string is 't25 t82'. Hmm, that's a mismatch. Maybe I took the wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there's another way to get 't82'. Wait, looking at the NT82 rules, I see that it's a non-terminal because it's not a terminal in the grammar. So, NT82 must be expanded further, which probably would take quite a few steps. But the given string ends with 't82', which is a terminal. So, maybe NT82 has a production that directly includes 't82', but I don't see that in the given grammar. Wait, looking through the productions, I don't see NT82 producing a terminal, so maybe it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial split is wrong. Let's consider S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Then, NT19 can go to NT84 NT8 or directly to 't47'. Let's see NT19 \u2192 't47'. So, if NT19 is replaced by 't47', then we have 't47' followed by NT67. Now, NT67 can produce 't30' or 't2', right? Looking at the grammar, NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2 or 't53', but wait, in the given grammar, NT67's productions are:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2  \nNT67 \u2192 't53'\n\nSo, NT67 can produce 't53'. If we take that, then the string becomes 't47 t53', not 't25 t82'.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not the right path either. Let's try another approach. Maybe 't25' comes from NT45, as we saw. So, if S \u2192 NT45 NT81 leads to 't25' for NT45, then NT81 must produce 't25'. But looking at NT81's rules, the only way to get a terminal is through NT81 \u2192 't3' or NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT82. So, 't82' doesn't directly appear except if we have a chain that ends with it. But the string is \"t25 t82\", so both are terminals. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's double-check the NT81 rule. From the grammar, the rules for NT81 are:\n- NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT82\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo, NT81 must expand to a non-terminal followed by NT82 or directly to 't3'. So, to get 't82', maybe NT82 is a terminal? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I don't see any production for NT82 where it directly goes to a terminal. So, NT82 is a non-terminal and must be expanded further. The only way 't82' would appear is if NT82 \u2192 't82' directly, but I don't see that in the grammar. Alternatively, if NT82 can derive to a terminal through some path.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the string given is \"t25 t82\", so perhaps I missed a production for NT82 that results in 't82'. Let me check the grammar again for NT82. Hmm, the provided grammar doesn't have any rule for NT82 where it directly produces a terminal. But wait, looking at NT72's rule: NT72 \u2192 't10' might not be NT82. Let me scan again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Wait, the grammar includes:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't22'\n\nSo, maybe NT82 can somehow lead to 't82' via a chain of productions. Let's see if there's a path. For example, perhaps NT82 \u2192 NT72 NT2 or something else. Wait, looking at NT82's rules, no, the only NT82 rule is NT82 \u2192 NT72, I don't think. Wait, wait, looking through the given rules:\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 't10'?\n\nNo, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me scan all the NT rules to see if NT82 has any terminal production. I don't see any rule where NT82 directly goes to a terminal. So, NT82 must derive through non-terminals. Therefore, 't82' cannot be a terminal in the string unless one of the non-terminals directly produces it. Since NT82 doesn't have such a rule, that string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me start over.\n\nOur goal is to get 't25 t82'. So, the entire string must be derived from the grammar. Let me consider possible derivations.\n\nStarting with S, which can go to either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nNT45 can go to 't25' \u2192 so that would produce 't25' followed by NT81.\n\nNow, NT81 can go to 't3' or NT30 NT82. We need the second part to produce 't82'. But since NT81 can't directly produce 't82', unless NT82 can go to 't82' directly, which it doesn't. But maybe through a chain. Wait, does NT81 derive into NT82?\n\nWait, looking at NT81, after expanding, it's followed by NT82. So, to get 't82', we need NT82 to produce 't82', but as per the grammar, none of the NT82 rules produce a terminal. Therefore, it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try the other branch: S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nNT19 can produce 't47' or further. Let's take NT19 \u2192 't47', so 't47' followed by NT67.\n\nNT67 \u2192 't53' or NT30 NT2.\n\nIf we take NT67 \u2192 't53', the string becomes 't47 t53' which doesn't match 't25 t82'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a longer derivation is needed. Let's explore more.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT45 NT81. NT45 \u2192 't25', so we have 't25' followed by NT81.\n\nNT81 can go to NT30 NT82. So, now we have 't25' followed by NT30 NT82. Now, NT30 is a non-terminal, so it needs to be expanded.

{"custom_id":"request-32","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t42 t3 t77\" is generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with various production rules, and I have to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a CFG in CNF has production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which simplifies parsing but may also make it tricky for manual analysis.\n\nThe given string is \"t42 t3 t77\". I notice that each token is either a terminal or part of a non-terminal production, but in this case, the entire string consists of terminals. So, I need to see if the start symbol S can produce a sequence that results in exactly these terminals in the correct order.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some production rules that directly terminate with terminals. For example:\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- And others like NT7 \u2192 't11', etc.\n\nMy approach will be to work backwards from the string and see if each terminal can be matched by a production rule. Since the string is a sequence of three terminals, I need to check if there's a way to split this into production steps that lead to this sequence.\n\nLet's break down the string into individual tokens: \"t42\", \"t3\", \"t77\".\n\nI'll start from the end. The last token is \"t77\". Looking at the grammar, I see that NT77 \u2192 't8'. So, \"t77\" must correspond to NT77. The next token is \"t3\", looking for where 't3' is a terminal. Checking the grammar, I don't see NT3 as a terminal; the closest might be NT36 \u2192 't42', but that's a different token. Alternatively, maybe 't3' is a terminal elsewhere. Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any production rule that directly ends with 't3', unless I'm missing it.\n\nWait, let's check again. The rules include NT13 -> 't47', NT22 -> 't22', etc. But 't3' doesn't appear as a terminal. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the string is generated. Alternatively, perhaps the string doesn't consist of standalone terminals but is part of a sequence from the grammar productions. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe each token in the string is part of a longer derivation. For example, \"t42\" could be part of a longer production like NT45 \u2192 ... which eventually produces 't42'. Let me map it out.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see that NT45 has a production: NT45 \u2192 't25' directly. Also, there's NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, which would produce 't25' via NT60 \u2192 't84' and NT77 \u2192 't8'. Wait, but that might be more complicated.\n\nWait, the string is \"t42 t3 t77\". Let me see where each of these can come from.\n\n- \"t42\" is 't42', I need to see if any non-terminal directly ends with 't42'. Looking at the grammar, there's NT44 \u2192 't59' and NT27 \u2192 't76', NT40 \u2192 't39', NT36 \u2192 't42' (as per rule: NT36 \u2192 't42'), wait no: looking up, actually, there are multiple NT36 productions. Specifically, I see:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53 and NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44, etc. Wait, no, let's check:\n\nWait, actually, the grammar provided includes:\n\nLooking for 't42':\n\nIn the rules, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> 't42' (Yes, there's a rule NT36 \u2192 't42')\n\nAlso, NT27 \u2192 't76', NT22 \u2192 't22', etc. So \"t42\" can be generated by NT36.\n\nSimilarly, \"t3\" is tricky because I don't see any NT that produces 't3', but perhaps \"t3\" is part of a longer production. Wait, let me check the grammar for 't3' anywhere.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT19 \u2192 't84'\n- NT61 \u2192 't53'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT23 \u2192 't14'\n- NT71 \u2192 't52'\n- NT50 \u2192 't49'\n- NT83 \u2192 't30'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't42'\n\nWait, none of these produce 't3', so \"t3\" is perhaps a separate token. But how can we have \"t3\" in the string? Since all the productions either lead to terminals or non-terminals. Unless \"t3\" is part of a longer production.\n\nWait, unless \"t3\" is part of the NT rule:\n\nLooking, I don't see a terminal 't3' in the grammar. So perhaps that's a dead end. So the string \"t42 t3 t77\" includes \"t3\", which doesn't appear directly in any production as a terminal. Therefore, unless \"t3\" is generated through some non-terminal, but I can't find any production that ends with 't3'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"t3\" is part of a larger sequence that produces something else, but in the given string, it's just \"t3\" as a separate token. So perhaps the string can't be generated because \"t3\" isn't present as a terminal in any rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's re-examine the grammar rules to confirm.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't25'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT36 \u2192 't42'\n- And so on.\n\nI don't see any rule for NT producing 't3'. Therefore, \"t3\" cannot be generated directly. But in the string, it's a standalone token. Unless the string is part of a larger production where \"t3\" is an intermediate step, but since it's a terminal in the string, that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe \"t3\" is part of a production that produces another non-terminal. But for a given string in terminals, the entire string must be formed by terminal symbols, so if any token in the string is not a terminal, and that terminal doesn't exist in the grammar, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nTherefore, since \"t3\" isn't a terminal in any of the grammar's rules, the string \"t42 t3 t77\" cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a rule where \"t3\" is present. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't25' (t25)\n- NT77 \u2192 't8' (t8)\n- NT84 \u2192 't77' (t77)\n- NT36 \u2192 't42' (t42)\n- NT44 \u2192 't59' (t59)\n- NT77 \u2192 't8' (again)\n- And other rules don't produce 't3'.\n\nSo yes, 't3' is not a terminal. Therefore, the string is invalid because \"t3\" isn't in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains \"t3\", which is not a terminal in the provided grammar.

So, if NT45 can expand to 't25', that's a terminal. So, for NT45, maybe it can produce 't25', which is different from our string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't76'. Let me check if NT45 can expand to 't76' somehow. Looking through NT45's productions: NT45 can go to NT50 NT44 or 't25'. So, 't25' is a possibility, but 't76' isn't one of the terminals directly from NT45.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through other non-terminals. For example, NT45 can produce NT50 NT44, and if NT50 can produce something, and NT44 can produce something else. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT44's productions: NT44 \u2192 NT30 NT7, and NT44 can also produce 't59' or 't76' because I see another production: NT44 \u2192 't76'. So, 't76' is one possibility.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT44, there's NT44 \u2192 't76' as a production. So, that's a direct way. So, if NT45 can produce NT44, which then can produce 't76', that starts things off.\n\nBut NT45's production to 't25' isn't helpful here because the string starts with 't76'. So, focusing on NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44.\n\nNow, let's look at NT50. NT50 \u2192 NT49, so it's just a chain. But in the given productions, NT50 doesn't have more options except maybe being reduced further. Wait, looking again, the productions for NT50: only NT49, so it's a single step. But then NT49 isn't defined, meaning it's a terminal? Or maybe not. Wait, let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, NT49 is not listed as any production, which suggests it's a terminal symbol. But none of the terminals are named NT49. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't26'. So, maybe NT49 is a terminal that produces something else. But in the given list, I don't see a production for NT49. So, perhaps NT49 is a terminal, but it's not listed here, meaning it's not part of the grammar, so it can't produce anything. Therefore, NT49 would be a terminal that's undefined, but since the problem doesn't show its expansion, we can't use it. That might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the productions again to see if NT49 is defined. Looking through the list, I don't see any production for NT49, which suggests that NT49 is a terminal because it's not defined as a non-terminal. So, in that case, NT50 \u2192 NT49 would require NT49 to expand into a terminal, but since it's not defined, it's stuck, so NT50 can't produce anything meaningful. Therefore, that path might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake, and NT49 is actually defined. Let me check the list again. No, it's not there. So, that suggests that NT49 is a terminal, which implies that this path might not help us reach 't76'.\n\nSo, back to NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44. Since NT50 leads to NT49, which can't produce anything useful, perhaps we can disregard that path. So, maybe the other production of NT45 is the only way, which is 't25'. But 't25' doesn't match 't76' either. So, maybe that path doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider other productions for S. Let's look at the second option: S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nSo, NT19 and NT67. Let's see what each of these can be.\n\nLooking at NT19, its productions are: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, and also a production NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5.\n\nSo, first, NT19 can produce NT84 NT8, or NT60 NT5.\n\nLet's consider NT67 first, as it's in S's second production. NT67's productions are NT23 NT45, or it can produce 't30'.\n\nWait, looking at the list, NT67 \u2192 't77' and NT67 \u2192 't30' as well. So, that's a production. So, from S \u2192 NT19 NT67, we can have NT67 produce 't30' or 't77'.\n\nBut in the string, the last token is 't71', so maybe 't77' is not helpful. Wait, no, the last token is 't71', which isn't directly in the S's productions. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me focus.\n\nWait, our string is `t76 t8 t71`. So, the three tokens in order should come from S's expansion.\n\nFrom S, we can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nFrom NT19 NT67, the first production of NT19 is NT84 NT8, which would be a sequence. But let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT84 can expand into something. Let me check NT84's productions. NT84 \u2192 NT72 NT5 or 't77'. So, as before, either 't77' or another non-terminal.\n\nBut in our string, we need 't76', so maybe that's not the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the other production for S, which is S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nWait, perhaps I should follow NT67's expansion. So, NT67 can produce 't77' or 't30'. Neither of those match 't76' or 't8' or 't71'. So, that path might not help.\n\nWait, unless there's a way to combine NT81 into producing 't81', but our string ends with 't71', which isn't directly present.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nLet me see if I can reach 't76' by another path.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nSo, NT45 needs to produce 't76' somewhere, but NT45 can produce NT50 NT44 or 't25'. 't25' doesn't help, and NT50 might not help because NT50 \u2192 NT49. Wait, unless NT49 can produce 't76' in some way. But if NT49 is a terminal, unless it's defined, it can't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT45 can produce NT44 (as in NT45 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-61","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t25 t52 t33 t52\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right side. That structure might help me parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice the string consists of four tokens: t25, t52, t33, t52. Each of these must correspond to some terminals in the grammar. My goal is to see if I can derive this string by applying the grammar's rules step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are some rules where non-terminals produce terminals. Let me list those out:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't84'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT14 \u2192 't52'\n- NT36 \u2192 't42'\n- NT27 \u2192 't35'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT81 \u2192 't30'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT12 \u2192 't3'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT71 \u2192 't52'\n- NT50 \u2192 't49'\n- NT83 \u2192 't30'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't42'\n\nHmm, not all terminals are directly mapped, but some are. Let's check each token in the string:\n\n1. t25: I see there's a rule NT25 \u2192 t33. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the grammar, NT25 is not a terminal, but according to the rules:\n\nLooking again, NT25 is actually a rule: NT25 \u2192 t33. Wait, okay, so NT25 produces t33. So that's a direct terminal. So for t25, we have to look for a rule where a non-terminal produces t25. Wait, in the grammar provided, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't25'. Only NT25 \u2192 t33, so maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, the rule is NT25 \u2192 t33, so t25 can't come directly from that. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's see, in the string, the first token is t25. I need to find a rule that produces t25. Looking through the rules, I don't see any production that directly produces 't25'. Hmm, that might be a problem. Or did I miss it?\n\nWait, let's look through the rules again. Looking at the given rules, I don't see any production rule that ends with 't25'. So I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps 't25' isn't a terminal but a non-terminal. But then, in the string, it's 't25' as a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rules like NT25 \u2192 t33, which means that NT25 is a non-terminal that produces the string 't33'. So, in the string, when I see 't25', I need a production rule that either directly produces it or can derive 't25' through some steps. But looking at the rules, I don't see any rule that has 't25' as the terminal output. So maybe this is a problem because 't25' isn't being produced by any rule.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's written as \"t25 t52 t33 t52\". So each of these is a separate token, each being a terminal. Therefore, each must be produced by some rule. But for 't25', I don't see a production rule in the grammar that does that. Because all rules ending with a terminal seem to produce things like t26, t52, etc. So perhaps the string can't be derived because 't25' isn't present in any rule's production.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm looking at the rules wrong. Let me check again. For example, the rule says NT25 \u2192 t33. So NT25 is a non-terminal that produces the string 't33'. But that means 't33' is a terminal, not a non-terminal. So in the string, 't25' would have to come from a rule where the non-terminal divides into other non-terminals or terminals. But I don't see any rule that produces 't25' directly or through a chain leading to 't25'.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider each token in the string and see if they can be produced by some rule.\n\n1. t25: As I can't find a rule that ends with 't25', perhaps this is a problem. Unless there's an implicit rule I'm missing.\n\n2. t52: There's a rule NT14 \u2192 t52, so that's fine. So t52 can be directly produced.\n\n3. t33: There's a rule NT25 \u2192 t33, but as we've established, 't25' isn't a terminal but would produce t33 from NT25. Wait, I'm confused. Let's clarify:\n\nIn the given rules, NT14 \u2192 t52. So if I have t52 in the string, that's fine. For t33, it's produced by NT25 \u2192 t33. But in the string, we have t33 as part of the tokens. So how does this work? Because 't33' is a terminal, but the rule says NT25 produces it. So unless NT25 is part of the derivation, we can't have 't33' as a terminal in the string.\n\nWait, in the string, the third token is 't33'. How can that happen? Because looking at the grammar, only NT25 \u2192 t33. So to produce 't33', we need to have NT25 somewhere in the derivation. But in the string, we have 't33' as a terminal, which would mean that in the parse tree, the root must derive down to 't33', which requires a rule where NT25 \u2192 t33. So to get 't33' as the third token, the derivation path must somehow lead to it.\n\nBut in the string, all four tokens are terminals. So let me consider the entire string as a sequence of terminals: t25 t52 t33 t52.\n\nTo generate this, the grammar must have a way to produce this exact sequence through its rules.\n\nLet's attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nSince it's a context-free grammar, I can try a top-down approach, starting from S.\n\nThe start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the rules for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 NT81\nS \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo S can split into two parts: either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67.\n\nWe need to see if any of these can lead to the string 't25 t52 t33 t52'.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT45 NT81 first.\n\nNow, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 (from the rules).\n\nSo after NT45, we have NT60 and NT77.\n\nBut the string starts with 't25', which we can't produce directly from any rule. Wait, earlier we thought that 't25' is not a terminal. So perhaps starting with NT45 is not the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, let's try S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nNT19 \u2192 two possibilities: NT84 NT8 or NT60 NT5.\n\nSimilarly, NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2 or NT53.\n\nLet's pick one path for NT19.\n\nTake NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8.\n\nThen, we have NT84 and NT8.\n\nWhat can these produce?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT30 NT2 on one side, and in the rules, NT84 \u2192 't77' and NT30 \u2192 't82', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let's approach this differently. Let's consider the string as four parts: t25, t52, t33, t52. Let's see how these could be derived.\n\nEach part must come from some rule.\n\nFirst, t25. As per the rules, perhaps it's produced by NT25 \u2192 t33, but we can't get t25 from any rule. So maybe it's not possible. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rules.

The first symbol is t83. Looking through the grammar, the only production that results in t83 is NT44 \u2192 t76 or NT44 \u2192 t59? Wait, let me check the grammar again. Oh, looking at NT28 \u2192 NT36 NT84 NT45? No, wait. The NT28 isn't in the grammar. Hmm. Wait, I think I might have misread. Let's check for production leading to 't83'.

Wait, no, let's look again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 t76 (from NT27 and others) but also NT44 \u2192 t76 (from another rule). Also, looking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT60 NT47\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT84 \u2192 t84?\n\nWait, not quite. Let me scan all productions again.\n\nLooking at all NT productions:\n\nNT44: Does it produce t76? Let's see: There's a NT27 \u2192 NT60 NT47, which later can produce t35 and t51 (assuming). Wait, that's not helpful. Wait, in the productions, NT27 is defined as NT60 NT47, which is one production. But then, looking for t76:\n\nWait, looking at NT27: NT27 \u2192 t35. Oh, yeah, in the list, I see NT27 \u2192 t35. Oh, but NT27 is a non-terminal. Wait, but t76 would come from NT27? Or is it from another production.\n\nWait, I might be getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach symbol in the string must be derived from non-terminals that can reduce to that symbol. So I'll work step by step.\n\nThe string is four symbols: t83, t47, t82, t11.\n\nStarting with S. Let's see what the productions of S are.\n\nThe first production for S is S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nSo S = NT45 NT81. That means to get the first symbol t83, the NT45 must produce t83.\n\nLooking at NT45 productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\nNT45 \u2192 t76 or could it be t76 from another rule? Wait, from the grammar, there's NT45 \u2192 t76 and NT45 \u2192 t60? Let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, and NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, but looking for NT45, I see NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44, NT45 \u2192 't76'. So yes, NT45 can produce t76, but we need to get t83.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t83. So NT45 must derive into t83. But in the productions, the only terminals that appear for NT45 are t76. So unless I'm missing something, NT45 can't produce t83 directly. Then what about the other production for S?\n\nThe other production is S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So S = NT19 NT67.\n\nNow, if this is the case, then the first symbol is t83, which would come from NT19, I suppose. Let's check NT19's productions.\n\nNT19 has two productions: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 and NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT53.\n\nSo for t83 to come from NT19, we'd need one of its productions to generate 't83'. But looking at NT19's rules, I don't see any that produce 't83' directly. Wait, another way: maybe through the productions of its children.\n\nFor example, if NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, then NT84 and NT8 need to produce t83.\n\nLooking at NT84's productions: Not directly; it's NT45 \u2192 t76, but wait, I don't see NT84 anywhere. Alternatively, maybe NT84 could derive into something else that includes t83. This is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should parse the string step by step, but perhaps it's better to see if any terminal symbols appear in the production rules that could come from the start.\n\nAnother approach: Check each symbol in the string to see if it can be derived by the grammar.\n\nSo the string is t83 t47 t82 t11.\n\nLet's go through each token.\n\n1. t83: Which non-terminal can produce t83?\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT27 \u2192 t35, but also, wait, is there a production NT28 that includes t83? No, wait.\n\nAlternatively, is there any NT that can derive into t83?\n\nLooking through the productions, the only terminal I see is NT44 \u2192 t76, and I don't see any t83.

{"custom_id":"request-66","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the string `t3 t39 t82 t33 t8` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's start by looking at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Each rule has a non-terminal on the left and a right-hand side with either two non-terminals or a terminal. This will help me see how the string can be broken down.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t3 t39 t82 t33 t8`. Each part is separated by a space, so the string has five tokens. The terminals are t3, t39, t82, t33, t8.\n\nTo see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S, I'll work backwards, starting from the string and trying to match each token to a terminal rule in the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the terminal productions given in the grammar:\n- NT36 \u2192 t45\n- NT39 \u2192 t28\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT40 \u2192 t39\n- NT84 \u2192 t77\n- NT12 \u2192 t3\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT71 \u2192 t52\n- NT50 \u2192 t49\n- NT83 \u2192 t30\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n- NT72 \u2192 t10\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- NT75 \u2192 t32\n- NT81 \u2192 t30\n- NT60 \u2192 t84\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT81 \u2192 t3\n- NT67 \u2192 t2\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n- And some other terminal rules.\n\nWait, actually, some non-terminals map to terminals, others don't. Let me make a list of all the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- t5 comes from NT2 (rule: NT2 \u2192 t5)\n- t26 comes from NT9 (rule: NT9 \u2192 t26)\n- t28 comes from NT39 (rule: NT39 \u2192 t28)\n- t30 comes from NT30, and a few others?\nWait, no, looking again: NT30 is a non-terminal, but I don't see any production rule for NT30 that ends with a terminal. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT30 having a terminal directly. So maybe NT30 isn't a terminal and it must be expanded further. Similarly, other non-terminals may need to be expanded until we reach terminals.\n\nBut let's focus on the given string:\n\nThe string is t3, t39, t82, t33, t8.\n\nEach token corresponds to a terminal symbol, so I need each to be matched with a production that directly gives that terminal.\n\nSo starting from the first token, t3. Looking for a production rule that's NTxxx \u2192 t3. Scanning the rules:\n\n- I see NT12 \u2192 t3 (rule given as NT12 \u2192 t3)\n- Also, NT8 \u2192 t83 is a production, but that would give t83, not t3.\n- NT45 \u2192 t60 and t77, but t3 isn't among them.\n\nSo t3 comes from NT12.\n\nSimilarly, t39 is from NT39 \u2192 t28? Wait, no, NT39 \u2192 t28, so t39 must come from another non-terminal. Wait, wait, the string is t39, but the rule is NT39 \u2192 t28. So t39 is a terminal, but NT39 doesn't produce t39. There's a rule NT39 \u2192 t28, so t39 can't come from NT39. Unless I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nLooking for each token:\n\n- t3: NT12 \u2192 t3\n- t39: looking for a rule that gives t39. Let's see if any NT rule ends with t39.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t39 is there: rule is NT40 \u2192 t39\nYes, so t39 comes from NT40.\n\nNext, t82: looking for a production that gives t82. Scanning:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT30 \u2192 ...?\n- NT72 \u2192 t10\n- NT67 \u2192 t2\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a production that directly gives t82. Wait, maybe it's through another non-terminal. Let's see.\n\nWait, looking again, the provided grammar may have an NT72 rule: NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44. But t82 isn't directly produced here. Alternatively, perhaps one of the NT rules produces t82. Let me check all the given rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44 (produces two non-terminals, leading to NT10 and NT44)\n- NT44 \u2192 t76 (Yes, NT44 \u2192 t76)\n- NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT47\n\nSo, perhaps t82 comes from NT44 via some expansion. Wait, no, because NT44 \u2192 t76, not t82. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check all NT rules to see if any non-terminal directly maps to t82:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 t77\n- NT75 \u2192 t32\n- NT45 \u2192 t60\n- NT9 \u2192 various terminals like t26, t36, etc.\n\nI don't see any NT rule that ends with t82. Therefore, maybe t82 comes from a non-terminal that eventually expands to t82. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, I'll check if any rule ends with NTxxx that produces t82. For example:\n\n- Looking for NT... \u2192 t82.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44\n- NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT47\n- NT50 \u2192 NT49 (No, it's NT50 \u2192 t49)\nWait, NT50 \u2192 t49. So, NT10 \u2192 NT50 \u2192 t49 and NT47.\n\nSo, starting from NT10: NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT47. Then NT50 \u2192 t49, NT47 \u2192 t84.\n\nSo, NT10 would produce t49 and t84, but how does that get us t82?\n\nAlternatively, maybe t82 comes from another path. Let's look for NT with t82 as a terminal.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed a NT rule with t82. Let me check all:\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52\n- NT25 \u2192 NT33 (Yes, so NT25 \u2192 t33)\n- NT71 \u2192 NT52 NT52 (Wait, NT71 is involved here)\n- NT52 \u2192 NT9 NT0 (Not terminal)\n- NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45\n- NT36 has multiple rules, including some terminals, but none to t82.\n\nSo, perhaps t82 is part of the expansion of some other non-terminal. Maybe NT72 produces t10 (from NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44 \u2192 t49 and t84), but that doesn't lead to t82.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has t82, but I can't find any direct or indirect way to get there from the grammar. Maybe that means the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each token again.\n\nFirst token: t3 \u2192 NT12\n\nSecond token: t39 \u2192 NT40\n\nThird token: t82 \u2192 Not direct from any production. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe t82 comes from NT... Let me look for NT rules that can produce t82.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, none directly produce t82. So maybe it's not possible.\n\nBut wait, perhaps t82 comes from a longer chain. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the rules again, for example:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 NT52 NT52 (Wait, does NT52 have a terminal? Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, NT52 \u2192 NT9 NT0\n\nSo NT52 doesn't produce t82 either.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe t36 \u2192 t42?

{"custom_id":"request-68","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string `t33 t28 t71 t25 t30` is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF is a specific form of CFGs where every production is either:\n1. A single terminal symbol,\n2. A single non-terminal symbol,\n3. A non-terminal symbol that produces two non-terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, all the productions fit into these categories, so that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t33 t28 t71 t25 t30`. Since it's a string in the language, it should be generated by the grammar. Each token here looks like it's a terminal symbol because they're lowercase and likely matched directly from the grammar.\n\nI think the approach is to break down the string into its components and see if each part can derive from the non-terminals in the grammar step by step.\n\nLet me list the terminal tokens in the string:\n- t33\n- t28\n- t71\n- t25\n- t30\n\nI should start by identifying which non-terminal symbols can produce these terminals directly. In CNF, the only way a terminal is produced is by rules that have exactly one terminal on the right side. So let's look at each token and see which non-terminal can generate it.\n\nFor example:\n- t33: I need to find a rule where the right side is t33. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n  - NT25 -> t25\n  - NT22 -> t22\n  - NT23 -> t14\n  - NT64 -> (wait, not present)\n  - Wait, the given rules don't have any production for t33. Hmm, that's odd because according to the given grammar, t33 is a terminal, but I don't see a rule that generates t33. Wait, looking back, I see a production where NT22 -> t22, but that's a different token.\n\nWait, the provided grammar list shows:\n- NT19 -> 't84' (but t84 is a terminal, and for NT19, I see it has two rules leading to terminals. For example, `S -> NT19 NT67`, and later rules for NT19 ending with t84 or other terms.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the non-terminals and their productions are:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that for t33, the only way it's generated is from NT22 since `NT22 -> 't22'`. So if t33 is part of the string, then in the grammar, it must come from NT22. But wait, in the string we have t33, which isn't generated by any NT in the grammar. That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again. The provided grammar rules are under NT0 to NT97. I should parse all the NTs and their terminal rules.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT9 -> 't26' (duplicate, but okay)\n- NT13 -> 't47'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT27 -> 't76' (but in another place, NT27 -> NT60 NT47)\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe given grammar rules that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT13 -> 't47'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT27 -> 't76' (but maybe I need to check another rule)\nWait, I see NT9 -> 't26' and NT5 -> 't26' and others. Also, NT25 -> 't33' is present.\n\nSo, for the token t33, the rule is NT25 -> 't33'. That means in the final derivation, to get t33, there must have been a step that derived NT25, which then produced t33.\n\nSo, the string starts with t33, which comes from NT25. So in the derivation, we must have NT25 being part of the parse.\n\nNext, the second token is t28. From the grammar rules, where does t28 come from? Looking through, I see:\n\n- NT39 -> 't28'\nSo, t28 is generated by NT39.\n\nThe third token is t71, which I need to see which NT generates it. Looking through:\n\n- NT71 -> 't52'\n- NT71 -> NT52\n- Also, somewhere, perhaps I need to check other rules.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, do any NTs generate t71 as a terminal directly? No, but looking deeper, maybe through rules.\n\nFor example, looking at NT9 -> 't26', but that's not helpful for t71.\n\nLooking at NT77, wait, no, I don't think any NT directly generates t71 except via production steps.\n\nWait, perhaps t71 is produced by NT77 -> 't8' and so on, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree starting from S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which appears in the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\n\nSo, S can be split into NT45 and NT81. Let's check their productions.\n\nNT45:\nLooking at the grammar, NT45 has two rules:\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n- NT45 -> NT0.\n\nWait, wait, no.

Hmm, the grammar is a bit complex with a bunch of non-terminals and productions. The string to evaluate is `t25 t71 t84 t26 t84 t3`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what it means for a string to be generated by a CFG. Each symbol in the string must be the start symbol (S) through a series of productions until all symbols are terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals have productions that lead directly to terminal 't' followed by a number. For example:\n- NT5 produces 't25'\n- NT22 produces 't22'\n- NT2 produces 't2', and so on.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and in the grammar, S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't25', which suggests that S must produce something that eventually leads to t25. Let's see:\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n- S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nBut I also see that NT5 produces 't25'. So maybe one of the NTs in the S's production chain leads to NT5.\n\nLooking further at NT19's productions:\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 or NT47 NT5 (from the given productions, I think the second one is NT19 \u2192 NT47 NT5)\nWait, the exact productions are:\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 and NT19 \u2192 NT47 NT5.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT19 NT67, then the first part is NT19. Let's see how NT19 can be rewritten. Let's take the production NT19 \u2192 NT47 NT5.\n\nThen, NT47 leads to 't47'. Hmm, but that's terminal 't47', which isn't present in the string. The string has 't25', 't71', etc. So maybe this path isn't leading us to the string.\n\nAlternatively, if S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then NT45 and NT81.\n\nLooking at NT45's production:\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44.\n\nBut we also see that NT45 \u2192 't45'? Wait, no. Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT45 \u2192 't45', but wait, the user provided:\n\nAh, yes, looking at the productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT84 NT81, but that's not a terminal. Wait, no. Wait, for NT45, the productions are:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44.\n\nWait, let me look again. Hmm, the productions:\n\nThe user provided the grammar with various NTs.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a production NT45 \u2192 't60' NT77? Wait, no. The specific lines are:\n\nThe user provided lines like:\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT39 -> 't28'\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, no, wait: the user provided the grammar as a list of production rules, where each line starts with a non-terminal and follows with symbols and sometimes terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT75 -> NT72 NT5\nNT22 -> 't22'\nAnd others.\n\nSo, for NT45: is there any production that leads directly to a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 but both are non-terminals. So no terminal here.\n\nWait, but what about NT5? Let me check NT5's productions:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar:\n\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT53\n- NT5 -> 't25'\n\nAh, okay, so NT5 directly produces 't25', so that's a terminal.\n\nSo, if we can derive NT5 from one of the other non-terminals, then that path would produce 't25' or similar.\n\nNow, in our target string, the first symbol is 't25', so perhaps one of the NTs in the initial S's productions must eventually derive 't25'. Let's see.\n\nLooking back, S can produce S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nLet's take S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So, NT19 and NT67.\n\nFrom NT19, as we saw, one of the productions is NT19 \u2192 NT47 NT5. So, NT19 can eventually produce NT47 and NT5. Then, NT47 may further produce a terminal, and NT5 produces 't25'.\n\nWait, let's break it down.\n\nS \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT47 NT5.\n\nNT67 \u2192 ... Let's see the productions for NT67:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, under NT67, do we have any production?\n\nYes, line: NT67 -> NT30 NT2.\n\nSo, NT67 can be rewritten into NT30 and NT2.\n\nThen NT30: NT30 \u2192 NT82 according to one of the lines.\n\nNT82 is a terminal? Wait, looking at the productions, I don't see any NT82 \u2192 terminal. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, looking through the grammar lines again, I think I might have missed some.\n\nLet me list all the NTs and their productions to see where we're going.\n\nWait, the productions are provided as a list, so I'll list them:\n\n1.

The string to evaluate is `t11 t71 t26 t11 t26 t32`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's given in CNF, so each production is either a non-terminal breaking into two non-terminals or a non-terminal leading directly to a terminal. The start symbol is S, and I see that S has two productions: S -> NT45 NT81 and S -> NT19 NT67. So, from S, either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67 are generated in two steps.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t11, t71, t26, t11, t26, t32. I need to think about how these terminals can be formed through the grammar.\n\nLet me try to break down the string. Starting from the beginning, t11. Looking at the productions, I see NT71 -> t52. But wait, I'm trying to get t11. Let me check NT13: it's not in the productions as a terminal. Wait, no, in the list of grammar rules, NT71 is there as NT71 -> NT12 NT84, which leads to t52. But wait, t52 is a terminal, as per the given rules. Let me check: NT52 -> t71, right? Because in the rules, I see NT52 -> t71. Hmm, no, wait, actually in the rules, there's NT52 -> t71. But looking at the string, I don't have t71 in it. The string has t11, t71, t26, etc.\n\nWait, in the string, the first term is t11. So, where does t11 come from? Looking at the grammar, do any of the non-terminals produce t11? Let's check the rules: I see NT5 -> t9 NT53, and NT53 -> t30. Wait, but that gives me t9 and t30. NT75 -> t72 t5. NT72 -> t10 t44. NT10 -> t50 t47, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a production that directly gives t11. Let's check: I see NT71 -> t52, which is t71. Wait, no, NT71 is produced by NT71 -> NT12 NT84, which then becomes t52 and t84. But t52 is another non-terminal that leads to t71. Wait, no, in the rules, I see NT52 -> t71. So if I have NT52, it becomes t71. But wait, the string has t71 as the second term.\n\nWait, let me try to find a derivation path for the string `t11 t71 t26 t11 t26 t32`.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t11. So, there must be a path where some NT produces t11.\n\nLooking at the rules, do any non-terminals directly produce t11? Scanning through, I don't immediately see any NT with a direct production to t11. So, maybe t11 comes from a longer chain.\n\nWait, another approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar, step by step, starting from S.\n\nStarting with S, the first step is to produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's assume the first production, S -> NT45 NT81.\n\nNow, let's see what NT45 can produce. From the rules, NT45 can produce NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44. Let's pick NT60 first because it leads to more possibilities.\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81. Now, NT30 can produce NT82, which is a terminal. So, let's say NT30 -> t82. But in the string, I first have t11, not t82. So maybe this path is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, from NT60, NT30 can also produce NT14 NT71. So, NT14 leads to t84, and NT71 leads to t52 and t84. But again, t52 is t71, which isn't matching the string.\n\nHmm, maybe this path isn't correct. Let me try another route. Back to NT45. It can also produce NT50 NT44. Let's see, NT50 -> t49. So that's a terminal. Now, NT44 can go to t76 or NT83 NT7.\n\nWait, maybe t11 comes from a different path. Let me check NT10: NT10 -> t50 t47. Then t50 is t49, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, NT10 -> t50 t47, and t47 is t84, which again isn't t11.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's see if any of the non-terminals produce t11. From the rules, let's look for any NT that can directly or indirectly produce t11. Scanning through:\n\nLooking at NT23: it says NT23 -> NT61 NT74. Then NT61 can produce NT53 NT12. Wait, NT9 is from NT5 -> t9 NT53, which leads to t9 and t30. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this differently. Let's see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is `t11 t71 t26 t11 t26 t32`.\n\nLet me look for t26. Where does t26 come from? Looking at the rules, I see NT27 -> NT60 NT47, and NT2 -> t5, which isn't helpful. Wait, NT26 is produced by NT9: NT9 -> NT26 NT45. But NT9 is a non-terminal, so to produce t26, maybe NT9 can produce t26 and something else.\n\nWait, NT9 -> t26 NT45. So if NT9 is part of the string, then the first element would be t26, but in the string, it's t11 first. So maybe t26 isn't part of the initial steps. Alternatively, maybe the string is built in a way that requires multiple layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is built using a series of NTs that eventually derive to the given terminals.\n\nLet me try to find a possible sequence:\n\nStart with S -> NT19 NT67.\n\nNT19 can produce NT84 NT8 or NT60 NT5. Let's pick NT84 NT8.\n\nNT84 can then produce NT36 NT7. Let's say NT36 produces t42 (a terminal), and NT7 produces t11. Wait, does any NT produce t11?\n\nWait, no, earlier that didn't give t11. Alternatively, NT8 is a terminal: looking at the rules, I don't see NT8 directly leading to t83 or anything else, except NT83 -> t30, and NT7 -> t11, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: let's see the terminals in the string and try to match from the bottom.\n\nt11 is the first symbol. So there must be a production that leads to t11 as the leftmost symbol.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, does any NT produce t11 as the leftmost terminal of a production? Or perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, if I look at NT7 -> t11 NT75, so if NT7 is part of the left-hand side, it could produce t11 followed by NT75, which can produce more symbols.\n\nSo, for example, if we have NT7 producing t11 and NT75, then the string begins with t11.\n\nLooking at NT75 -> NT72 NT5. So if NT7 generates t11, then the next element would be NT75, which becomes NT72 and NT5. NT72 -> t10 t44, and NT5 -> t9 NT53.\n\nWait, but this might not align with the string given, as the second element is t71, not t10 or t9.\n\nAlternatively, looking at another non-terminal that can produce t71. For example, NT71 can produce NT12 NT84, which leads to t3 and t83. But t83 leads to t30, so that would give t3 t30, not t71 t26.\n\nAlternatively, NT71 can produce NT52 NT47, and NT52 leads to t71, which is a terminal.

Scanning through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n- NT72 \u2192 t10 t44\n- NT61 \u2192 t53 NT12\n- NT40 \u2192 t14 t71\n- Maybe I'm missing something? Let's check:\n\nWait, looking at NT9 \u2192 t26. Wait, that's not it. Let me list all NT productions that end with terminals:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT45 \u2192 t60 NT77, which then t60 could go to t84, which then t84 to t30, which eventually becomes t3. Not sure.\n- NT72 \u2192 t10 t44\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT27 \u2192 t35\n- NT22 \u2192 t22 \u2192 so t22 is a terminal. But the string starts with t11, so that's not helpful.\n- NT23 \u2192 t14\n- NT71 \u2192 t52\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT30 \u2192 t82\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT5 \u2192 t9 t53\n- NT52 \u2192 t71\n- NT36 \u2192 t42 again.\n- NT61 \u2192 t53 NT12\n- Wait, I might be missing something. Is there an NT that produces t11? Looking again:\n\nWait, the grammar includes NT71 \u2192 t52 and NT5 \u2192 t53, but not directly t11. Hmm, did I miss an NT production that leads to t11? Let me scan all the productions again.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 t52\n- NT5 \u2192 t53\n- NT45 \u2192 t60 NT77 (and T77 is t8)\n- NT72 \u2192 t10 t44\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT27 \u2192 t35\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT23 \u2192 t14\n- NT75 \u2192 t23 t45\n- NT39 \u2192 t28\n- NT9 \u2192 t36 t45\n- NT19 \u2192 t84 t8\n- NT12 \u2192 t3\n- NT88? Wait, not in the productions. Let me see:\n\nWait, I might not have an NT that directly produces t11. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a longer chain. Maybe the non-terminal NT5 (which is S's first production) leads to something that eventually produces t11.\n\nLooking back, the first production is S \u2192 NT45 NT81. So S starts by producing NT45 and NT81. Let's consider NT45 first. NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. So NT45 can be broken down into NT60 and NT77.\n\nNT77 is t8, as per NT77 \u2192 t8. So NT77 directly gives 't8'.\n\nNow, NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81. NT30 is t82, and NT81 is t71.\n\nSo putting it all together, NT45 becomes NT60 NT77 \u2192 t82 t71, so S \u2192 NT45 NT81 \u2192 t82 t81 t75? Wait, no, let me retrace:\n\nWait, S is broken into NT45 NT81. NT45 is NT60 NT77 \u2192 t82 and t8. NT81 is another production. Let's look at NT81. Scanning the grammar, NT81 can be:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT82? No, in the productions, NT81 goes to NT30 (another NT) which then has rules. Wait, from the given grammar, looking at NT81, I see:\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I see NT81 is in several places. Wait, in the initial list, the grammar has:\n\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n- S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n- Then, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n- NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45\n- NT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53\n- NT74 \u2192 NT72 NT5\n- NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13\n- NT74 \u2192 NT72 NT5\n- NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81\n- NT71 \u2192 NT9 NT75\n- NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT47\n- NT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44\n- NT40 \u2192 NT14 NT71\n- NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n- NT27 \u2192 NT60 NT47\n- NT23 \u2192 NT61 NT74\n- NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n- NT71 \u2192 NT12 NT84\n- NT52 \u2192 NT9 NT0\n- NT61 \u2192 NT53 NT12\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n- NT40 \u2192 NT58 NT39\n- NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7\n- NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n- NT39 \u2192 NT28 NT\n- ... (and so on).\n\nSo, let's get back to S \u2192 NT45 NT81. NT45 is NT60 NT77 \u2192 t82 (from NT60 \u2192 NT30 \u2192 t82) and t8. NT81 is another production. Looking at NT81's productions:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT2 (from NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2, but I'm looking at NT81). Wait, actually, looking through the grammar, NT81 appears in a few places:\n\nLooking specifically, NT81 is produced by NT? Let me check:\n\nIn the initial list, NT81 is not a production. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT81 on the left-hand side except in the start productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nWait, so NT81 is one of the non-terminals, but there's no rule for NT81 \u2192 ... Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production for NT81 as the left-hand side. Wait, maybe that's a mistake, or perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the non-terminals on the left are S, NT45, NT19, etc. So perhaps the question is that NT81 is somewhere else. Wait, no: I looked through all the rules, and I don't see NT81 \u2192 anything. So perhaps that's an error, but perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, no: in the given code, the only place where NT81 appears is in S's productions. So, perhaps I was wrong, and NT81 is not a non-terminal but a terminal. But that can't be, because in the string, the last part is `t52`, which comes from NT52 \u2192 t71. So, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is mine. Let me re-express the rules correctly:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first rule is S \u2192 NT45 NT81.

Let me start by understanding the problem and the approach I can take.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) can generate a string through a series of derivations where each step replaces a non-terminal with another non-terminal or a terminal. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should make parsing the string a bit more straightforward because each step in the derivation deals with replacing a single non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string given is composed of the following terminals: t84, t83, t71, t76, t33, t22, t59 in that order. I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has the following productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, the string starts with either NT45 followed by NT81 or NT19 followed by NT67. Let me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: The string starts with NT45, which then needs to generate the terminal sequence starting with t84.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT45 has the following productions:\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44 (duplicate)\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 (duplicate)\n- Wait, looking back, I might have miscounted. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT45:\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n\nSo, NT45 can produce either NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44.\n\nIf the first terminal after S is t84, let's see where that comes from. Looking through the productions, I see that:\n- NT75 \u2192 t72 t5 (but wait, looking at the given productions, I think I need to check each NT that can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions. Let me go through each one to see which NT can produce t84, t83, etc.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT45 can produce NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44. Do any of these produce t? Let me check.\n\nLooking for t84 and t83:\n\n- NT76: I don't see any production listed for NT76, so probably doesn't produce a terminal.\n- Wait, let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, the target string is t84 t83 t71 t76 t33 t22 t59.

Wait no:\n\nWait, looking back, the productions are listed as:\n\n\"NT44 -> 't76'\", but I need to check all productions where a NT is directly replaced by a terminal.\n\nLet me go through each production:\n\nLooking for any production where the left side is a NT and the right side is a terminal:\n\nLooking at the provided productions:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't35'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT75 \u2192 't72' and 't5' (Wait, NT75 \u2192 't72' and 't5'? Or did I misread.)\n\nWait, looking again, the user provided a list:\n\nHere is the list:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't84'\n\nNT75 \u2192 't72', 't5'\n\nWait, but looking at the list, for NT75: \"NT75 -> NT23 NT45 | NT72 NT5\"\n\nWait no, that's not producing terminals directly. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, let's look:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nNT75 -> NT23 NT45\n\nLooking further:\n\n\"NT75 -> NT23 NT45 | NT72 NT5\"\n\nWait, no, for NT75:\n\n- NT75 -> NT23 NT45\n\nWait, no, looking at the list:\n\n\"NT75 -> NT23 NT45 | NT72 NT5\"\n\nSo NT75 can produce NT23 NT45 or NT72 NT5. Neither of these end in a terminal yet.\n\nBut in some other productions:\n\nLooking for NT that directly go to a terminal.\n\nLet's go through each NT and see if any produce a terminal.\n\n- NT77: It's on the right side of NT45's productions, but does NT77 produce anything? From the list, I don't see any production for NT77 as a left-hand side, except perhaps in right side of others.\n\nWait, in the list, \"NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\". So NT77 is produced by NT45, but we don\u2019t have any production where NT77 \u2192 something else. So unless NT77 is a terminal, which it isn't because in the string, we have t77 as a terminal? No, wait, the string has t77? Looking back:\n\nThe string is t84 t83 t71 t76 t33 t22 t59. I see t71, t76, but not t77. Wait, no. t77 is a terminal in the string? Wait, no, the string given is:\n\n\"t84 t83 t71 t76 t33 t22 t59\"\n\nWait, no, t77 isn't in there. So, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, no, looking at the string: t77 isn't in the string, but in the grammar, NT45 can directly produce NT60 NT77, which would then need to produce terminals somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to approach this by working backwards from the string.\n\nSo the string is:\n\nt84, t83, t71, t76, t33, t22, t59.\n\nI'll represent it as a list: [t84, t83, t71, t76, t33, t22, t59]\n\nSince the grammar is context-free and in Chomsky normal form, I can parse the string from the end, perhaps, using a stack-based method, although given the string length, it might be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find if the string can be built by starting from S and replacing non-terminals step by step.\n\nSince S has two productions: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nLet me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nSo we have to generate t84 followed by t83, etc., starting with NT45 followed by NT81.\n\nLooking at NT81: From the productions, I see that NT81 \u2192 t71. So the second symbol is generated by NT81 \u2192 t71.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first terminal is t84, then t83, then t71. So from S, NT45 is first, which would have to produce t84 (or something else) leading to t83, etc.\n\nWait, wait\u2014no. Let's re-examine:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then the first part is NT45, which would have to generate the first part of the string, and NT81 generates the latter part.\n\nBut looking at the string, it starts with t84, which would come from NT45, and ends with t59, which would come from NT81.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the string is t84 t83 t71 t76 t33 t22 t59. That's seven symbols.

The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to test is `t83 t49 t76 t77 t59 t22 t11 t52`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side can have two non-terminals or one terminal. Each production is always of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that some non-terminals immediately produce terminals, like S \u2192 NT45 't25'. So, those are the base cases. The string we're trying to produce consists of terminals, so we need to trace back from the start symbol S and see if the given string can be formed through a series of these productions.\n\nThe string has eight tokens, which means there are eight production steps in the leftmost derivation, assuming each step adds exactly one terminal. Alternatively, since some non-terminals produce multiple terminals, maybe more steps are needed. But let's focus on the string and see how each terminal could be generated.\n\nLet's list the tokens: t83, t49, t76, t77, t59, t22, t11, t52. I'll need to find a sequence of productions that can generate these in the correct order.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S. The rule for S seems to have two possibilities: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So, from S, the first step would produce either NT45 and NT81, or NT19 and NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t83. Let's check where t83 appears in the productions. I see NT39 \u2192 't28', but that's 't28', not 't83'. Wait, let me check all the productions for terminal 't' tokens. \n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n- NT13 \u2192 't47' (but it's 't47' not 't13')\nWait, maybe I'm misreading.

Wait, no, that's a non-terminal. Looking again, perhaps:\n\nWait, looking for production rules where the right-hand side is a terminal.

Both non-terminals. Wait, no, any terminal in the right-hand side?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the rules again:\n\nLooking for rules where RHS is a single terminal:\n\n- NT39 \u2192 't28' \u2192 so t28 is produced by NT39.\n- NT44 \u2192 't76' \u2192 t76 is produced by NT44.\n- NT77 \u2192 't8' \u2192 t8 is produced by NT77.\n- NT81 \u2192 't30' \u2192 t30 is produced by NT81.\n- NT52 \u2192 't71' \u2192 wait, no, looking: NT52 is defined as NT9 NT0, which are both non-terminals.

Let me go through each rule:\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT81 \u2192 't30'\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'? No, that's a production like S \u2192 NT45 't25'? Wait, in the rule S \u2192 NT45 't25'? Wait no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, no, the rules are all of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So for example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81, or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Then, each non-terminal has a production. For example, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, etc.\n\nSo I think I need to find which non-terminals directly produce terminals. From the given list, I can see:\n\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT81 \u2192 't30'\n- NT0 \u2192 NT47 NT53? Or does any non-terminal produce a terminal?\n\nWait, perhaps NT59 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal that produces a terminal? Let me look: None of the given rules have a terminal other than those listed. Wait, looking:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT81 \u2192 't30'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT60 \u2192 't84'\n- NT81 \u2192 't3' (Wait, no, let me check again.)\n\nWait, the rules include:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT81 \u2192 't30'\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'? Wait, no. Looking at the rule:\n\"S->_NT45 't25'\" is not present because all rules are either BC or a single terminal. Wait, checking each rule:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't52' is a terminal. Yes, that's one.\n\nWait, let me go step by step through each rule to see which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81: Both non-terminals.\n2.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because that means each production rule is binary\u2014only two symbols on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, I should probably understand how the strings are structured. The string consists of several tokens separated by spaces, so maybe each token is a terminal symbol. Let me list them out: t3, t13, t5, t71, t84, t14, t3, t82.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal symbol expands into two others. I think the approach here is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string by applying the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo each S production results in two NT symbols. I'll need to see if either of these can lead to the target string.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n- So each of these NT45 and NT81 have to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT45's production: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. So each of these needs to expand.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, and NT77 is a terminal 't8'.\n\nWait, NT77 is given as 't8', which is a terminal. So NT77 is 't8'. NT60 expands into NT30 and NT81, which is another terminal 't82'.\n\nSo expanding NT45 would be:\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 \u2192 (NT30 NT81) 't8'\n\nNow NT30 \u2192 NT82, which is a terminal 't82'. And NT81 \u2192 't3'. So putting that together:\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 \u2192 (NT30) \u2192 (NT82) (t8) \u2192 t82 t8.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should break it down step by step.\n\nWait, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. Then each of these needs to be resolved.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, which are both non-terminals. NT30 \u2192 NT82 (terminal 't82'), and NT81 \u2192 't3'. So NT60 becomes t82 t3.\n\nNT77 \u2192 't8'. So NT45 \u2192 [t82 t3] ['t8'] which together is t82 t3 t8.\n\nSo NT45 expands to t82 t3 t8.\n\nNow, the first part of the string is t3. Hmm, that doesn't match the first token t3. Wait, but NT45 doesn't expand to t3. Let me check NT3's production. Oh, wait, NT3 \u2192 ...? Actually, looking at the grammar, there's no NT3 mentioned. Let me check the given productions again. Oh, wait, the grammar only has certain NT productions. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking through the grammar rules, I don't see an NT3. Only NT5, NT19, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. The NT3 isn't present in any production on the left-hand side, but wait, the first part of the string starts with t3. So if S is NT45 NT81, and I'm looking at NT45, which produces t82 t3 t8, and NT81 produces 't3' as per the rule NT81 \u2192 't3'. Wait, no, I thought NT81 \u2192 't3', but let me check: the productions for NT81 include NT30 NT81, but also a terminal 't3'? Wait, looking back, the NT81 productions: NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT81 and NT81 \u2192 't3'. No, wait, looking at the list, I think one of the NT81 rules is 't30' or 't3'. Wait, no, wait the user listed:\n\nLooking at the grammar, one of the NT81's productions is NT81 \u2192 't30' and another is NT81 \u2192 't3'? Let me check the list:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n- NT13 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT81 -> 't71'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't83'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't59'\n- NT52 -> 't71'\n- NT81 -> 't30'\n- NT60 -> 't84'\n- NT81 -> 't3'\n\nWait, so NT81 has multiple productions, including NT30 NT81, as well as 't3':\n\nWait, looking at the list provided, under NT81:\n\nNT81 -> 't30' (from earlier lines), but wait, no, let me parse through each line:\n\nLooking at the second half:\n\nWait, the given grammar rules are:\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53\n\nNT71 -> NT9 NT75\n\nNT52 -> NT9 NT0\n\nAnd so on, listing several NT productions. Then, at the end, some of the rules are:\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\n\nNT77 -> 't8'\n\nNT84 -> 't77'\n\nNT39 -> 't28'\n\nNT13 -> 't47'\n\nNT7 -> 't11'\n\nNT36 -> 't42'\n\nNT81 -> 't71'\n\nNT44 -> 't76'\n\nNT27 -> 't35'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT53 -> 't30'\n\nNT30 -> 't82'\n\nNT9 -> 't26'\n\nNT40 -> 't39'\n\nNT12 -> 't3'\n\nNT8 -> 't83'\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nNT75 -> 't32'\n\nNT44 -> 't59'\n\nNT52 -> 't71'\n\nNT81 -> 't30'\n\nNT60 -> 't84'\n\nNT81 -> 't3'\n\nWait, so NT81 has two terminal productions: 't30' and 't3'. So when NT81 is reached, it can be replaced directly with either 't30' or 't3'.\n\nSo going back, S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nExpanding NT45: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. Then NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, and NT77 is 't8'.\n\nBut wait, NT60 expands into NT30 and NT81. So for NT60, we have to expand each part:\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT82 (terminal 't82') and NT81 can be replaced with either 't30' or 't3'. But since NT81 is a non-terminal, it must be further expanded until it becomes a terminal.\n\nSo, the expansion of NT60:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81 \u2192 (t82) (NT81).\n\nThen, NT81 can expand into 't3' or 't30'. Let's say we choose 't3':\n\nSo NT60 \u2192 t82 t3.\n\nWait, but NT81 is a non-terminal, so perhaps I need to keep expanding NT81 until all non-terminals are replaced.\n\nWait no, because NT81 is on the right side, and in the case of CNF, it must be a binary expansion. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nStarting with S\u2192NT45 NT81.\n\nSo NT45\u2192NT60 NT77.\n\nNT60\u2192NT30 NT81.\n\nNow, NT30\u2192NT82 and NT81\u2192't3' or 't30'.\n\nBut wait, NT82 is a terminal (from NT30\u2192't82'), so NT60 \u2192 NT82 't8'. But NT81 in this case is 't3' or 't30'.\n\nWait, no, NT60 is two symbols, so NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, which would expand to (NT30) (NT81).

I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t39 t30 t3 t22 t76 t26 t35 t26 t11`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals into terminals and possibly other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that some of the productions lead directly to terminals:\n- NT45 -> 't25'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT19 -> 't84' and 't8'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT81 -> 't30' and 't3'\n- NT9 -> 't26', 't22'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't52'\n- NT50 -> 't49'\n- NT83 -> 't30'\n- NT22 -> 't42'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT61 -> 't13'\n- NT44 -> 't76', 't71', etc.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t39 t30 t3 t22 t76 t26 t35 t26 t11`.\n\nI'll attempt to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. Starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S produces two options:\n1. NT45 NT81\n2. NT19 NT67\n\nI need to see which of these can produce the string.\n\nConsider option 2: NT19 NT67. The start symbol could be rewritten as S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nSo, let's look at NT19 and NT67.\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8 (from production NT19 -> NT84 NT8 and NT19 -> NT60 NT5). Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT19 has two productions:\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT19 -> NT60 NT5\n\nSo, I need to decide which path to take for NT19.\n\nThe string starts with t39. Let's look at the options for NT19:\n\nLooking for a way to get t39. From the given terminals, I see NT40 \u2192 't39'. So, perhaps NT19 can produce 't39' in two steps.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let's check NT40's production. NT40 \u2192 NT14 NT71, NT40 \u2192 't39'. So how does NT19 relate to t39?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting a bit confused. Let me plan a better approach.\n\nThe string starts with t39, t30, t3, etc.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the terminals are in the right-hand side of the productions. So, when expanding a non-terminal, if a production leads to a terminal, that's the end of that branch.\n\nLet me map each terminal in the string to possible non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nt39: Only NT40 can produce t39 (NT40 -> 't39'). So t39 must come from NT40.\n\nt30: NT81 and NT27 produce 't30' (looking at the rules: NT81 -> 't30' and NT27 -> 't76' isn't t30. Wait, wait:\n\nLooking again, the grammar has:\n\n- NT81 -> 't30' (from NT81 \u2192 't30')\n- NT27 -> 't76' (wait, no, looking up the grammar:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided:\n\nThere are entries:\n\nNT30 -> 't82'\nNT27 -> 't76'\nNT23 -> 't14'\nNT58 -> 't27 NT47'\nWait no, perhaps I need to double-check each production.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I have:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't82'\nNT27 \u2192 't76'\nWait, but according to the string, the third token is t3, which isn't directly a terminal in the given rules, unless I misread.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me list all the productions that result in terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the RHS that include 't' are:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26', 't22'\n- NT19 \u2192 't84', 't8'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT81 \u2192 't30', 't3'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT23 \u2192 't14'\n- NT71 \u2192 't52'\n- NT50 \u2192 't49'\n- NT83 \u2192 't30'\n- NT22 \u2192 't42'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76', 't71', 't30', 't59', etc.\n- Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nBut for the string `t39 t30 t3 t22 t76 t26 t35 t26 t11`, the tokens are:\n\n1. t39\n2. t30\n3. t3\n4. t22\n5. t76\n6. t26\n7. t35\n8. t26\n9. t11\n\nSo first token is t39. The only non-terminal that produces t39 is NT40.

Wait, in the given grammar, there is a production:\n\nNT83 \u2192 't30', which is correct.\n\nSo t30 can come from NT81 or NT83.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can go to a terminal. First, I need to understand the grammar structure and see if I can trace the string back through the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals like 't25', 't49', etc. The grammar consists of non-terminals on the left side (like S, NT5, NT0, etc.) and terminals on the right side when certain rules are applied. My goal is to see if there's a derivation path starting from S that leads to the given string.\n\nI notice that each non-terminal in the grammar can expand into two non-terminals. The start symbol S can expand into two NTs, so each step adds a pair of non-terminals. The string has nine tokens, which is an odd number. Each production step consumes two non-terminals and produces two non-terminals, so the number of symbols (including non-terminals) should increase by one each step. Starting from S, the first step gives two non-terminals, then each subsequent step would add one more, leading to an increase of the number of symbols. However, the given string has nine tokens, and starting from one symbol, the number of steps needed would be eight (since each step adds one). So nine tokens make sense because 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nBut I need to see if the specific sequence of terminals can be produced. I'll start from the string and try to factor it back into the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t25 t49 t52 t11 t8 t83 t49 t11 t32.\n\nI need to reverse the process. Let's see which non-terminals can derive the terminals.\n\nFirst, I look for non-terminals that can produce 't25', 't49', etc. The rules that end with terminals are:\n\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT22 -> 't42'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't52'\n- NT50 -> 't49'\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT44 -> 't59'\n- NT52 -> 't71'\n- NT22 -> 't42'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT61 -> 't13'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't83'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't59'\n- NT52 -> 't71'\n- NT81 -> 't30'\n- NT60 -> 't84'\n- NT81 -> 't3'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't52'\n\nFrom the string, 't25' must come from a production ending with 't25'. Looking at the rules, NT25 produces 't33' and NT22 produces 't42'. Hmm, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't25'. So perhaps 't25' is part of a non-terminal that isn't directly terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for how 't25' could fit into a production. For example, if a production leads to NT22, which then leads to 't42'. Or perhaps 't25' is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the beginning of the string. Let's consider the first few tokens: t25, t49, t52, t11, t8, t83, t49, t11, t32.\n\nt25 could come from NT25, but NT25 only produces 't33'. Alternatively, maybe t25 is part of a larger production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar uses several non-terminals to generate each terminal. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- S -> NT45 NT81\n- So S is a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t25, which isn't a non-terminal, so that must be a terminal derived from a non-terminal. Looking back, rules that end with 't25' don't seem to exist. So perhaps 't25' is part of a larger step where it's derived indirectly.\n\nWait, the rules:\n\nLooking for where 't25' appears in the right-hand side. The rules that produce 't25' do not exist. So perhaps 't25' is derived from a non-terminal that can go to 't25', but I don't see any such rule. So maybe it's impossible, which would mean the string is invalid, thus the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, in the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly or indirectly produces 't25'.

Therefore, it's impossible to derive a string starting with 't25', so the entire string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Perhaps 't25' is somehow derived indirectly. For example, maybe a non-terminal that can produce something with 't25' as part of its expansion.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of terminals: t82 t59 t26 t47 t13 t25 t11 t52 t3 t49.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how this grammar works. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My goal is to see if the given string can be derived by applying these productions step by step starting from the start symbol, which is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S branches into two parts: S -> NT45 NT81 and S -> NT19 NT67. So the initial expansion would be something like NT45 followed by NT81 or NT19 followed by NT67. I'll need to follow the possible paths to see if the string can be constructed.\n\nLet me write down the string: t82 t59 t26 t47 t13 t25 t11 t52 t3 t49.\n\nSince the string starts with t82, I need to see which production can lead to that.

Wait, but in the grammar, there's a production where NT2->t5 and NT8->t83. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, let me look again. The grammar has individual non-terminals like NT2, NT3, ..., and for some of them, they produce a single terminal. For example, NT27->t76, NT22->t22, etc. So perhaps each non-terminal eventually breaks down into a sequence of terminals, and the string is the concatenation of these terminals.\n\nLet me go step by step. The given string is a series of terminals, so I need to see if it's the result of expanding S into a sequence of non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nFirst, starting from S, which can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLet's tentatively choose the first option: S -> NT45 NT81.\n\nNow, I'll need to expand NT45 and NT81 each as much as possible until they produce terminals or can be broken down into non-terminals.\n\nStarting with NT45, looking at the grammar, NT45 has two productions: NT45->NT60 NT77 and NT45->NT60 NT44. Wait, both are same on NT45? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the grammar shows:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77 and NT45 -> NT50 NT44.\n\nSo, NT45 can produce either NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44.

Similarly, other rules like `NT10 -> t50` and `NT43 -> t51` show that non-terminals can produce single terminals.\n\nBut wait, the string I need to check has mostly non-terminals like `t5`, `t8`, etc. Wait, actually, looking again, the string is in terms of 't' followed by numbers, which might correspond to the terminals directly produced by the grammar. So each 'tX' is a terminal, and each 'NTX' is a non-terminal.\n\nLet me break down the string into a sequence of terminals:\n1. t5\n2. t5\n3. t14\n4. t11\n5. t39\n6. t8\n7. t82\n8. t84\n9. t22\n10. t13\n\nEach of these must be produced by some production in the grammar. For example, if somewhere in the grammar, NT5 is rewritten to t5, that fits. Let me check which NTs produce these terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I can see:\n- NT45 -> t25? Wait, no. Let me go through each terminal in the string and see which NTs produce them.\n\n1. t5: Looking at the grammar, I see NT10 -> t50 and NT45 -> 't25', but I don't see any rule for NT4 -> t5. Hmm, did I miss that? Wait, no, the string is `t5`, which is a different token. So maybe I need to check if there's a production where the LHS is a non-terminal that can produce t5. I'll look through all the rules where the RHS includes t5.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT9 -> NT36 NT45 (No, that's a production that includes NT5, not t5)\n- OH, wait, in the list of grammar rules, are there any rules where t5 appears as a RHS? Scanning through, I see:\n   - NT45 -> 't25' (so t25 is produced by NT45)\n   - NT77 -> 't8' (t8)\n   - NT84 -> 't77'\n   - NT39 -> 't28'\n   - NT13 -> 't47'\n   - And others, but I don't see any rule that directly produces t5. Wait, then how does t5 appear in the string? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps t5 corresponds to NT5 or some derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar's rules have NTs that can derive to t5. Let me check all productions to see if any NT can directly produce t5. Scanning through the grammar:\n\nLooking for rules where RHS is t5:\n\nI don't see any rule where the RHS is 't5'. So that's confusing because the string has t5 in it, but I don't see a production that produces t5. Unless I made a mistake in parsing.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar's rules have something like NT5 -> 't5', but looking back through the rules provided, I don't see any NT5 -> t5. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT45 -> t25\n- NT75 -> t32\n- NT44 -> t76\n- NT40 -> t39\n- NT36 -> t42\n- NT77 -> t8\n- NT84 -> t77\n- NT22 -> t42\n- Others produce combinations or other NTs.\n\nSo, there's no rule that directly produces t5, which is a problem because the string starts with t5, which would mean that the derivation must have a path where some NT produces t5, but I don't see that happening.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me go through the rules again:\n\nLooking for any NT that immediately produces 't5':\n\n- NT5 -> '...'?\nNo, NT5 is on the left side of some rules.\n\nLooking at rule S -> NT45 NT81, which are combined to produce a string of terminals if both can be reduced directly.\n\nBut for the string to have t5, it must be produced directly by some NT. If no NT directly produces t5, then this would imply that the string cannot be generated by the grammar, hence the answer is No.\n\nWait, unless one of the NT productions can derive to t5 through several steps, but that would imply a longer derivation, which would require the string to be longer, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, since the string starts with t5, but the grammar doesn't have any NT that directly produces t5, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check if any rule's RHS includes 't5'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT45 -> t25\nNT75 -> t32\nNT44 -> t76\nNT40 -> t39\nNT22 -> t42\nNT77 -> t8\nSo no, none of the NT productions directly produce t5. Therefore, the string t5 cannot be generated. So the entire string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string in question is `t59 t13 t82 t11 t25 t13 t77 t25 t49 t76 t77`. Hmm, that's quite a long string with a lot of tokens. \n\nFirst, I'll need to look at the grammar rules provided. Let me try to parse the grammar to understand how the strings are built. The grammar starts with S and expands into NT combinations, which themselves expand further into other NTs or terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers. \n\nLooking at S, it goes to NT45 NT81 and NT19 NT67. Each of these NTs then expand into other NTs or sometimes directly into terminals. So for example, NT45 can become 't25' or go further into other NTs. Similarly, NT77 is a terminal 't77'.\n\nThe string I'm trying to validate is made up of several 't' tokens. So I guess I need to see if these 't's can come from the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by looking for any 't's in the NT rules. So scanning through the grammar, I see that various NTs expand into terminals. For example, NT45 can become 't25', NT47 can become 't84', and so on. Also, some NTs like NT44 can expand into 't76', NT39 into 't28', etc.\n\nI'll need to map the tokens in the string and see if each one can be derived from the grammar. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t59 t13 t82 t11 t25 t13 t77 t25 t49 t76 t77\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n1. t59: Looking at the grammar, which NTs expand into 't59'? Let's see. In the rules, I don't see NT59 directly, but perhaps through a chain. Wait, I don't think any NT immediately goes to 't59', so that could be a problem. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules, the only 't's I see are 't5', 't8', 't11', 't22', 't25', 't26', 't28', 't30', 't32', 't35', 't39', 't42', 't44', 't47', 't49', 't53', 't59', 't76', 't77', 't82', etc. But do any NTs lead to 't59'? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n- NT44 -> 't76' and 't59'\nOh, so NT44 can become 't76' or 't59'. That's good.\n\nSo the first token, 't59' must be from NT44. Okay, that's possible.\n\nNext, t13: Looking for NTs that produce 't13'. Looking at the rules, NT13 -> 't47', so that doesn't help. Wait, no, in the grammar, I don't see 't13' directly, but let me check all rules again. Wait, I see that NT13 is present in some rules, like S->NT13 NT52, but not as a terminal. Let me check all NT rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly gives 't13'. Wait, but in the list, I see NT13->'t47'. Hmm, no. Wait, line 14: NT19 -> NT84 NT8, line 23: NT58 -> NT27 NT47, line 24: NT14 -> NT25 NT52, etc. Wait, does any NT produce 't13'? Let me check all:\n\nLooking through the rules, for NTs such as NT13: In NT5 -> NT9 NT53, NT9 -> NT36 NT45, etc. But I don't see any NT producing 't13' as a terminal. So 't13' must come from an NT that can derive 't13'. Alternatively, perhaps 't13' is a typo and should be 't25' or something else, but assuming the string is correct, I need to see if 't13' is possible. \n\nWait, looking at the rules, every NT seems to expand to other NTs or to certain terminals. So if there's no NT rule that creates 't13', then 't13' can't be in the string. Therefore, the string would be invalid.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. Let me go through all the NT rules:\n\n1. S -> NT45 NT81, NT19 NT67\n2. NT5 -> NT61 NT75, NT9 NT53\n3. NT7 -> NT36 NT45\nWait, line 17: NT71 -> NT9 NT75, and NT9 is 't26' from elsewhere.\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all NTs and their derivations:\n\nLooking through all NT production rules, I don't see any NT that directly becomes 't13'. So 't13' cannot appear if the grammar doesn't have an NT that can produce it. Therefore, if the string contains 't13', then the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but looking back, perhaps I'm missing an NT. Let me check line 21: NT14 -> NT25 NT52, line 32: NT50 -> NT14 NT71. Hmm, I don't see any NT that directly leads to 't13'. So if the string has a 't13', it's not possible.\n\nWait, no, in the string, the first token is 't59', which is okay, next is 't13', which is problematic because there's no NT leading to 't13'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again. In the rules, is there any NT that can produce 't13'?\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see an NT that has 't13' as a terminal. So the answer should be No because 't13' can't be in the string.\n\nBut let's make sure. Maybe I'm missing an NT somewhere. Let me list all NTs and their possible derivations:\n\n- NT45: 't25' or if it expands further, maybe leads to others, but 't45' is a terminal only through 't25'.\nWait, no. NT45 can become 't25' or go further. Wait, no, NT45's production is either 't25' or into other NTs.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT45 is S->NT45 NT81 and another production: NT45 -> NT60 NT77. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, line 7 says S->NT19 NT67, line 8 is NT5 -> NT9 NT53, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up NTs. Let me focus on the NTs that can produce 't13' or 't59'. Wait, 't13' is problematic because no NT rules produce it.\n\nSo if any token in the string can't be derived, the string is invalid. Therefore, the string has a 't13' which can't be produced by any NT in the grammar, so the answer is no.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a token 't13', which cannot be derived from any Non-Terminal in the grammar. \n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I recall that any context-free grammar can be transformed into Chomsky Normal Form, as is often done in proofs. So, the given grammar must already be in CNF, which is helpful because that simplifies the analysis.\n\nThe string starts with `t30`, `t22`, `t39`, etc. These look like terminal symbols. My goal is to parse the string from left to right and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar's productions mostly expand non-terminals into two non-terminals. Each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others, until we get to terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree must be a binary tree where each internal node has exactly two children. This means that the length of the derived string should be one more than the number of production steps. For example, starting from S and applying two productions (each replacing a non-terminal with two), we'd get four symbols, but since some might be terminals, it could vary. However, in our case, the string has 11 symbols. Since the start symbol S might derive into two non-terminals, which each derive further, and so on, the total number of steps would be such that the length of the string is a result of the branching.\n\nLet me consider the structure. Each non-terminal expansion adds exactly one non-terminal pair. So, starting from S, each step could potentially double the number of symbols, but since some will be terminals, perhaps the length isn't a straightforward power of two.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to map the string backward, reconstructing possible non-terminals that could lead to the given string. This is sometimes called a top-down or backward induction parse.\n\nLooking at the string, the last symbols are `t3`, which is a terminal. Looking into the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand into 't' followed by some number. For example, NT36 \u2192 't42', NT22 \u2192 't22', etc. Wait, actually, looking more carefully, some non-terminals have productions ending with specific terminals like 't22', 't28', etc.\n\nLet me map which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't39' (among others)\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\nNT35 \u2192 Is there any NT that goes to 't35'? Looking through the productions, I see NT27 \u2192 't35'.\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 't22'\nNT81 \u2192 't30'\nNT76 \u2192 't59'? Wait, let me check. Looking at the productions, NT44 \u2192 't76', NT77 \u2192 't8', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to reverse-engineer which non-terminals can lead to each terminal in the string.\n\nLet's list the string in reverse to see if that helps.\n\nThe string is: t30 t22 t39 t35 t76 t5 t5 t35 t28 t42 t3\n\nSo, starting from the end, the last token is t3. I need to find which non-terminals can produce t3. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce 't3'. For example:\n\nNT53 \u2192 't30'? Wait, no, looking at the productions, I see NT53 \u2192 't30'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT53 \u2192 't30' (look at NT53: \"NT53 \u2192 't30'\", yes. So, NT53 can produce 't30'. But wait, in the string, the last token is t3. So looking for which NT produces 't3'. Let me scan through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'? No, looking at NT9: \"NT9 -> NT36 NT45\", no, unless there's a production that directly gives t3.\n\nWait, looking for 't3', I check the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT7 \u2192 't11', NT10 \u2192 't50' etc. Wait, I don't see any production that directly gives 't3'. Hmm, that's a problem because the string ends with 't3', and if no NT directly expands into 't3', then the string can't be derived.

Let me check all NT81 productions.\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n\"NT84 -> 't77'\", \"NT81 -> 't30'\", and \"NT81 -> 't3'\". Wait, no, looking through the given grammar, does NT81 have any production that directly gives 't3'? Let me check:\n\nIn the given productions: \"NT81 -> 't71'\" and \"NT81 -> 't3'\". Wait, that can't be. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\n\"NT81 -> 't71'\" and \"NT81 -> 't3'\": No, actually, looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\n\"NT45 -> 't44'\", \"NT77 -> 't8'\", \"NT39 -> 't28'\", \"NT13 -> 't47'\", \"NT7 -> 't11'\", \"NT8 -> 't83'\", etc. Then further down:\n\n\"NT27 -> 't35'\", \"NT22 -> 't22'\", \"NT44 -> 't76'\", \"NT36 -> 't42'\", \"NT81 -> 't71'\", \"NT81 -> 't3'\". Wait, yes, NT81 can produce both 't71' and 't3'. So that's the critical point. So, the last token in the string is 't3', so NT81 can produce 't3'. So, the last symbol could come from NT81 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo, working backward, the last symbol is t3, so the last rule would be NT81 \u2192 't3'. Now, the symbol before that is t42, which is followed by t3.\n\nWait, no, the last two symbols are t42 and t3. So that would require that t42 t3 comes from some NT expansion. Let's think in terms of the production rules. Since in CNF, each production splits a non-terminal into two parts. So, if a non-terminal A expands into, say, B and C, then B and C would each be expanded further, until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, going backward, the last non-terminal before producing t3 would be something that expands into 't42' and 't3'? But wait, no, because 't42' is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, each step in the backward process would involve breaking down the string into parts that match the right-hand side (RHS) of a grammar rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think top-down. Starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet's think: S can expand into NT45 and NT81, each of which is a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-204","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is a bit complex, with a bunch of non-terminals and production rules. The string to evaluate is `t83 t28 t49 t11 t30 t49 t84 t28 t3 t33 t82`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a context-free grammar in CNF looks like. CNF requires that each production rule is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals, with no \u03b5 (epsilon) productions. Looking at the grammar, I see all the rules are either terminals or combinations of two non-terminals, so it fits.\n\nThe string provided consists of a series of terminals separated by spaces. My goal is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol, which is S. The grammar has a start symbol S, and from the rules, I see that S can be rewritten in different ways, such as S -> NT45 NT81, S -> NT19 NT67, etc. So there are multiple ways S can be rewritten.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the terminals produced by these non-terminals. Let's look at the string: t83, t28, t49, t11, t30, t49, t84, t28, t3, t33, t82.\n\nI think a good strategy is to work backwards from the string, trying to match the leftmost symbols to possible productions. Alternatively, I could process the string from left to right, choosing the appropriate production rules to generate each part.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to reverse the process. Starting from the right, see if each symbol matches a production of some non-terminal, and see if the entire string can be built from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string step by step. Let's see, from S, the string is generated by a sequence of non-terminals that eventually expand into the terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at possible S productions. S can be NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's consider each case.\n\nFirst, S -> NT45 NT81. So the generated string would start with NT45 generating t83 and NT81 generating t... Looking for t83, I see in the rules that NT83 is 't30', but wait, maybe I'm looking at the rules the wrong way. Wait, the grammar's productions are for non-terminals to produce other non-terminals or terminals. The string is in terms of terminals, so the non-terminals must expand into the correct terminals.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT45 -> 't25' and others. So for example, NT45 can produce 't25'. But in the string, I see a t83, which must come from some non-terminal that expands into t83.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT44 -> 't76', and NT27 -> 't76' as well. Also, NT73 -> 't...' Hmm, not sure. Wait, let me check. Wait, in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT77 -> 't8' (not relevant here)\n- NT30 -> 't82' (no)\n- NT45 -> 't25'\n- Let me scan the rules for any that produce 't83'. Looking, I see:\n\n- NT44 -> 't76' and 't59' as well.\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT22 -> 't22' (so that's a terminal)\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n\nBut wait, I'm looking for 't83' in the string. Let me check the rules again to see if any non-terminals expand into 't83'. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at each line, I see NT44: NT44 -> 't76' and 't59', but not 't83'. Hmm, wait, looking again:\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar rules again. Wait, in the rules section, I see:\n\n- `NT45 -> 't25'`\n- `NT72 -> 't10'`\n- `NT77 -> 't8'`\n- `NT83 -> 't30'`\n- `NT28 -> 't5'`\n- `NT9 -> 't26'`\n- `NT40 -> 't39'`\n- `NT12 -> 't3'`\n- `NT8 -> 't83'`\n- `NT19 -> 't84'`\n- And so on.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-212","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems each production either breaks down non-terminals into two non-terminals or terminals. Okay, that checks out.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t3 t32 t26 t22 t26 t8 t30 t59 t84 t26 t84 t39`. I notice that this string consists of a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the grammar has two options: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Since S starts with NT45 or NT19, let's see how these break down.\n\nThe first rule S \u2192 NT45 NT81 would produce a string starting with t44 and t71 because looking at NT45, the terminal is 't44', and NT81 is 't71'. But the given string starts with t3, so this path doesn't seem to fit. Wait, hold on, let me verify. Actually, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44. So NT50 \u2192 ? Let me check. NT50 hasn't been defined here. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should create a parse tree or at least understand the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if each token in the string can be derived from the grammar. Let's list the tokens: t3, t32, t26, t22, t26, t8, t30, t59, t84, t26, t84, t39.\n\nI should probably check the productions for each non-terminal and see if each token can be matched through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the strings correspond directly to certain non-terminals, so I can see if there's a way to derive each token step by step.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to parse the string according to the grammar. Let's start by looking for the start symbol S.\n\nThe string starts with t3. So, maybe NT3? Let me check which non-terminals produce t3. Looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for rules where the right-hand side is 't3' or can derive 't3'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see which non-terminals produce 't3' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice 't3' appears in a few places. For instance, NT22 \u2192 NT22 (since one of the rules is NT22 \u2192 't22'), but I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nWait, actually, in the productions, I see NT30 \u2192 't82', NT27 \u2192 't35', NT25 \u2192 't33', but I don't see 't3' being directly produced by any NT. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again at the productions, I see:\n\nLooking for 't3':\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT50 \u2192 NT30 \u2192 't84' (from NT30 \u2192 t82), but that's a chain.\nWait, perhaps 't3' is produced by a certain NT. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it directly.\n\nWait, perhaps 't3' is part of a longer production, like NT53 \u2192 't27'? Let me check: NT53's production is NT50 NT36, but then NT50 \u2192 NT50 NT49, which I don't think directly produces 't3'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to backtrack. Alternatively, maybe 't3' is part of longer sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by looking at possible derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be generated by breaking down non-terminals into terminals. Let me check if each 't' in the string can be matched to a production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see that 't3' can only come from a specific NT. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT27 \u2192 't35' and 't76', so no, that doesn't produce t3.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in not seeing it.

The string has 't22' multiple times, so maybe that's a starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if the entire string can be matched by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in the grammar, certain non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT25 \u2192 't25', but the string has 't22', so that's not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a production that can generate 't26'. Looking for NT26 producing 't26'? Let me check if any NT has a production that ends with 't26'.\n\nWait, I don't see a production that directly outputs 't26'. Let me check each production for an NT that leads to 't26'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t26 is part of a larger chain.\n\nWait, according to the productions, NT9 \u2192 't26' (from NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45, and NT36 \u2192 NT45 NT33, wait no, let's check:\n\nWait, looking again:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53 and also NT36 \u2192 NT50 NT36, but I don't see NT36 \u2192 't36', unless it's part of a chain.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.

Let me double-check. Are there any NTs that produce 't3'?\n\nLooking at the list of productions... I don't see 't3' being produced. So if 't3' is in the string, but there's no NT that produces 't3', then the entire string can't be generated by the grammar. But wait, I'm not sure\u2014maybe 't3' comes from a chain of non-terminals that somehow end up in 't3', but looking through, I don't see any NT that eventually leads to 't3'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.

My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I need to see how the string could be parsed. Let's look for possible breaks in the string that align with the grammar.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, it ends with t42. I notice from the grammar that NT45 has a production where it becomes t60 followed by t44, but I also see that NT44 has a production like t83 followed by t7, which could contribute to t83 t7, but that's not in our case. Alternatively, looking for the last part: t33 t59 t3 t42.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT39 can produce 't28', NT52 can produce 't71', and NT37 (or whatever) isn't here. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe it's better to parse the string from the end, trying to see if I can break it down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the last token: t42. I check the grammar to see where this can come from. Looking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals produce t42, like NT36 -> 't42', and NT44 -> 't59' but wait, no. Looking again: NT36 can also produce 't42'? Let me check the production for NT36. Oh, yes, I see: NT36 -> 't42'. Also, in another production, NT36 can be split further into NT84 NT53, which then leads to 't77' or other parts.\n\nSimilarly, NT45 produces 't60' and 't44'. 't60' might come from NT60, which goes to NT30 NT81, and so on.\n\nI think a better approach is to build a parse tree, but starting from the end. Let's try to see possible breaking points.\n\nThe last three elements are t59 t3 t42. Let's see: t42 is from NT36. So the t42 must come from NT36. So the part before t42 must be the left part of NT36's production. Looking at NT36's productions: one is NT61 NT74, another is 't42', and another is NT50 NT36. So, since the string ends with t42, the last symbol is achieved through NT36. So the rest of the string before that should be either NT61 NT74 or NT50 NT36.\n\nLooking at the given string: ... t59 t3 t42. So before t42, we have t59 and t3. Let me see if I can combine these into the production of NT36, which is NT50 NT36. Wait, no, because NT36 can be split further. Alternatively, if the production is NT50 NT36, then NT50 must produce 't59' and NT36 as t3? That doesn't make sense because t3 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. So perhaps the other route.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT5's production: NT5 can produce NT9 NT53 or 't26'. But in the string, we have t26, which is a terminal. So maybe NT5 is 't26'?\n\nWait, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list all the tokens in the string: t42, t26, t84, t5, t76, t83, t8, t22, t49, t33, t59, t3, t42.\n\nI'll process the string from the beginning, trying to match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first token, t42. Where does t42 come from?\n\nFrom the grammar, NT36 -> 't42'. So the start of the string must come from NT36. So the first symbol t42 comes from NT36. So that's one part. Now, in NT36's production, it can be broken down into three parts: either NT61 NT74 or 't42', or NT50 NT36. Since we have 't42' as the first token, perhaps the NT36 is broken as 't42' immediately. But then the next token is t26, which isn't part of that. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps NT36 is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, the grammar's S rule starts with S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. So maybe the entire string starts with one of these.\n\nLet me try to see which of these can lead to our string.\n\nLooking at S -> NT45 NT81. Let's see how NT45 and NT81 can produce the first two symbols t42 t26.\n\nNT45's production includes 't60' and 't44', or other options. Wait, from the grammar: NT45 can produce 't60' 't44', or 't50' 't44', or 't60' 't77', or 't44' 't44', etc. But also, from looking at the string, the first two tokens are t42 and t26. So if S is split into NT45 and NT81, then NT45 must produce t42 and t26.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions: does it produce t42? Let's check. NT36->t42, but NT45 can't directly produce t42. Looking at NT45's rules: NT45 -> NT60 NT77, NT40 NT71, NT40 NT44, etc. It seems NT45 doesn't directly produce tanything except via further expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with S -> NT19 NT67, which would lead to NT19 and NT67. Let's see: NT19 has productions like NT84 NT8 and 't47'. Hmm, the second symbol is t26, which comes from NT26. Wait, but NT26 isn't in the grammar as a non-terminal. Let's check:\n\nLooking at NT5's production: NT5-> NT9 NT53 or 't26'. So 't26' is a terminal and comes from NT5.\n\nSo if S is split into NT19 and NT67, then NT19 needs to produce 't42' and 't26'? Let's see: NT19 can produce NT84 NT8 and 't47'. So 't42' isn't directly produced by NT19. Alternatively, maybe NT19 is split further, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S is split into NT45 and NT81, so NT45 produces t42 and something, and NT81 produces t26 and the rest.\n\nWait, let me approach this differently. Since the string starts with t42, let's see NTS that produce 't42'. From the grammar, NT36 -> 't42'. So to get 't42' as the first symbol, the first non-terminal must be NT36. So S must split into something that leads to NT36 first.\n\nLooking at S's rules: S can split into S1 NT81 or S1 NT67, etc. Wait, the S production is:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\nor S -> NT19 NT67\nand others, but the string starts with t42, which comes from NT36. So I think S must be split as NT45 NT81, because NT19 would give a different initial production.\n\nSo first, let's assume the string starts with NT45 producing the first few symbols. Let's see:\n\nNT45 can produce 't60' followed by 't77' (via NT60 -> t84, etc.), or 't50' followed by 't44', etc. But our first token is 't42', which is produced by NT36, not NT45.

The start symbol is the only non-terminal that can be empty.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that all the production rules are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or some of them produce terminals directly. For example, NT45 has a production NT45 \u2192 t25 and others produce combinations of NTs. So, that fits CNF.\n\nThe task is to parse the string using this grammar. Since the grammar is given, I need to see if the string can be generated through a series of valid expansions.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so each part must correspond to a terminal in one of the productions.\n\nLet me list the string parts: t77, t33, t82, t30, t32, t71, t39, t84, t82, t32, t35, t47, t84.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I should check which NTs produce which terminals. From the grammar, I see lines like NT45 \u2192 t25, NT77 \u2192 t8, NT84 \u2192 t77, etc. So each of these NTs have specific terminals attached.\n\nI think I need to start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar's rules are only in CNF, so the string must be built by combining non-terminals according to the rules until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nS has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo to start, any derivation must begin with either S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nI can try both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n\nNow, I look at NT45 and NT81.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT45 can produce t25 or other NT combinations. But in our string, the first symbol is t77.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, is there an NT that produces t77? Yes, NT77 \u2192 t8. Hmm, that's not helpful. Wait, no, looking again, NT77 \u2192 t8 is a production. Wait, but looking at the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t77. So I need a non-terminal that produces t77.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT44 \u2192 t76 (two times)\nNT27 \u2192 t76\nNT77 \u2192 t8\n\nWait, none of these directly produce t77. Wait, but looking again, perhaps I missed something. Let me check all the NT productions that might end with t77.\n\nWait, I see this line: NT44 \u2192 t76. So that gives t76, not t77. But I'm looking for t77. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 t76, but is there another rule that produces t77? Hmm, I think maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking through the production rules:\n\nI see NT77 \u2192 t8\n\nThat's it. I don't see any NT that directly produces t77. So if our current path is S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then neither NT45 nor NT81 produce t77. So that path can't be part of the string, since the string starts with t77.\n\nTherefore, this path is invalid.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nNow, NT19 and NT67.\n\nLooking at NT19's productions: I see in the grammar, NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 and NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t77. Does any NT here produce t77? Let's check the productions for NT77: NT77 \u2192 t8. So, no NT that directly produces t77.\n\nWait, but perhaps through other nodes. Let me see. For example, if NT19 can lead to a chain that produces t77.\n\nWait, let's explore NT19.\n\nNT19 has two productions: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 and NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5.\n\nLet's check NT84 first.\n\nLooking at NT84, I see it doesn't appear as a target in any production except where it's in another non-terminal like NT40 \u2192 NT58 NT39, etc. Wait, looking for NT84:\n\nWait, from the productions, I see:\n\nLooking at NT45 \u2192 t60 NT77 (Wait no, NT45 \u2192 is in multiple places.

Let me list them:\n\nt77, t33, t82, t30, t32, t71, t39, t84, t82, t32, t35, t47, t84.\n\nI can try to find a non-terminal that produces each of these.\n\nBut since the grammar uses non-terminals, I have to see if the chain of terminals can be represented by the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a recursive approach, starting from the start symbol and expanding non-terminals until reaching the string.\n\nWait, another approach: build the leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S.\n\nSince S has two productions, I can try both.\n\nLet me try the second option: S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nNow, let's expand NT19 and NT67.\n\nLooking at NT19 \u2192 options are NT84 NT8 and NT60 NT5.\n\nLet me see NT19 first produces something that leads to t77.\n\nBut from earlier, NT19's productions don't directly produce t77. So maybe via other steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT19 can lead to t84 and then t8, which are t84 and t77.\n\nWait, wait: NT84 \u2192 looking through the productions, I see ND84 is produced by NT40 \u2192 NT58 NT39, but that doesn't lead to terminals except as per the rules.\n\nWait, no. Let's check NT84's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I think NT84 is not directly a target of any production except as part of something else.\n\nWait, perhaps it's in the rules of other non-terminals.\n\nFor example, NT40 \u2192 NT58 NT39.\n\nWait, but NT58 produces t37? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the entire process step by step, which is time-consuming but necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write down the possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to check for each symbol in the string if it exists as a right-hand side of any rule, and see if it can fit into the grammar.\n\nBut the string is 't77', then 't33', etc. So let's check if each can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at t77: In the grammar, NT77 \u2192 t8, so 't77' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal except if there's a rule we missed.\n\nSimilarly, t33: Do any NT produce 't33'? Looking, I don't see any NT with a production that includes 't33'.\n\nWait, unless I've missed some NT. Let me check through the production rules.\n\nAh! Wait, I see this production:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT27 NT47\nLooking further, NT27 is in a production that can produce t76. So, NT33 \u2192 t76 NT47.\n\nBut the terminal 't33' is not directly produced.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. There are many production rules that produce specific single terminals, like A \u2192 tX where X is some number. So, every string generated by this grammar will consist of these terminal symbols, each corresponding directly to a production that ends with a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t13 t39 t83 t3 t33 t49 t84 t47 t14 t52 t32 t84 t32 t71`\n\nLet me list the terminals to check: [t13, t39, t83, t3, t33, t49, t84, t47, t14, t52, t32, t84, t32, t71]\n\nI notice that in the given grammar, the only non-terminals are things like S, NT0, NT1, etc., but the terminals are things like t1, t2, etc. So, each terminal in the string must correspond to a production rule that directly maps a non-terminal to that terminal.\n\nI should check if each terminal in the string has a corresponding production rule in the grammar. Let's go through each terminal one by one.\n\n1. t13: Looking at the grammar, I see NT13 \u2192 t47. Wait, no, that's for NT13 \u2192 NT7 -> ... \u2192 t47? Hmm, no. Let me check the grammar rules. Oh, wait, I see NT13 \u2192 t47 is not present. Wait, looking back, is there a production for NT13? Yes, in the grammar, there's NT13 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 ... \u2192 t47. Wait, no, actually NT7 is a different rule. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 t47\n\nYes, there is NT13 \u2192 t47. So, t13 is not a terminal, but actually, it's used as part of NT13, which produces t47. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. The production NT13 \u2192 t47 means that when you have NT13, you can replace it with t47. So, t13 is a terminal that's generated by NT13. So, in the string, if I have t13, that corresponds to a production that ends with t13. But looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce t13?\n\nWait, no. Let me check. There's no rule like NT... \u2192 t13. Instead, for example, NT13 \u2192 t47. So, in the string, if I have t13, that would mean the grammar has a production that ends with t13, which it doesn't. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to trace back from the terminals to see if they can be produced by the grammar. Each terminal in the string must be covered by a production rule. For example, t84 is produced by NT44 \u2192 t84. So, the string contains t84, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check each terminal:\n\nt13: Is there a production that ends with t13? Let's see. In the grammar, I don't see any rule that ends with t13. The rule for NT13 is NT13 \u2192 t47, which is t47, not t13. So, t13 isn't a terminal that any non-terminal directly produces. So, in the string, if we have t13, that would be a problem because no rule ends with t13. It seems that t13 is part of some production chain, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the grammar produces t-strings, each part of the input string must be matched by a production that directly replaces a non-terminal with a terminal. So, for each symbol in the string, I need to see if it's in the terminal symbols of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar's production rules, the terminal symbols are t1, t2, t3, etc. But specifically, the string has t13, which isn't a terminal in any production rule. Because no rule directly produces t13; instead, NT13 produces t47. So, t13 would require that a production rule exists for some non-terminal that ends with t13. But I don't see such a rule.\n\nFor example, in the grammar, we have NT13 \u2192 t47. So, t47 is the terminal output. Therefore, if the string contains t13, it can't be produced by this grammar because there's no production that outputs t13. So, t13 is not a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Perhaps the NT13 is one of the non-terminals, and the string has t13 as a symbol, but it's not part of the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-251","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t52 t76 t22 t3 t84 t5 t49 t28 t77 t30 t47 t49 t32 t13`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, often using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just manually checking, I'll need a different approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it consists of a set of production rules starting from the start symbol S. Each production either combines two non-terminals or ends with a terminal. The string given is a sequence of terminals, so my job is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI also notice that the string ends with `t13`. Looking at the grammar, I see there's a production NT13 -> 't47'. So the last symbol 't13' must be the terminal 't47' which isn't possible because 't13' is a terminal, but the production for NT13 is 't47' not 't13'. Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no. The production for NT13 is `NT13 -> 't47'`, which means 't13' isn't in the grammar. So perhaps the last symbol is `t13` which isn't a terminal in the grammar. That can't be right. Maybe I misread the productions.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, there's a production NT13 -> 't47', so 't13' isn't a terminal, it's actually derived from NT13. Hmm, but the string has 't13', which is a terminal. So this might be a problem. Maybe I should check if 't13' is ever a terminal but looking through the productions, I don't see any terminal called 't13'. Instead, NT13 goes to 't47'. So maybe the string has a 't13' which isn't allowed. That might be a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's last symbol is correct because of a different path. Maybe I need to backtrack from the string to see if each symbol can be matched by the grammar.\n\nLet's start breaking down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t52, t76, t22, t3, t84, t5, t49, t28, t77, t30, t47, t49, t32, t13.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminals and see if they match any productions:\n\n- t52: Looking through the grammar, I see NT71 -> t52, and NT25 -> t33, but t52 appears in the productions. Wait, looking at the productions, I see NT71 -> 't52' (specifically, the rule `NT71 -> 't52'`). So t52 is directly produced by NT71.\n\n- t76: Looking through the productions, NT23 -> 't76' ?\n\nWait, actually, the rules include NT23 -> 't74', NT27 -> 't76', right? Let me check the productions. Yes, looking at the list, I see NT27 -> 't76'. So t76 comes from NT27.\n\nBut wait, our string starts with t52, which is from NT71, so how did NT71 get to t52? Let's see. NT71's production is `NT71 -> 't52'` so it's a direct production. So the first step is to have NT71 -> t52.\n\nNow, looking further in the string, the next symbol is t76, which comes from NT27. So to produce t76, we need NT27. But how does NT71 lead to NT27? Because S and other non-terminals are the starting points, maybe this is getting complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to look for each terminal in the string and see their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the terminals and see their possible sources:\n\n- t52: NT71 \u2192 t52\n- t76: NT27 \u2192 t76\n- t22: Looking at the productions, I see NT50 -> 't49', but where does 't22' come from? Wait, looking again, I see `NT22 -> 't22'`? No, looking at the rules, I see NT22 -> 't22'? Wait, no: looking back, I see `NT22 -> 't22'` is not present. Wait, in the productions, I'm seeing NT25 -> t33, NT22 -> 't22'? Wait no, looking at the list, the last production is NT61 -> 't13', so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal productions in the grammar to map which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT5 -> 't9' (from NT5 -> NT9 NT53, but wait NT9 is a production that leads to 't26')\nWait, no. Wait, some rules have 't's at the end, like NT5 -> 't9' or 't25'. Wait, no, looking back, actually, in the grammar rules, some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals, others produce other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a list where each non-terminal maps to the set of terminals it can produce directly, ignoring the intermediate non-terminals for now.\n\nSo, compiling the list:\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53 \u2192 looking at NT9, which can lead to t26, etc. But there are direct terminals in other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Hmm, Chomsky normal form means each production rule has either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, right? So the grammar is in a form where each step can produce two symbols, either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal.\n\nThe string I have to evaluate is: `t84 t13 t5 t76 t52 t26 t22 t77 t39 t35 t8 t82 t47 t13 t47`.\n\nFirst thing I notice is that every rule in the grammar is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the approach would be to try to derive the string by expanding the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S. Looking at the productions for S, I see S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the string will be generated starting with either \"t84 t81\" or \"t22 t67\". Wait, no, because NT45 and NT81 have rules that lead to terminals. Let me check: NT45 -> NT60 NT77, and NT77 -> 't8'. Similarly, NT81 -> 't71'. So if S -> NT45 NT81, the start would generate something like NT60 NT77 NT71. But wait, looking at NT77, it directly goes to 't8'. NT60 is another non-terminal, like NT60 -> NT30 NT81, and so on. This could take a while. Maybe I should consider which initial production makes sense.\n\nThe string starts with t84, t13, t5, t76, etc. Let me see where these come from. Let's see the rules where terminals appear.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals have terminals as productions:\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT8 -> 't83'\n- NT5 -> 't9'? No, wait, NT5: Hmm, looking back: NT5 -> NT9 NT53, and NT9 -> NT26 NT45, then NT45 leads to NT60 NT77, etc. The terminals I see in the string are t84, t13, t5, t76, t52, t26, t22, t77, t39, t35, t8, t82, t47, t13, t47.\n\nWait, some terminals like t84: let's check where that comes from. Looking at NT72 -> 't10' and 't44', but I don't see NT72 -> t84. Hmm, NT44 -> 't76' and so on. Maybe I should look for where t84 appears. Let's check NT71 -> 't52'; no, and NT72 -> 't10', 't44'. What about NT40 -> 't39', but that's more t's.\n\nAlternatively, looking for t84 in the rules: wait NT84 is a non-terminal with NT84. Let me see, NT84 -> 't77' and perhaps others? Hmm, I think I might be mixing up uppercase and lowercase T's. Wait, no, the grammar has T84 as a non-terminal? Wait, checking the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, NT45 can become 't8' via NT77. Wait, I'm getting confused because the grammar is written with uppercase letters, and the string is all lowercase 't's and numbers. Maybe I need to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the terminals are lowercase letters? No, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals have a rule like \"NT9 -> NT26 NT45\" and some have a terminal, like \"NT5 -> NT9 NT53\". Wait, some non-terminals have terminal productions ending with lowercase letters, like 't25', 't77', 't84', etc.\n\nWait, in the string, I have 't84', 't13', etc. So I need to find which non-terminals can lead directly to these terminals.\n\nLooking at NT84: Is there an NT84? Let me check the grammar rules. Yes, I see NT84's rule: looking at the rules, I see \"NT84 -> 't77'\" Wait no, wait, looking at the grammar, it's:\n\n\"NT75 -> NT72 NT53\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\nNT75 -> NT23 NT5\nWait, looking through, I don't see a production for NT84. Hmm, maybe it's a typo. Let me check all the rules. Looking through each line:\n\n- NT39 -> 't28'\n- NT13 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT81 -> 't71'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT40 -> 't39' (Wait, NT40: \"NT40 -> NT14 NT71\" and also \"NT40 -> NT58 NT39\" )\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't83'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\nAh, here we go. So NT47 -> 't84', which is a terminal. So in the string, the presence of 't84' suggests that it's produced by NT47. So in the derivation, the production must have produced NT47.\n\nLooking at NT47's rule: looking back, I see the line: \"NT47 -> t84\" Or wait, let me look again: \"NT47 -> t84\"? No, actually, the line is \"NT47 -> t84\". So NT47 is a terminal that produces 't84'. Got it.\n\nSo the string starts with 't84', which must come from NT47. So the derivation must have started with a production that leads to NT47. Wait, but all the starting productions are S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. So that would produce something else. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the string is longer than just one symbol. But each non-terminal expansion produces more symbols. So maybe the production tree is such that the NT47 comes from the expansion of NT47, which is a terminal, but wait, how is NT47 derived? Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, if NT47 is a non-terminal, it must be derived from some other non-terminal. Wait, in the grammar, checking all lines, do we have any NT47 productions? Oh yes, I think I found it earlier: \"NT47 -> t84\". So that means NT47 is a terminal, meaning it can't be further expanded. So in the string, whenever we have 't84', it must have come from NT47, which cannot be expanded further. So that suggests that in the parse, 't84' is a leaf node, meaning the entire string must be generated as a sequence of terminals starting from a single rule that only produces terminal strings.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the grammar's Chomsky normal form, where every production either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal. If a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly, that's fine. So in the grammar, if NT47 can produce 't84', then in a derivation, you can have 't84' as a terminal.\n\nBut the starting symbol is S, which can only produce two non-terminals. So how does the string start with 't84'? Because S can only produce two non-terminals, and the string starts with one terminal. That suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial rule.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the initial production of S: S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So every derivation starting from S must consist of a terminal followed by something else, unless one of those non-terminals can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at NT45: NT45 -> NT60 NT77. So if we consider the S->NT45 NT81, then the first symbol would be derived from NT45, which then must expand into NT60 and NT77. NT77 then goes to 't8' and NT60 goes to NT30 and NT81, and so on. So from S -> NT45 NT81, we get a string that starts with 't8' (from NT7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, each production is either N \u2192 NT PT or N \u2192 NT PT, where N is a non-terminal and PT is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit CNF because all productions either expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal (like NT5 -> 't25'). So, each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with two symbols, possibly non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string given is a series of terminals: t52, t59, t77, etc. In CNF, the parse tree should be a binary tree because each production is a binary split. This means that the string should be of length 2^(n) where n is the number of steps in the derivation. For example, if the start symbol S is expanded directly, the string would be of length 1 (if S is a terminal). If S is the root, the next level would have two symbols, then four, and so on.\n\nCounting the elements in the string: there are 15 tokens separated by spaces. So the string length is 15. Let's see if that fits into a binary tree.\n\nThe number of nodes in a binary tree is 2^(height + 1) - 1. If the string length is 15, then 2^(height + 1) - 1 = 15. Solving for height:\n\n2^(h+1) -1 =15 => 2^(h+1)=16 => h+1=4 => h=3. So the height would be 3, which would mean the leftmost parse tree with 8 leaves (2^3=8). But wait, 15 is not a power of 2 minus 1. Wait, no, 15 is 2^4 -1=15. So that's a height of 3. But 15 is a valid left or right skewed tree? Hmm, I think 15 could be from a tree with more complex structure, but I need to check how many nodes in the parse tree would correspond to the given string.\n\nWait, the string has 15 tokens, which would correspond to the leaves of the parse tree. So how many internal nodes would such a tree have? For a perfectly balanced binary tree, the number of nodes is 2^(k+1)-1, where k is the height. So for 15 leaves (k=3), 2^(3+1)-1=15. So yes, it fits. Therefore, the string length of 15 is possible.\n\nNext, I'll need to simulate the parse process or find a way to reconstruct a possible derivation that leads to this string.\n\nSince the start symbol is S, which has the productions S->NT45 NT81. So the first step is S expands into two non-terminals, NT45 and NT81. Each of these NT's will then further expand, possibly splitting into more NTs or terminals.\n\nLet's see what NT45 and NT81 expand into.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44.\n\nNT81 -> NT44 NT53 or NT40 NT53 or NT60 NT81 or NT30 NT2 or NT84 NT8 or NT72 NT5 or NT27 NT47 or NT22 NT7 or NT25 NT12 or NT9 NT53.\n\nWait, I need to check each production for NT81. Let me look at NT81's productions:\n\nNT81: It seems that NT81 can expand into multiple options like NT30 NT9, NT97 NT8, etc. Wait, looking at the provided grammar, NT81 is listed as having several productions:\n\nNT81 -> NT44 NT53\nNT81 -> NT40 NT53\nNT81 -> NT60 NT81\nNT81 -> NT30 NT2\nNT81 -> NT84 NT8\nNT81 -> NT72 NT5\nNT81 -> NT27 NT47\nNT81 -> NT22 NT7\nNT81 -> NT25 NT12\nNT81 -> NT9 NT53\n\nWait, that's a lot. So NT81 can expand into various combinations. Similarly, NT45 also has multiple productions.\n\nThe given string starts with t52, t59, t77, etc. Let's see what t52 corresponds to. Looking through the grammar, I see that:\n\nLooking at the terminals, for example:\n\nNT27 -> 't35'\nNT25 -> 't33'\nNT61 -> 't13'\nNT75 -> 't32'\nNT47 -> 't84'\nNT23 -> 't14'\nNT71 -> 't52' (Ah, yes, NT71 -> t52)\nNT71 -> NT978 t52\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for 't52', I see:\n\nNT71 -> 't52' is there. Wait, in the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT71 -> NT12 NT84\nNT71 -> 't52' (Yes, in the list: NT71 -> 't52')\n\nSimilarly, NT59: Wait, let me find 't59'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT53 -> 't30', but I don't see 't59' directly. Wait, let's check each terminal assignment:\n\nLooking for 't59' in the grammar, I don't immediately see it. Let me go through the provided list:\n\nNT40 -> 't39'\nNT53 -> 't30'\nNT30 -> 't82'\nNT12 -> 't3'\nNT8 -> 't83'\nNT47 -> 't84'\nNT75 -> 't32'\nNT44 -> 't59'\nWait, yes! NT44 -> 't59' is present.\n\nSo, looking back, the string starts with t52, which comes from NT71, and t59, which comes from NT44. So in the parse tree, the root's first expansion is S -> NT45 NT81. Then, let's see what each of these NTs could produce.\n\nLooking at the string: the first three tokens are t52, t59, t77. So let's see how these could be generated.\n\nIf we have S -> NT45 NT81, then perhaps NT45 is producing T59, T52, etc. Wait, but each expansion is two symbols. So the first step is S -> NT45 NT81, resulting in [NT45, NT81].\n\nThe next level would have NT45 and NT81 each being split into two symbols. So after the second step, the tree would have potentially four symbols. However, in the string, the first token is t52, which would come from a terminal symbol. Since NT71 is 't52', perhaps in NT71, one of its productions is 't52'. But in the initial expansion, S is split into NT45 and NT81, so the first split would be into these two. But to get t52, it would need to come from NT71, which isn't directly in the initial expansion.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for the entire parse tree that leads to the string. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to find a way to decompose the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me think about the string as t52 t59 t77 t26 t25 t33 t26 t84 t28 t39 t82 t14 t42 t28 t83.\n\nI notice that t52 comes from NT71, t59 comes from NT44, and t77 comes from NT77, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT77 is a terminal and it's written as NT77 -> 't8'.\n\nWait no, let's check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking back, the grammar for NT77 is: NT77 is a terminal? Wait, no.\n\nWait, the provided grammar does not have NT77; instead, NT77 is a non-terminal? Wait no, looking at the rules, some are terminals.\n\nLooking again, for example, NT77: in the provided grammar, one of the rules is NT77 -> 't8'. So NT77 is a non-terminal that can produce either a terminal 't8' or something"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t11 t26 t82 t25 t14 t47 t42 t30 t30 t32 t3 t13 t30 t33 t26 t30`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like all the non-terminals (those with 'NT' prefixes) eventually resolve to some terminals with 't' followed by numbers, except for a few that directly produce t-values and others that are defined recursively or have multiple productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each non-terminal can produce exactly one string of terminals, or two non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, but actually, it's mostly terminals since each token starts with 't'. I should parse the string to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Identify the Start Symbol**: The start symbol is S, so the string should derive from S. \n\n2. **Parse the String**: The string is `t11 t26 t82 t25 t14 t47 t42 t30 t30 t32 t3 t13 t30 t33 t26 t30`.

I can split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\n4. **Check Each Step**: Each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a single terminal. So the string can't have arbitrary orders; it has to follow the structure defined by the grammar.\n\n5. **Handle Recursion and Left\/Right Recursion**: The grammar has cases like NT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53 or other similar recursions. I need to make sure that these are handled correctly.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string:\n\nThe string is 17 tokens long. Let's list them in order:\n\nt11, t26, t82, t25, t14, t47, t42, t30, t30, t32, t3, t13, t30, t33, t26, t30.\n\nNow, let's see if S can produce this. S has two productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 NT81\nS \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo S can split into NT45 and NT81, or NT19 and NT67.\n\nLet me examine both options.\n\nFirst, production S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nThen, the string must be generated by NT45 followed by NT81.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t11. I need to see how t11 can be produced.\n\nLooking at the list, NT11 is involved in several productions, but it's a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, there's NT51? Wait, let me check: actually, looking through the grammar, I see NT71 \u2192 NT12 NT84, and NT12 \u2192 t3. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT22 \u2192 t22, NT25 \u2192 t25, etc. But for t11, I need to find which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT12 NT84. NT12 is in the grammar, but does it produce t3? Let's see, NT12 \u2192 t3. So NT71 can produce t12 followed by t84, which is t3 followed by something else. But t12 is t3, which is what? Wait, NT12 \u2192 t3, as per the grammar: NT12 \u2192 t3. So t12 is 't3', which is just 't3'.\n\nWait, wait, let me organize this better.\n\nFirst, let's list the productions and see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT19 can produce NT84 followed by NT5, or some other sequences, but wait, let me find NT19's productions. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 \u2192 t77 t83?\nWait, perhaps I should map each non-terminal to the possible terminals it can produce.\n\nBut this might take a long time. Maybe a better approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be matched to a production, and whether the sequence can follow the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first token: t11.\n\nLooking for a production that results in 't11'. Scanning the productions:\n\nI see NT71 \u2192 NT72 NT5. NT72 can produce NT10 NT44, and NT10 is 't50', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT47, but NT50 is 't49', and NT47 is 't84'. So perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can produce 't11'.\n\nI don't see any non-terminal in the grammar that directly produces 't11', except if there's a chain.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see NT71 \u2192 NT72 NT5. NT72 is defined as NT10 NT44. NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT47. NT50 is 't49', and NT47 is 't84'. So that gives 't50' 't49' or 't84'. So that's not 't11'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check if there's any non-terminal that can produce 't11'. I think there's none directly. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again.\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't11' as a terminal. Maybe 't11' is only produced by a non-terminal that is part of a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check the production rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the list again, I'm not seeing any NT that directly produces 't11'. So perhaps that's a problem. Wait, the string starts with t11, so if S can't produce t11 directly, perhaps it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and NT45 produces t11 or something else.\n\nLooking at NT45: It has several productions:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n- NT45 \u2192 NT47 NT84\n- NT45 \u2192 NT53 NT12\n- NT45 \u2192 NT27 NT47\n- NT45 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 't5'? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, actually, in the list, I see: NT5 \u2192 `NT9 NT53`, etc., but looking for NT45:\n\nWait, in the list: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44, NT45 \u2192 NT47 NT84, NT45 \u2192 NT53 NT12, NT45 \u2192 NT27 NT47, NT45 \u2192 NT5, which is a terminal. Wait, no: looking again:\n\nIn the list, I have:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT14 NT71\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Looking at the list, earlier steps: It says \"NT45 \u2192 't25'\". Wait, actually, the list seems to have some lines like:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n\n...\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, I'm confused because earlier I thought NT45 directly produces 't25', but looking again, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n\n...\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n\n...\n\nLooking further down:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\n\nBut wait, earlier in the list, looking at how it's written, perhaps it's more accurate to see if any NT can produce 't11'. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nGoing back: the first token is 't11'. So we need some non-terminal that can produce 't11' directly or through a series of productions"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, which expands into various combinations of non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the productions, S starts as either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Each of these non-terminals can further expand, sometimes into more non-terminals or terminals (like 't' followed by a number). \n\nThe string provided starts with several 't's, so I'll need to trace through the grammar to see if these terminals can be produced by the non-terminals in the grammar. \n\nLet me break down the string step by step:\n\n1. t39: From the productions, looking for where a non-terminal expands to 't39'. Scanning through the NT rules, I see NT44 \u2192 't76' and NT39 \u2192 't28', as well as other 't's. Wait, no. Wait, looking again, NT39 isn't present.

Looking through each NT rule, I see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\nSo NT40 can produce t39. So 't39' must come from NT40.\n\nSo now, the first part of the string is generated from NT40 \u2192 't39', then the next parts must come from some other non-terminals or maybe NT27 (which also has 't42')?

The rules for NT44: NT44 \u2192 't76' and also NT44 \u2192 't59' (Wait, no: looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\n\"NT44 -> 't76'\" and \"NT52 -> 't71'\", \"NT72 -> 't10'\", etc. Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the numbers.

Here's the key: NT47 \u2192 't84'\n\nSo, 't84' comes from NT47. So the third token in the string is 't84', which is produced by NT47.\n\nSo after NT40 \u2192 t39, we have NT23 \u2192 t14, then NT47 \u2192 t84.\n\nNext token is 't5'. Looking for 't5' as a terminal. Let's see the rules:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I don't see any NT producing 't5' directly. Wait, but maybe one of the NT productions can expand to 't5'. Or perhaps one of the terminal rules:\n\nLooking again, I see NT22 \u2192 't22', NT75 \u2192 't32', NT53 \u2192 't30', etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe I need to check where 't5' comes from.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Looking through the NT rules, I don't see any NT \u2192 't5'. That might be a problem because the fourth token is 't5', but none of the NT rules directly produce 't5'. So if that's the case, then perhaps this string cannot be generated, so the answer would be No. But wait, perhaps 't5' is produced via some other NT production that eventually leads to it. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption that 't84' comes from NT47 is correct, but perhaps I'm missing a path that can take that 't84' as part of a larger production. Wait, but the third token is 't84', which must be directly produced, so if nothing produces 't84', then the string can't be generated. Wait, no, wait: NT47 can produce 't84' as per the rule NT47 \u2192 't84'.\n\nSo, the third token is 't84' from NT47. But wait, then where does 't5' come after that? Because the fourth token is 't5', which must come from some NT production that eventually leads to 't5'. But looking through the NT rules again, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't5'.

{"custom_id":"request-305","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t59 t82 t39 t3 t76 t76 t13 t22 t8 t77 t30 t5 t28 t47 t30 t35 t26`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a CFG in CNF looks like. CNF is where each production rule has at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, and the start symbol is on the left. Also, every production leads towards terminal symbols, so there are no useless symbols or epsilon productions in this case.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it starts with S and branches into combinations of NTs and some terminals. The first step is to note that each symbol in the string must be produced by some rule in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by analyzing each 't' in the string to see if they can be derived from some non-terminal. For example, 't25' is directly produced by NT45. So, any 'tX' must have an NTX somewhere, but let's check which are present in the string.\n\nThe string includes 't59', 't82', 't39', 't3', 't76', 't76', 't13', 't22', 't8', 't77', 't30', 't5', 't28', 't47', 't30', 't35', 't26'. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can see which NTs lead to these terminals. For instance:\n- 't5' is directly produced by NT5.\n- 't8' is directly produced by NT19 via the rule NT19 -> t84 | t5 | ... Wait, looking back, NT19's rules:\n  NT19 -> NT84 NT8 | NT60 NT5 | ... Hmm, no, wait, in the given rules, I see NT19 -> NT84 NT8, but that's for NT19, which is a non-terminal that must be derived from other symbols.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminal symbols in the grammar rules:\n- 't5', 't77', 'nt72', 'nt40', 'nt14', 'nt25', 't76', 't84', 't39', 't82', etc. Wait, perhaps I should make a list of all the terminal symbols:\nLooking through each rule, whenever a symbol is written without any NTs, it's a terminal. For example:\n- S -> NT45 NT81, so NT45 and NT81 are part of the first branch.\nWait, no, actually, in the rules, some are written as 'tX', like 't25' is directly produced by NT45, 't8' is produced by NT19, etc.\n\nSo the terminals are: t5, t77, t82, t39, t3, t76, t13, t22, t8, t77, t30, t5, t28, t47, t30, t35, t26.\n\nWait, I can see each 't' in the string corresponds to a production. Now, I need to check if each of these 't's can be reached from S.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So each part of S can be NT branches.\n\nLet's take the first part: NT45 -> NT60 NT77.\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81 or other routes. Let's see if this can lead to t30 and t81, but t81 is 't30' and t5. So 't30' is an NT that can go to 't30' via NT60->NT30 NT81? Wait, no, NT60 has a rule NT60 -> NT30 NT81.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT60 is defined as NT30 NT81? Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking at NT60: NT60 -> NT30 NT81.\n\nWait, but NT30 produces 't82', I think. Let me check NT30's rules: NT30 -> NT82 NT... Looking through the rules, I see NT30 -> NT82 (but wait, NT30 is part of a larger production, like S -> NT45 NT81, which is a binary expansion. Let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S, and from S, there are two branches. Each branch is two NTs. For example, S -> NT45 NT81. So both NT45 and NT81 need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT45's rules: NT45 -> NT60 NT77.\n\nSo, NT45 leads to NT60 and NT77. Then, NT60 is NT30 NT81, and NT77 is 't77' which is 't32' in the string.\n\nWait, no, NT77 is directly t77, but in the string, we have t77 twice. Wait, the string only has 't77' twice? No, the string has t77 at position 5 and 6: t76 t76 t13 t22 t8 t77 t30 t5 t28 t47 t30 t35 t26. Wait, let me count the 't's:\n\nThe string is: t59 t82 t39 t3 t76 t76 t13 t22 t8 t77 t30 t5 t28 t47 t30 t35 t26.\n\nWait, so 't77' appears once, as the 10th element, and not twice. So, the grammar needs to produce t77.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT77 can be derived by which NTs? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see some NTs produce 't77'. For example, NT82 in S is split into NT30 NT81. Wait, perhaps I should list for each 't' what NT can produce it.\n\nLet me create a list:\n\nt5: NT5 produces it.\n\nt77: Looking through the grammar, which NTs produce t77? Looking for any production that ends with t77. Ah, looking at NT72: NT72 -> NT10 NT44. NT10 is directly 't50' and NT44 can produce 't76', etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach 't' in the string must be generated by some NT rule. Let's go through each 't' in the string and see which NT can produce it.\n\n1. t59: Looking at the NT productions, does any NT -> t59? Looking through, I see NT44 -> 't44', but that's t44, not 59. Wait, perhaps NT53 can produce t59? Let me check: looking through the grammar, I see NT53 -> 't30' and NT36 -> 't35'. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, NT25 -> 't33' and NT33 is another NT, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe NT53 can produce t59 through some longer chain.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree for the string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each needs to be generated by an NT. The overall goal is to see if each terminal can be reached through some NT in the grammar, and the structure can be built from S.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a leftmost derivation for each 't' and see if the entire string can be built up.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string step by step. The string is:\n\nt59, t82, t39, t3, t76, t76, t13, t22, t8, t77, t30, t5, t28, t47, t30, t35, t26.\n\nI'll try to see for each 't' which NT can produce it.\n\n1. t59: Looking at the grammar, is there any NT that produces t59? Let's see: NT53 -> 't30' and NT53 is also used in other rules, like NT53 -> ... Wait, I'm not finding any NT that directly produces t59. Maybe through expansion. Let's see NT27: NT27 -> NT60 NT47. NT60 -> NT30 NT81. NT30 -> NT82 (...). Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, NT36 -> 't35'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.

The string is: `t76 t47 t13 t59 t32 t52 t11 t39 t83 t84 t76 t39 t84 t47 t8 t5 t77 t32`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like a CFG where each non-terminal (on the left side of the arrow) can produce two non-terminals, except for the terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers and some are 't' with just a single character. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, in the grammar, the right-hand sides are all two non-terminals until the productions end, which have a mix of non-terminals and terminals, except for a few where the right-hand side is a single terminal. For example, `NT45 -> NT50 NT44` continues to have non-terminals. But then, later, I see `NT44 -> 't76'` and others like `NT75 -> 't32'`. Hmm, wait, no, perhaps some non-terminals have productions where one side is a terminal. So, the grammar includes both non-terminals and terminals as production results.\n\nWait, the grammar is given in CNF. So, each production is either A->BC or A-> terminal, but in CNF, typically, a production can only have two non-terminals. Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, a context-free grammar requires that all productions, except for the start symbol, have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. But in this given grammar, there are productions where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example: `NT45 -> NT60 NT77` is a two non-terminal production, but some have something like `NT44 -> 't76'` which is only a terminal. So perhaps the grammar is not in proper CNF, or maybe the user made a mistake, but perhaps the parser can handle it.\n\nWait, but in this case, the user says the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which typically only allows two non-terminals on the right. So maybe some of these productions are terminals, but perhaps it's allowed to have something like A->a, which is a terminal. So, in that case, the grammar includes both types of productions.\n\nSo, the string given has a series of terminals, some are single-character 't's followed by a number. So, the string is made up of these 't' followed by digits. The question is whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the given productions.\n\nTo approach this, perhaps I can work backwards, starting from the string and trying to find if it can be reduced using the productions. Alternatively, maybe I can parse the string step by step, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a CFG in Chomsky normal form, perhaps I can construct a parse tree to see if the string can be derived.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each part of the string can be broken down into components that correspond to the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t76 t47 t13 t59 t32 t52 t11 t39 t83 t84 t76 t39 t84 t47 t8 t5 t77 t32.\n\nLet me list these terminals: the string starts with t76, t47, t13, t59, t32, t52, t11, t39, t83, t84, t76, t39, t84, t47, t8, t5, t77, t32.\n\nI can group these into pairs of two, as the grammar is in CNF, which would mean that the string is composed of non-overlapping pairs, each deriving from a production. Wait, but some terminals might be single steps if a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, NT44 -> 't76', which is a single terminal production. Similarly, NT52 -> 't71' and others like NT47 -> 't84' or 't44' into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, some non-terminals have productions that are two non-terminals, which would mean that each pair in the string would correspond to a production.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Instead, maybe I should check each occurrence of the terminals and see if they can be part of the grammar's derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if each terminal in the string is present in some production's right-hand side as either left-hand side or a terminal. Or perhaps it's easier to see if any non-terminal in the grammar can generate the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be divided into pairs that match the grammar.\n\nWait, starting from the beginning: the first two symbols are t76 and t47. Let's see if any production in the grammar starts with t76. Looking through the productions, I see NT44 -> 't76', but that's a single terminal, so perhaps it can't be part of a two-terminal pair. Alternatively, maybe the next symbol is part of another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should try building parse trees for the string. Since the string is quite long, this will be tedious, but perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the string has multiple occurrences of certain terminals. For example, t84 and t36 appear multiple times, as does t76, t47, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for what produces t76. The only terminal production for t76 is NT44 -> 't76'. So, if the grammar has a production where a non-terminal produces 't76', then 't76' can be a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nSimilarly, for t47, looking at the productions, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions: NT47 -> 't44', so that's a terminal. NT47 also appears as a right-hand side in other productions, like NT44 -> 't44' and perhaps others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for each terminal in the string and see if any non-terminal directly expands to it, either through a single production or through two steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can make a table of terminals and their possible parent non-terminals.\n\n- t76: produced by NT44 -> 't76'\n- t47: produced by NT47 -> 't44'\n- t13: from which production? Looking at the productions, I don't see any production that directly produces 't13' except perhaps in the right-hand side of another non-terminal, but in the given productions, NT12 -> NT40 NT13, and NT40 may have a production that includes 't13'? Wait, the right-hand sides are all either non-terminals or terminals. So, perhaps 't13' is directly produced by NT13, but looking for NT13 in the productions... Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT13 -> 't26' perhaps? Wait, no, looking at the productions, most produce two non-terminals. Wait, for example, NT13: looking through the list, I don\u2019t see any NT13 in the right-hand side except in NT13 -> 't47'? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the productions are in the form S -> ... and NTx -> ... So, let's list out the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nS -> NT45 NT45? No, looking at the production:\n\nWait, it's more like:\n\nS can be NT45 NT45? No, let me see:\n\nThe first line is S -> NT45 NT45? No, perhaps it's S -> NT45 NT45 as per the given, but in the original, it's \"S -> NT45 NT5\" perhaps? No, perhaps I should process each line step by step.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look at each terminal in the string and see if it can be generated by any non-terminal via a production.\n\nFor example, for 't13', is there any production that ends with 't13'? Looking through, I see NT12 -> NT40 NT13. So, if NT13 can produce 't13', but in the provided grammar, I don't see that.\n\nWait, checking each NT's production: NT13 is not present as a production on the right-hand side except for NT12 -> NT40 NT13. But does any NT13 exist on the left-hand side? No. So, perhaps 't13' can't be generated by the grammar, meaning the string is invalid.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Because if the grammar doesn't have a production that produces 't13' as a terminal, then there's no way for 't13' to appear in the string. Since the only production involving NT12 is NT12 -> NT40 NT13, and NT13 isn't defined as a production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I think the first step is to parse the string and see if there's a way to break it down into the non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string as a sequence of tokens: t22, t3, t83, t33, t8, t8, t28, t52, t83, t8, t84, t32, t49, t30, t83, t52, t25, t13.\n\nHmm, the first token is t22. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT22 has two productions: one is 't22' and another is 't42'. Wait, no, looking more closely:\n\nWait, the rules under NT22 are:\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT22 \u2192 't42'\n\nSo, t22 is directly produced by NT22. So in the string, the first token is t22, so that means the first part must come from NT22. \n\nSo, the string starts with NT22 \u2192 t22. That takes care of the first token. So the remaining string is: t3, t83, t33, t8, t8, t28, t52, t83, t8, t84, t32, t49, t30, t83, t52, t25, t13.\n\nThe next token is t3. So where does t3 come from? Looking at the rules, t3 is part of NT12 \u2192 't3'. So NT12's rule is: NT12 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo, after t22, we have t3, which could come from NT12. So the next step is that after t22, we have NT12 producing t3. So, the string after the first two tokens is: t83, t33, t8, t8, t28, t52, t83, t8, t84, t32, t49, t30, t83, t52, t25, t13.\n\nNow, after NT12, the next non-terminal would have to produce t83. Looking at the rules, t83 is a terminal, and the rule that produces it is NT83 \u2192 't83'. So after NT12, which produces t3, the next token is t83, so that comes from NT83.\n\nSo now, the string is broken down as: t22 (NT22) \u2192 t3 (NT12) \u2192 t83 (NT83). The remaining tokens after this are: t33, t8, t8, t28, t52, t83, t8, t84, t32, t49, t30, t83, t52, t25, t13.\n\nWait, that's 16 tokens remaining. Let me think about the next production. After producing t83, what leads into that? Looking at NT83's rule: NT83 \u2192 't83', which is a terminal. So there's no non-terminal to produce t83; it has to directly correspond to the next token. So, the string after t22, t3, t83 is expecting the next token to be what NT83 can produce, which is t83. So that's correct, so moving on.\n\nNext token is t33. Looking at the rules, t33 comes from NT25 \u2192 't33' (since NT25 \u2192 NT25 can produce 't33'). Wait, the rule is NT25 \u2192 't33'. So t33 is directly from NT25.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT25's rule is: NT25 \u2192 't33'. So yes, t33 is from NT25.\n\nSo after t83, the next token is t33, which comes from NT25.\n\nSo now the string is: t22 (NT22) \u2192 t3 (NT12) \u2192 t83 (NT83) \u2192 t33 (NT25). Remaining tokens: t8, t8, t28, t52, t83, t8, t84, t32, t49, t30, t83, t52, t25, t13.\n\nNext token is t8. Looking for a production that produces 't8'. The rules for 't8' come from NT8 \u2192 't83' and NT84 \u2192 't77' (since NT84 \u2192 't77'), and some other rules? Wait, looking:\n\nWait, the rules for T produce as per the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, let me make a list where the terminal is the left-hand side.\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't53'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83' (from NT84 \u2192 't77' and NT8 \u2192 ? )\n\nWait, no.

The string is `t59 t59 t11 t42 t42 t39 t83 t30 t52 t52 t13 t26 t77 t30 t39 t47 t76 t32 t22`.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should help because I can easily parse the string using a top-down approach or by looking for possible sequences in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t59`. I need to check if there's a production that leads to `t59`. Scanning through the grammar, I see that `NT44 -> 't76'`, `NT36 -> 't42'`, `NT40 -> 't39'`, and others, but I notice that `NT52 -> 't71'` and `NT27 -> 't73'? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT27 -> 't76' actually, looking at the list:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLooking for symbols that produce `t59`. Let me go through the RHS:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> 't42' (okay)\n- NT45 -> 't60' and 't77', but in the main part:\nWait, NT44 appears in:\nNT44 -> NT83 NT7 and NT44 -> 't76'.\n\nSo, looking at `t59`, is there a production that directly produces `t59`? Scanning all, I don't see any NT production where the RHS starts with `t59`. All the terminals are single characters, so I think the only NTs that terminate in terminals are those that directly give a token.\n\nWait, looking again, some terminal symbols are things like `t59`, `t8`, etc. So I need to check which non-terminals result in these.\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT61 -> 't13'\nWait, but where is `t59` produced?\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, perhaps I missed it. Let's check each production:\n\nLooking at NT44:\n- NT44 -> 't76', not 59\nNT52 -> 't71'\nNT5 -> 't25'\nNT77 seems to come from NT72 -> 't10' and 't44'\nWait, maybe I should look for each symbol and see what they produce.\n\nWait, the grammar has several NT rules, and some terminals. Maybe I should create a list of all NTs and their productions.\n\nLet me list all non-terminals and their productions to see where they lead to:\n\n- S -> NT45 NT81\n- S -> NT19 NT67\n\nNT5:\n- NT5 -> NT61 NT75\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT53\n\nNT19:\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT19 -> NT60 NT5\n\nWait, but NT8 is not a non-terminal, right? Wait, looking back, perhaps NT8 is not a non-terminal. Because in some rules, tokens like 't8' are terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the production RHS, whenever a terminal is written in quotes, such as 't25', 't8', etc., those are terminal symbols, meaning they can't be further expanded. So all NTs expand into other NTs or terminals. Therefore, NTs cannot produce terminals directly in CNF, unless they have a production to a single terminal.\n\nSo, for NT5, for example, possible productions are:\n\n- NT5 -> NT61 NT75\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT53\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see NT5 -> NT9 NT53 which is two NTs, and another production NT5 -> NT61 NT75.\n\nBut maybe I missed where NT5 leads to a terminal. Let me search through all the productions:\n\nLooking at NT5 in the rules, does it have any production that ends up producing a terminal? Wait, looking through all the rules provided, NT5's productions are:\n\nLooking again:\n\nYes, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nSome rules have 't' followed by a number, like:\n- NT5 -> 't25' (is this possible?)\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar:\n\nWait, I see a line that says \"NT53 -> 't30'\", so for NT53, it can reach 't30'. Similarly, NT36 -> 't42'. So, looking for NTs that can produce 't59'.\n\nLooking through all, I don't see any NT directly producing 't59'. Wait, let me check again carefully.\n\nLooking at all the rules, perhaps I missed one. Let me go through each line methodically.\n\nThe provided grammar list is long. Let me see:\n\nScanning through each production:\n\nNT5 -> NT61 NT75 (no terminal)\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53 (another NT)\nLooking for any 't...' in NT5's rules? No.\n\nLooking further, how about NT52? It has \"NT52 -> 't71'\". So NT52 can produce 't71'.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 is another rule that produces two NTs, so it won't directly give a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find a sequence that can produce 't59' as part of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps 't59' is part of a larger NT that can be derived from other NTs, but since the string is a series of 't's and numbers, I need to see if the grammar can generate each token step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of parts derived from the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me think about the string:\n\nt59 t59 t11 t42 t42 t39 t83 t30 t52 t52 t13 t26 t77 t30 t39 t47 t76 t32 t22.\n\nLet me break it down into individual tokens: t59, t59, t11, t42, t42, t39, t83, t30, t52, t52, t13, t26, t77, t30, t39, t47, t76, t32, t22.\n\nSo the question is, can each of these tokens appear in a derivation starting from S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is two NTs or a terminal. So each token must be directly produced by a non-terminal, or if it's part of a larger expansion, the production must lead to it.\n\nLooking for 't59' in the grammar:\n\nI need to find an NT production that either directly produces 't59' or is part of a production that can reach 't59' through further expansions.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nDo any NTs produce 't59'? It seems not. Looking through each line, most produce either two NTs or a terminal:\n\nFor example, NT52 -> 't71', so t71 is produced directly. Similarly, NT77 -> 't32', etc.\n\nBut where is 't59' produced?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, perhaps I missed NT59 or something. But looking through the rules:\n\nI don't see any NT with 't59' in its productions. Or maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps when a larger NT is being expanded, it can produce a sequence that includes 't59' as one of the symbols.\n\nSo maybe 't59' is the result of a larger expansion. Let me think about how that could happen.\n\nIf an NT produces another NT, which in turn produces the terminal. So for example, NT59 could be a non-terminal that somehow leads to 't59', but since in the given grammar, I don't see such a rule, I can't produce 't59' directly or via further expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial scan. Let me check more carefully:\n\nLooking for all rules where a non-terminal is followed by a terminal, like 't...':\n\n- NT5 -> 't25' (so NT5 can produce 't25')\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT40 -> 't39'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-349","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can have a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It has a start symbol S, and a bunch of NT followed by numbers, like NT0, NT1, and so on. Some of these non-terminals produce terminals, especially towards the end. For example, NT44 can produce 't25' and 't76', which are terminals. The goal is to see if the string `t82 t76 t82 t30 t13 t32 t25 t33 t32 t25 t22 t47 t22 t82 t42 t14 t76 t35 t33` can be derived from this grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if there's a derivation path that starts with S and ends with this string, expanding all non-terminals along the way.\n\nI think the best approach is to use the top-down parsing method, starting from S and trying to match the string from the beginning. But since the string is quite long, I might need to do this step by step, breaking it down.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, according to the grammar, S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the first part of the string should come from one of these options.\n\nLet me see the string: it starts with 't82', 't76', etc. So the first step is to check if 't82' and 't76' can be produced by NT45 and NT81 or vice versa.\n\nWait, let me think again. When S expands to NT45 NT81, each NT45 and NT81 can produce some non-terminals or terminals. Similarly for NT19 NT67.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first two terminals are 't82' and 't76'. So perhaps the first NT45 produces something that leads to 't82', and NT81 produces something leading to 't76'.\n\nWait, but wait. Each production rule has two non-terminals on the right. So, for example, NT45 -> NT60 NT77, which then each of those can produce either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo I think it's better to model this as a top-down approach, trying to see if each part of the string can be matched by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a bottom-up approach would work, checking if each terminal can be matched to the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are things like 't25', 't35', etc. So let's list the terminals present in the string: t82, t76, t82, t30, t13, t32, t25, t33, t32, t25, t22, t47, t22, t82, t42, t14, t76, t35, t33.\n\nSo the string is: [t82, t76, t82, t30, t13, t32, t25, t33, t32, t25, t22, t47, t22, t82, t42, t14, t76, t33]\n\nI think perhaps a recursive descent parser would work here, but given the time, maybe a better approach is to reverse the process.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write out each non-terminal and see what terminals they can produce.\n\nLooking at NT81: in the grammar, NT81 -> NT30 NT82, and NT30 -> 't82', etc. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLet me list the NT productions with their right-hand sides:\n\n- S: NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67\n\nThen,\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53\n\nNT7 -> 't11'\n\nNT0 -> NT47 NT53\n\nNT12 -> NT40 NT13\n\nNT74 -> NT72 NT5\n\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\n\nNT75 -> NT23 NT45\n\nNT36 -> NT50 NT36\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81\n\nNT71 -> NT9 NT75\n\nNT58 -> NT27 NT47\n\nNT14 -> NT25 NT52\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\n\nNT72 -> NT10 NT44\n\nNT40 -> NT14 NT71\n\nNT19 -> NT60 NT5\n\nNT27 -> NT60 NT47\n\nNT23 -> NT61 NT74\n\nNT9 -> NT36 NT45\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53\n\nNT71 -> NT12 NT84\n\nNT52 -> NT9 NT0\n\nNT61 -> NT53 NT12\n\nNT45 -> NT50 NT44\n\nNT40 -> NT58 NT39\n\nNT44 -> NT83 NT7\n\nNT67 -> NT30 NT2\n\nNT9 -> NT22 NT7\n\nNT10 -> NT50 NT47\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\n\nNT77 -> 't8'\n\nNT84 -> 't77'\n\nNT39 -> 't28'\n\nNT13 -> 't47'\n\nNT7 -> 't11'\n\nNT36 -> 't42'\n\nNT81 -> 't71'\n\nNT44 -> 't76'\n\nNT27 -> 't35'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT53 -> 't30'\n\nNT30 -> 't82'\n\nNT9 -> 't26'\n\nNT40 -> 't39'\n\nNT12 -> 't3'\n\nNT8 -> 't83'\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nNT75 -> 't32'\n\nNT44 -> 't59'\n\nNT52 -> 't71'\n\nNT81 -> 't30'\n\nWait, hold on, that's a lot of NT productions.

So the first step is to see if S can produce something that starts with 't82' and 't76' or similar.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t82, t76, t82, etc.\n\nLooking at S: if S expands to NT45 NT81, then the first part is NT45, which could produce t25, but in the string, the first nt is t82, so that might not match. Alternatively, if S expands to NT19 NT67, then NT19 might produce t84 or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to map the string to the NT productions.\n\nLet me see the string as a list of terminals, and I need to see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, 't82' 't76' 't82' 't30' 't13' 't32' 't25' 't33' 't32' 't25' 't22' 't47' 't22' 't82' 't42' 't14' 't76' 't33'.\n\nThat's 18 terminals.\n\nStarting from S, which can be NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nSuppose we choose S -> NT19 NT67, then the first symbol is NT19.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure.

I need to see if any production leads to t59. Let's check the production rules for NT and terminals.\n\nFrom the productions, I see that NT52 \u2192 t71, NT44 \u2192 t76, NT45 \u2192 t60 NT77, and so on. Hmm, looking for 't59'. Scanning the productions, I find NT44 \u2192 t76, but that doesn't help. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the productions for NT44 include t76, but t59 isn't directly there. Let me check for terminals like t59. Looking through the rules, I see NT27 \u2192 t76, NT53 \u2192 t30, NT44 \u2192 t76, NT75 \u2192 t32, NT36 \u2192 t42, NT22 \u2192 t22, etc. Wait, where is t59?\n\nLooking through all the terminals generated, I don't see an entry with 't59' as a terminal. So, does that mean there's no way to get to t59? Maybe, but let me double-check the productions. Scanning through the NT rules, I don't see any rule that terminates with t59. So if the string requires t59, and the grammar can't produce t59, then the answer would be No. But wait, maybe it's part of a longer non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Perhaps t59 is part of a non-terminal symbol expansion. Looking at the productions, NT44 has a production \u2192 t76, but t59 isn't directly a terminal. So, perhaps t59 is part of a longer production. Let me check the productions for NT52, NT44, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that produces t59. So if there's a t59 in the string, and the grammar can't generate t59 directly, then the string can't be generated. So this would mean the answer is No, unless t59 is somehow generated through a series of non-terminals that eventually derive t59, but looking through all the productions, I don't see such a path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again. Let me go through each production for various NTs:\n\nLooking for any production that ends with t59 as a terminal, but I don't see any NT production that includes t59 on the RHS. So, no NT directly produces t59, and none of the non-terminals seem to have a production that ends with t59.\n\nSo, the string starts with t59, but the grammar doesn't have a production that can derive t59. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it starts from the start symbol S and has productions leading to terminals (t's) and non-terminals (NT's). Each production in CNF has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one on the right, or a terminal on the right. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nSo, the grammar's rules are all in CNF because each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe given string is: `t35 t82 t25 t30 t3 t11 t59 t32 t76 t28 t77 t47 t11 t28 t39 t25 t13 t47 t5 t13`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived by the grammar. That means I should parse the string and see if each terminal can be generated by the grammar, following the production rules.\n\nLet me start by listing the unique elements in the string to see which non-terminals they point to. The string includes t's, so I need to see if each t has a corresponding production.\n\nLooking at each t in the string and mapping them to the grammar:\n\n- t35: From the rules, t35 is in NT27 -> t35. So NT27 is a non-terminal that can produce t35.\n- t82: NT9 -> t82.\n- t25: NT25 -> t25. Wait, but looking at the grammar, NT25 is the rule: NT25 -> t25.\n- t30: NT60 -> t30, and NT30 -> t82. So possible.\n- t3: NT12 -> t3.\n- t11: NT7 -> t11.\n- t59: Looking back at the rules, I don't see NT59 producing t59. Wait, in the grammar, NT53 -> t53? Let me check.\nWait, in the grammar, I see that NT36 -> t42, NT27 -> t35, etc. Hmm, does any NT produce t59? I don't see an NT59 rule. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, in the grammar, NT36 has two rules, one to t42, the other to NT40. Wait, looking back, I see NT44 -> t76, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT generating t59. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's an earlier rule. Let me scan again.\n\nLooking for NT's that produce t59: I don't see any direct NT59 production. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me search again. Oh, in the rules, do I see any NT with t59 in their rules? I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if t59 can be derived somehow. But the string has t59, so the grammar must have a production for NT59 that results in t59. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any such rule. So if t59 is in the string, the grammar must produce it, but since it's not present, that would mean the string is not derivable, so the answer would be No. But let me confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me go through the rules again, maybe I missed something. Looking through each production:\n\nLooking for t59: I don't see any rules where a non-terminal produces t59. So that's a problem. Therefore, if the string contains t59, it can't be generated by this grammar because there's no rule for NT59. Therefore, the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but did I miss any rule? Let me cross-check.\n\nLooking through all the productions, each t is directly produced by a single NT. For example, NT75 -> 't72' and 't5', as per the rules. So each t corresponds to a specific NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find which NT produces t59. Let me go through each rule:\n\nLooking at NT36: two rules, one to t42, the other to NT40.\n\nLooking at NT27: one rule, t35.\n\nNT23: t14.\n\nNT71: t52.\n\nNT58: t27.\n\nNT14: t25.\n\nNT19: two rules, one to t84 and t8, the other to NT84? Wait, in the rules, NT19 has two productions: NT19 -> NT84 NT8 and NT19 -> NT60 NT5.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused because some of the rules produce a terminal, others produce a combination of two non-terminals. So perhaps t59 comes from NT59, but since I don't see any NT59 production, it's impossible.\n\nWait, unless t59 is a typo and supposed to be something else. No, the user provided the string as is. So I think the correct answer is No because t59 cannot be generated by the grammar since there's no rule for NT59. However, I should make sure that t59 is indeed not present elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the t's. Let me list all t's in the string again:\n\nt35, t82, t25, t30, t3, t11, t59, t32, t76, t28, t77, t47, t11, t28, t39, t25, t13, t47, t5, t13.\n\nSo t59 is present. Since there's no rule for NT59, the string cannot be generated. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check if any rule can lead to t59. Looking again:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, the terminals are mapped from certain NT's. I don't see any NT with t59 as a production.

{"custom_id":"request-390","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the grammar provided. It looks like each rule starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left and has two non-terminals on the right, except for some rules where the right side ends up with a terminal symbol. For example, S -> NT45 NT81, but then NT45 has a production that ends in 't44'. So, the grammar consists of multiple production rules, some of which lead to terminal characters.\n\nThe string to be evaluated is: `t76 t52 t42 t83 t71 t82 t52 t25 t13 t47 t11 t39 t84 t14 t11 t59 t71 t49 t42 t84 t82`.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards using the parse table method or recursive descent parsing. Since the grammar is in CNF, recursive descent should be feasible because each production has at most two symbols on the right, which makes top-down parsing manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S, using each production step by step until I reach the terminals, making sure each step consumes a token from the string.\n\nLet me list out the rules again for better clarity. Each NT (non-terminal) has rules that produce other NTs or terminals. For example, S can produce NT45 NT81. Then NT45 can produce NT60 NT77 or 't25', and so on.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, each 't' followed by numbers, I need to find a way to match these terminals with the production rules.\n\nI'll start by trying to match the first token in the string, which is 't76'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT27 produces 't35' and NT77 produces 't72'... Wait, let me check each rule.\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides:\n\n- NT27 -> NT60 NT47 or 't35'\n- NT52 -> NT9 NT0 or ... Hmm, wait, I'm looking for 't76' as the first token.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT75 -> 't72'\n- Wait, maybe I need to find where 't76' comes from. Looking through the rules:\n\nYes, looking here: NT60 -> 't84' and 't76' is in another rule? Wait, no. Wait, no. Let's check each rule carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT60 has two options: it can produce NT30 NT81 or 't84'. Hmm, 't84' is an option for NT60.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, I think I missed some rules.\n\nWait, let me scan the rules:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n- NT54? Wait, maybe I missed the exact rules.\n\nWait, actually, looking through all the given rule definitions, I notice:\n\nLooking back, I see this rule:\n\nNT44 -> 't76'\n\nYes, that's it. So, NT44 can produce 't76'. Other rules for NT44:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT44 -> NT83 NT7 or 't76'\n\nSo, that's correct. So, the first step is to check if the first token 't76' can be produced by NT44.\n\nSo, the parse starts with S. The first production of S is NT45 NT81, and the second is NT19 NT67.\n\nBut 't76' is in NT44's productions, which is not directly under S. Wait, so the first symbol is 't76', which comes from NT44.\n\nSo, perhaps the first step is that S must produce a rule where one of the non-terminals leads to 't76'. Let's see the two options for S:\n\n- S -> NT45 NT81: So the first non-terminal is NT45, which could lead to 't44' (from NT45 -> 't44'), but 't44' isn't 't76', unless there's a path downstream. Alternatively, the second option for S is NT19 NT67, but we're looking for 't76', which comes from NT44.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nWait, in recursive descent, after producing two non-terminals, but perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to parse the string from the top down. Starting with S, which can produce NT45 and NT81.\n\nEach of these non-terminals can produce something else.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor S, the options are:\n\n1. S -> NT45 NT81\n2. S -> NT19 NT67\n\nSo the string starts with 't76'. Let's see if T76 can be part of either of these branches.\n\nLooking at NT19 and NT45:\n\n- NT19 has rules like NT84 NT8, or NT60 NT5, or 't22'. So 't76' is not among NT19's outputs.\n\n- NT45 has rules like NT60 NT77, and also 't47' and 't44', as well as 't60' and 't77', but 't76' is not directly in NT45's rules. Wait, there's a rule NT44 -> 't76', which is a different non-terminal. Hmm, I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the parse tree starting with S, and see if I can match the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to see each step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to represent the grammar as a parse table, but given that it's CNF, we can use the recursive descent approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a tree bottom-up. Let me think step by step.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt76 t52 t42 t83 t71 t82 t52 t25 t13 t47 t11 t39 t84 t14 t11 t59 t71 t49 t42 t84 t82\n\nSo, the string has 21 tokens. The grammar's start symbol is S.\n\nLet's try to see if the entire string can be derived.\n\nStarting with S -> NT19 NT67.\n\nWait, because S has two options, and 't76' is a terminal, perhaps the second option of S is better because NT19 can produce 't22' among other things, but 't76' is not directly accessible there. So maybe I need to consider the first option for S: NT45 NT81.\n\nWait, S -> NT45 NT81.\n\nSo, the first two symbols would be NT45 and NT81. So, the start is NT45 followed by NT81.\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is 't76', which would have to come from NT45 or NT81.\n\nWait, let's check what NT45 can produce:\n\nLooking through all the rules, NT45 has two options:\n\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77 or 't47'\n\nSo, 't47' is an option for NT45. So, if the first token is 't76', perhaps NT45 can produce something else.\n\nWait, wait no. 't76' is the first symbol, but 't76' is produced by NT44, not NT45. So, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe S's first production, NT45 NT81, could eventually derive 't76' through some path.\n\nSo, let's see: NT45 can produce 't47' or NT60 NT77.\n\nNT45 -> 't47' would end the derivation at that point, but in the string, we have more tokens, so S would need to consume multiple tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is not working. Let me try another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for each symbol in the string and see how it can be produced.\n\nLet's list out all the 't...' symbols:\n\nt76, t52, t42, t83, t71, t82, t52, t25, t13, t47, t11, t39, t84, t14, t11, t59, t71, t49, t42, t84, t82.\n\nEach 't' is part of a rule where a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT44 can produce 't76' or '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production rule in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t11 t35 t32 t28 t71 t3 t49 t14 t52 t59 t76 t71 t42 t14 t33 t83 t82 t5 t77 t42`\n\nI notice that each part of the string is separated by spaces, which indicates each 't' followed by a number is a separate token. So the string can be broken down into individual tokens: `t5`, `t11`, `t35`, `t32`, `t28`, `t71`, `t3`, `t49`, `t14`, `t52`, `t59`, `t76`, `t71`, `t42`, `t14`, `t33`, `t83`, `t82`, `t5`, `t77`, `t42`.\n\nNow, I need to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. \n\nStarting with S, the initial production is S \u2192 NT45 NT81, so the derivation starts with NT45 followed by NT81. Both of these are non-terminals, so each must be expanded further until they reach terminals.\n\nLooking at NT45's production: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. Both NT60 and NT77 need to be broken down.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81. NT30 \u2192 NT82, and NT81 is a terminal 't30'. Wait, no, looking back, NT81 \u2192 't30'? Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT81 appears in a couple of places. For example, in NT81 \u2192 't71' (maybe), but looking carefully:\n\nWait, the rules are like NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, which eventually leads to terminals. However, in the given string, I see 't81' as part of the string, but looking at the grammar, NT81 has a production NT81 \u2192 't71' or maybe other? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are multiple rules where NT81 is on the left side and appears on the right side. For example, NT81 \u2192 't71'? Or does it have a production that leads to 't71'?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I notice:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't71' (in NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, which would become NT30 NT81, then NT30 \u2192 NT82, etc. Hmm, I might be getting ahead of myself. Maybe I should approach this differently by building a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see the replacements step by step. Let's try to break down the string into individual steps, matching the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach is to reverse the process. Each non-terminal in the grammar can generate certain terminals. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, and we can try to match this string by seeing if each part matches any of the terminals generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string and their order: t5, t11, t35, t32, t28, t71, t3, t49, t14, t52, t59, t76, t71, t42, t14 (again), t33, t83, t82, t5, t77, t42.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some of these terminals are produced by specific non-terminals. For example, NT71 \u2192 't71', NT42 \u2192 't42', etc.\n\nSo perhaps each timestep in the derivation should match one of these terminals.\n\nBut this could get very complicated. Instead, maybe I can construct a parse tree by matching each terminal from the string step by step, using the productions to expand the non-terminals as needed.\n\nLet me consider the start symbol S, which is NT45 NT81. So, the first two symbols in the string should be derived from NT45 and NT81.\n\nLooking at the string: first two tokens are t5 and t11. So, does NT45 derive to t5 and t11, and NT81 derive to the rest? Wait, no, because NT45 and NT81 are non-terminals, so each must be expanded into two symbols each, which can eventually be terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at each non-terminal and see which terminals they can produce. For example:\n\nLooking at NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53. NT9 can produce 't26', 't22', 't2', etc. Wait, let's look at NT9's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45, NT9 \u2192 NT22 NT7, NT9 \u2192 NT26.\n\nSo NT9 can produce 't26' directly. Similarly, NT45 has several productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, NT45 \u2192 't25', and others. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and also NT45 \u2192 't25'.\n\nSo, NT45 can directly produce 't25'. Similarly, NT77 can produce 't8'.\n\nSo, if NT45 is to produce 't5', it must have a production that leads to terminal 't5', but in the grammar, I don't see NT45 \u2192 't5', so that's a problem because t5 comes first in the string. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar rules don't have a direct production for NT45 to produce 't5', so that suggests that the first symbol 't5' must be a terminal, but if NT45 can't produce 't5', then perhaps NT45 must be expanded into symbols that eventually produce 't5'.\n\nSo perhaps NT45 is part of a longer expansion. For example, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, and then NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, NT30 \u2192 NT82, etc. But I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can't start with t5 because the leftmost non-terminal (NT45) can't directly produce t5, so that might invalidate the string. But I'm not certain; I need to check more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is t5 t11 t35 t32 t28 t71 t3 t49 t14 t52 t59 t76 t71 t42 t14 t33 t83 t82 t5 t77 t42.\n\nSo starting with t5, which is a terminal, it must come from NT45's expansion, but since I don't see NT45 producing 't5' directly, maybe the parse tree starts differently. Alternatively, perhaps the starting S is NT45 NT81, which becomes two non-terminals, each expanded into two symbols, leading to a total of four symbols. Wait, but each production is two non-terminals or a terminal, so the derivation alternates between adding non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to try to see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the start.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n   So, the first symbol is derived from NT45, second from NT81.\n\nThe string starts with t5, so the first symbol t5 must come from NT45's expansion. Looking at NT45's rules, the direct productions are NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 't25'. So, t5 isn't directly produced by NT45. Therefore, the initial step where NT45 is expanded to t5 isn't possible. So perhaps the string cannot be generated because the first symbol can't be derived from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a longer derivation path. Wait, let me check. If NT45 can't produce t5 directly, then perhaps in the first step, NT45 is expanded into NT60 and NT77, each of which then expands further, eventually leading to the t5 terminal.\n\nWait, but for that to happen, the string would have to build up to t5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-405","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF is a specific form where each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by another non-terminal. Also, every non-terminal has the same number of symbols on both sides, which is two for CNF. So each production is like A -> BC or A -> aB, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it mostly follows this structure. For example, S->NT45 NT81 is a production with two non-terminals, and S->NT19 NT67 is another. Some productions have terminals, like NT5->NT61 NT75, or NT5-> 't25'. Wait, actually, in CNF, non-terminals can't be on the right side with terminals unless it's a single terminal. I think this grammar is not strictly in CNF but might have productions like A->aB. Because in the given rules, there are instances like NT5-> 't25' which is a terminal, but other rules have two non-terminals. So maybe each production can have either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nBut regardless, the task is to check if the string \"t13 t32 t28 t8 t82 t13 t42 t39 t8 t39 t76 t30 t5 t47 t25 t25 t77 t11 t39 t76 t8 t42\" can be generated by this grammar.\n\nI remember that for such checks, a common approach is to build a parse tree or use a top-down or bottom-up parsing strategy. Since the string is pretty long, manually building a parse tree might be tedious, especially because the grammar has many non-terminals. Alternatively, I can look for a way to decompose the string into parts that match the production rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The productions for S are NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the string must start with the expansion of either S->NT45 NT81 or S->NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't13'. So I need to see if either of these productions can lead to 't13' as the first token.\n\nLet me check the right-hand side of the first production: NT45 NT81. So each of these NTs will expand into some sequence of symbols. Similarly, the second production has NT19 NT67.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to look for the first symbols in the string and see if they can be derived from any NT symbols in the grammar.\n\nLooking at all the NTs in the grammar, I can list some of them:\n\nNT5, NT19, NT45, NT12, NT74, NT36, NT84, NT2, NT53, etc., and several others. Each of these NTs has their own production rules.\n\nLet me list some terminal symbols in the string: t13, t32, t28, t8, etc. So I need to see if these terminals can be the result of non-terminals expanding into them.\n\nLooking at the productions, some NTs directly produce a terminal. For example, NT5->'t25', NT2->'t5', NT8->'t83', etc.\n\nSo maybe I can build a parse tree for the string starting from S.\n\nLet me consider possible matches for the start symbol. The string starts with t13. So looking at the possible derivations from S:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Then, NT45 and NT81 would each expand into some sequence leading to t13.\n\nBut wait, let me check NT45's productions. Looking at the grammar, NT45 -> NT60 NT77, and NT60 is another non-terminal. So NT45's expansion could go further. Alternatively, is there any production for NT45 that leads directly to a terminal? Checking the list, NT45-> NT60 NT77, NT77->'t8', but other than that, NT60 has multiple productions, like NT60-> NT30 NT84, NT30->'t82', etc.\n\nThis seems a bit complex. Alternatively, maybe I can match the string step by step, looking for possible non-terminals that can produce the next term.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be matched by a series of productions starting from S. But since this might take a while, maybe I'll try to see if each part of the string can be produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a list of t followed by numbers. So it's a sequence of tokens, and the grammar likely uses these NT symbols to generate them.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this by trying to match the entire string as a sequence of symbols in a parsing way, like in a top-down or bottom-up approach.\n\nLet me consider that the grammar is context-free, so I can use a recursive descent parser or similar method.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps I can model this as a series of transitions in a symbol table. Since the string is a list of terminals, I can attempt to find a way to decompose it into the productions of the grammar.\n\nFor example, the string starts with 't13'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT23 -> 't14', but that's not helpful. Wait, actually, looking for t13, I see in the grammar that NT25->'t33', which isn't it. Alternatively, NT22->t22, but that's a terminal, but no.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see NT5->'t25', but that's not relevant here. So perhaps t13 comes from an NT that directly produces it. Looking through all the productions, it seems that most of the nt-> 't' productions are specific to certain NTs, like NT25->t33, etc. So I don't see any NTs that directly produce 't13'.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT25->'t33', but that's not helpful. Wait, is there any NT that directly produces 't13'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT production that ends with 't13'. So perhaps it's a longer derivation. For example, an NT that produces 't13' eventually after expanding other NTs.\n\nBut without knowing the full derivation, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps looking at the production rules, maybe the string can be built via certain paths.\n\nWait, let me check the production options:\n\nLooking at S's rules: S->NT45 NT81 or S->NT19 NT67.\n\nIf S->NT45 NT81, then the first part would be NT45 and the second NT81.\n\nSo let's see what both of these can generate.\n\nNT45's production is NT60 NT77, and NT77 is 't8'. So NT45 -> NT60 NT77 -> NT60 't8'.\n\nThen NT60 has multiple productions: NT60->NT30 NT84, NT30->'t82', NT84->'t77'.\n\nWait, so another path for NT60 is NT30 NT84, and both have direct terminals, so NT60 can produce 't82' 't77', which is 't82t77'.\n\nAlternative, NT60-> NT14 NT71, and NT14->NT25 NT52, which are both further non-terminals. This might take a long time to expand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's see if S can produce 't13' via NT25. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the string's first token 't13', maybe it's better to see if any NT directly ends with 't13', but I can't see any in the given grammar. All the terminals in the grammar seem to have two-letter or so, but perhaps the full expansion leads to 't13'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built in a way that matches multiple productions. For example, let's process the string step by step.\n\nBut this approach might take forever, given the length and number of non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I can note that the string given includes 't13' twice. Maybe one of the productions in the grammar produces 't13' as part of a longer expansion.\n\nWait, looking again at the productions for NT27: ND27 -> NT60 NT47, and NT60 can produce 't82' as per earlier, and NT47->'t84'.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 could also go via NT23 NT64 or other paths, but the main idea is that some NTs expand into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into parts that match the grammar.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check: the first symbol is 't32', but none of the terminal productions start with 't32' in the initial rules. So perhaps the first symbol is the result of a non-terminal that eventually leads to 't32'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check which non-terminals can produce 't32'. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the production rules again, 't32' is produced by NT44 \u2192 't76' and NT77 \u2192 't8', NT40 \u2192 't39', NT27 \u2192 't76', NT53 \u2192 't30', NT36 \u2192 't42', NT22 \u2192 't22' (but 't22' is a terminal), and others. Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing 't32' production.\n\nWait, looking more carefully: the production NT77 \u2192 't8' is present. What about NT44 \u2192 't76' and NT40 \u2192 't39', NT27 \u2192 't76', NT53 \u2192 't30', etc. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Or perhaps 't32' is produced by NT77 \u2192 't8' but that's not 't32'. Wait, maybe the string has 't32' coming from NT77?\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of each terminal and their possible sources:\n\nBased on the grammar production rules:\n\n1. NT45 \u2192 t25\n2. NT77 \u2192 t8\n3. NT30 \u2192 t82\n4. NT9 \u2192 t26\n5. NT53 \u2192 t30\n6. NT27 \u2192 t76\n7. NT2 \u2192 t5\n8. NT47 \u2192 t84\n9. NT75 \u2192 t32\n10. NT44 \u2192 t76\n11.

But it's possible that sometimes it can also be 't3'? Wait, no, looking again, in the grammar, NT81 \u2192 't71', and another rule is S \u2192 NT60 NT81, but I think for NT81 itself, the productions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT81's productions are:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT36\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n\nWait, no, looking back: the lines provided include \"NT81 \u2192 't71'\" but not \"NT81 \u2192 't3'\". So maybe 't3' comes from another rule, perhaps from NT3? Wait, no, NT3 isn't a non-terminal in the grammar. Wait, let me check again. The grammar includes the following:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't42' (among others), and NT60 \u2192 t84.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with 't32', which I thought comes from NT75. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT75: NT75 \u2192 't32' is present, yes.\n\nWait, so 't32' is produced by NT75 \u2192 t32. So the first symbol in the string is 't32', which would come from NT75.\n\nThen, the rest of the string would be 't35 t26 t52 t59 t71 ...'.\n\nBut after producing 't32' from NT75, we'd need to see what happens in NT75's production. But looking at NT75: NT75 \u2192 't32', which is a terminal, so NT75 must be replaced by 't32' in the first step.\n\nWait, so the first step is S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Let's see what those produce.

{"custom_id":"request-432","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I have to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The grammar is presented with a set of production rules. Each rule has a non-terminal on the left and a combination of non-terminals or terminals on the right. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. That makes parsing a bit easier because the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal followed by a terminal or vice versa.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The S rule is S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. So, the start string must derive from either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Each of these is a combination of two non-terminals, so S is the top level, and each of these components must be expanded until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t59 t26 t5 t82 t8 t77 t33 t39 t25 t30 t39 t25 t49 t42 t83 t42 t59 t32 t42 t59 t5 t30 t8. That's 22 tokens, all terminals, which makes sense since the string is in the language if it's derived from the start symbol.\n\nTo check if the string is generated by the grammar, I'll have to see if there's a derivation path from S to this string. Alternatively, I can parse the string using the grammar, applying the inverse operations: see if, starting from the string, we can reduce it to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try the latter approach since it's often easier for me\u2014parsing from the string to the start symbol, trying to match the productions.\n\nSo, let's take the string and look for any production rules where the right-hand side matches a substring. Remember, each production is two symbols, but terminals are single, so looking for combinations that match.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t59. I need to find a production that has t59 as one side. Scanning the grammar rules, under the terminals section, I see NT45 -> 't25', NT77 -> 't8', NT33 -> 't33' (Wait, looking back, I think there might be a mistake here. Let me check the grammar rules again to find all terminal productions.)\n\nWait, let me clarify. The given grammar has several rules that are terminals. For example:\n\nNT45 -> 't25' (is that right? Wait, looking at the grammar, I think I should list all terminal productions to check.)\n\nLet me list all terminal productions:\n\n- NT45 -> 't25' (No, wait: looking at the grammar, under the terminal rules, we have several. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are a bit dense. Let me go through them systematically.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for each production rule, if the right-hand side is terminals, they look like NTsomething -> 'tnumber'.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT45 -> 't25' (Wait, looking at the original grammar, no, under the NT45 production: No, wait, in the first part of the grammar, NT45 is shown as:\n\nWait, in the original grammar, for NT45, the productions are:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT45 -> NT40 NT44\nNT45 -> NT40 NT36\nNT44 -> NT83 NT7\nWait, no, the initial grammar is a list of all production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar provided:\n\nThe grammar is presented as follows:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\nS -> NT19 NT67\nNT5 -> NT61 NT75\nNT0 -> NT47 NT53\nNT12 -> NT40 NT13\nNT74 -> NT72 NT5\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\nNT75 -> NT23 NT45\nNT36 -> NT50 NT36\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81\nNT71 -> NT9 NT75\nNT58 -> NT27 NT47\nNT14 -> NT25 NT52\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT72 -> NT10 NT44\nNT40 -> NT14 NT71\nNT19 -> NT60 NT5\nNT27 -> NT60 NT47\nNT23 -> NT61 NT74\nNT9 -> NT36 NT45\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53\nNT71 -> NT12 NT84\nNT52 -> NT9 NT0\nNT61 -> NT53 NT12\nNT45 -> NT50 NT44\nNT40 -> NT58 NT39\nNT44 -> NT83 NT7\nNT67 -> NT30 NT2\nNT9 -> NT22 NT7\nNT10 -> NT50 NT47\nNT45 -> NT40 NT36\nNT27 -> NT76\nNT22 -> NT22\nWait, now I'm getting confused because some rules are written in a way that's unclear. Hmm, perhaps the original grammar is presented in a different format, maybe using a different notation or with some missing formatting.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best way is to list all the production rules properly, but here's a better approach:\n\nI think the grammar is given in a single list, separated into lines for better readability, perhaps each line represents a production rule.\n\nSo, the grammar is as follows (trying to parse each line correctly):\n\nLine 1: S -> NT45 NT81\nLine 2: S -> NT19 NT67\nLine 3: NT5 -> NT61 NT75\nLine 4: NT0 -> NT47 NT53\nLine 5: NT12 -> NT40 NT13\nLine 6: NT74 -> NT72 NT5\nLine 7: NT36 -> NT84 NT53\nLine 8: NT75 -> NT23 NT45\nLine 9: NT36 -> NT50 NT36\nLine 10: NT60 -> NT30 NT81\nLine 11: NT71 -> NT9 NT75\nLine 12: NT58 -> NT27 NT47\nLine 13: NT14 -> NT25 NT52\nLine 14: NT19 -> NT84 NT8\nLine 15: NT45 -> NT60 NT77\nLine 16: NT72 -> NT10 NT44\nLine 17: NT40 -> NT14 NT71\nLine 18: NT19 -> NT60 NT5\nLine 19: NT27 -> NT60 NT47\nLine 20: NT23 -> NT61 NT74\nLine 21: NT9 -> NT36 NT45\nLine 22: NT5 -> NT9 NT53\nLine 23: NT71 -> NT12 NT84\nLine 24: NT52 -> NT9 NT0\nLine 25: NT61 -> NT53 NT12\nLine 26: NT45 -> NT50 NT44\nLine 27: NT40 -> NT58 NT39\nLine 28: NT44 -> NT83 NT7\nLine 29: NT67 -> NT30 NT2\nLine 30: NT9 -> NT22 NT7\nLine 31: NT10 -> NT50 NT47\nLine 32: NT45 -> NT40 NT36\nLine 33: NT27 -> NT76\nLine 34: NT22 -> NT22\nLine 35: NT25 -> NT33\nLine 36: NT61 -> NT53 NT12\nLine 37: NT45 -> NT50 NT44 (Wait, Line 26 was NT45 again with NT50 and NT44.

{"custom_id":"request-433","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I can use.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure makes it easier for parsing algorithms like CYK, but I might not need that here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t83 t33 t25 t22 t47 t33 t47 t33 t28 t49 t28 t30 t59 t5 t11 t8 t52 t3 t52 t13 t35 t47 t76`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a sequence of terminals. My task is to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production can produce at most two non-terminals. This suggests that each step in a derivation splits a non-terminal into two smaller non-terminals or terminals. But parsing the string requires building a tree where each node (non-terminal) is replaced by two nodes (or terminals if it's a terminal production).\n\nI can approach this problem by trying to build such a tree from the leaves (terminals) up to the root (S). Alternatively, I can check if the string can be parsed using the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and terminals in the grammar to get an overview.\n\nNon-terminals (N):\nS, NT5, NT19, NT67, NT36, NT84, NT75, NT36 (duplicate), NT60, NT71, NT58, NT14, NT19 (duplicate), NT27, NT9, NT5, NT72, NT40, NT19 (duplicate), NT19 \u2192 appears multiple times, perhaps an error. Wait, but perhaps S's productions have duplicates, but let's move on.\n\nTerminals (T):\nt83, t33, t25, t22, t47, t33, t47, t33, t28, t49, t28, t30, t59, t5, t11, t8, t52, t3, t52, t13, t35, t47, t76.\n\nWait, some terminals repeat, like t47 appears several times.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, each production is either a non-terminal splitting into two or a terminal. The terminals are single characters, all lowercase 't' followed by a number.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of 23 terminals. Let me list them:\n\n1. t83\n2. t33\n3. t25\n4. t22\n5. t47\n6. t33\n7. t47\n8. t33\n9. t28\n10. t49\n11. t28\n12. t30\n13. t59\n14. t5\n15. t11\n16. t8\n17. t52\n18. t3\n19. t52\n20. t13\n21. t35\n22. t47\n23. t76.\n\nEach of these is a terminal, so I need to see if the grammar can derive a sequence starting with S and splitting into these terminals.\n\nOne approach is to reverse the process: start from the given string and try to factorize it into the grammar's productions.

{"custom_id":"request-450","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t35 t39 t76 t33 t3 t5 t22 t33 t76 t26 t35 t35 t28 t47 t13 t30 t47 t59 t25 t77 t32 t84 t39 t52`.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals: NT45 and NT81. So S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nEach of these non-terminals then splits into other non-terminals until we reach symbols that correspond to terminals (like 'tX'), which are the atoms in the string.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string from the start and see if it can be derived according to the grammar rules. Since parsing in CNF can be done with a recursive descent or CYK algorithm, I can try to see if the string matches by backtracking.\n\nLet me break down the string into components:\n\nt35, t39, t76, t33, t3, t5, t22, t33, t76, t26, t35, t35, t28, t47, t13, t30, t47, t59, t25, t77, t32, t84, t39, t52.\n\nFirst, notice that the string starts with 't35', which must be derived from a non-terminal that directly produces 't35'. Looking at the grammar, is there a production where NT->t35? Scanning through, I don't see any production for NT35 except when NT35 is on the left-hand side, and in the rules, most are of the form NT... -> ... or NT... -> terminal.\n\nWait, the grammar doesn't have any rules starting with NT35. So to get a 't35', it must come directly from a production that starts with NT35. Since the grammar has only productions where non-terminals go to other non-terminals or terminals, and there's no NT35 in the left-hand sides, except in the case of NT35 only appearing in t35 rules?\n\nWait, looking back: the grammar has:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT23 \u2192 t14\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- NT75 \u2192 t32\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\nWait, NT77 is produced as 't8', but in the string, we have 't77' as part of the string. So perhaps I got confused.\n\nWait, in the string, 't77' is a terminal. So I need to see if any non-terminal can produce 't77'. Looking at the grammar, NT77 is a production that produces 't8', but I don't see a production for NT76, which would produce 't77'. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT77 \u2192 't8', but in the string, we have 't77'. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, in the string, 't77' is a terminal. So I need to find if any of the non-terminals directly produce 't77'. Looking through the right-hand sides, I don't see any NT... \u2192 't77' production. The closest is NT77 \u2192 't8', so that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me list all the terminals in the grammar to see if 't77' is present:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n\nSo terminals are 't25', 't8', 't77', 't28'. So 't77' can only come from NT84, because NT84 \u2192 't77'.\n\nWait, in the string, 't77' is present. So how can 't77' be generated? That would require that a non-terminal called NT84 produces 't77'. So in the left-hand side, there's NT84 \u2192 't77', so yes, 't77' can be generated by NT84.\n\nSo in the string, 't77' is a terminal, so that part would have to come from NT84.\n\nSimilarly, other terms:\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nSo first, S splits into NT45 and NT81. So the first step is to split the string into two parts: what NT45 generates and what NT81 generates.\n\nThe entire string is length 25. If S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then the string should split into two parts where the first part is the string generated by NT45 and the second part by NT81.\n\nSo the first thing I can do is check if the string can be split into two substrings, one starting at position 0 and ending at n, and the other starting at n+1 to end, and each substring can be generated by NT45 and NT81 respectively.\n\nWait, but in the context of CNF, each non-terminal can only produce two symbols (non-terminals or terminals), so for N terminals, the entire string should correspond to the derivation of S \u2192 NT45 NT81, each of which then produces sequences of symbols.\n\nSo I'll approach this by trying to parse the string starting with S, which is NT45 and NT81, and check if their respective productions can generate the corresponding substrings.\n\nLet me attempt to represent the string as a list or positions 0 to 24:\n\n0: t35, 1:t39, 2:t76, 3:t33, 4:t3, 5:t5, 6:t22, 7:t33, 8:t76, 9:t26, 10:t35, 11:t35, 12:t28, 13:t47, 14:t13, 15:t30, 16:t47, 17:t59, 18:t25, 19:t77, 20:t32, 21:t84, 22:t39, 23:t52.\n\nSo the entire string is 25 symbols. Since S \u2192 NT45 NT81, which are two non-terminals, the string must be split into two parts that are the concatenation of the productions of NT45 and NT81.\n\nSo I need to find a split point, say after k symbols, such that the first k symbols are produced by NT45 and the remaining 25 -k symbols by NT81.\n\nI can try all possible split points, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look for the possible terminals and see which non-terminals they correspond to.\n\nLooking at the first term, t35. As I noted earlier, there's no production for NT35, which suggests that perhaps I'm making a mistake. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing NT and t35.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT... \u2192 t.... So for example, NT2 \u2192 t5, NT22 \u2192 t22, etc.\n\nSo for the string's first symbol 't35', I need to see if it can be generated by any production. Since the grammar has:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 ... (but checking the grammar list, I don't see any rule starting with NT35 on the left-hand side except when NT35 is on the RHS, but in the given rules, I don't see NT35 as a LHS except in the productions of other non-terminals? Wait no, in the given rules, the LHS are all the NT variables, and none of them are NT35. So except for NT13 \u2192 t47, etc., but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again: looking through, the non-terminals are things like NT5, NT12, etc., but I don't see NT35 in the left-hand sides of any productions except possibly in a split like NT36 \u2192 t42, NT36 \u2192 t50, but not NT35.\n\nWait, so perhaps 't35' is not directly produced by any NT. That can't be right. That would mean the string cannot be generated by this grammar, which is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to look for a production where a nt"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-447","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the string to evaluate is: `t25 t71 t49 t71 t59 t82 t83 t30 t25 t32 t84 t39 t33 t83 t35 t33 t71 t52 t77 t39 t11 t83 t71 t11`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it consists of production rules starting from S and NT followed by numbers. The right-hand sides of these rules can either be terminals (like 't25', 't71') or other non-terminals (like S, NTx, etc.). The goal is to see if the string can be derived from S through a series of these productions.\n\nI'll start by noting that all terminal symbols in the grammar are 't' followed by numbers. So the string is composed of these terminals, which is good because that's what the grammar expects.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which according to the grammar, can produce NT45 NT81. So any string generated by this grammar should start with two non-terminals, which then expand into sequences of terminals and non-terminals until we reach the terminal string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t25. That must come from a production rule that starts with one of the non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, I see that several NT rules expand into terminals. For example, NT25 -> t33, so if NT25 is part of the string, it contributes t33. So perhaps the string is formed by expanding S into NT45 NT81, and each of those expand into sequences that eventually produce t's and other NT's, until we get to the string.\n\nWait, no, the string starts with t25, which would have to come directly from a production rule that starts with NT25, like NT25 -> t33. But the string starts with t25, not t33, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Or perhaps the non-terminals are expanded step by step.\n\nLet me think about this. The string given is a sequence of terminals. So I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. The grammar's NT rules all eventually terminate into terminals or other NT rules. So to check if the string is in the language, perhaps I can work backwards, trying to match the string to the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nAlternatively, I can work bottom-up, starting from S and expanding it step by step, but that might take longer. Maybe working backwards is better here.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt25 t71 t49 t71 t59 t82 t83 t30 t25 t32 t84 t39 t33 t83 t35 t33 t71 t52 t77 t39 t11 t83 t71 t11.\n\nLet me try to parse this string using the grammar.\n\nFirst, the string must be expanded starting from S. So the first step is that S expands into NT45 NT81. So the string starts with NT45 expanding into some sequence, followed by NT81 expanding into another sequence.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the only way to produce NT45 is via some rule. Let me check which non-terminals produce t45 or related.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT45 -> NT60 NT77, and NT77 -> 't8'. Wait, but here's the line: NT77 -> 't8'? Or wait, perhaps it's NT77 -> 't8'? Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT77 -> 't8' (Yes, that's correct). So NT77 produces t8, which is 't8'. Similarly, NT45's production is NT60 NT77, which further expands to NT60 and NT77.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77. So NT60 can produce, for example, NT30 NT84, and NT30 is 't82', NT84 is 't39'. Or let me see:\n\nWait, no. Let me look for each rule step by step.\n\nStarting with S: it can only produce NT45 NT81. So the entire string must be a combination of the expansions of NT45 and NT81.\n\nSo the string starts with t25, which may come from either NT25 or a further expansion. But NT25's production is NT50 NT32, and NT50 -> 't49', NT50 -> 't49' (from NT50's rule: NT50 -> 't49').\n\nWait, so NT50 -> 't49', so if we have NT50 in the string, it produces 't49'. That matches the third element in the string, which is t49. So perhaps t49 comes from NT50, which is part of NT25's expansion.\n\nBut how does this fit into the overall string structure?\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the string and seeing if each part can be matched by the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me try to split the string into possible NT sequences, looking for matches.\n\nAlternatively, I can parse the string step by step, ensuring each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is small, perhaps manual parsing is feasible.\n\nLet me list the string again, with each token separated:\n\n1. t25\n2. t71\n3. t49\n4. t71\n5. t59\n6. t82\n7. t83\n8. t30\n9. t25\n10. t32\n11. t84\n12. t39\n13. t33\n14. t83\n15. t35\n16. t33\n17. t71\n18. t52\n19. t77\n20. t39\n21. t11\n22. t83\n23. t71\n24. t11\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. Let me start by considering possible derivations.\n\nOption 1: Let's assume the entire string is the expansion of S via S -> NT45 NT81. So we split the string into parts that correspond to the expansions of NT45 and NT81.\n\nLooking at the string, the total tokens are 24. Let's see where the split point could be.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for terminals that match NT rules. Let's see where in the string NT rules start.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t25. Let me check what NT25 produces.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT25 -> t33. So NT25 would produce t33 as a terminal. But the string starts with t25, so that's a problem because NT25 would produce t33, not t25.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe there's a NT rule that produces t25, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that produces t25. Let me check the production rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT14 -> t33, NT25 -> t33. Hmm, but none of the NT rules start with t25. So how can the string start with t25? That suggests that perhaps I'm miscalculating or misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all NTs that produce 't25' or see if perhaps I'm misinterpreting the productions.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking at the NT productions, the only NT that seems to produce a 't' is those entries where they expand into a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT25 -> t33 (from NT25 production), which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, t25 is present. Hmm, unless I'm misreading the grammar. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the last set of grammar rules:\n\n...\nNT27 -> 't35', nt25 -> t33? Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT25 -> t33.\n\nSo only NT25 produces a terminal starting with t, and it's t33. So no NT rule produces t25 as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the string to have a t25 because the grammar never produces that. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar, so the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there a way that 't25' can be generated? Because in the grammar, every non-terminal either expands into more non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals are 't' followed by a number. So if the grammar never has a production where any non-terminal directly produces t25, then t25 cannot appear in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It consists of a start symbol S and various non-terminals (NT) that can be rewritten into other non-terminals or terminals ('t' followed by a number). Each production is in the form NT -> NT1 NT2, except for S, which is rewritten into two NTs that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nThe string provided is essentially a sequence of terminals and non-terminals that were generated from the grammar. So, I need to check if starting from S, we can derive this string through a series of productions, replacing non-terminals with other non-terminals until all are replaced by terminals, forming the string.\n\nLooking at the string, each element is either a terminal like 't8' or a non-terminal like NTn.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't8' and ends with 't33'. The grammar has terminals like 't2', 't5', 't7', etc., but the string uses 't77', 't84', 't32', etc. Notably, the terminals in the grammar are mapped to specific non-terminals, and these in turn map to other non-terminals until reaching the actual terminals.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to parse the string backwards, starting from the last symbol and working my way up to see if they can be produced by the grammar. Parsing in reverse might be easier because each step depends on the leftmost symbol, but since we're going backwards, perhaps we can find a path.\n\nAlternatively, I can construct a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar and the string length (36 symbols), it's better to look for patterns or specific productions that must be followed.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each symbol in the string must correspond to a derivation path where non-terminals can split into the required terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- Each non-terminal (NT1, NT2, etc.) seems to be directly associated with a terminal. For example, NT5 becomes 't26', NT7 becomes 't11', etc.\n\nBut some non-terminals are linked to other non-terminals. For example, NT81 can be rewritten as 't30' or 't71' via different productions. Wait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT81 has two productions:\nNT81 -> NT45 NT77\nNT81 -> NT30 NT2\n\nBut in the string, we have 't30' and 't2', which would require that NT81 is split into these. Since NT81 has two forms, it can become 't30 t2' or 't45 t77'. But 't45 t77' would require us to have NT45 and NT77, which further break down.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first two symbols are 't8' 't83'. Looking at the grammar, is there any non-terminal that produces 't8'? Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT that can produce 't8':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production where X -> 't8'. However, some non-terminals like NT2 produce 't5', NT5 produces 't26', NT7 produces 't11', etc. 't8' is not directly produced by any NT. Wait, but in the grammar, is there any NT that can produce 't8'? Let me check all NT productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT61 -> 't13'\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't59'\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT22 -> 't42'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT various others all seem to produce 't' followed by a number, but not all are present.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each NT for their terminal rules.\n\nWait, in the listed productions, I only see some NTs producing terminals:\n\n- NT5 -> 't9' (wait, no, in the grammar, let me check: NT5 -> NT9 NT53. Oh, no, 't's are direct productions for some NTs:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT77 -> 't77' (But 't77' is a terminal, perhaps 't77' is a terminal? Wait, perhaps the terminal is 't', followed by a number, so 't77' is a distinct terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the list, I can see that many non-terminals produce 't' followed by a number, like NT72 -> 't10', NT40 -> 't14', etc.\n\nWait, here's the key: each production where a non-terminal directly turns into 't' followed by a number is an terminal. So for example, 'NT45 -> 't44'', I need to check if any NT directly produces a 't' terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT61 -> 't13'\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't59'\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT22 -> 't42'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT various others don't directly produce 't' terminals. Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, for example, NT9 -> 't26', but some might produce 't's.\n\nLet me list all NT productions that produce terminals:\n\nLooking at each production line:\n\n1.

Wait, no, in the grammar, NT81's productions are:\n\nNT81 -> NT45 NT77\n\nNT81 -> NT30 NT2\n\nBut in the grammar, 'NT72' is a non-terminal leading to 't1', etc. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in how the grammar is presented.

{"custom_id":"request-469","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way of structuring CFGs where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. From what I remember, CNF is useful because it simplifies certain parsing algorithms and makes it easier to analyze the structure of the grammar.\n\nThe grammar provided is a bit extensive, with multiple non-terminals generating other non-terminals or terminals. My task is to check if the string `t83 t49 t49 t84 t52 t84 t77 t71 t77 t47 t84 t59 t77 t32 t59 t30 t39 t8 t33 t11 t42 t71 t8 t32 t8` can be derived from this grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string we're testing. The string is a sequence of several 't' tokens with numbers following them. The grammar consists of a start symbol S, which branches into combinations of NTx, where x is the number following NT. Each NT can expand into two other NTs or a terminal.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should start by seeing if each 't' in the string can be produced by a production rule in the grammar. But wait, 't' looks like a terminal, so each 't' with a number must have a production rule that directly produces it. Looking at the grammar, I notice some NTs produce terminals like 't25', 't8', etc.\n\nLet me list out the production rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT71 \u2192 't52'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71' (Wait, this seems like it might be a loop. But NT52 is rewritten to 't71', so that's acceptable since NT52 can be used to derive t71, which in turn can derive t52. Hmm, but that might not be possible if the length increases forever, but perhaps there's a way around it for the specific string.)\n\nLet me go through the string token by token and see if each can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t83 t49 t49 t84 t52 t84 t77 t71 t77 t47 t84 t59 t77 t32 t59 t30 t39 t8 t33 t11 t42 t71 t8 t32 t8.\n\nBreaking this down, each 't' has a number. I need to check if each of these 't' tokens is a direct production. From the grammar, for each 't':\n\n- t25: From NT53 \u2192 't25' \u2705\n- t8: From NT77 \u2192 't8' \u2705\n- t77: From NT84 \u2192 't77' \u2705\n- t52: From NT71 \u2192 't52' \u2705\n- t39: From NT44 \u2192 't39' \u2705\n- t22: From NT22 \u2192 't22' \u2705\n- t42: From NT22 \u2192 't42'? Wait, is there a production for NT42? Looking back, the grammar doesn't have NT42. Hmm, but NT23 \u2192 NT14 NT74, and I don't see NT42 as a terminal. Maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, some production rules have 't's as results, but I should look for each 't' in the string and see if it's produced by a rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. For example, in NT27 \u2192 't35' and 't60 NT47', so from NT27, you can get 't35' or other non-terminals. Wait, but the string has t22, which is an immediate terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see NT22 is defined as NT22 \u2192 't22'.\n\nSo let's go through each 't' in the string and see if it's directly produced by a rule:\n\n- t83: Is there a production for NT83? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT83. The closest is NT84 \u2192 't77', which doesn't help. Wait, maybe it's another NT that produces 't83'. Checking the rules: Oh, NT27 \u2192 't35' or NT60 NT47. Hmm, no, t83 is from somewhere else. Wait, maybe I'm missing some rule. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see NT83 is mentioned here: ' NT83 -> 't30' ' \u2705 Wait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar list, under NT83, is there a production rule? Looking down, I see:\n\n\" NT83 -> 't30' ' \" So yes, NT83 \u2192 't30'. No, wait, I thought in the grammar given, under NT83, but I don't see NT83's rule. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check carefully.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, here's a line: \" NT83 -> 't30' ' \" So NT83 produces t30 directly.\n\nWait, but the string has t83 as the first token. So t83 is the first token. But according to the grammar, is there a production rule that produces t83? Let me check the production rules for all NTS:\n\nLooking through, I see NT83 has a rule? Let me parse each rule:\n\n- NT83's production: \" NT83 -> 't30' ' \" So it's a terminal 't30'. So no production rule in the grammar directly produces 't83'; the 't30' comes from NT83, but that doesn't help with a t83.\n\nSo 't83' is not a terminal, but in the string, it's part of the input. Therefore, t83 must be generated by some NT. So does any NT produce t83 directly? Looking through all the rules:\n\nI see that NT27 \u2192 't35' or NT60 NT47.\n\nWait, in the rules given, I don't see any NT that directly produces t83. So perhaps t83 can only be generated if it's part of a longer chain. But from the string, the first token is t83, so it needs to be a terminal, which it isn't. Unless I'm misunderstanding, perhaps t83 is part of a two-step production.\n\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Each 't' in the input string must be directly produced by some NT's production rule, or it's part of a chain that ultimately produces that. For example, NT77 \u2192 t8, which is a direct production.\n\nBut t83 isn't a terminal in the grammar because the only 't's are either as terminals or come from certain productions, like NT83 produces t30, NT27 produces t35, etc. So t83 isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal and must be derived via a production.\n\nTherefore, the first token t83 must be derived from some NT rule. Looking through the grammar's production rules:\n\nDoes any NT produce t83 directly? Looking through all the rules:\n\nOnly NT83 \u2192 t30, so that doesn't help. Other rules, like NT52 \u2192 t71, but that doesn't produce t83.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a longer chain. But in Chomsky Normal Form, each step replaces a non-terminal (or a terminal?) Wait, Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Since this is already in CNF, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, and the string is derived via a series of such steps.\n\nThe input string is a sequence of t's, so each of these t's must be either a terminal or produced by an NT. However, in our grammar, there is no NT that directly produces t83, as far as I can see. The only place that t83 appears is in NT60's production: NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81. Wait, but t83 isn't a 't' in that rule. Looking at other lines, I don't see any NT producing t83. The rules are:\n\n\" NT83 -> 't30' ' \" So NT83 produces t30, but that's it. Therefore, t83 is not a terminal, and it's unclear how it can be generated by any production rule in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the entire set of production rules more carefully. Here's what I have:\n\nLooking through all the NTs and their productions, t83 isn't a terminal anywhere.

The string is: `t49 t14 t32 t76 t49 t35 t71 t52 t25 t30 t32 t8 t5 t5 t25 t3 t22 t84 t25 t14 t8 t52 t5 t52 t39 t84`.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have production rules where each rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This typically makes parsing easier, but for checking if a string is generated, I think I can use the pumping lemma or try to parse the string using the grammar rules.\n\nBut maybe a simpler approach is to look for a path in the grammar's parse tree that generates the entire string. Alternatively, I can see if each terminal in the string can be derived step by step according to the rules, ensuring that each step follows the productions.\n\nLooking at the given string, it's a sequence of terminals. So each token in the string (like t49, t14, etc.) must be derived from the start symbol S, following the CFG rules until the entire string is expanded.\n\nLet me first write down the grammar rules so I can refer to them easily:\n\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81 (Rule 1)\n- S \u2192 NT19 NT67 (Rule 2)\n- NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75 (Rule 3)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT47 NT53 (Rule 4)\n- NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13 (Rule 5)\n- NT74 \u2192 NT72 NT5 (Rule 6)\n- NT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53 (Rule 7)\n- NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45 (Rule 8)\n- NT36 \u2192 NT50 NT36 (Rule 9)\n- NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81 (Rule 10)\n- NT71 \u2192 NT9 NT75 (Rule 11)\n- NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT47 (Rule 12)\n- NT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52 (Rule 13)\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 (Rule 14)\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 (Rule 15)\n- NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44 (Rule 16)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT14 NT71 (Rule 17)\n- NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5 (Rule 18)\n- NT27 \u2192 NT60 NT47 (Rule 19)\n- NT23 \u2192 NT61 NT74 (Rule 20)\n- NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45 (Rule 21)\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53 (Rule 22)\n- NT71 \u2192 NT12 NT84 (Rule 23)\n- NT52 \u2192 NT9 NT0 (Rule 24)\n- NT61 \u2192 NT53 NT12 (Rule 25)\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44 (Rule 26)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT58 NT39 (Rule 27)\n- NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7 (Rule 28)\n- NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2 (Rule 29)\n- NT9 \u2192 NT22 NT7 (Rule 30)\n- NT53 \u2192 NT30 NT30 NT2? Wait, Rule 52 is NT52 \u2192 NT9 NT0. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount all the rules.\n\nWait, actually, the initial user message included many rules, up to Rule 19 (I think some are missing after 19, but maybe I can spot which terminals correspond to non-terminals).\n\nLooking at the terminals, the string has t49, t14, etc., so I need to find rules that produce these terminals. Perhaps some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the list, for example:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 t42 (Rule 44? Wait, maybe I missed the 't' rules in the earlier count. Let me check again. Oh, the last rules are:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't25' (Is this part of the earlier rules? Wait, maybe the user listed the rules with ' \u2192 'a'' for terminals.

Wait, no, actually looking back, one of the rules is:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't42' (Rule maybe 36?), but perhaps I need to look into the later parts.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of rules with many '\u2192 't'' productions. Let me try to identify which non-terminals map directly to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see several instances where non-terminals produce 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT44 \u2192 't59'\n- NT9 \u2192 't22'\n- NT5 \u2192 't9'\n- NT83 \u2192 't30'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT23 \u2192 't14'\n- NT71 \u2192 't52'\n- NT50 \u2192 't49'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT83 \u2192 't30'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't42'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a list of all the rules that produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-491","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is `t30 t5 t22 t42 t83 t76 t33 t84 t47 t25 t52 t71 t84 t3 t52 t14 t59 t8 t77 t35 t32 t59 t25 t28 t49 t83`. \n\nFirst off, context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form have production rules where every left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. My grammar here has a bunch of rules, all of which fit that structure. \n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t<something>t tokens. From the rules provided, it seems like each tX part is a terminal symbol derived from a non-terminal through these production rules. My goal is to see if the entire string can be generated by following the grammar's rules step by step.\n\nLet me break down the process. Each token in the string is a target for a production rule. For example, if the string starts with `t30`, I need to find the production rule for whatever non-terminal leads to `t30`. Looking through the rules, I see that `NT30 -> NT30 production? Wait, no, let me check. \n\nWait, the rules include individual terminals. For instance, `NT60 -> NT30 NT81` and also `NT60 -> 't84'`. Hmm, no, no, looking closer, I think I misread. Wait, NT84 produces 't8' as I see: `NT84 -> 't77'` and others. Wait, no, let me list the terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals are things like 't25', 't8', etc. So each terminal is a single symbol. So the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. My job is to see if the entire sequence can be generated by the grammar by expanding non-terminals into these terminals and non-terminals.\n\nStarting from S, which is the start symbol. The given grammar's S can produce two different expansions: either `NT45 NT81` or `NT19 NT67`. Each of these NTs then further expand, and so on until we reach terminals.\n\nI want to see if this string can be built starting from S, expanding non-terminals as needed. Given the length of the string is quite long (30 tokens), I might need a systematic way to approach this, like using a parse tree or checking if each step can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a leftmost derivation. Let's try starting from S.\n\nS can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's first see if S can go to NT45 NT81.\n\nSo the first symbol would be t30. Looking for NT30 production. Wait, in the rules, I don't immediately see a production for NT30 apart from maybe not. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given rules, NT30 is on the left of one production? No, I don't see NT30 as a left-hand side except in one rule as NT84 -> 't30'. Wait, no, the left-hand side is an NT, and each rule either goes to another NT or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, NT30 might be a terminal if any rule has NT30-> terminal, but in the given list, I don't see any rule with NT30 as LHS except possibly one: looking through the rules, I see NT52 -> 't71', NT77 -> 't8', but for NT30, the only rule where NT30 is on RHS is in the production NT50 -> NT53 NT36, and so on. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up.\n\nWait, I think I've made a mistake. Let me take a step back. The RHS of the production rules are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT9 can produce NT36 NT45 or terminals 't26', 't22', etc. So each production ends in either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I can look for the terminals in the string and see if they match any production rules.\n\nSo, the first token is `t30`. Let's see which non-terminals produce `t30`. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n- NT75 -> NT72 NT5\n- NT72 -> NT10 NT44\n- NT60 -> 't84'\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT81 -> 't30'\n\nWait, I think the production rules have some terminals:\n\nLet me scan all the rules to find where a RHS is a single terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT60 -> 't84'\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT30 -> 't30'?

{"custom_id":"request-506","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of symbols: t28 t32 t32 t13 t42 t32 t59 t8 t33 t49 t47 t83 t49 t13 t28 t42 t33 t26 t5 t22 t76 t84 t35 t13 t33 t22 t13.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. A grammar is in CNF if each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all rules either produce two non-terminals or terminal symbols directly. For example, S starts with NT5 and NT45, both non-terminals.\n\nThe string consists entirely of terminals ('t' followed by numbers), so the question is whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. Since S expands into NT5 and NT45, the initial production is of the form NT5->... and NT45->.... So, for each symbol in the string, I need to trace back to see if it can be generated by these non-terminals.\n\nI'll start by examining each production rule and seeing how the terminals in the string can be derived. Let's break down the string token by token and see if each corresponds to a production from NT5, NT45, or other non-terminals mentioned.\n\nThe string is: t28, t32, t32, t13, t42, t32, t59, t8, t33, t49, t47, t83, t49, t13, t28, t42, t33, t26, t5, t22, t76, t84, t35, t13, t33, t22, t13.\n\nI notice that each 't' number corresponds to a production rule. For example, t84 appears in the production of NT5 to 't25'. So, each symbol in the string must be matched to the right production.\n\nI'll start from the beginning:\n\n1. t28: Looking at the productions, NT58 -> 't27' and NT58 -> 't84'? Wait, I need to check the full list. Looking at NT58, it's production is NT27 -> 't76' and NT27 -> 't35'. Wait, no, NT58 is part of NT27? Let me see: the productions include NT58 -> NT27 NT47 and NT58 -> NT27 NT39. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look up each symbol.\n\nWait, it's better to map each terminal to its corresponding production. Let's go through each symbol and see how they are generated.\n\nt28: Looking at the grammar, I see NT9 -> 't26', and I also see NT5 -> 't26' no, wait. Wait, NT5's production includes 't9' and 't53', but I don't see 't28' in NT5. Wait, I should go through each terminal and see which production it comes from.\n\nLooking at NT9's production, I see that NT9 -> 't26', but I'm looking for t28. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> NT36 NT45\n- NT9 also appears in NT5 -> NT9 NT53 and NT13 -> NT47.\n- Wait, perhaps I missed it.

Let me go through each production and note if any produce a 't' symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps going through each rule and noting if it leads to a terminal:\n\nThe rules where the right-hand side (RHS) contains a terminal 't**' are:\n\n- NT5, because in NT5-> 't26' I think I missed that earlier.

Let me start by looking at the grammar rules. It seems that the grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT2, etc.) that can be broken down into other non-terminals until you eventually get to terminals (like 't25', 't8', etc.). The top-level rule is S, which can expand into combinations like NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67, and so on for various non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals. My task is to determine if this string can be generated by the grammar. So, I'll need to see if each part of the string fits into the rules of the grammar.\n\nLet me list the grammar rules first for clarity:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\nS -> NT19 NT67\n\nNT5 -> NT61 NT75\nNT0 -> NT47 NT53\nNT12 -> NT40 NT13\nNT74 -> NT72 NT5\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\nNT75 -> NT23 NT45\nNT36 -> NT50 NT36 (This one is recursive, which could lead to loops)\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81\nNT71 -> NT9 NT75\nNT58 -> NT27 NT47\nNT14 -> NT25 NT52\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT72 -> NT10 NT44\nNT40 -> NT14 NT71\nNT19 -> NT60 NT5\nNT27 -> NT60 NT47\nNT23 -> NT61 NT74\nNT9 -> NT36 NT45\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53\nNT71 -> NT12 NT84\nNT52 -> NT9 NT0\nNT61 -> NT53 NT12\nNT45 -> NT50 NT44\nNT40 -> NT58 NT39\nNT44 -> NT83 NT7\nNT67 -> NT30 NT2\nNT9 -> NT22 NT7\nNT10 -> NT50 NT47\nNT45 -> 't25'\nNT77 -> 't8'\nNT84 -> 't77'\nNT39 -> 't28'\nNT13 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't11'\nNT36 -> 't42'\nNT81 -> 't71'\nNT44 -> 't76'\nNT27 -> 't35'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT53 -> 't30'\nNT30 -> 't82'\nNT9 -> 't26'\nNT40 -> 't39'\nNT12 -> 't3'\nNT8 -> 't83'\nNT47 -> 't84'\nNT75 -> 't32'\nNT44 -> 't59'\nNT52 -> 't71'\nNT81 -> 't30'\nNT60 -> 't84'\nNT81 -> 't3' (Wait, there are two rules for NT81 -> t30 and NT81 -> t3. Hmm, that seems conflicting. I'll have to keep that in mind.)\n\nNow, the string is a series of tokens. Each token is either a 't' followed by a number or a number. So the string is: t82, t30, t83, t33, t42, t28, t3, t8, t82, t5, t22, t26, t8, t11, t22, t25, t49, t28, t26, t30, t84, t35, t83, t83, t42, t47, t49.\n\nI need to parse this string starting from the top-level rules. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the start symbol S, which can expand into NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLet me start with S -> NT45 NT81:\n\nNT45 can be either (because I see two rules for NT45: one says NT45 -> NT60 NT77 and another says NT45 -> t25). Similarly, NT81 can expand into multiple options.\n\nWait, so for NT45: \nOption 1: NT45 -> NT60 NT77\nOption 2: NT45 -> t25\n\nAnd for NT81:\nOption 1: NT81 -> NT44\nOption 2: NT81 -> t30 (from NT81)\nOption 3: NT81 -> t3 (another rule)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. I think there might be a typo or misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back, I see that NT81 -> 't71' and NT81 -> 't30', but also another rule NT81 -> 't3'. That seems odd. Maybe it's a mistake, but I'll proceed as is.\n\nWait, more carefully looking, in the grammar, it's:\n\nNT81 -> NT44\nNT81 -> 't71'\nNT81 -> 't30'\nNT81 -> 't3'\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nIn the provided grammar:\n\n- NT67 -> NT30 NT2\n- NT81 has multiple rules: for example, S\u2192NT81, but actually looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT44\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- Wait, no, checking all entries:\n\nI see:\n\nNT81 \u2192 't71'?\n\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar:\n\nHere are some of the rules:\n\nNT81 -> 't71' \u2014 because I see \"NT81 -> 't71'\"\n\nWait, looking at the given rules:\n\n\"NT36 -> 't42'\", \"NT45 -> 't25'\", \"NT84 -> 't77'\", etc. So, yes, I see:\n\nNT81 has a rule NT81 -> 't71' (I think that's one of them).

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It's a CFG in CNF, which means each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t42 t49 t8 t82 t25 t30 t3 t33 t35 t25 t32 t82 t5 t30 t49 t84 t76 t32 t83 t39 t26 t28 t77 t25 t8 t33 t39 t8.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t42, which immediately tells me that one of the first productions must be t42. Looking at the productions, t42 is a terminal, so the first rule must be one that produces 't42'. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT27 -> 't42' and NT2 -> 't5', but wait, no, NT27 is a non-terminal, it's 't42' because of NT27 -> 't42' as per the last set of productions.\n\nWait, looking at the last few lines:\n\nNT27 -> 't42'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT47 -> 't84'\nNT52 -> 't71'\nNT81 -> 't30'\nNT60 -> 't84'\nNT81 -> 't3'\n... and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several 't' productions. Specifically, NT27 -> 't42', and in the string, the first token is t42. So that's good, that suggests that NT27 was used as the start symbol. But wait, the starting symbol is S. So how does S derive t42?\n\nLooking at S's productions, S can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Both of these are combinations of two non-terminals. So for S to produce a terminal string, through this grammar, the non-terminals must eventually derive a terminal.\n\nWait, but S is the top symbol. So how can S produce a terminal string directly? It can't, unless all the non-terminals in the productions of S somehow reduce to terminals. But in the given string, the first token is t42, which comes from NT27. So maybe the process is that S somehow leads to NT27, which then becomes t42.\n\nBut looking at the S productions: S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. Neither of these involve NT27. Hmm. So perhaps the entire string isn't directly generated by S but by a non-terminal that's produced by S through a series of steps.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this by trying to reverse-engineer the derivation. Starting from the string and seeing if I can trace back through the grammar to reach S.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt42 t49 t8 t82 t25 t30 t3 t33 t35 t25 t32 t82 t5 t30 t49 t84 t76 t32 t83 t39 t26 t28 t77 t25 t8 t33 t39 t8.\n\nThat's 27 tokens. Let's see: t42 is first, so that comes from NT27. Then t49 could be from NT5 because NT5 -> t49 according to:\n\nLooking at the grammar, yes, NT5 -> 't49'.\n\nNext is t8, which is in NT53: NT53 -> 't53' is not t8, wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through NT53, I see NT53-> 't83'? No, wait, let me check the grammar. Oh, I see:\n\nWait, at the end of the grammar, there's:\n\nNT53 -> 't30'\nNT52 -> 't71'\nNT81 -> 't30'\nNT60 -> 't84'\nNT81 -> 't3'\n... and others.\n\nWait, I might have misread earlier. Let me go through each production for NT53. Scanning the list:\n\nI see NT52 -> 't71' but that's for NT52. Looking for 't49' as a terminal, it's in NT5: NT5->'t49'. So the string starts with NT27->t42, then NT5->t49, then t8.\n\nWait, t8 is in NT47: NT47 -> 't84'? Or maybe another NT. Wait, looking for 't8' in the grammar: I see NT77->'t8', but 't8' isn't explicitly listed. Wait, maybe it's derived by combining.\n\nWait, no, 't8' is in NT9: Wait, looking back, the grammar rules have:\n\nNT9 -> NT36 NT45\nNT45->... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building a parse tree. Alternatively, try to see if the entire string can be broken down into subparts that match the grammar.\n\nLet's list the entire string as a list of tokens for clarity:\n\n1. t42\n2. t49\n3. t8\n4. t82\n5. t25\n6. t30\n7. t3\n8. t33\n9. t35\n10. t25\n11. t32\n12. t82\n13. t5\n14. t30\n15. t49\n16. t84\n17. t76\n18. t32\n19. t83\n20. t39\n21. t26\n22. t28\n23. t77\n24. t25\n25. t8\n26. t33\n27. t39\n28. t8\n\nWait, that's 28 tokens.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, the string is:\n\n1: t42\n2: t49\n3: t8\n4: t82\n5: t25\n6: t30\n7: t3\n8: t33\n9: t35\n10: t25\n11: t32\n12: t82\n13: t5\n14: t30\n15: t49\n16: t84\n17: t76\n18: t32\n19: t83\n20: t39\n21: t26\n22: t28\n23: t77\n24: t25\n25: t8\n26: t33\n27: t39\n28: t8\n\nWait, that's 28 tokens. Hmm. Maybe I should stop and try to see how each of these can be derived.\n\nStarting from the first token, t42: that's NT27->t42. So this suggests that the first part of the string is derived from NT27. So in the parse tree, the root would be S, which must eventually produce NT27, which then produces t42. So S must derive into a chain that ends in NT27.\n\nBut looking at the S productions: S can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the entire string must be derived from either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t42 comes before t49. So after S, the NT45 and NT81 must produce t42 and t49 in some order. Wait, but S's production is S -> NT45 NT81, meaning both NT45 and NT81 are produced. So the string must be a sequence of the forms (NT45)(NT81).\n\nBut in the string, it's t42 followed by t49. So NT45 must derive t42 and NT81 must derive t49?

Since it's in CNF, I can use a top-down parsing approach, but I'm more comfortable with the CYK algorithm for CNF grammars. \n\nThe CYK algorithm works by parsing the string and building a table that keeps track of the possible non-terminals that can derive substrings of the string. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Initialize the table with |string| columns. Each cell in column i corresponds to the substring starting at i of length 1. For terminal symbols, if there's a production for that non-terminal that equals the terminal, we mark the cell with that non-terminal.\n\n2. For each subsequent column j (jumping one cell at a time), look at adjacent cells in column j-1. For each pair of symbols in cells (i, j-1) and (k, j-1) where k = i+1, check if there's a production from some non-terminal A that can produce the symbols at these positions. For each such A, mark the current cell (i, j) with A if it's not already marked.\n\n3. After filling the table, check if the start symbol (S in this case) appears in the last cell (the cell covering the entire string). If yes, the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven the complexity of the grammar, I might need to look for patterns or possible derivations in the string. Let's break down each step.\n\nStarting with the initial string:\n\nThe string is in the order of terminals, like t25, t83, etc. Each terminal appears to be matched by a rule. For example, the first 't25' corresponds to the production NT22 -> t22. So, that production must be used.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> t22. So, the first symbol 't25' shouldn't match NT22. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake. Oh, the string has \"t25\" as the first symbol. Checking the grammar, is there a production for some non-terminal NTx that directly produces t25? Let's look.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT->t25. Scanning the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't25'. Wait, but some productions may produce multiple terminals. For example, a production like NT12 -> NT40 NT13 might eventually produce t42 or another terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbol 't25' is part of a longer production. Wait, no, each production in CNF either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal. So, it seems that 't25' must be a terminal that's produced by some non-terminal directly.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> t22\n- NT25 -> t33\n- NT27 -> t76\n- NT23 -> t14\n- NT33 -> t52 (from production NT22 -> t22, but I don't see NT23 being used to produce 't14')\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The string starts with 't25', which as per the grammar, is produced by NT22. But to have 't25' in the string, that would mean the grammar must have a production for NT22 that can produce 't25'. But looking at the grammar, I don't see such a production. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the terminals in the string can be any produced by any production.

But looking at the grammar, many of the productions in the right-hand sides are two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production should be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But in the given grammar, I see some right-hand sides have two terminals, like NT5 -> NT61 NT75, which are both non-terminals? Or wait, actually, in the grammar, sometimes the right-hand sides are two non-terminals, sometimes one terminal and one non-terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81 is a production where both are non-terminals. So wait, that's a valid CNF production because both are non-terminals. So each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a terminal. That's okay as long as all the non-terminals can be reduced further.\n\nNow, the string consists of a series of terminals, each starting with 't' followed by a number. The grammar uses certain terminals, so the string must be entirely made up of such terminals, which it is. \n\nMy goal is to check whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can think of it as a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal and each child is derived by expanding that non-terminal.\n\nOne approach is to work backwards from the string, trying to split it into two parts whenever a non-terminal is present, which corresponds to a production. Alternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminals, we can look for how each part could have been produced from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking for long sequences of terminals because that might correspond to a single non-terminal's expansion. Alternatively, since all productions are binary, every split of the string into two parts should correspond to a production.\n\nBut in the provided grammar, many non-terminals have productions that expand into two non-terminals. So the string could be split in multiple ways. However, since the string is given, it's easier to check if the entire string can be generated by the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't22'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't22'. Looking through the grammar, I find:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' (from the grammar, NT22 -> 't22')\n- NT5 -> NT61 NT75 (from NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75)\n- Wait, no, NT5 produces NT61 and NT75, but since NT61 and NT75 are non-terminals, they would expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the possible productions that can directly produce a terminal. Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the productions, any that end with a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25' (from looking at the list, I see NT25 \u2192 't25')? Wait, in the given grammar, looking at NT25's production, I see \"NT25 -> NT33\". So that's a production of a non-terminal. So perhaps I need to look for all non-terminals that directly produce a terminal (i.e., have a production A \u2192 a).\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar and pick out all productions where the right-hand side is a single terminal:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't25'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25' (Wait, no, according to the given grammar, is there a production like NT25 \u2192 't25'? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT25 -> NT33 (from \"NT25 -> NT33\") \u2014 so that's a production for NT25, but it's non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, let's list all productions that result in a terminal:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT5 \u2192 't25'?

{"custom_id":"request-564","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. I notice that the start symbol is S, and it's broken down into combinations of NT symbols. Looking at the start productions:\n\n- S -> NT45 NT81\n- S -> NT19 NT67\n\nSo, the first step is to expand S either into NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67. Each of these NT symbols is another non-terminal that eventually needs to produce a terminal string.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t14 t39 t42 t32 t13 t32 t22 t14 t42 t83 t42 t8 t22 t22 t49 t83 t32 t83 t83 t76 t33 t49 t83 t26 t3 t30 t77 t26 t3 t28`\n\nThat's a sequence of 32 tokens. Each token is either a number followed by 't' (like t14, t39) or just a single letter 't' (but looking at the options, seems like all have numbers except some like t2). Wait, let me check the grammar again. Oh, actually, in the grammar, some symbols expand to 't' followed by a number, like 't25', 't5', etc. But the string given has all 't's with two numbers after them except for 't84', which has t84. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand to 't' followed by a number, like NT40 -> 't39', which would be t39.\n\nWait, let me first understand how each NT symbol expands. I need to trace back the string to the start symbol S, expanding each non-terminal step by step.\n\nStarting with the string, the first token is t14. Looking at the grammar, NT14 -> NT25 NT52. Let me check that production: NT14: NT25 and NT52.\n\nLooking at NT25, from the grammar: NT25 -> NT33, and NT33. Wait, no. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT14 -> NT25 NT52. So, to get t14, NT14 must produce 't25' and 't52'? Wait no, because each production is a combination, so NT14 would produce two terms. But in the string, t14 comes as a single token. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the string is structured. Wait, the string is a sequence of these 't' tokens, each possibly with numbers? No, looking again, the string is written as `t14 t39 t42 t32 ...`, so each token is a concatenation like 't14', 't39', etc. So each token is a production of a single NT symbol that expands to that terminal.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated by the grammar, each of these tokens must correspond to the expansion of some NT symbol. So for example, 't14' comes from NT14, which expands to some sequence of NT symbols. But the grammar is in CNF, so each step breaks down into two non-terminals. So, to get 't14' as the first token, the derivation must be S -> NT19 NT67 (since 't14' isn't in NT45's expansion). Then, one of NT19 or NT67 must derive into a sequence that starts with t14.\n\nWait, but looking at NT19, according to the grammar: NT19 -> NT84 NT8. So, from NT19, we get two symbols: NT84 and NT8. Then, each of those must expand further.\n\nWait, but NT8 is not a terminal. Looking at NT8's productions, it seems that NT8 -> 't83'. Wait, no, looking back, the productions include NT8 -> 't83' is actually in another part. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, I see:\n\n- NT8 -> 't83' is not directly, but looking at the list, I see NT81 -> 't71', NT84 -> 't77', NT8 -> 't83'? Wait, no, looking through the grammar, I don't see a production like NT8 -> 't83'. Wait, let me go through all the productions line by line to find 't84' etc.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- NT45 -> 't8' (wait, no: looking at the grammar list, I see NT45 -> NT60 NT77. And elsewhere, NT45 -> 't60' doesn't exist. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. The grammar's production list includes, for example, NT45 -> NT60 NT77, and NT45 also -> 't8'? Wait no, in the list, I see NT40 -> 't39', NT45 -> 't60' NT77? Wait, no, let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through each production line and see what each non-terminal can produce. It might help to list all the production possibilities for each NT symbol.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to follow a top-down approach to see if the string can be generated.\n\nThe string starts with t14. So, that would have to come from NT14. Let's see the production for NT14: NT14 -> NT25 NT52.\n\nSo, NT14 would expand to NT25 and NT52. Now, to get 't14', NT14 must eventually produce a terminal, but since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces two non-terminals, until a terminal is reached. But in the string, 't14' is a single token, meaning that in the expansion, NT14 must directly produce t14. Wait, no, because NT14 is in the grammar, it's not a terminal. So perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps each token in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that must be expanded, which then results in that token. For example, the first token is t14, which must come from NT14, which then must be expanded into t14 through a series of productions.\n\nWait, but NT14's production is NT25 and NT52. So, NT14 can't directly produce 't14'; it can only produce two other non-terminals. So, to get t14, the production must derive a terminal, but that requires that NT14 is converted to 't14'. So perhaps in the derivation, NT14 must be rewritten as 't14'. But looking back at the grammar, is there a production for NT14 that results in a terminal? No, all productions for NT14 go to NT25 and NT52. So, perhaps this indicates that the first token cannot be 't14' because the grammar doesn't have a production for NT14 that results in 't14' as a terminal.\n\nWait, wait, let's check the grammar again for NT14. Looking at the list:\n\nNT14 -> NT25 NT52\n\nThat's it. So, NT14 can't directly produce a terminal. Therefore, in the string, the first token 't14' would have to come from a non-terminal that produces t14 as a terminal. So, perhaps someone in the grammar produces 't14' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar list, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT3 -> etc., but nothing starts with t14.\n\nSo, there is no production that has 't14' as a terminal. Therefore, the string cannot start with 't14' because it's impossible to produce that token from the start symbol according to the grammar.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the string must start with a token that comes from a derived symbol. So, since the first token is t14 and there's no production leading to it as a terminal, the string as a whole cannot be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Maybe I misread a production. Let me look through all the productions in the grammar. Scanning through, I see NT45 -> 't25', NT77 -> 't8', etc. But nothing like NT14 -> 't14'.\n\nSo, no, the grammar doesn't have a production that allows NT14 to become t14.

{"custom_id":"request-570","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step, even though I'm a bit new to this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It seems that each production rule starts with a non-terminal symbol (like S, NTx, or NTy) on the left-hand side (LHS) and is replaced by a sequence of other non-terminals and possibly terminal symbols. A string is in the language if it can be derived by expanding the non-terminals into terminals using these rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t71 t71 t13 t13 t25 t52 t11 t71 t35 t8 t28 t32 t77 t71 t47 t25 t77 t3 t13 t82 t3 t13 t14 t59 t32 t11 t22 t59 t42 t26`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a bunch of two-digit numbers, which are presumably terminal symbols in the grammar. My task is to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S can produce two types of expansions: NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the string must start with either NT45 followed by NT81 or NT19 followed by NT67.\n\nWait, but NT is just a prefix for non-terminals. So when we start, each NTx is a production that eventually must be broken down into terminals.\n\nLet me look at the grammar more carefully. There are 74 productions here, which is a lot. But perhaps I can make some observations.\n\nI notice that many of the non-terminals (like NT45, NT5, etc.) eventually produce a single terminal symbol. For example, NT45 -> 't25', which is a terminal.\n\nSo each non-terminal can either produce another non-terminal or a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Actually, CNF requires that each production is of the form A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the string starts with t71 t71... So let's think about how t71 is produced.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which productions produce t71? I see:\n\n- NT77 -> 't71' (but that's not present here)\nWait, the given grammar doesn't list all, but let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\nWait, the last lines have some t's. Let me scan the provided rules:\n\nLooking for 't71...' I see:\n\n- NT77 -> 't71' (Is this present? Wait, no. Let me check the provided rules.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, under NT75, there's NT75 -> 't32', so t32. Under NT14: NT14 -> 't83', etc.\n\nWait, looking back at the provided grammar, here's some key rules:\n\nLooking for any rule that directly produces 't71', I see NT50: NT50 -> 't49'. Hmm, not helpful. And other rules:\n\nLooking for 't71' on the RHS: For instance, NT71 has rules like NT71 -> NT12 NT84, and some to 't's. Wait, looking again, is there any rule that directly produces 't71'?\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is 't71':\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT77 -> 't71', but in the list provided by the user, I don't see that. Wait, let me parse the entire list.\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules, under NT75, it says NT75 -> 't32'\u2014so that's 't32'. Then NT77 is listed here: 't71'\u2014no, wait, no\u2014the user's provided grammar's last lines include:\n\nWait, the user provided this grammar with several rules, and looking at the last lines, near the end, I see:\n\nNT77 -> 't71'\n\nWait, no, let me check again. Wait, here's the end:\n\n...\nNT77 -> 't36' ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me find each rule that ends with a 't' to see what it produces.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n- NT77 -> 't71'\n- NT71 -> other things, but in the provided list, I don't see a rule where RHS is 't71'\n\nWait, maybe I have to check through each rule.\n\nLooking through each of the 74 rules:\n\nFor example, NT77 is present with NT77 -> 't71'\u2014is that correct? Let me see the provided rules:\n\nI see towards the end: `NT77 -> 't71'`.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, yes, the user provided NT77 -> 't71'. So there is a rule that directly produces 't71' via NT77.\n\nSo, if a nt leads to NT77, which can then produce 't71', then in the string, 't71' can be achieved via NT77.\n\nSo now, the string starts with t71 t71. How can this happen?\n\nEither each 't71' comes from NT77, or perhaps another production that eventually leads to 't71'.\n\nSo the approach is to see how the string can be broken down. Let me see.\n\nThe string is: t71 t71 t13 t13 t25 t52 t11 t71 t35 t8 t28 t32 t77 t71 t47 t25 t77 t3 t13 t82 t3 t13 t14 t59 t32 t11 t22 t59 t42 t26.\n\nI need to see if this can be derived starting from S.\n\nGiven that S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nSo the first step is to choose between these two options.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are t71 t71.\n\nIf the first production from S is NT45 NT81, then NT45 and NT81 must produce the rest. So let's see what NT45 and NT81 might produce.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT45 and NT81:\n\nNT45: NT45 -> 't25' (according to the list).\n\nWait, in the provided rules, under NT45: `NT45 -> 't25'`. So NT45 can produce 't25' directly.\n\nBut the first part of our string is 't71 t71', so that would not match 't25', right? That\u2019s a problem. Because if we start with NT45, it can only produce 't25', which doesn't fit 't71'.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the other option for S: NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at NT19: looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8.\n\nWait, under the provided rules:\n\nNT19 has two rules: NT19 -> NT84 NT8 and NT19 -> NT60 NT5.\n\nBut the string starts with t71, so perhaps NT19 must produce a terminal. Let's check if any other rules for NT19 lead to t71.\n\nBut according to the rules, I don't see NT19 directly producing 't71'. The rules for NT19 are:\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8\n\nNT19 -> NT60 NT5.\n\nSo, NT19 leads to non-terminals, which then would have to produce the 't71's.\n\nSo perhaps the S produces NT19 NT67, and both of those non-terminals need to produce the 't71's and other symbols in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT45 can produce something that could lead to 't71', but according to the rules, NT45 -> 't25' directly.\n\nSince 't71' is in the string, and it's the first token, and if the first part is 't71', then perhaps S should use the production NT77, but S can't directly produce NT77. S can only produce NT45 or NT19.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me see the productions for NT45 and NT81 again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the rules for NT45 include:\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\n\nand\n\nNT45 -> 't25'. So every time NT45 is expanded, it can produce 't25' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT81"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-588","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem to solve where I need to check if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar. The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a specific way grammars are structured, where each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should recall the structure of CNF. It states that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it makes certain parsing methods, like the CYK algorithm, possible. But for now, I just need to parse the string according to the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's a list of production rules. I'll need to parse the string token by token, seeing if each part can be matched by the rules. The string given is: `t52 t8 t49 t39 t3 t22 t42 t47 t71 t30 t77 t39 t32 t71 t42 t32 t32 t39 t39 t76 t77 t59 t28 t11 t71 t49 t8 t47 t42 t59 t14`.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I think the string is actually a sequence of tokens, each of which is a terminal. So each of these like 't52', 't8', etc., should be matched by the grammar's productions. \n\nI see that the grammar has several production rules ending with a terminal, like S \u2192 NT45 t45, S \u2192 NT19 t67, etc. Each of these must be followed by a terminal that's part of the string.\n\nSo the approach I should take is to parse the string step by step, trying to find a way to split the string into the right productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the string as a sequence of tokens and see if there's a way to match from the start symbol S to the end of the string.\n\nBut parsing manually could get complicated because the grammar might have many non-terminals, and it's a matter of figuring out the correct sequence of splits.\n\nAnother approach is to think in terms of the parse tree. Each non-terminal in the grammar could correspond to a part of the string, so I can try to see if the string can be built up by the grammar's rules.\n\nBut considering the number of tokens, which is 35, and the complexity of the grammar, I might need a systematic way to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each token in the string can be derived by the grammar's rules in reverse, starting from the terminals and seeing if they can be linked back to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me write down the entire string as a list of tokens for clarity:\n\n1. t52\n2. t8\n3. t49\n4. t39\n5. t3\n6. t22\n7. t42\n8. t47\n9. t71\n10. t30\n11. t77\n12. t39\n13. t32\n14. t71\n15. t42\n16. t32\n17. t32\n18. t39\n19. t39\n20. t76\n21. t77\n22. t59\n23. t28\n24. t11\n25. t71\n26. t49\n27. t8\n28. t47\n29. t42\n30. t59\n31. t14\n\nHmm, that's quite a list.

However, looking further, there are production rules for NT19 and NT5, etc., that result in t61, t5, etc. Wait, looking for t52, I see that NT25 \u2192 t33 and NT36 \u2192 t84, etc. Wait, let me check all production rules for terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, some of the terminal productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 t45\nS \u2192 NT19 t67\nNT5 \u2192 NT61 t75\nWait no, I'm looking through the production rules as given in the problem:\n\nHere are some terminal productions:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 t84?

{"custom_id":"request-592","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by this context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because all production rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: t52 t14 t77 t8 t59 t11 t30 t30 t47 t83 t47 t5 t33 t77 t25 t14 t33 t76 t77 t32 t76 t25 t30 t11 t14 t59 t32 t39 t3 t84 t32.\n\nFirst, I think I should reconstruct the derivation steps that would result in this string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step should produce exactly two non-terminals, and the string is a sequence of terminals. But wait, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but the actual derivation would expand non-terminals into other non-terminals step by step until we get to terminals.\n\nHowever, the string starts with t52, which is a terminal, so that must come from a production rule that directly ends with t52. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT52 -> t71. So that's a possible start.\n\nWait, no. The string starts with t52, so we need to see which non-terminal directly produces t52. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT52 -> t71\n\nBut t71 is another terminal. So if the first symbol is t52, that would require t71, which can't be because t71 isn't a terminal in the string. Hmm, so maybe I misunderstood the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production leads to a sequence that ultimately expands to terminals. So each non-terminal in the string must be a result of expanding a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is to two non-terminals. So the initial productions are to two non-terminals, and each of those can be further split into two non-terminals, etc., until they become terminals.\n\nSo the string is a series of terminals, so each symbol must be produced by some production that ends in a terminal, and the way they are combined must fit the leftmost or rightmost derivations.\n\nBut to reconstruct this, perhaps I should look for possible parent structures. Each non-terminal in the string must be either a symbol that's directly produced by a production rule ending in 'a' (terminal) or comes from a production that produces two non-terminals, which should be the case if the grammar is in CNF.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each production of a non-terminal leads to either another non-terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of terminals, so the entire derivation of the string must be built from a leftmost derivation starting with the start symbol S, expanding step by step, each time replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, perhaps the string can be split into pairs of symbols that correspond to the left and right parts of a production, except for the first and last symbols if they correspond to left or right productions.\n\nWait, actually, in a leftmost derivation, each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal. So the structure of the derivation would produce a sequence of non-terminals, which would then produce terminals.\n\nBut it's quite a chain, and looking at the string, it has 32 symbols. Since each step in a leftmost derivation would reduce the number of non-terminals by one, the initial symbol would be S, and each step would replace a non-terminal with two others. So for a string of length n, the number of non-terminals would be n-1.\n\nHmm, but with a string of length 32, that would imply that S expands directly to something that leads to a derivation of 31 non-terminals, which seems too much. Maybe the grammar is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be parsed by following the productions backwards, starting from the given string and trying to split it into parts that match the productions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should try to parse the string from the end, looking for possible splits using the productions.\n\nLooking at the given string:\n\nt52 t14 t77 t8 t59 t11 t30 t30 t47 t83 t47 t5 t33 t77 t25 t14 t33 t76 t77 t32 t76 t25 t30 t11 t14 t59 t32 t39 t3 t84 t32.\n\nWait, but each production is either A \u2192 a (terminal) or A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals). So for the string to be generated, the sequence must come from expanding A into BC, and then those B and C must themselves be terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps I can parse the string by trying to split it into possible non-terminals and terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would be helpful, but given the length, that's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any of the symbols can be directly derived from an A \u2192 a rule. So looking for any symbol that's a terminal which is a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that many symbols are terminals like t5, t2, etc. So for example, NT52 -> t71 is a production that ends in t71, so if the first symbol is t52, which is a terminal, that can't be because t52 is the non-terminal and it's supposed to produce t71.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the productions, NT52 is a non-terminal that produces t71. So to get t52, we must have a non-terminal that directly produces it. Looking back at the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT52 -> t71, but nowhere does a non-terminal produce t52 directly. Wait, the start symbol S is defined as NT5 producing NT67, which is non-terminal NT5 -> NT61 NT75, etc.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that produces t52 directly. The string starts with t52, which would require a production rule like NT52 -> t52, but I don't see that anywhere.\n\nSo, does that mean the string starts with a terminal t52, which can only come from a production rule where that non-terminal produces t52. But in the given rules, is there such a production?\n\nLooking at all the non-terminals, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal ends with t52. For example, NT52 -> t71, but that's different. So perhaps the string starts with a terminal that cannot be generated by this grammar, so the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar, the production rules end with t's. I see rules like NT52 -> t71, but is there any non-terminal that directly produces t52? Looking through:\n\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT8 -> 't83'\n- So, NT19 could produce t77 t8.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t52, which suggests that the start symbol S must produce something that includes t52 as the first symbol. But in this grammar, S produces two non-terminals, NT5 and NT67, as per the first production: S -> NT5 NT67.\n\nSo the string will start with the derivation of NT5 and NT67. So the first symbol in the string would come from the expansion of NT5, and the second symbol from NT67, or something like that.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is t52, which would mean that either NT5 directly produces t52, which it doesn't, or through a series of expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT5 expands into something that produces t52 at the terminal level.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the possible expansions of NT5 and NT67.\n\nNT5 has the rule NT5 -> NT9 NT53.\n\nThen, NT9 -> NT36 NT45, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 -> NT50 NT44, and so on.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to check if the string can be split into production rules.\n\nLet me try to split the string into possible parts, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t52. If t52 is the first symbol, then it must be produced directly, which doesn't seem to be the case since the grammar doesn't have any rule like A -> t52.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, is there any rule that produces t52? Let me check all the terminal rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT52 -> t71\n\nWhich means NT52 produces t71 when expanded.\n\nSimilarly, NT71 -> t52?\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-606","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where every non-terminal is on the left side, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit CNF because all the productions either produce two non-terminals or a terminal like 't' followed by a number. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81 is a production where S becomes NT45 and NT81, both non-terminals. Similarly, some have terminals, like NT36 \u2192 't42', so that would directly produce a terminal string.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t13 t33 t83 t35 t82 t35 t71 t82 t5 t39 t32 t30 t84 t33 t11 t71 t28 t47 t28 t83 t84 t82 t39 t71 t25 t32 t11 t59 t30 t30 t25 t22`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. Essentially, I should build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can generate this sequence of terminals.\n\nLet's start by identifying the start symbol, which is S. S can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's pick one production and see if we can build the string from there.\n\nLet me try using S \u2192 NT45 NT81. So the root of the parse tree is NT45 \u2192 NT36 and NT36 \u2192 't42'. Wait, but the string starts with t13, which is quite different. Maybe that's not the correct path.\n\nAlternatively, let's try S \u2192 NT19 NT67. NT19's productions: looking at the grammar, I see NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 or NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5 or other possibilities. Hmm, but let's see. NT19 could produce 't26' through NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45 and then NT36 \u2192 't13', but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace back from the string. Each terminal in the string must be the result of a production ending in a single terminal. Let's break down the string into elements: t13, t33, t83, t35, t82, t35, t71, t82, t5, t39, t32, t30, t84, t33, t11, t71, t28, t47, t28, t83, t84, t82, t39, t71, t25, t32, t11, t59, t30, t30, t25, t22.\n\nStarting from S, we have two non-terminals, so the string must start with two terminals or a production that eventually leads to two terminals. Let's see if the string starts with something that could come from S's productions.\n\nWait, S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's see:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 \u2192 then NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81 \u2192 NT30 \u2192 NT82 \u2192 NT82 is a terminal 't82', which matches the first t82. Then NT81 \u2192 NT30 \u2192 which would be another 't82', but the next element is t35. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT19 NT67. NT19 can produce 't26' (from NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45 \u2192 't13'), but the string starts with t13. Let's see: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 \u2192 then NT84 is 't84', but the first element is t13, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's look at the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT36 \u2192 't42' and other options. NT36 also can produce NT45 NT36 and NT50 NT36. Maybe the string involves a recursive production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by multiple productions, and each step must follow the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. Starting with S: S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nSo the first two symbols should come from NT19 and NT67.\n\nLooking at NT19, possible productions: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5, etc. Similarly, NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2, and since 't2' is in the string, that could fit.\n\nWait, the first element is t13. Let me check how NT19 can produce t13. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8: so if NT84 produces a terminal and NT8 production produces another.\n\nLooking for 't13', let me see where 't13' comes from. Looking at the productions, NT36 \u2192 't13' is one option. So maybe NT36 \u2192 't13' is a production, but wait, no, in the grammar, I don't see that. Wait, looking back, I think NT36 \u2192 't42' and 't42' perhaps. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar, under NT36, there is: NT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53, NT36 \u2192 NT50 NT36, and others. Oh, also, looking at NT36's productions, I see NT36 \u2192 't42' and NT36 \u2192 't42' appears a few times, but I don't see 't13' in the NT36 productions. Wait, but perhaps another non-terminal builds up to it.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45, and NT36 \u2192 't13' is not directly stated. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Looking at the grammar, under NT36, I see: NT36 \u2192 't42'. Wait, let me check the exact productions:\n\nLooking at the production list:\n\nI see:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT50 NT36,\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT45 NT36,\n\nand elsewhere:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53,\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT50 NT36,\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT45 NT36,\n\nAlso, there is:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't42'. So yes, NT36 can produce 't42' directly. But earlier when I thought NT36 can produce 't13', that must not be correct. So where does 't13' come from?\n\nWait, looking at NT22 \u2192 't22', which is a terminal, and NT25 \u2192 't25', but perhaps 't13' comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to backtrack. Since the string starts with 't13', perhaps the first symbol is from NT9 \u2192 't13', but looking at the grammar, is there a production where NT9 produces 't13'? Let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45, and NT36 \u2192 't42', so NT9 can't directly produce 't13'. Hmm, no, so maybe 't13' is part of a longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to map the entire string step by step using possible productions.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nNT19 can produce:\n\n- NT84 NT8, which would produce 't84' and then NT8 (assuming NT8 is a terminal, but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT8 as a terminal. Wait, looking back, NT8 appears on the right side of some productions. Wait, in the grammar, NT84 \u2192 't84', but NT8 itself is a non-terminal. Wait, perhaps NT8 has a production that leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-608","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite complex with a lot of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit because all rules are either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81 is two non-terminals, and NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75 is also two non-terminals. There are some rules where a non-terminal is on the right side but eventually leads to a terminal, like NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44 NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44, which might loop back, but in the final string, the terminals are provided directly.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t76 t25 t84 t26 t77 t52 t3 t42 t76 t5 t3 t59 t33 t39 t39 t52 t47 t11 t39 t5 t22 t83 t35 t77 t84 t25 t3 t32 t71 t14 t11 t35.\n\nMy plan is to start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive this string using the given rules. Since it's a CNF grammar, the parse tree will be a binary tree where each node has exactly two children.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts to see if it can be generated by the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a terminal symbol. So, the string starts with 't76', followed by 't25', etc.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the entire string and see if it can be built by the rules. Looking at the grammar, I can try to match the terminals back to their respective production rules.\n\nStarting with the first terminal 't76'. Looking at the NT productions, I see NT76 isn't directly in the rules. Wait, let me check. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n\nSo, t76 can come from either NT44 or NT27.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first part is 't76 t25 t84 t26 t77'. Let me see how these can fit into a production.\n\nLooking at NT44 \u2192 t76, and NT27 \u2192 t76. So, I can consider that the first t76 is from either NT44 or NT27.\n\nLooking at t25 as the next token. In the grammar, NT25 is present with a production:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSo, t25 comes from NT25, which rules to t33.\n\nHmm, so after t76 comes t25. So, the first part could be S \u2192 NT45 NT81, but then NT45 and NT81 might need to be broken down further.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to work backwards, trying to see if the string can be split into parts that match the left-hand sides of the rules.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t76 t25... Let me see if there's a rule where the right-hand side of a production leads to these.\n\nLooking for a production that leads to 't76 t25...'. Perhaps starting from the top-down approach, try to see if the entire string can be generated by S.\n\nSince S produces two non-terminals, S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Let's see which one is more likely.\n\nIf I choose S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then the next step would be to see if NT45 can produce the first part of the string starting with t76.\n\nLooking at NT45's production rules: I see NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44, and also NT45 \u2192 t76. So, t76 can be derived directly from NT45, and then NT44 would need to derive the remaining part of the string.\n\nAfter t76, the next is t25. So, after NT45 produces t76, the next NT81 would need to produce the remaining part.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think in terms of the production steps.\n\nWait, S splits into two non-terminals, say X and Y. Each of these can split again until we reach terminals.\n\nBut this might get too complicated with the current approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the parse tree method. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t76, t25, t84, t26, t77, t52, t3, t42, t76, t5, t3, t59, t33, t39, t39, t52, t47, t11, t39, t5, t22, t83, t35, t77, t84, t25, t3, t32, t71, t14, t11, t35.\n\nIf I consider S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then NT45 produces the first part, and NT81 produces the second part.\n\nSo, NT45 could start with t76. Looking at NT45's rules, it can produce t76 directly, or go through NT50 and NT44.\n\nIf I choose the direct t76, then NT81 would handle the rest of the string.\n\nSo, after t76, the next symbol is t25, which is part of the NT81 production.\n\nLooking at NT81's rules: NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT81 or NT30 \u2192 t82. Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't84'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT81 \u2192 't30'\n- NT81 \u2192 't82'\n\nWait, the rule for NT81 is actually NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT81. Then, there's a rule NT81 \u2192 't71'. So, to get t71, but in our string, after t76 comes t25, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the second option for S: S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nLet's see what NT19 and NT67 produce.\n\nLooking at NT19's production rules: I see multiple rules, including:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n- Also, NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, which could produce t84 and something else.\n\nWait, the string starts with t76, t25, t84, t26... So perhaps NT19 is producing part of this.\n\nWait, but NT19 doesn't directly produce t76. It can produce t84 if it's via NT84. Let me check.\n\nLooking for where t76 comes from. It's produced by NT45 or NT27.\n\nIn the first approach, S \u2192 NT45 NT81, which could produce t76, then the rest comes from NT81.\n\nBut the problem is that after t76, the next symbol is t25, which may not align with NT81's productions.\n\nAlternatively, after t76 from NT45, the next non-terminal would be NT81, which could produce t84, t77, or maybe through some chain.\n\nLooking at NT81's rules: NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT81, which could lead to t82 or t84, but let me check.\n\nWait, the rule for NT81 is NT81 \u2192 't71' or NT81 \u2192 't30' followed by NT81.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe a different approach: look for the production of the string in terms of the rules.\n\nLet me try to break down the string:\n\nt76 t25 t84 t26 t77 t52 t3 t42 t76 t5 t3 t59 t33 t39 t39 t52 t47 t11 t39 t5 t22 t83 t35 t77 t84 t25 t3 t32 t71 t14 t11 t35.\n\nLet me try to group this into parts that match the productions.\n\nLooking for 't76', which can come from NT44 or NT27.\n\nSuppose the first 't76' comes from NT27.\n\nNT27's rule is NT27 \u2192 't76' or '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-624","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check. The string is: `t32 t13 t77 t77 t8 t71 t59 t76 t47 t47 t83 t49 t76 t59 t47 t13 t77 t26 t59 t76 t25 t32 t84 t33 t22 t33 t28 t71 t32 t33 t22 t13 t76`.\n\nI remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has each production with two symbols on the right side, either non-terminals or terminals. The starting symbol is S, and the goal is to see if the string can be derived from S by applying these productions.\n\nFirst, I should note all the productions starting from S. Looking at the given grammar, S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So any valid string starting from S should be a combination of these.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with t32 t13... Let me see the productions that result in terminals. I'll scan through the grammar to find which productions produce terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, I can list all productions that produce terminals (like 't' followed by a number or other combinations). For example, NT5 -> 't25' (I think these are productions where the right side is a terminal symbol or a single non-terminal).\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, some of the productions have two symbols on the right, like NT5 -> 't25', but that's a two-symbol production, but one part is a terminal and the other is a number. Wait, no, I think in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right. So, perhaps those productions where one side is a terminal and the other is a single non-terminal are treated as terminal symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's list all productions where the right side consists of two terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, but that might not fit exactly. Or perhaps each production in CNF is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals (A) or terminals (B and C). But if a production has a terminal, that's a problem because CNF requires A -> BC, both B and C must be non-terminals or terminals? Or wait, I think in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right side, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, right-hand sides can be two non-terminals or one terminal and another non-terminal. So, for example, a production like A -> a B, where a is a terminal and B is a non-terminal, is acceptable in CNF because the right-hand side has two symbols (the terminal 'a' and non-terminal B).\n\nBut I think that in our case, all the productions except S are two symbols. Like S -> NT45 NT81. Then NT5 -> NT61 NT75. Wait, no, NT5 is a non-terminal, and it produces two non-terminals, right?\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I need to list all the productions where a non-terminal produces two others. For example: S -> NT45 NT81 (so two non-terminals). Similarly, NT5 -> NT61 NT75, which is two non-terminals. But then, some other productions have terminals as part of their right-hand side, like NT5 -> 't25', but this seems to contradict CNF because that's only one symbol. Unless, perhaps, that's a typo or perhaps that production isn't in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me read the grammar again. The initial part says it's in Chomsky normal form, so all productions should have exactly two symbols on the right except the starting symbol? Wait, no, in CNF, S can have a production with a single non-terminal, but all non-terminals must produce two symbols. Hmm, no, I think all productions, including S's, should be of the form A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals. But the initial productions given in the grammar have S -> NT45 NT81 and S -> NT19 NT67. Then, for other non-terminals, like NT5, it's NT5 -> NT61 NT75, which is two non-terminals. So all productions have two symbols on the right.\n\nBut then, in the given grammar, there's a production like NT5 -> 't25'. Wait, that's a terminal symbol. So a production A -> a B, where a is a terminal and B is a non-terminal. That should be acceptable in CNF because each symbol on the right is a terminal or non-terminal, and the total number is two.\n\nWait, but if a production has a terminal and a non-terminal on the right, like A -> a B, that's allowed in CNF. So in our case, the string contains both terminals and non-terminal symbols (like t-something and NT-something).\n\nSo, to verify the string, I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from some production, and then recursively check the non-terminals.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to parse the string backward, starting from S and seeing if we can derive the string by applying the productions in reverse.\n\nAlternatively, since the start symbol is S, and S can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67, each expansion will result in two components. The string provided is 37 symbols long, so it must have 36 splits because each production adds one symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by a production of a non-terminal, and then the resulting non-terminals can be further expanded.\n\nLet me try to map the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t32 t13 t77 t77 t8 t71 t59 t76 t47 t47 t83 t49 t76 t59 t47 t13 t77 t26 t59 t76 t25 t32 t84 t33 t22 t33 t28 t71 t32 t33 t22 t13 t76`.\n\nI notice that some terminals appear multiple times, but I need to check their positions.\n\nLet me first look for the first symbol, t32. Which non-terminals produce t32?\n\nLooking through the productions, let's see:\n\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n- NT26 -> 't26'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT33 -> 't33'\n- NT84 -> 't84'\n- NT83 -> 't83'\n- NT47 -> 't47'\n- NT77 -> 't77'\n- NT76 -> 't76'\n- NT71 -> 't71'\n- NT75 -> 't32'\nWait, looking at the list:\n\n- NT75 -> 't32' (since NT75's production is 't32')\n- Also, perhaps others?\n\nWait, let me list the productions that result in a terminal:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the relevant productions where the right side is a terminal:\n\n- S -> NT45 NT81 (non-terminal)\n- S -> NT19 NT67 (non-terminal)\n- NT5 -> 't25' (maybe this is a two-symbol production, but the right side is 't25', so perhaps a typo? Or perhaps in the original grammar, NT5 produces two symbols where one is a terminal. Wait, the initial line says each production is in CNF, so each production must have exactly two symbols on the right side. So perhaps the production should be written as NT5 -> 't25' followed by a non-terminal or another terminal. Wait, no, that can't be right. So maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, maybe each line represents a production where the non-terminal on the left produces two symbols on the right. But sometimes, the right-hand side may consist of a terminal and another symbol. For example, if a production is written as NT3 -> a B, that would be allowed as long as each symbol is a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, for example, NT84 -> 't77'. Wait, 't77' is a two-symbol terminal? Or is there a typo? Wait, I think each production in CNF must have exactly two symbols on the right side. So perhaps 't77' is a single terminal? Or is 't' followed by two symbols?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused because the way the grammar is presented may have two symbols in some cases, but perhaps some productions are written as the terminal followed by a non-terminal. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nFor example, S -> NT45 NT81: here, NT45 and NT81 are non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-631","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and string are provided, but I'm a bit overwhelmed because the grammar is quite complex with a lot of productions. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that CNF has specific rules: every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to follow CNF because all the productions either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. The starting symbol is S, and the string to check starts with 't33', which is a terminal, so S must eventually derive this sequence.\n\nThe string is: `t33 t5 t5 t22 t3 t3 t3 t22 t3 t47 t35 t26 t33 t22 t49 t22 t59 t52 t32 t76 t76 t3 t3 t84 t3 t28 t83 t49 t14 t49 t77 t71 t84`.\n\nI notice that some terminals are repeated, which might indicate that they are produced by multiple non-terminals. The first symbol in the string is 't33', so I need to find a production that starts with 't33'. Looking at the grammar, there's `NT22 -> t76` and `NT27 -> t76`, but none directly produce 't33'. Wait, looking closer, I see `NT22 -> t42` and `NT25 -> t33`. Oh, so 't33' must come from NT25.\n\nSo the first part would be NT25 \u2192 t33, which consumes 't33' from the string. Now, after that, the next symbols are 't5', 't5', etc. I need to find how 't5' is derived. Looking for 't5', I see in the grammar that `S -> NT19 NT67` and `S -> NT45 NT81`. Other productions for NT5 and others lead to 't25', etc. But wait, let me check the terminals. Oh, there's `NT9 -> t26`, `NT22 -> t42`, but I'm looking for 't5'. Wait, in the grammar, some productions produce 't5' directly, but I don't see it in the initial productions. Wait, no, looking again, I don't see a production that directly produces 't5'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Looking through the grammar, the terminals start with 't2', 't5', etc. I see `NT9 -> t26`, but where is 't5' coming from? Oh, wait, perhaps I need to trace back how 't5' is formed. Maybe NT5 \u2192 t5 is a production? Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see a rule like NT5 \u2192 t5. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see `NT9 -> t26` but not directly 't5'. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, I see that NT5 has a production `NT5 -> 't25'`, so NT5 can only produce t25, not t5. So how is 't5' being produced? That's confusing. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the grammar. I'll scan for any production that directly produces t5. Looking through all the productions:\n\nAt the very end, I see `NT53 -> 't30'`, `NT30 -> 't82'`, `NT83 -> 't30'`, `NT39 -> 't28'`, `NT13 -> 't47'`, etc. I don't see any production that directly gives t5. Wait, did I miss it? Or perhaps it's indirectly produced via a chain. So maybe I need to find a path where a non-terminal can derive a series of symbols ending with t5.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, perhaps the NT5 can be involved in producing t5. Wait, NT5's productions are `NT5 -> NT9 NT53`, `NT5 -> 't25'`. So from NT5, you can go to t25, but how to get t5? Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the initial step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first symbol 't33' comes from NT25, as I thought, and then after that, the next symbols need to be derived. Let's try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t33 \u2192 NT25. Now, the next production is NT25 \u2192 t33, so the first part is clear. After that, the next symbols are t5 t5 t22...\n\nSo after NT25, we have to derive the remaining string. But wait, the production for NT25 is only `NT25 -> t33`, so that's a single step. So after that, the next symbols must come from another part of the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire string must be derived from S, so the entire process starts with S. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t33 t5 t5 t22 t3 t3 t3 t22 t3 t47 t35 t26 t33 t22 t49 t22 t59 t52 t32 t76 t76 t3 t3 t84 t3 t28 t83 t49 t14 t49 t77 t71 t84.\n\nThis is a long string. Let's try to break it down starting from S.\n\nS can be derived in two ways: NT19 NT67 or NT45 NT81. Let's check which one makes sense based on the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t33, which comes from NT25, but not NT19 or NT45. Wait, so maybe the initial production is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part of the string starts with something else. Let me check the possible productions that can start with t33. From the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 t42, NT25 \u2192 t33, NT27 \u2192 t76, etc. So the only production that gives t33 is NT25 \u2192 t33.\n\nBut wait, how does the grammar derive t33? It's directly from NT25. So in S's expansion, if S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then NT45 and NT81 must both be non-terminals that can produce the remaining string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t33, which is an output of NT25. But S can't produce t33 directly because S's productions are NT19 NT67 or NT45 NT81. So this suggests that maybe the initial step is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which production starts with t33. Maybe I should look through all possible NT productions to see where t33 comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t42\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT53 \u2192 t30\n- NT30 \u2192 t82\n- NT83 \u2192 t30\n- NT39 \u2192 t28\n- NT13 \u2192 t47\n- NT7 \u2192 t11\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT81 \u2192 t30\n- NT60 \u2192 t84\n- NT81 \u2192 t3\n- NT22 \u2192 t42\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n- NT45 \u2192 t60 t77\nWait, no, the NT45 production is `NT45 -> NT60 NT77`, which then can derive t84 t30? Because NT60 \u2192 t84 t30 via NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81 and NT30 \u2192 t82, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production NT45 \u2192 t60 t77, then NT60 \u2192 t84 via another production or something else.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me attempt a parse:\n\nThe string is: t33 t5 t5 t22 t3 t3 t3 t22 t3 t47 t35 t26 t33 t22 t49 t22 t59 t52 t32 t76 t76 t3 t3 t84 t3 t28 t83 t49 t14 t49 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-652","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, Chomsky normal form means each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string provided is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol, which is S.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, S can produce two options: NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Both of these are combinations of other non-terminals, so I'll need to track how these non-terminals might unpack into the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't25 t52 t30 ...'. 't25' isn't a terminal on its own in the grammar. Wait, looking through the productions, I see that in NT19's production, there's a terminal 't25'. Also, NT22 has 't22', but that's different. So, maybe we're looking at some production that eventually leads to 't25' as the first symbol.\n\nLet me check the grammar again. In the S rules, the first option leads to NT45 NT81, and looking at NT45, it has a production that eventually becomes 't44', not sure if that's relevant. But wait, there's an NT45 rule that goes to NT60 NT77, and NT77 is 't8', which doesn't help. Alternatively, looking at NT45's other production: NT50 NT44, but that doesn't seem to get to 't25'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Let's think about the start symbol S. The first production is S -> NT45 NT81. So the first two symbols must be the leftmost NT45 and NT81.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't25'. So maybe the first production isn't the one being used because NT45 is producing things that don't start with 't25'. Let me check NT45's productions. NT45 can produce 't44' or other combinations. Hmm.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see if any of the rules produce 't25'. Looking through, I see in NT5's production: NT5 -> NT9 NT53, and I don't see 't5' but 't9' and 't53'? Or wait, NT53's production leads to 't30' and other things. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a non-terminal NT52 which has production NT52 -> NT9 NT0. Then NT9 leads to 't26' among other things. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT22, which has a production NT22 -> 't22'. So that might be a place where 't22' comes in. But the string starts with 't25', so that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the first NT45 is producing something that leads to the first 't25' in the string. Let me check NT45's rules again. Oh, there's a production NT45 -> NT50 NT44. Then NT50 goes to 't49', but we need 't25' somewhere. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I might be getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider the parse tree. The string is made up of terminals, so each terminal in the string must be the result of a production rule that eventually produces a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't25'. So where does 't25' come from? Checking the grammar, among all the rules, NT5 has a rule NT5 -> NT9 NT53, and NT9 can produce 't9' or 't26', or other combinations. Not directly helpful.\n\nWait, looking at the NT19 rule: S starts with NT19 NT67. And in NT19's production, there's 't25'. Oh! So if the first production used is S -> NT19 NT67, then the first part is NT19, which can produce a terminal 't25'.\n\nSo the string starts with 't25', which could come from NT19. Let's note that: the first step would be S -> NT19 NT67, then NT19 -> ... resulting in 't25', and then NT67 would need to produce the rest.\n\nWait, let's see: S -> NT19 NT67, then NT19 -> t25 ... So the first 't25' comes from NT19. So maybe that's the right direction. Then the rest of the string after 't25' is 't52 t30 t5 t5 t77 t5 t39 t14 t47 t3 t13 t59 t52 t84 t71 t83 t77 t76 t52 t84 t13 t33 t47 t83 t33 t39 t5 t84 t76 t13 t33 t25 t13'.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. The string is one continuous sequence, so it's 't25 t52 t30 t5 ...' So after 't25', we have 't52', then 't30', etc.\n\nBut in the production S -> NT19 NT67, the first terminal would be 't25' (from NT19) and then the 't52' would come from NT67. Let me check NT67's productions. Looking at the grammar, NT67 -> NT30 NT2. Hmm. Then NT30 can produce 't82' or other combinations. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Maybe the first 't25' comes from NT19, but the second part (NT67) leads to the rest of the string.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible derivation:\n\n1. Start with S -> NT19 NT67\n2. NT19 -> t25 (from NT19's production: NT19 -> t25 NT14)\n3. Then NT67 needs to produce the rest after 't25': 't52 t30 t5 t5 t77 t5 t39 t14 t47 t3 t13 t59 t52 t84 t71 t83 t77 t76 t52 t84 t13 t33 t47 t83 t33 t39 t5 t84 t76 t13 t33 t25 t13'\n\nWait, but NT67's production leads to NT30 NT2. So after 't25', the next symbols would be 't52' from NT67. So NT67 -> ... Let me see: NT67 -> NT30 NT2. So 't52' is the next symbol. Let me check NT67's production: looking at the grammar, NT67 -> NT30 NT2. Then NT30 can produce 't82' or other things, but 't52' is another symbol. Wait, maybe I'm missing a step.\n\nWait, no: NT30's production is NT30 -> NT9 NT45. Then NT9 produces 't26' or other things. Hmm, but I need to get to 't52' somehow. Wait, maybe looking at another production: NT25 is 't25', but where is NT26? Or maybe I'm getting off track.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me start over.\n\nThe string starts with 't25', which must come from NT19 because only NT19 has a production that starts with 't25'. So the first production is S -> NT19 NT67, which fires NT19 and NT67.\n\nFrom NT19, it can go to t25 NT14. So the first symbol is 't25', then from NT19's NT14, which can produce 't14' or other terms. Then after 't25', the next symbols from NT67 need to be 't52', then 't30', etc.\n\nNT67's production is NT30 NT2. So after 't25', the next symbol is the first symbol from this production, which is 't30' from NT30, but the string's next symbol is 't52', not 't30'. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT67 can produce 't52' directly. Let me check NT67's production: it's only NT30 NT2. So the first symbol from NT67 is 't30' if NT30 produces 't30' or other symbols.

Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can see that all the productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. So it's correctly in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t35 t59 t28 t52 t14 t83 t39 t13 t71 t35 t35 t11 t49 t14 t35 t82 t11 t32 t52 t35 t33 t47 t71 t32 t22 t47 t71 t59 t59 t32 t28 t59 t59`.\n\nEach part of the string is separated by spaces, and each seems to be a terminal symbol. So, my task is to see if this entire string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string using the given grammar. Parsing in CNF is deterministic if we can perform top-down parsing using something like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm dealing with this manually, maybe a better approach is to simulate the parsing step by step, starting from the top-down.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Identify the start symbol, which is S. Our aim is to see if S can derive the given string.\n\n2. The given grammar has two production rules for S:\n   - S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n   - S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, at the beginning, either S can split into NT45 followed by NT81 or NT19 followed by NT67. Since the string starts with t5, I need to see which of these productions can lead to t5.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5. Let's check what NT45 and NT19 produce:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 t60 NT77 (and then further splits until terminal 't8'), or also has a production NT44 \u2192 t59, which eventually leads to 't59' as a terminal. Wait, let's check NT45's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT45 has:\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- Also, there's NT44 \u2192 NT84 NT8, and NT44 \u2192 t44 (when NT84 \u2192 t77 and NT8 \u2192 t83, which leads to t44 as a terminal).\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is t5. Let's look at NT5 productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, and looking at NT9's productions, NT9 \u2192 NT22, which leads to t22, or NT9 \u2192 t26, which is 't26'. But our first symbol is t5, which suggests that perhaps I'm looking for a production that starts with t5.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the non-terminals may derive to terminals through several steps. Let me see if any of the non-terminals directly produce t5.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53. Then NT9 has productions leading to t22 or t26. So no direct t5.\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t22 (directly, which is 't22').\n\nBut our string starts with t5, which isn't t22 or t26. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me see: maybe the NT45 production leads to 't5' through a chain. Let me check NT45.\n\nLooking at NT45:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77.\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81.\nNT30 \u2192 t82 (directly).\nWait, no, NT30's production is:\nNT30 \u2192 t82 as per NT30 \u2192 t82.\nBut looking at the string, we have t5, which isn't t30, t81, etc.\n\nAlternatively, NT44 \u2192 t59. Wait, but t59 isn't the first symbol. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's look at the first symbol in the string, which is t5. Maybe none of the productions directly produce t5, so perhaps we need to see if t5 can be part of a more complex derivation.\n\nLooking through the grammar, is there any non-terminal that can produce t5? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT5: NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, and NT9 can produce t22 or t26, so no.\n\nLooking elsewhere:\n\nFor NT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52.\n\nNT25 \u2192 t33.\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT9 NT0.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first t5 is part of a longer derivation. Let's see: perhaps the S \u2192 NT45 NT81 split.\n\nLooking at NT45: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81.\n\nAnd NT30 \u2192 t82.\n\nSo NT60 would derive into t82. But that's just one part.\n\nNT45 has two parts: if NT45 produces t60 and t77, but t60 becomes t82, and t77 is 't77' (from NT77's production as t77). So that part would become t82 t77.\n\nSimilarly, NT81 in S \u2192 NT81 would go into t31 or some other terminal?\n\nWait, looking at NT81's rules:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT30 NT2.\n\nSo NT30 \u2192 t82, and NT2 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo NT81 would derive t82 t5.\n\nPutting it together, S \u2192 NT45 NT81 would derive (t82 t77) (t82 t5). But our string starts with t5, so that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at NT19:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8.\n\nNT84 \u2192 't77'.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't83'.\n\nSo NT19 would produce t77 t83.\n\nNT67's rule is: NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2.\n\nAgain, NT30 \u2192 t82, NT2 \u2192 t5, so NT67 would be t82 t5.\n\nPutting that together, S \u2192 NT19 NT67 would be t77 t83 t82 t5.\n\nSo how does the string start with t5? It seems that the initial part is t5, so maybe the second part of S's production, which is NT67, produces t82 t5, so perhaps the initial t5 comes from there.\n\nWait, but in S \u2192 NT19 NT67, the first part is NT19 which is t77 t83, and then the second part is NT67 which is t82 t5. So the entire S would be t77 t83 t82 t5.\n\nSo the first symbol is t5, but wait, actually, the leftmost symbol is the first to be generated. So in the case of S \u2192 NT19 NT67, the NT19 is the first part, so it would generate t77 t83, and then NT67 would generate t82 t5. So the string starts with t77 t83 t82 t5, meaning the first four symbols would be t77 t83 t82 t5, but our given string starts with t5. That can't be, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the order.\n\nWait, maybe I got the order wrong. In S \u2192 NT19 NT67, does the NT19 come before or after? In Chomsky Normal Form, the leftmost derivation would expand the leftmost non-terminal first. So, for S \u2192 NT19 NT67, the NT19 would be expanded first, followed by NT67.\n\nSo, NT19 \u2192 t77 t83.\n\nNT67 \u2192 t82 t5.\n\nSo S \u2192 (t77 t83) (t82 t5).\n\nSo the string would start with t77 t83 t82 t5.\n\nBut our target string starts with t5, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nNT45: let's see how it's derived.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81.\n\nNT30 \u2192 t82.\n\nNT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-691","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: `t49 t52 t25 t59 t52 t71 t33 t14 t32 t11 t82 t30 t83 t76 t83 t14 t11 t52 t71 t42 t33 t76 t25 t52 t3 t39 t77 t26 t39 t59 t84 t3 t82 t77 t14 t14`.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. All productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems mostly follows CNF, except maybe some rules might have more than two symbols, but let me check. Each production either has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81, so two non-terminals. The production S \u2192 NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75 is two non-terminals again. No terminal on the left side except in some cases. Wait, I notice that some productions have terminals, like NT5 \u2192 't25', which is a terminal. So, the rules where non-terminals produce terminals are acceptable because in CNF, a non-terminal can produce a terminal. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, to check if the string is in the language, I need to simulate the derivation process or use a parsing approach. Since the string is long, a top-down approach (using the CYK algorithm) might be feasible, but I'm not sure about the time. Alternatively, I can try using the Earley parser or see if the string can be broken down using the given productions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since each production either splits into two parts or a terminal and a non-terminal, maybe the string can be derived by tracking the possible non-terminals that could produce each token.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with `t49`. Looking at the grammar, which rules produce 't49' as a terminal? Let's check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT50 -> 't49'. So, NT50 \u2192 t49.\n\nSo the first token is 't49', which is the terminal generated by NT50. So, the first production used would be NT50 \u2192 t49. Then, moving to the next token.\n\nWait, but the string starts with `t49`, which is the first symbol. So, to produce 't49', we need NT50 \u2192 t49. So that would mean the left-hand side is NT50, which can only produce that terminal. But in CNF, the left-hand side is a non-terminal, so in the initial step, we'd start with S. So, S can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the order. The string is a sequence of terminals, so in a top-down parser, we'd start with S and try to derive the string. But to make it simple, perhaps I can model this as the reverse: starting from the string and working towards the start symbol, consuming symbols as we go.\n\nAlternatively, since the string starts with t49, which comes from NT50. So, let me see: The string is [t49, t52, t25, t59, t52, t71, t33, ...].\n\nSo, the first token is t49, which is from NT50. So, the first production is NT50 \u2192 t49. Now, the next token is t52. So we need to see how t52 can be generated. Looking at the grammar, possible productions:\n\n- NT27 -> t76\n- NT25 -> t33\n- NT23 -> t14\n- NT14 -> t22\n- NT52 -> t71\nWait, no, looking again, are there any NT producing t52?\n\nWait, let me check all the production rules for terminals:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT23 \u2192 't14'\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n- NT50 \u2192 't49'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT81 \u2192 t71?\nWait, no, in the rules, NT53 is 't30', NT27 is 't76', NT22 is 't22', NT23 is 't14', NT61 is 't13', NT44 is 't76', NT25 is 't33'.\n\nWait, none of the non-terminals in the grammar directly produce 't52'. So the next token is t52. That suggests that either the parser needs to have a production that can generate t52, but looking through all non-terminals, no production rule for any NT ends with 't52'. Wait, but the string's next tokens:\n\nSecond token is t52.\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 t52? I see:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 t49\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT23 \u2192 t14\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'? No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check all the NT productions for terminals:\n\nLooking at the full grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 't52' as a terminal. Scanning the list:\n\n- NT75 \u2192 't32', NT44 \u2192 't59', NT27 \u2192 't76', NT61 \u2192 't13', NT23 \u2192 't14', NT52 \u2192 't71', NT53 \u2192 't30', NT9 \u2192 't26', NT40 \u2192 't39', NT12 \u2192 't3', NT8 \u2192 't83', NT47 \u2192 't84', NT75 \u2192 't32', NT44 \u2192 't59', NT52 \u2192 't71', NT81 \u2192 't30', NT60 \u2192 't84', NT81 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, is there any NT that produces 't52'? It doesn't seem so. So, the second token is t52, but there's no NT rule that directly produces 't52'. That suggests that either the parser can't produce that token, leading to rejection, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check if any of the rules have 't52' as a terminal.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking for any occurrence of 't52' on the right-hand side of a production. Let's see:\n\n- The rules are in the form NTX \u2192 something. So, any rule where the RHS is a terminal includes 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 t49\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT23 \u2192 t14\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT40 \u2192 t39\n- NT12 \u2192 t3\n- NT8 \u2192 t83\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- NT75 \u2192 t32\n- NT50 \u2192 t30?

{"custom_id":"request-687","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are quite long and complex, so I'll have to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals. Terminal symbols appear only on the right-hand side, and the start symbol is S. Since all productions are in CNF, the parse tree for any string will be a binary tree where each internal node has two children.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t39 t77 t71 t71 t47 t76 t13 t52 t82 t71 t25 t11 t49 t5 t82 t71 t77 t77 t25 t76 t76 t5 t82 t76 t39 t30 t26 t76 t30 t84 t42 t35 t11 t39 t3 t47`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and terminals are only the leaves. So, the entire process will involve breaking down the string step by step, checking if each production exists in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the structure of the string. It's 41 tokens long, which means the parse tree will have a certain structure. In CNF, the number of non-terminals at each level will be specific, so maybe I can check if the string can fit into some production hierarchy.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, it's a long list of productions. Each non-terminal on the left expands into two non-terminals on the right. I need to see if the string can be formed by combining these.\n\nAlternatively, since this might be time-consuming, perhaps I can find a way to break the string into parts that match some production rules.\n\nLooking at the string: The first token is t39. In the grammar, I see that t39 is the right-hand side of NT40. Specifically, NT40 -> NT14 NT71 and also NT40 -> t39. So, t39 can be directly produced by NT40.\n\nSo, the first token t39 comes from NT40. That means that in the parse tree, the root S must have a chain of productions leading down to NT40, which then produces t39 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but S -> NT45 NT81. So, S directly expands to two non-terminals, NT45 and NT81. The string starts with t39, which comes from NT40, but NT40 isn't directly a child of S. S's children are NT45 and NT81, so maybe I'm getting off track.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the string is the leftmost derivation. So, starting from S, we replace S with NT45 NT81. Then, each non-terminal expands further until we get all terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be represented as a combination of the non-terminals in the grammar, following their productions.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Maybe I should look for certain patterns. Alternatively, perhaps I can track the possible ways each token could be generated.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the grammar. Looking at the left-hand sides, most are two non-terminals, except for some which expand into terminals. For example, NT5 -> 't25' and others.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the grammar, some non-terminals expand into a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT75 -> NT72 NT5, which would produce a terminal in the second position. For example, if NT75 appears in a production, the resulting string after that expansion would have a 't' followed by another non-terminal.\n\nBut in our given string, all tokens are terminals. So, each production in the parse tree must have both expansions leading to terminals at the lowest level. That means that each path from the root to a terminal must consist of all non-terminals being replaced until we reach a production that ends in terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the long productions (like NT45, NT75, etc.) have terminals only as the first or second symbol, but not both. For instance, NT45-> NT60 NT77 is a production with two non-terminals. NT45 also has NT5 -> 't25' as a production.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated by the grammar, each part of the string must come from a sequence of productions where each non-terminal is expanded step by step until we reach a production that ends in terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree for the string backwards, starting from the end. But given the string is quite long, that might not be feasible manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for tokens that appear in the grammar as endpoints, meaning that they can only be produced by specific non-terminals.\n\nFor example, 't39' appears in two places in the grammar: NT40 -> t39 and NT27 -> t36 t47 but t39 is the first part of NT40. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for the right-hand sides, NT27 -> NT60 NT47, and also looking for 't39'. In the grammar, I see NT40 -> t39, so 't39' is only on the right-hand side of NT40. So, 't39' can only be produced by NT40.\n\nSimilarly, other tokens can only be produced by specific non-terminals. For example, 't26' is only in NT19 -> NT60 NT53 and also in NT9.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar includes 't82' in some places? Wait, the right-hand sides include 't25', 't11', 't49', 't5', 't82', 't71', 't42', 't35', 't76', etc. So, each of these is terminal symbols that appear on the right-hand side of certain non-terminals.\n\nFor example, 't39' is from NT40, 't77' is from NT74? Wait, no, looking at the grammar: NT74-> NT72 NT5, and also NT75-> NT72 NT5, wait, looking through:\n\nWait, in the grammar given, looking for where the right-hand sides are terminals:\n\n- S's productions are both two non-terminals: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53.\n\nNT5 also has NT5 \u2192 't25'.\n\nOther non-terminals:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13.\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52.\n\nNT19 has NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 and NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT60 NT47.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT22 which is a production that only leads to 't22'.\n\nWait, looking again, in the grammar provided:\n\nNT22-> 't22'\n\nSimilarly, other terminals like t71, t77, etc., appear as terminal symbols. For example:\n\nLooking at NT44 \u2192 t76.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT77 is on the RHS of several productions, including S's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all terminal symbols and note which non-terminals produce them.\n\nFor example:\n\n't39' comes from NT40.\n\n't77' comes from NT77, which produces t8 and t71, perhaps?\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT77 appears as the right-hand side of NT77 -> 't8', but I see in the list, wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nFrom the given productions:\n\nLooking through all the right-hand sides, the terminals are:\n\nt25, t11, t49, t5, t82, t71, t42, t35, t76, t30, t84, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps listing them all:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- 194: NT77 -> 't8'\n\n- 195: NT78 -> 't9'\n\n- 197: NT79 -> 't4'\n\n- 180: NT80 -> 't7'\n\n- 187: NT83-> 't30'\n\n- 90: NT84-> 't77'\n\n- 169: NT85-> 't5'\n\n- 181: NT86-> 't8'\n\n- 164: NT87-> 't9'\n\n- 155: NT88-> 't7'\n\n- 127: NT43-> 't4'\n\n- Not actually, wait, this might get too confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-705","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I should probably understand the grammar better. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S. Let me see the productions:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\nS -> NT19 NT67\n\nSo the string starts with 't49', and according to the grammar, the first part should be NT45 and NT81. Let me check if the string starts with 't49' followed by other parts, but wait, the string starts as 't49 t13 t8 t77 t32 t11 t35 t71 t14 t22 t13 t49 t82 t25 t35 t25 t52 t25 t5 t14 t39 t59 t22 t47 t13 t82 t25 t26 t25 t28 t14 t77 t42 t8 t35 t39 t49'.\n\nHmm, that starts with 't49', but according to the first production, it should be 't49' (from NT45) followed by something. Wait, no\u2014looking directly, the production S -> NT45 NT81 translates to T45 followed by T81. So if S was expanded, the first part is T45 and then T81.\n\nBut the string starts with 't49', which I think corresponds to NT45 -> 't49'. So that's a possible match. Now, the next symbol should be NT45 followed by NT81. Let's see:\n\nAfter 't49', the next thing is 't13'. But according to the production, NT45 should be followed by NT81. But in the string, after 't49' is 't13', which is a terminal; maybe that's part of the expansion. Wait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are non-terminals, and only the leaves are terminals.\n\nSo perhaps I should parse the string as a series of terminals that come from the expansion. Let's list the string parts as a sequence of terminals:\n\nt49, t13, t8, t77, t32, t11, t35, t71, t14, t22, t13, t49, t82, t25, t35, t25, t52, t25, t5, t14, t39, t59, t22, t47, t13, t82, t25, t26, t25, t28, t14, t77, t42, t8, t35, t39, t49.\n\nWait, that's a lot. Starting from S, which is NT45 -> 't49' followed by NT81 -> 't77'? Because in the S production, it's NT45 followed by NT81, which according to the rules would translate to 't49' followed by 't77' \u2014 but in the string, the first two are 't49' and 't13', which doesn't match. So maybe the string doesn't start with S's first production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with a different production. Let's look at the entire string. Alternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step, using the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt49, t13, t8, t77, t32, t11, t35, t71, t14, t22, t13, t49, t82, t25, t35, t25, t52, t25, t5, t14, t39, t59, t22, t47, t13, t82, t25, t26, t25, t28, t14, t77, t42, t8, t35, t39, t49.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t49. Looking at the grammar, how can we get t49? From NT45, which has a production NT45 -> 't49'. So perhaps the first part is derived from NT45. So the first part is 't49'.\n\nNow, what was the production for NT45? Looking up:\n\nNT45 production:\nNT45 -> 't49' (since one production is NT45 -> 't49') and another is NT45 -> NT50 NT44. So once 't49' is produced, it's done. So the next symbols must come from the other side of the production.\n\nWait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form allows the left-hand side to be a non-terminal, so the production S -> NT45 NT81 means that S expands into NT45 followed by NT81. So each of those is a non-terminal, which must be expanded further.\n\nSo if we're using S, the initial expansion is NT45 and NT81, each of which must be expanded into their respective right-hand sides.\n\nSo let me see. For S to generate the string, it must begin with NT45 being expanded into something that starts with 't49', and NT81 being expanded into something that starts with 't77' (since S's first production is NT45 -> 't49' and NT81 -> 't77').\n\nLooking at the given string, the first symbol is 't49', which matches NT45's possible expansion. Now, the second symbol is 't13'. But according to S's production, NT81 comes after NT45. So NT81's expansion must start with 't13'?\n\nWait, looking at NT81 productions:\n\nNT81 -> 't71' (from one production), and NT81 -> 't3' and also NT81 -> 't30' (from other productions like NT78), but wait, looking at the provided grammar, looking for NT81:\n\nIn the productions given, I see:\n\nNT78 is not present, but let's check NT81:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT81 -> 't71', and NT81 -> 't30' via NT30 -> 't82' and so on, but that's more steps.\n\nWait, looking at the direct rules:\n\nNT81 has:\n\nNT81 -> 't77' (from NT81 in S's production), and looking further down, I don't see NT81 directly. Wait, let me recheck the provided grammar:\n\nThe provided grammar lists various NT rules, and here's what stands out for NT81:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT87 or anything, but I do see:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- S: ... includes NT81, which in some cases may be 't77'.\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT81 is produced as 't71' in one production, and also as 't30' but wait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT81 having a production other than maybe a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look for NT81 in the productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- The rule NT61 -> NT53 NT12.\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77 (and also another production NT45-> 't49').\nSimilarly, for NT81, I can see:\n\nLooking over:\n\n- 't71' corresponds to NT71 -> 't77'.\nWait, no\u2014seems messy. Maybe I should list all NT81 productions.\n\nWait, let me look through the rules:\n\nIn the provided grammar, NT81 is only present in S's production as NT81, so I need to check in the rules if NT81 has other productions. Looking through each rule for NT81:\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each production rule step by step.\n\nLooking for 'NT81' in the productions:\n\n- S: NT81 is the right-hand side.\n- Other lines:\n\n- NT60 -> NT30 NT81 (so NT81 is part of this rule's output).\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77 (another rule).\n- NT36 -> NT84 NT53.\n- NT84 -> 't77'.\n- NT39 -> 't28'.\n- NT87 isn't in the provided rules.\n- NT52 -> 't71' among others.\n- NT81->'t71'\u2014Yes, looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking again, in the given rules:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nLine by line:\n\n1.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That makes parsing a bit easier because each step in the derivation only adds one symbol at a time. \n\nThe start symbol is S, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t13 t83 t39 t28 t39 t25 t33 t3 t47 t33 t42 t3 t71 t82 t52 t3 t76 t84 t49 t47 t47 t28 t14 t26 t30 t77 t11 t71 t42 t47 t25 t39 t26 t25 t35 t3 t25.\n\nI'll start by trying to find any production rules that directly correspond to these terminals.

Maybe that's a key point.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first symbol is t13, which is part of NT83? Wait, no. Let me check the non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string starts with t13, which would require NT13's terminal, but looking at the non-terminals, NT13 is part of NT40's production: NT40 \u2192 NT14 NT71 and so on. Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nWait, let me check the possible NTs that can produce t13. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for where a non-terminal directly produces t13. Scanning the production rules, I see NT13 \u2192 t39. Wait no, that's not right. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t47? Wait, looking through the list:\n\nLooking for t13, t28, etc. Each 't' is a terminal.

Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through each production, the right-hand sides:\n\n- Does any production for a non-terminal equal t13? Let's see:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT47\n- NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13\nWait, wait, NT13's production is listed as NT13 \u2192 t47. No, let me check. Looking through each line:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines:\n\n- NT13 -> t47\nWait, that's one of the productions. Similarly, NT22 -> t22, etc.\n\nWait, so NT13 can produce 't47', not 't13'. Hmm, looking through all the rules, I don't immediately see an NT that directly produces 't13'. Maybe 't13' is produced indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me see:\n\nIf the string starts with t13, that would mean the initial non-terminals must produce 't13' somehow.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Each production rule in the grammar is of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ or NTX \u2192 'tK'. So any 'tK' is a terminal, and NTXY refers to non-terminals.\n\nSo, for example, if a non-terminal A can produce 'tK', then in the string, when that A is expanded, it would produce tK directly.\n\nIn the given string, the first symbol is t13. So, that must come from some NTX \u2192 t13. But looking through the production rules, I don't see any NTX directly producing t13.\n\nLooking through the rules, the 't' symbols are t11, t14, t22, t26, t27, t28, t29 (wait no 29?), let me list all 't's:\n\n- t25: NT25 \u2192 t33\n\n- t35: NT25 \u2192 t35\n\nWait, looking through all rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t14\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n\n- NT4 --> wait, looking again: I see NT45 \u2192 't25','t39'?

Looking through all the productions, I don't see any. So perhaps 't13' is only produced by a chain of expansions starting from some NT.\n\nWait, looking at NT12's productions: NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13. So if NT12 is expanded, it becomes NT40 and NT13. Then, NT13, if it can produce t13, but from the rules, NT13 expands to t47 or maybe through another step.\n\nWait, so the t13 can't be generated directly by any NT, as per the given rules. So perhaps the string cannot be generated, but that would be strange. Or maybe I made a mistake in identifying the rules.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me re-express the rules correctly.\n\nLooking at each production line:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n- NT45 \u2192 NT53 NT12\n- NT45 \u2192 NT40 NT71\n- NT45 \u2192 NT52 NT27\n- NT45 \u2192 NT23 NT45\n- NT45 \u2192 NT44 NT28\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n\nSo, among these, the only 't' is 't25' from NT45.\n\nSimilarly, NT25's productions are:\n\nLooking for any NT25 rule with 't'.

{"custom_id":"request-728","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is important because it simplifies the implementation of parsers like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just trying to figure this out manually, maybe that's not necessary right now.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of production rules. Each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. Let me list out some of the key rules to understand the structure.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81, which means S can be replaced with NT45 NT81. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75, so NT5 is replaced by NT61 and NT75. On the terminal side, NT45 can also produce 't25', which is a terminal symbol. Similarly, other non-terminals can produce various terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t77 t11 t25 t32 t42 t47 t42 t8 t39 t13 t59 t39 t22 t26 t8 t82 t71 t49 t35 t8 t59 t59 t11 t33 t83 t83 t5 t82 t11 t71 t33 t71 t71 t11 t33 t42 t33 t13`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a series of 't's followed by numbers, like 't77', 't11', etc. Some of these are terminals, while others are non-terminals because they have letters like 'NT' or numbers like '45', '61' etc. Wait, actually, in this grammar, uppercase 'NT' stands for non-terminals, while numbers (like 't25') are terminals because they're mapped to actual terminal symbols. So in the string, when I see 't77', that's a terminal; when I see 'NT45', that's a non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string, I only see 't' followed by numbers, no uppercase NT. So all the elements in the string are terminals. But in the grammar, the non-terminals only produce terminals or other non-terminals. So for the string to be generated, every symbol must eventually derive into terminals.\n\nGiven that the string consists only of terminals, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, we need to see if the derivation leads to this string.\n\nFirst, I'll check the top-level production. S can be replaced by two options: NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nBoth options start with two non-terminals. So S \u2192 NT45 NT81 implies that we need to derive NT45 and NT81 to match with the first two symbols of the string, which are 't77' and 't11'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first is 't77', so let's see what NT45 and NT81 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT45 \u2192 't25' (a terminal), or other non-terminals? Wait, wait: Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n\nAnd then NT60 \u2192 NT84 NT53, and so on... Hmm, maybe I need to build a parse tree.\n\nWait, another approach is to check if each 't' in the string can be matched by the terminals generated by the non-terminals.\n\nWait, but for the string, the order of the terminals must match the order of the derivations.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since both S's first options produce NT45 NT81 and NT19 NT67, I can check each possibility.\n\nFirst, let's look at the string's first symbol: 't77'.\n\nIf the first production is S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then we need to see if NT45 can produce 't77' or related. But looking at NT45's productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. So NT45 can produce NT60 and NT77. Then, NT60 \u2192 NT84 NT53. NT84 produces 't30' and NT53 \u2192 't30' or other.\n\nWait, no, NT84 actually has a production that produces 't30'? Or does it?\n\nLooking at the rules, for NT44 \u2192 't76', NT84 \u2192 't77', yes. So NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. NT77 is a terminal, 't77'. That's great because the first symbol is 't77'.\n\nWait, hold on: NT77 is a non-terminal. Or is NT77 a terminal? Let me check. In the grammar, the terminals are everything that starts with 't', like 't77', 't11', etc. So NT77 can't be a terminal, because it's an NT symbol. So in the production NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, NT60 is another NT, and NT77 is another NT, which can't be terminals except if they have a production that leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, but let me check NT77 in the grammar: Is there a production for NT77? Looking through the list, I don't see any NT77 rule, except for some that produce terminals, but none specifically for NT77. So wait, does that mean NT77 cannot derive into a terminal? Then the derivation would require NT77 to become something else, but since it doesn't have a rule that leads to a terminal, that branch wouldn't produce a terminal string. Therefore, S \u2192 NT45 NT81 would lead to a tree that can't derive into the first 't77' because NT45's next production is NT60 NT77, which can't be terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. Let me see: In the grammar, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. So when you expand NT45, you get NT60 and NT77. Both are non-terminals. But then, you have to expand NT60 and NT77 further. NT60 \u2192 NT84 NT53. NT84 \u2192 't30' or NT72. Wait, looking at NT84: It has a production NT84 \u2192 't30'. So in NT60's expansion to NT84 NT53, one part is a terminal and the other is a non-terminal.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT45 NT81, which leads to NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT81. NT81 can be derived in a few ways: looking at NT81's productions, one is NT81 \u2192 't30', another is NT81 \u2192 't3' and so on. Let me check: NT81's rules include NT81 \u2192 't30' (yes, under NT81 \u2192 't82' and something else? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let me check the specific rules for NT81:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT36 NT81? No. Let's scan:\n\nLooking for NT81: \n\nYes, \"NT81 -> NT30 NT2\" and \"NT81 -> 't30'\", \"NT81 -> 't3'\" and another \"NT81 \u2192 NT36 NT81\" and then \"NT36 \u2192 't42'\". So NT81 can produce 't30', 't3', or other combinations.\n\nSo in the case of S \u2192 NT45 NT81, the start would produce NT45 NT81, which is (NT60 NT77) and (something).\n\nWait, but if NT77 is not a terminal, it's a non-terminal. But according to the grammar, NT77 is not listed as a terminal, so perhaps it cannot derive into a terminal? That might be a problem because our string starts with 't77', a terminal.\n\nSo, in the first case, S \u2192 NT45 NT81, the first symbol is 't77' which must come from NT45. But NT45 can derive into NT60 NT77, which are both non-terminals, but none can produce a terminal except perhaps NT77.\n\nWait, does NT77 have any production that leads to a terminal? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT77 that ends in a terminal. For example, NT77 doesn't appear on the left-hand side of any production except when another non-terminal refers to it. So unless NT77 itself has a production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I can use.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens, some of which are terminals (like 't11', 't25') and others might be non-terminals, but looking at the grammar, actually, the right-hand sides of the productions are either terminals or have two non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, the productions have two non-terminals except when they have a terminal. For example, S -> NT45 NT81, where NT45 and NT81 are non-terminals. But there's a production like NT36 -> 't42', so that's a terminal.\n\nThe string is a series of these tokens, and I need to see if it can be derived from the grammar. The string is: t11 t13 t28 t3 t30 t33 t5 t11 t8 t5 t39 t71 t13 t30 t11 t28 t39 t83 t82 t5 t28 t76 t84 t13 t33 t13 t83 t32 t8 t83 t14 t82 t25 t13 t8 t11 t42 t49.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. If I can use the productions to match each part of the string step by step until the entire string is consumed, then it's generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a parsing problem where I expand symbols from the left until I reach the start symbol S, ensuring that each production only uses two symbols at a time.\n\nLet me outline a plan:\n\n1. Start from the start symbol S, which expands into NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n2. Each production has two parts, and each part is either a non-terminal or a terminal. Since all terminals are single tokens, each must match exactly in the string.\n3. I can simulate the parsing by creating a stack or using a pointer to track where I am in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use a recursive descent approach or memoization to see if each symbol in the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me try to break down the string and see how it can be formed.\n\nThe string starts with 't11'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't11'. Looking through the grammar, I see that:\n\n- NT71 -> NT25 NT52\n- NT25 -> NT33\n- NT52 is a terminal (look at the production: NT52 -> 't71'). Wait, no: in the grammar, NT52 has productions like NT52 -> 't71', so it's a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the productions more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT5 -> 't26', NT75 -> 't32', NT71 -> 't52', NT52 -> 't71', and NT25 -> 't33'. Also, NT19 is matched to 't84' and 't8', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all non-terminals and their possible expansions:\n\nNT5: production leads to NT9 NT53. Oh, but NT9 can be 't26', and NT53 can be 't30', so 't9' 't53' which would be 't26' 't30', but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to represent each possible symbol and see if the string can be split into valid production sequences.\n\nI think I should model this as a series of linked list steps, where each step consumes two symbols from the string, possibly with non-terminals that can expand further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by replacing each symbol step by step, looking for the right productions.\n\nLet me start by looking for terminals in the string and see how they can be formed.\n\nThe string starts with 't11' followed by 't13', etc. Wait, let me check for any 't11's in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT71 -> NT25 NT52\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT52 -> 't71'\n\nSo NT71 produces 't33' 't71' when NT25 and NT52 are both terminals. Then, any production that can derive 't11' would need to come from a non-terminal that starts with that.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT71 -> NT25 NT52. Wait, and there's another production for NT71: NT71 -> NT12 NT84. Also, NT71 is mentioned in the string as the starting symbol perhaps.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The start symbol S can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the string starts with 't11', but NT81's expansion includes 't30' and 't81', but that's different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parse the string by matching each part step by step, using the grammar.\n\nLet me think of the entire string as a sequence of tokens:\n\nt11 t13 t28 t3 t30 t33 t5 t11 t8 t5 t39 t71 t13 t30 t11 t28 t39 t83 t82 t5 t28 t76 t84 t13 t33 t13 t83 t32 t8 t83 t14 t82 t25 t13 t8 t11 t42 t49.\n\nFirst token is 't11'. I need to find a production that can produce 't11'. Looking at the productions, perhaps NT71 can produce 't11' because one of the non-terminals might expand to that.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see that NT71 has the production NT71 -> NT25 NT52, and NT25 -> 't33', NT52 -> 't71'. So, combining these, NT71 would produce 't33' 't71', which means when combined, NT71 produces 't33 t71', which is 't33 t71' as a sequence. But 't11' is our first token, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't11' comes from another path. Wait, looking through the productions, is there any non-terminal that ends with 't11'? NT71 produces 't33 t71', which doesn't have 't11'. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, let's think about the entire string as a sequence of symbols and see if it can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is left-deriving, so we can try to match the string token by token.\n\nStarting with the first 't11'. Does any production of S start with 't11'? Let's see S produces NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nSo NT45 produces 't42' (when looking at the production NT45 -> 't42'). Hmm, that might not fit. Wait, NT45 can produce 't42', but in the S production, NT45 is followed by NT81. So if NT45 is 't42', then NT81 must produce the rest of the string starting from the next token.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe I can consider S as NT45 NT81. So when parsing the string, after the 't42' from NT45, the next non-terminal is NT81, which would produce some sequence.\n\nWait, but the initial token is 't11', which doesn't match any of the terminals produced by S directly. So that suggests that the first token is being produced by a non-term that is part of a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't11' is part of a longer expansion of a non-terminal. So perhaps I need to see a production that can lead 't11' to appear.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT71 -> NT25 NT52\n   NT25 -> NT33\n   NT52 -> 't71'\n\nSo NT71 would produce 't33' 't71'.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if any of these tokens appear.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't11 t13 t28 t3 t30 t33 t5 t11...', there's a 't33' at position 5th token, position 5 (if I count zero-based or one-based? Hmm, let me just note positions as 1 to 38 or so).

{"custom_id":"request-744","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if this string is generated by the given grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The string we need to check is a series of 't's followed by numbers, which probably correspond to terminals or non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I notice that the initial symbols of the grammar are S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So S produces either NT45 followed by NT81 or NT19 followed by NT67. Since NT45 is a non-terminal, it must be expanded into other symbols until it reaches a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't59'. I need to see if there's a production that starts with NT59 leading to 't59'. Scanning through the productions, I find NT53 \u2192 't30', NT39 \u2192 't28', but nothing for NT59. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. Oh, there's NT44 \u2192 't59' and 't76'. So NT44 can produce 't59' or 't76'. Also, NT47 \u2192 't84', and other NTs lead to various terminals.\n\nSo if the first part of the string is 't59', that must come from NT44. So somewhere in the derivation, there must be a production where NT44 produces 't59'. But to get to NT44, we need to look at the grammar. Let me see if NT44 has a production. Oh, yes, NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7 and NT44 \u2192 't59', and also NT44 \u2192 't76', etc. Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, the productions for NT44 are under NT75, yes: NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45, and NT45 \u2192 't25'. No, wait, looking back, I see that NT44 isn't directly a non-terminal; it's only mentioned under other NTs. Hmm, maybe I confused NT44 with something else.\n\nWait, let me re-examine. The productions are all for specific NTs. For example, NT53 \u2192 't30', NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, etc. So, for example, NT44 is written as NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7 and NT44 \u2192 't59' and NT44 \u2192 't76'. Wait no, looking back: the productions are:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7, and also NT44 \u2192 't59' and NT44 \u2192 't76'. So yes, NT44 can produce 't59' directly. So the first token 't59' must come from NT44.\n\nSo how do we get NT44? We need to see if any production leads to NT44. Looking at the grammar, is there any rule that produces NT44 as a non-terminal? Hmm, looking through the productions, I don't see an S or NT production that results in NT44. Wait, but perhaps NT44 is derived from another NT. Let me think.\n\nWait, let me check the productions: There's NT40 \u2192 NT58 NT39, NT47 \u2192 't84', etc. Hmm, maybe I need to look for a path from S to NT44. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with 't59', so the first symbol is 't59', which comes from NT44.\n\nSo assuming that, we can consider that NT44 is part of the parse tree, and it directly produces 't59'. Then, the next symbol is 't25'. So after 't59', the next is 't25'.\n\nSo after NT44 \u2192 't59', the next non-terminal would be NT25, which then produces 't25'. Do we have a production for NT25? Yes: NT25 \u2192 't33'. Wait, 't33' comes from NT25. But in the string, after 't59', it's 't25', so the NT44 must produce two symbols: 't59' and 't25'. But that would mean the production is NT44 \u2192 't59' 't25', but looking back, the productions don't have any rule that combines 't59' and 't25' directly. Instead, NT44 can only produce symbols in one step, either as a single symbol or by splitting into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions have two non-terminals on the left, and either a single terminal or two non-terminals on the right. But once you expand, the production must eventually resolve to terminals only.\n\nSo for NT44, it can directly produce 't59' or 't76', or split into two non-terminals. But the string after 't59' is 't25'. So perhaps the next step is NT25, but NT25 \u2192 't33', so that would require 't33' next, but the string has 't25' after 't59', which doesn't align. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me retrace.\n\nThe string starts with 't59 t25...'. So the first two symbols are 't59' and 't25'. That would imply that NT44 could produce a pair: the first part as 't59' and the second part as 't25'. But in the grammar, NT44 produces 't59' or 't76' or 't76' (wait, earlier I thought NT44 \u2192 't76' too, but looking again, the productions for NT44 are:\n\nWait, in the list provided, I see NT44 under some NTs. Wait, actually, in the productions, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, the productions starting with NT44 are under NT83 \u2192 NT44 NT7, and wait, the exact NT productions are a bit hard to parse. Let me look again.\n\nFrom the given productions, I see:\n\n- RT44 \u2192 NT44 NT7 or perhaps other combinations. Wait, looking through all the NTs:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the NT productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n\nSo NT44 can't produce 't59' directly. So if the string starts with 't59', it's produced by a non-terminal that can produce 't59'. Hmm, looking back, perhaps I missed that NT53 \u2192 't30' and other NTs. Wait, perhaps I should check all NTs to see which ones produce 't59'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't59' or 't76'\n\nSo NT44 can produce 't59' or 't76'. So the first token 't59' must come from NT44. So to get 't59' as the first symbol, the start symbol S must derive a chain that eventually starts with NT44, which then emits 't59'.\n\nSo starting from S, which can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLet's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nNow, we need to see how NT45 and NT81 can produce the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at NT45, it has productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 or 't25'.\n\nSimilarly, NT81 can produce several things: NT81 \u2192 NT40 NT13, NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT71, NT36 \u2192 't42', or others.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't59'. So in the first step, we have S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Then, each of these non-terminals must expand. But the first symbol we have is 't59', which suggests that one of the NTs produced 't59'.\n\nBut in S \u2192 NT45 NT81, the first NT is NT45 and the second is NT81. So each of these will produce symbols. So the combined string would be whatever NT45 produces followed by what NT81 produces.\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is 't59', so I think the 't59' must come from either NT45 or NT81.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 or 't25' or perhaps splitting into NTs. Wait, the first production for NT45 is NT45 \u2192 't25', which is a direct production of 't25'. So if NT45 produces 't25', and NT81 also produces something else,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-749","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see how it's structured. Context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production doesn't have more than two symbols on the right side, so that might help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several productions, some of which are broken down further. For example, S -> NT45 NT81. This suggests that the start symbol S can be replaced by two other non-terminals, NT45 and NT81. Each of these NT symbols (like NT5, NT19, etc.) likely represents a non-terminal that can be further expanded.\n\nNext, I'll examine the given string: \n\nt14 t8 t77 t3 t14 t42 t83 t83 t82 t13 t39 t28 t77 t3 t22 t71 t47 t11 t5 t33 t25 t49 t25 t30 t13 t8 t8 t47 t71 t32 t76 t52 t11 t8 t30 t42 t3 t5 t59\n\nI notice that the string starts with t14 and t8. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminal NT14 has a production: NT14 -> NT25 NT52. Let me see what NT25 and NT52 produce. \n\nFrom the grammar, NT25-> t33. Okay, so NT25 resolves to t33, which is a terminal. For NT52, the production is NT52-> t71. So NT52 is t71. \n\nSo, putting that together, NT14 -> t33 t71, which gives us the first two tokens of the string: t14 t33 t71. Wait, but the string starts with t14 t8. Hmm, that's a problem because the first production I'm getting from NT14 doesn't start with t14 t8 but t14 followed by t33 and t71. That suggests a mismatch because the string begins with t14 t8, so maybe NT14 isn't the starting point.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The grammar starts with S, which can be NT45 NT81. So the entire string must be derived from S, which expands into NT45 NT81. Therefore, the first two tokens should come from NT45 and NT81.\n\nLooking at NT45's production: NT45 -> t25 as one of the options, but wait, actually in the grammar, NT45 has multiple productions. Let me check all productions for NT45.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT45's productions are:\n- NT45 -> t8\n- NT45 -> t30\n- NT45 -> t44\n- NT45 -> t47\n- NT45 -> t50\n- NT45 -> t50 NT44 (which is non-terminal, but wait, no, I think it might be a typo. The grammar line is \"NT45 -> NT60 NT77\". Wait, let me parse that correctly.\n\nWait, looking again: The grammar shows several lines for NT45. It says \"NT45 -> NT60 NT77\" and \"NT45 -> NT50 NT44\". Wait, no, perhaps it's a formatting issue. Let me list them all.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n- NT45 -> NT47 NT53\n- NT45 -> NT44 NT?\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me go line by line.\n\nLooking for NT45's productions:\n\n1. NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n2. NT45 -> NT47 NT53\n3. Then, looking through the grammar, I don't see other NT45 productions. So NT45 can only expand into these two options: either NT60 NT77 or NT47 NT53.\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT45 NT81, so the first expansion is NT45 followed by NT81. For the string, the first two tokens are t14 t8, but let's see what NT45 and NT81 would produce.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t14 t8, so perhaps the NT45 produces t14? Let me check NT45's productions to see if any of them lead directly to t14. \n\nLooking at all NT45 productions, I see:\n\n- NT45 can produce NT60 NT77, which are non-terminals\n- NT45 can produce NT47 NT53, which are non-terminals\n- Then, perhaps more, but I don't see NT45 -> t14 anywhere in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the NT symbols that produce terminals. For example, NT5 -> t25, etc. Looking for any non-terminal that directly produces t14.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production where any NT symbol directly resolves to t14. The closest is NT52 -> t71, NT25->t33, etc. So NT45 can't directly produce t14. That suggests that the first step would produce something else, not starting with t14 or t8.\n\nBut the string starts with t14 t8. So perhaps the expansion is happening in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is supposed to start with NT45 and NT81, but looking for their expansions. NT45 can't produce t14; perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me see: for S->NT45 NT81, that would mean the string must start with whatever NT45 expands to, which is either t8, 47, etc. But since the string starts with t14, maybe the other part is NT81 expanding to something.\n\nLooking at NT81: It can expand into multiple non-terminals. Looking for NT81's productions, I see:\n\n- NT81 -> NT30 NT2\n- NT81 -> NT77 (from line \"NT81 -> t77\")\n- Also, from the grammar, NT81 can be expanded to t30. Specifically, there's a production NT30 -> t82, and elsewhere NT81 can produce t30. Wait, maybe I need to check all NT81 productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT81 has:\n\n- NT81 -> t77 (from \"NT81 -> 't77'\")\n- NT81 can also be expanded, for example, via NT72, which is not directly useful, but perhaps through other productions. Wait, maybe I'm missing some.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I also see:\n\n- NT60 -> t84 NT77 (wait, no, looking again, the line says NT60 -> t84 NT53). Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, the production line is: NT60 -> t84 NT53. So that's a non-terminal on the right.\n\nBut for NT81, perhaps it can produce itself as t77. So if the production is NT81 -> t77, then that's a terminal. Alternatively, looking in other lines, I see:\n\n- NT81 -> t72 (wait, no, looking through, I don't see that. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, let me make a better approach. I think I'm getting mixed up with the grammar lines. Let me list all NT symbols and their productions systematically.\n\n1. NT5 -> NT9 NT53\n2. NT5 -> NT53\n3. NT19 -> NT84 NT8\n4. NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n5. NT45 -> NT47 NT53\n6. NT72 -> NT10 NT44\n7.

{"custom_id":"request-764","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and make sure I understand each part.\n\nFirst, let's understand the grammar. CNF means that each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Or wait, no, is it exactly two? Actually, in CNF, each production can be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But wait, in some definitions, CNF only allows A \u2192 BC, meaning both options\u2014terminals or two non-terminals\u2014must be considered.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some of the productions end with a terminal, like NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, or some are more like A \u2192 BC. So, I think the grammar allows for mixed terminals in the right-hand side if a production can generate a terminal. But I might need to clarify this.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. So, if a production ends with a terminal, that would violate CNF. Hmm, but looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT5 \u2192 't25', which is a terminal. So perhaps the grammar isn't strictly in CNF? Or maybe my understanding is wrong. Oh, maybe I'm mixing up Chomsky Normal Form with other forms like Greibach Normal Form. Let me double-check the definitions.\n\nChomsky Normal Form requires each production to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal symbol. So, wait, that's slightly different. So the grammar could be using a form where some productions generate terminals, not just non-terminals. So in that case, the grammar could still be in CNF if each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nBut in this case, looking at the grammar, I see rules like S->NT45 NT81, which is two non-terminals, and other rules like NT5->'t25', which is a single terminal. So, yes, it seems the grammar is in CNF, allowing productions that produce a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t82 t83 t71 t26 t8 t26 t49 t83 t35 t76 t5 t3 t39 t25 t52 t11 t39 t82 t59 t26 t32 t71 t25 t30 t77 t11 t47 t49 t76 t59 t47 t28 t11`.\n\nWait, but that string is written as a single string with spaces, so each 't' followed by a number is a single token. So the string is a sequence of these tokens, which we can process.\n\nTo check if this string is generated by the grammar, we'll need to see if each symbol in the string (i.e., each 'tN') can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions in the grammar.\n\nSince this is a top-down parsing approach, but given the complexity, perhaps we can use the method of computing the parse tree in a bottom-up manner, using the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for CNF grammars. However, since I might not be familiar with all the details of the CYK algorithm, maybe I'll approach it another way.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split into a sequence of non-terminals that can be derived according to the grammar. Each terminal in the string must be derived from a production that starts with a non-terminal and ends with a terminal.\n\nLet me think about how the string is structured. The first symbol is t82. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT82 isn't present; instead, looking at the productions, what generates t82?\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT36: NT36 -> 't42', and NT81 -> 't30', but I don't see a production for NT82 or NT72 in the terminals. Wait, let me check. Scanning through the productions, the only terminals listed are t8, t19, t25, t26, t27, t3, t35, t36, t39, t40, t44, t45, t47, t49, t5, t52, t53, t59, t60, t67, t71, t72, t75, t76, t77, t81, t83, t84, t2, t5, t7, etc.\n\nSo, t82 isn't directly a terminal in any production. Hmm, so if the string contains t82, we must have a production that eventually produces t82. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't82'. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the productions again. The list goes up to NT75 and others, but I don't see any NT82. So perhaps t82 is not a terminal in this grammar. But the string has t82 as part of it, so unless the grammar can generate it, the string can't be part of the language.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the only way to get a 't' is from rules like NT5 \u2192 't25', NT13 \u2192 't47', etc. Since there's no production that derives 't82', the string cannot be generated. So the answer must be 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me make sure. Is there a way to derive 't82' from any combination? For example, perhaps a non-terminal that eventually produces a sequence ending with 't82'. Let me see.\n\nLooking through the productions, there's NT60 -> NT30 NT84, and NT30 -> 't82'. So NT30 can produce t82. But to get to NT30, we need a production that leads to NT30. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT30, the productions are:\n\nNT30 -> 't82' (from NT60->'t82'?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking through the grammar:\n\nNT30's productions are:\n\n- NT30 -> 't82' in the list? Wait, let me look.\n\nWait, the list provided includes:\n\n- NT30 -> 't82' (is that correct?)\n\nWait, in the given grammar, let me check again:\n\nNo, looking through the grammar string, I don't see any production for NT30 other than some:\n\nWait, the grammar seems to be in a long list. Let me try to find lines that mention NT30.\n\nLooking at the lines, I see:\n\n- NT30 -> 't82' is under NT19 -> NT60 NT77, but that leads to t82, t77.\n\nWait, no, let's look correctly.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n\"NT19 -> NT60 NT77\"\n\n\"NT45 -> NT60 NT77\"\n\n\"NT60 -> NT30 NT81\"\n\n\"NT90 something...

{"custom_id":"request-770","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t30 t76 t3 t30 t32 t3 t3 t47 t47 t26 t5 t22 t5 t47 t76 t5 t5 t14 t28 t47 t35 t39 t47 t49 t39 t22 t76 t5 t14 t33 t22 t84 t77 t35 t49 t35 t26 t35 t25 t82`.\n\nFirst, I should recall how the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) works. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a mix of production rules. Some seem to have two non-terminals on the right, and others have a terminal. But wait, in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So I need to check if all the productions fit.\n\nBut before that, maybe I can start with the given string and try to break it down.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t-terms: t30, t76, etc. So let's look at the possible terminals in the grammar. The terminals are 't' followed by numbers, and some non-terminals without arrows (like 't22', 't5'). Wait, no, the grammar's left-hand sides are all non-terminals, but the right-hand sides can have terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, the production rules can either produce two non-terminals, or a terminal. Since the string consists only of terminals, the derivation must end with productions that generate terminals.\n\nI'll try to work backwards from the string, trying to find possible last production steps.\n\nLooking for the last non-terminal that could produce the terminal part. The RHS could be a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLet's look for the end of the string: the last part is ... t39 t47 t49 t39. Hmm, let's make it more manageable by splitting the string into tokens.\n\nThe string has 55 tokens: [t30, t76, t3, t30, t32, t3, t3, t47, t47, t26, t5, t22, t5, t47, t76, t5, t5, t14, t28, t47, t35, t39, t47, t49, t39, t22, t76, t5, t14, t33, t22, t84, t77, t35, t49, t35, t26, t35, t25, t82].\n\nEach token is a terminal, so the derivation must end with terminals. So each terminal (like t30) must come from a production rule where the RHS is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the productions that produce terminals have 't's followed by numbers, or sometimes just 't' plus a number. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81, but NT45 \u2192 t60, etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the productions seem to end with 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT5 \u2192 t22. Or NT53 \u2192 t30, and so on.\n\nSo each terminal is generated by a production that ends with 't' plus some digits, or perhaps it's from a step where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, there are several production rules that produce terminals, such as:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t22\n- NT53 \u2192 t30\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT84 \u2192 t77\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT76 \u2192 t5\n- etc.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list all the productions that end with a terminal:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t22 (yes)\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT84 \u2192 t77\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT14 \u2192 t47\n- Wait, actually, some productions have a terminal in their RHS. For example, NT75 \u2192 t32. NT19 \u2192 t84 t8? Wait, no, no, looking again:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t22\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT84 \u2192 t77\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- Wait, no, some RHS have terminals. Let's go step by step.\n\nWait, for each production, if the RHS ends with only terminals, then it's a production that can produce a terminal string.\n\nBut actually, in the grammar as provided, many productions have two non-terminals on the RHS, meaning that they have to be expanded further before terminals can appear.\n\nSo, the derivation starts with S and works towards the terminals in the string.\n\nFirst production for S: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 OR S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nSo the string starts with either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t30.\n\nSo let's see what could produce t30.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT36 \u2192 t42 and a non-terminal, but I don't see an NT that directly produces t30. Wait, wait, looking into the productions:\n\nWait, for example, NT53 \u2192 t30. Yes, production: NT53 \u2192 t30.\n\nSimilarly, NT75 \u2192 t32.\n\nWait, let's check all the NT rules:\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t22\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT84 \u2192 t77\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT47 \u2192 t84 (Wait, but 47 on the LHS, RHS is t84?)\n\nWait, no, the productions are written as NTx \u2192 RHS.

{"custom_id":"request-785","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t47 t30 t13 t82 t71 t8 t13 t32 t35 t82 t33 t71 t35 t14 t30 t5 t52 t5 t83 t84 t47 t59 t26 t49 t42 t33 t47 t14 t35 t42 t28 t35 t32 t49 t30 t35 t5 t28 t84 t11 t11`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar here seems to consist of a bunch of rules with non-terminals leading to other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it's a sequence of terminals (like 't47', 't30', etc.). My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think about how strings are generated in such grammars. Usually, we'd start from the start symbol, S, and break down the string into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nThe initial grammar S can produce NT45 NT81. So, the first step is to split the string into parts that match these sequences.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first two tokens are t47 and t30. I need to see if these correspond to any of the productions. Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT47 -> t84 t47. Wait, that's not it. Let me check other rules. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps I should try to parse the string using the given grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use something like the CYK algorithm, but since I don't remember that exactly, I'll try to do it manually.\n\nStarting with the entire string, I need to see if it can be broken down into the grammar's productions. Let me list the entire string first:\n\nt47 t30 t13 t82 t71 t8 t13 t32 t35 t82 t33 t71 t35 t14 t30 t5 t52 t5 t83 t84 t47 t59 t26 t49 t42 t33 t47 t14 t35 t42 t28 t35 t32 t49 t30 t35 t5 t28 t84 t11 t11.\n\nI think the string is quite long, so it's better if I see if I can find substrings that match the start rules S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at the beginning tokens: t47 and t30. Looking at the rules:\n\nFrom the rules, NT45 can produce several things, one of which is 't44', but I don't see 't47' as a direct production from NT45. Wait, let's check:\n\nNT47 -> t84 t47. Wait, that doesn't help because it's a rule where NT47 produces t84 and t47. But the first token is t47, which would have to come from a production ending with t47, but looking through the rules, I don't think NT47 does that except this rule, which is circular.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's produced by another non-terminal. Wait, perhaps NT47 is derived from another non-terminal that eventually leads to it. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production is S -> NT45 NT81, so let's see what NT45 and NT81 produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT45 can produce:\n\n- NT60 NT77 (but then each of those might produce more non-terminals)\n- NT50 NT44\n- NT44 't25'\n- Others like NT27, but these seem to produce terminal or non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for sequences in the string that match these productions.\n\nFor example, looking at t47 t30, maybe NT45 produces t47 and NT81 produces t30. But looking at the grammar, NT81 can produce 't71' directly via the rule NT81 -> 't71', right?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, in NT81 there's a rule NT81 -> 't71', so if NT81 is t71, but the string has t30 after t47. Hmm, this doesn't seem to match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break down the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach: try to parse the string as per the grammar.\n\nLooking for a production where S splits into two parts each of which can produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me see the start S can produce either:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67.\n\nThe string starts with t47 t30. Let's see which production could lead to t47.\n\nLooking for NT45: One of NT45's rules is NT45 -> NT60 NT77, but both of those could produce further non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, NT45 could produce NT50 NT44, which then could be 't50' and 't44', but in the string, the first two are t47 and t30.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the possible terminals in the string and see if they can be linked to the start symbols.\n\nLooking through the string:\n\nt47, t30, t13, t82, t71, t8, t13, t32, t35, t82, t33, t71, t35, t14, t30, t5, t52, t5, t83, t84, t47, t59, t26, t49, t42, t33, t47, t14, t35, t42, t28, t35, t32, t49, t30, t35, t5, t28, t84, t11, t11.\n\nI notice that 't47' appears multiple times, as does 't30' and others. Maybe I should try to find a way that NT45 and NT81 can produce these combinations.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe the entire string can be split in such a way that each pair (splitting into two parts) corresponds to a production starting from S.\n\nSo, for example, the entire string is a sequence generated by S, which means that it must be split into two parts, each starting with some non-terminal.\n\nBut since the string is just a flat list of terminals, I need to see if the entire string can be generated by these rules.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for specific patterns.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT5, which can produce 't25' or 't26', etc. Similarly, NT36 can produce 't42' directly, which is another terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for some patterns in the string that might correspond to the rules.\n\nFor example, looking at 't84 t47' appearing in the string. I know that NT47 can produce 't84 t47', according to the rule NT47 -> 't84' 't47'. Wait, that's a rule! So if NT47 produces 't84' and 't47', that's a possible way.\n\nLooking at the string, I see 't84 t47' towards the end. Let me check:\n\nThe last part of the string is 't84 t47 t59 ...'? Wait, let me check:\n\nThe string ends with ... t84 t11 t11. Wait, no, looking again:\n\n... t84, t47, t59, ..., etc.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for 't84 t47' in the string. Let me count:\n\nLooking at positions: after 't5' and a few others, I see 't84' after 't47', which could be 't84 t47'.\n\nIf that's the case, then that part could come from NT47's production.\n\nBut how to get the rest of the string? This is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. I wonder if any of these options can lead to the tokens in the string.\n\nLooking for 't45' would be from NT45, but in the string, I don't see 't45' as a token. Similarly, 't19' is present in the string as 't19' when it's part of 't36' (look at the grammar, NT36 can produce 't42',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-792","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to check if it's generated by the grammar. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal, right? So, every non-terminal on the left, and two non-terminals on the right for the first case, and a terminal for the second. That structure should help in parsing.\n\nNow, the string I need to check is: `t5 t22 t47 t83 t52 t82 t5 t26 t47 t49 t25 t52 t32 t13 t3 t30 t52 t76 t11 t25 t84 t76 t49 t39 t32 t47 t83 t82 t52 t13 t77 t59 t8 t83 t25 t14 t77 t35 t83 t32 t8`.\n\nI think the first step is to see if the string can be broken down according to the productions in the grammar. Each non-terminal must expand into two non-terminals, except for the terminals which are the t's and numbers. Wait, no, the t's and numbers are terminals, right? So each production either is a single terminal (like A \u2192 t5) or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some of the right-hand sides have terminals like 't25', 't5', etc. So that means some non-terminals produce those terminals directly. So in the process, whenever we see a 't', it's an immediate terminal from one of the productions.\n\nSo, the string is made up of various 't's followed by numbers. I think I need to parse the string step by step, checking if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me see if I can map the string to the grammar. Maybe I can start with the entire string and see if it can be generated by any of the productions. But the string is quite long, so perhaps breaking it down could help.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to reconstruct the parse tree. Let's see. The starting symbol is S, which according to the grammar, can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nSo the string must start with either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t5 t22... Hmm. Let me check what NT45 and NT19 produce. Wait, the string starts with t5, which might be part of a production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals terminate into t's. Let's see, for example:\n\nNT45 \u2192 t60 t77 or NT45 \u2192 t25 (from NT45 -> t25 is a production? Wait, looking at the grammar, yes: NT45 -> t25. So if NT45 produces t25, then starting with t5 would come from where? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, S starts with NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's see what NT45 and NT81 produce.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT45 can produce:\n\n- NT60 NT77\n- t25\n\nSo, if NT45 \u2192 t25, that gives a terminal. Similarly, NT81 can produce:\n\n- NT30 NT52\n- NT27 NT47\n- NT9 NT45\n- NT45 NT53\n- t30\n- t71\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT81's productions, one is NT81 \u2192 t30, which is a terminal. Another is NT47 for NT45 and so on.\n\nSo the first part is NT45 producing t5? Wait, I'm looking at the first symbol being t5. But in the grammar, does NT45 produce t5? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT45 directly producing t5. Wait, let me search the given grammar for t5. Yes, I see:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 t25 (that's one production)\n- Also, looking through, I don't see t5 in any production except perhaps somewhere else. Wait, let me scan:\n\nI see NT47 \u2192 t84, NT84 \u2192 t77, etc. Hmm, not t5. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps the number 5 is part of a non-terminal. Let me check if any non-terminal expands into 5. Looking at the given productions, I see NT53 \u2192 t30, NT30 \u2192 t82, etc. Hmm, perhaps NT53 can go to t30, but I don't see 5 being a terminal elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe my approach is wrong. Perhaps each symbol in the string corresponds to a non-terminal or a terminal. So the string is a sequence of symbols, each of which must be either a terminal or a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nWait, but the terminals are the t's followed by numbers. So maybe the string is a series of terminals and non-terminals that expand.\n\nWait, the string starts with t5, which would correspond to some non-terminal producing t5. Let me check the grammar for any production where the right-hand side is t5. But in the given grammar, I don't see any production that results in t5. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the string is structured. Maybe each symbol is a non-terminal, and I'm supposed to expand them. But if the string includes t5, which is a terminal, then that indicates that the corresponding non-terminal must produce that terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each part of the string to see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to represent the string as a sequence and see if it can be broken down into the productions of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm, but that could be time-consuming. Since the grammar is in CNF, CYK might be a good approach.\n\nWait, let's structure the string tokens step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt5 t22 t47 t83 t52 t82 t5 t26 t47 t49 t25 t52 t32 t13 t3 t30 t52 t76 t11 t25 t84 t76 t49 t39 t32 t47 t83 t82 t52 t13 t77 t59 t8 t83 t25 t14 t77 t35 t83 t32 t8.\n\nSo, 37 symbols in total.\n\nGiven the grammar, let's see:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5. So, to get t5, we need a production that ends in t5. But in the given grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces t5. So either that's possible via some chain of productions, or the string starts with t5 which isn't possible in this grammar.\n\nWait, unless t5 is a part of a non-terminal that can expand into t5. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any production where the RHS results in t5. Therefore, it's impossible to derive t5 from any non-terminal in the grammar. So, the string cannot be generated because the first symbol, t5, cannot be produced by any rule in the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me go through all the non-terminals to see if any produce t5.\n\nLooking through all the RHS in the grammar:\n\n- I see NT53 \u2192 t30\n- NT45 \u2192 t25\n- But nothing starting with t5, t35, etc. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in reading. Let me check each production line.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nI see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\nNT45 \u2192 t25\nYes, so NT45 can produce t25. Similarly, NT53 \u2192 t30, etc.\n\nI don't see any production that ends with t5 as a terminal. So, the first symbol t5 can't be produced by any rule.

{"custom_id":"request-805","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for the start symbol, which might have terminals. Let me check that. The start symbol is S, and the productions for S both expand into two non-terminals, so that's correct. All other productions seem to either expand into two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, actually, looking back, for example, the production NT5 -> NT61 NT75 is in CNF since two non-terminals. Then there's a mix where sometimes we have a terminal, like S -> NT45 't25' or similar. So, the grammar allows for terminals on the right side of the productions, which is fine.\n\nNext, the target string we're checking is: `t47 t14 t49 t59 t42 t26 t14 t84 t42 t5 t33 t32 t84 t42 t28 t30 t30 t42 t30 t76 t39 t5 t77 t71 t33 t39 t8 t59 t84 t76 t33 t33 t77 t59 t30 t71 t14 t71 t59 t32 t77 t26`. It's a sequence of t-strings, which I assume correspond to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production produces two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. This suggests that the derivation tree is a binary tree, and the string's length should be 2^n -1, where n is the number of non-terminals in the starting production. Wait, but our grammar might have different starting productions, so I need to check the productions for S.\n\nLooking again, the start symbol S has two productions: S -> NT45 NT81 and S -> NT19 NT67. So the leftmost derivation would expand S into these two parts, each of which might further expand. The string we're given is a concatenation of these terminal symbols, and I need to see if it can be formed by such a derivation.\n\nOne approach is to simulate a top-down or bottom-up parsing. Since it's CNF, a recursive descent parser or even an automaton-based approach (like using parsers for CNF grammars) might be applicable. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string by breaking it down into possible non-terminals and see if it matches.\n\nLet me think about the start symbol S. It can derive NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Each of these NTs (non-terminals) will produce more non-terminals or terminals. So the string should be a sequence of terminals, each of which is generated by some NT in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a long sequence starting with 't47', then 't14', etc. I need to find possible ways that these t's come from the grammar. Each 't' is a terminal, so each corresponds to a production where a terminal appears on the RHS. For example, some NT produce a terminal directly, like NT45 -> 't25' or NT77 -> 't8'.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to build a parse tree for the string. Each node in the tree would be an NT, with children being either NTs or terminals. But since it's CNF, each parent has exactly two children, either both NTs or one NT and a terminal, but wait, no\u2014in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals. So, wait, the grammars are such that each production has two non-terminals. However, the problem here is that the RHS of a production can have a terminal, like S -> NT5 't25' or similar. Wait no, actually, in CNF, the productions are strictly A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. There are no terminals in the RHS. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, the productions can also have a terminal in the RHS, but the rule is that any production must consist of exactly two non-terminals. So, perhaps in this grammar, it's a mix where some productions are A-> BC, and others are A-> Bt or A-> tB, but I don't see any in this grammar. Wait, looking at the grammar, all the productions are in the form of two non-terminals on the RHS. For example, NT45 -> NT60 NT77, or some have a non-terminal and then a terminal? Wait, looking again: The production for NT5 is NT61 NT75, which are both non-terminals. The production for NT0 is NT47 NT53, again both non-terminals. Similarly, NT12 is NT40 NT13, and others like that.\n\nWait, in the problem, some productions might have two non-terminals, but in the string, we have some 't's, which indicate terminals. But if all productions are in the form of two non-terminals, then how do we get terminals in the string? Oh, unless the grammar actually has production rules where a non-terminal can produce a non-terminal and a terminal, but in our case, looking at the grammar provided, all productions are of the form NT X -> NT Y NT Z, so no production generates a non-terminal and a terminal directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check the grammar again. For example, the line \"NT45 -> NT60 NT77\" is correct. What about \"NT53 -> t30\"? Wait, looking at the grammar, some lines have '...' but maybe in the problem some lines might end with a t-string. Let me make sure. Looking through the grammar, I see lines like NT75 -> 't32', so for example, if a non-terminal NT75 directly produces a terminal 't32', then that's possible.\n\nWait, that's correct! So for example, NT75 -> 't32' is a production. So in the grammar, some non-terminals produce a terminal directly. So, when a NT can either produce a terminal or two non-terminals. So in the grammar, it's not that all productions are two non-terminals on the RHS. Some can have a single non-terminal in the RHS along with a terminal? Wait no, no. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A->BC, with B and C being non-terminals. But the presence of terminals in the RHS can still happen because a derivation can proceed by mixing NT and terminal productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is given in a way that some productions have a terminal on one side and two non-terminals elsewhere.\n\nWait, no, that's not possible. Chomsky Normal Form requires two non-terminals in each production to the right of the arrow. So, perhaps the confusion arises because in the problem statement, some of the lines are like NT19 -> 't84' which would be A->Bt, but in reality, that's not allowed in CNF. Hmm, no, maybe the problem statement allows non-terminals to have productions that produce a terminal. But from the problem statement, I'm seeing lines like \"NT53 -> 't30'\", which suggests that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nTherefore, this grammar is not in pure CNF; instead, it's in Extended Chomsky Normal Form because some productions are A-> tB or A-> Bt, allowing terminals on the RHS.\n\nSo, the grammar is a context-free grammar, but not necessarily in CNF, which might make it more complex. Wait, but the initial statement says that the grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). So perhaps the confusion is unwarranted.\n\nWait, let me re-express the structure. In CNF, each production is either A->BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or if the grammar allows, A-> a, where 'a' is a terminal. But sometimes, people define CNF with only two non-terminals, but for unit productions, which might be allowed in some definitions.\n\nWait, but in CNF, I think the rule is that each production must be of the form A \u2192 BC, with B and C being non-terminals. If that's the case, then the presence of a production that produces a terminal would violate CNF, which suggests that somehow the problem's grammar might not be in CNF, which contradicts the initial assertion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me move forward. The key point is that if the grammar is in CNF, then each production either has two non-terminals or a single symbol, but in the problem, the given grammar seems to have productions in the form of two non-terminals on the RHS, except for those with a terminal, which suggests that the grammar isn't in CNF.

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, right?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see S has two productions: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So every string generated starts with combinations of these non-terminals, which eventually break down into terminals. The string to evaluate starts with 't13', so I need to see if it can derive from one of the productions.\n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals and their productions because understanding them is key. NT45 can produce t25 or break down further, NT40 can go to 't39', and so on. Each non-terminal seems to either produce a terminal or another pair of non-terminals. \n\nSince the string starts with 't13', I need to find which non-terminals can directly produce 't13'. Looking through the rules, I see NT13 \u2192 't47', but that's not helpful. Wait, checking other non-terminals... Oh, wait, there's NT12 \u2192 't3', which isn't helpful. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all non-terminals for direct terminal productions.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I notice NT13 isn't directly a terminal; it's a non-terminal. So maybe the string starts with a production that leads to 't13'. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built step by step from the grammar. \n\nLet me consider how the string is structured. It goes like this:\n\nt13 t33 t22 t8 t42 t28 t8 t33 t26 t84 t11 t3 t28 t82 t83 t5 t26 t13 t76 t49 t35 t39 t35 t22 t42 t5 t47 t30 t76 t76 t32 t25 t25 t11 t5 t3 t5 t76 t35 t28 t59 t33.\n\nI notice that t13 appears a few times early on and later. Maybe the start symbol can generate t13 through some chain. Wait, earlier I thought about NT13, but looking back, in the grammar, it's actually that NT13 can go to 't47'? Or maybe I misread. Wait, no, the grammar shows NT13 \u2192 NT75 NT44 and also NT13 -> 't47'? Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nWait, no, looking through the list, for NT13, I see NT13 -> 't47' is incorrect. Wait, let me look. The given rules include NT13 -> NT75 NT44 and also NT13 -> 't47' under NT36? Wait no, actually, in the list, I don't see NT13 \u2192 't47'; it's NT9 -> 't45'? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me verify.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided:\n\nNT13: -> t47? Let me check: yes, the list includes \"NT9 -> 't45'\", but no direct for NT13. Wait, in the string, it's 't13', so perhaps NT13 is not a terminal but can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, I need to check if any non-terminal directly produces 't13'. Looking through the rules, does any rule have 't13'? Scanning all, I see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 NT75 NT44\n- NT27 \u2192 't35' but that's t35\n- NT36 \u2192 't42', etc.\nWait, no rule that directly produces 't13'. Hmm, so maybe the string t13 can't be directly derived because there's no non-terminal that produces 't13' directly. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a rule. Let me look again through the production rules provided. The list is quite long, so perhaps I missed 't13'. Let me go through each line:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT45 \u2192 't25' (Wait, no, 't25' is the terminal for NT45. But the string is 't13', which isn't present.\n\nWait, actually, no rule in the grammar produces 't13'. That's a problem because the string starts with 't13', but none of the non-terminals directly produce it. So, does that mean the string is not possible?\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's possible to derive 't13' through a series of productions. For example, maybe some non-terminals can break down further into a mix that includes 't13'. Let me think about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check the production for NT13 again. Looking through the provided rules, I don't see NT13 as a terminal. So NT13 must be a non-terminal that can produce other non-terminals. So, can any derivation path lead to t13?\n\nWait, maybe it's the other way around. The string is a sequence of terminals built from the grammar. So, the first step is to see which non-terminals can produce a 't13' as part of their derivation.\n\nWait, but from my initial check, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't13'. So perhaps the answer is 'No', but I might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo or I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me double-check: looking at the production rules, I don't see any rule that has 't13' as a terminal. So, the non-terminal NT13 can't produce 't13' directly. Therefore, the only way to get 't13' is through a non-terminal that can eventually produce it. Hmm.\n\nLooking through the productions, does any rule break down into 't13' through a chain? For example, can a non-terminal that eventually leads to 't13' be part of the string? Alternatively, maybe 't13' can be part of a longer chain. \n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the string to be evaluated isn't directly generated by the start symbol's expansion but is a part of it. But in this case, the string starts with 't13', so the initial derivation must include that. Therefore, if the grammar can't produce 't13' as the first terminal, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I overlooked something. Let me consider if any production leads to 't13' via multiple steps. For example, is there a chain of productions that ends in 't13'?\n\nLooking again at the non-terminals, I see NT45, which can produce t25 or NT60 NT77. Then NT60 breaks into t84 and NT30, and so on. But none of these seem to directly lead to 't13'. Similarly, NT13 breaks down into NT75 NT44. NT75 can produce t32 or NT72 NT5. NT72 can go to t10 or NT44 NT44, etc. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the string starts with t13, which is a terminal, but the production that leads to t13 has to be via a chain of non-terminals. Wait, but none of the non-terminals produce 't13' directly. So perhaps the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but let me check again for any possible rules that might produce 't13'. Checking the grammar rules again, I don't see any rule that ends with 't13'. So, if the string starts with 't13', which can't be produced directly, the answer must be 'No'.\n\nWait, unless there's a chain where a non-terminal can produce an expansion that includes 't13' as an option. For example, maybe NT13 can produce a non-terminal that can produce either another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at all the rules, NT13 only produces NT75 NT44. There's no option for NT13 to produce anything else. So, NT13 can't directly produce t13. Therefore, the string can't start with t13 because there's no production that does that.\n\nSo, based on this, the string cannot be generated by the grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is useful because every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll note that the string to check is `t35 t82 t11 t30 t13 t52 t14 t33 t25 t11 t39 t14 t52 t8 t33 t59 t14 t8 t14 t28 t33 t8 t8 t22 t26 t3 t71 t25 t76 t22 t42 t8 t13 t52 t25 t35 t22 t77 t25 t25 t71 t33 t83`. That's a pretty long string, 50 tokens of terminals. \n\nThe grammar has non-terminals S, NT5, NT19, etc., and terminals like 't25'. Each production rule is of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal. \n\nSo, the plan is to parse the string from top-down, starting from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser approach, where each step involves checking if the current string can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nLet me break down the grammar rules:\n\n- S can be NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n- NT5 can be NT61 NT75 or NT47 NT53 etc. There's a lot of non-terminals, so I'll need to track them.\n\nI think the first step is to choose an initial production. Let's say we start with S -> NT45 NT81. So, we need to parse the string as NT45 followed by NT81.\n\nLooking at the string, the first term is t35. Now, in the grammar, NT35 is part of NT23 production: NT23 -> NT61 NT74. But wait, the string starts at t35, so is there a rule that outputs t35 directly? Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT22 -> t22, NT23 -> t25, etc. Let me check each production.\n\nWait, the rules in the grammar are as follows:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see several terminals like t5, t71, etc.\n\nFirst, I'm seeing that the string starts with `t35`. So, is there a production where a non-terminal produces t35? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> t35 (since it says NT27 -> 't35'). Wait, no: Looking at the given grammar, under NT27 it's 't27'? Wait, no, let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, under each NT has a production. For example:\n\nNT27 -> NT60 NT47\nNT22 -> NT42\nBTW: looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT27 -> t35 (Yes, looking at the given grammar, under NT27: 't27'? Wait, no.

Looking at the grammar, under NT27: the productions are NT60 NT47 and 't76'. So, 't76' is one terminal. But I'm trying to parse the first token which is t35. So I'm looking for a production that starts with NT35. But in the grammar, is there any non-terminal NT that can generate t35? Looking through the grammar rules, under each NT, only some of them have terminal outputs. For example:\n\n- NT27 has t76 as a production.\n\n- NT22 has t22 as a production.\n\n- NT75 has t75? No, looking at the grammar, NT75 is NT23 NT45, which is a production of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me look carefully. Under NT27: 't76'? No, that's not correct. Oh wait, in the grammar provided, under NT27, it has a production that includes t35. Let me see:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, the only explicit terminal is t5, t71, etc. Wait, perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, under NT27, I see:\n\nNT27 -> NT60 NT47\nNT27 -> t76?\n\nWait, looking back, the line is: NT27 -> NT60 NT47 | t76? Or perhaps it's another production. I'm a bit confused. Let me look again:\n\nIn the user's grammar list, NT27's production is:\n\nNT27 -> NT60 NT47 | t76\n\nIs that correct? Yes, because the line is \"NT27 -> t35\".\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nThe user's grammar under NT27 says: NT27 -> t35? Let me check the exact line:\n\nLooking through the entire list, under NT27, the production is:\n\nNT27 -> t35\n\nWait, that can't be right because the grammar is in CNF. In CNF, every production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, a production that starts with t35 would be a single terminal production, which would violate CNF. Wait, that can't be. Wait, the user's grammar seems to have some production that have terminals as the first option, which would not be allowed in CNF.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting lines. Let me check:\n\nThe grammar has a line NT27 -> t76. No, no, in the list, the grammar is:\n\nLooking at the lines, under NT27: It's \"NT27 -> NT60 NT47\" and \"NT22 -> t76\".\n\nWait, no: looking again, the user's grammar list is:\n\nNT27 -> NT60 NT47\nNT22 -> t22\n...\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, to clarify, I think I made a mistake earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-824","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left or a single terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the string: `t13 t25 t8 t25 t77 t8 t26 t32 t83 t26 t35 t28 t13 t76 t47 t33 t30 t59 t26 t33 t26 t49 t11 t33 t33 t13 t47 t5 t11 t59 t26 t84 t49 t32 t59 t52 t30 t14 t26 t22 t30 t82 t14`. It's a series of tokens, and I need to see if they form a derivation starting from S and ending up with this string.\n\nThe grammar's rules are quite extensive. I'll note that some non-terminals expand into terminals, which are indicated by the presence of 't' followed by a number or by a non-terminal. Since many rules end with another non-terminal, I'll need to see how these terms are combined.\n\nStarting from S, the grammar has two options: S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider S -> NT45 NT81. NT45 can expand into 't60' or 't44'. Wait, looking at the rules, NT45 -> NT60 NT77 or NT40 NT44. Hmm, actually, in the provided grammar, NT45's rules include NT60 NT77 and NT40 NT44. But when I check, I see NT45 -> NT60 NT77, NT45 -> NT50 NT44. Oh, wait, no. Let me list all NT45 rules.\n\nLooking again: NT45 -> NT60 NT77, NT45 -> NT50 NT44. Also, from other lines, \"S -> NT45 NT81\" and I see NT45 can produce more. So, yes, NT45 can produce a terminal either via NT60 NT77 or other combinations.\n\nBut wait, the first step would be to expand NT45 and NT81. Let's see NT45's possibilities:\n\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n- NT45 -> NT50 NT44\n\nBut NT45 can also appear as 't45' in some cases, but looking at the rules, perhaps not directly. Wait, in the rules provided, I see \"NT45 -> 't25'\", but wait, let me check again: the user provided the grammar, and under NT45, it's written as:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT45 -> NT50 NT44\nAlso, further down, I see \"NT45 -> 't25'\". No, wait, looking carefully, under the NT45 rule, there's a line that says \"NT45 -> 't25'\". So that means NT45 can produce the terminal 't25'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other NT rules that produce terminals.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't13'. So if the start is S -> NT19 NT67, then NT19 and NT67 must produce 't13' and the rest of the string.\n\nLet me check what NT19 and NT67 produce.\n\nLooking for NT19: From the grammar, NT19 has two rules:\n\n1. NT19 -> NT84 NT8\n2. NT19 -> NT60 NT5\n\nNow, let's see if these can produce terminals. Let's look at NT84: under NT84, we see \"NT84 -> 't77'\". So NT84 can produce 't77'.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 can produce 't83' as per the rule \"NT8 -> 't83'\".\n\nWait, let's look:\n\n- NT8's production: \"NT8 -> 't83'\"\n\nSo, NT84 -> 't77'\n\nNT8 -> 't83'\n\nSo NT19's rules can produce either a combination leading to t77 t83 or another combination.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFrom NT19, first rule: NT19 -> NT84 NT8. So NT84 -> 't77' and NT8 -> 't83', so this would produce 't77 t83'.\n\nSecond rule: NT19 -> NT60 NT5. Now, NT60 -> 't84' (from \"NT60 -> 't84'\"), and NT5 can produce 't25' (from \"NT5 -> 't25'\"), so this rule would produce 't84 t25'.\n\nBut our string starts with 't13', not 't77 t83' or 't84 t25', so S -> NT19 NT67 might not be the path.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider S -> NT45 NT81.\n\nNT45 can produce 't25' (since \"NT45 -> 't25'\"), and NT81 can produce 't30' (from \"NT81 -> 't30'\").\n\nWait, let me check NT81: From the grammar, I see NT81 has two rules:\n\n1. NT81 -> 't30'\n2. NT81 -> NT36 NT81\n\nSo NT81 can directly produce 't30' or via NT36 NT81. But our string starts with 't13', so that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check: the string starts with 't13'. So starting from S, let's see what each production gives.\n\nIf S -> NT45 NT81, and NT45 can produce 't25' and NT81 can produce 't30', that would give 't25 t30' as the first two tokens. But the string starts with 't13 t25...', so that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, if S -> NT19 NT67, then NT19's first rule is 't77 t83', which gives 't77 t83', not 't13' as the first token.\n\nWait, so maybe neither of these initial paths are correct. Perhaps I have to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the other possibilities for NT19 and NT67.\n\nLet me check NT67. From the grammar, NT67 has two rules:\n\n1. NT67 -> 't30' (from \"NT67 -> 't30'\"), and\n2. NT67 -> NT30 NT2 (from \"NT67 -> NT30 NT2\").\n\nNT30 -> 't82' (from \"NT30 -> 't82'\"), and NT2 can produce 't5' (from \"NT2 -> 't5'\").\n\nSo NT67 can produce 't30' directly or 't82 t5'. Our first token is 't13', so neither seems to match.\n\nHmm, so neither of the initial productions from S seem to start with 't13'. Maybe I made an error in looking at the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way to get 't13'. Let me check other NT rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT13 -> 't47' (from \"NT13 -> 't47'\")\n\n- NT19 -> 't25' (from \"NT19 -> 't25'\")\n\n- NT22 -> 't22' (from \"NT22 -> 't22'\")\n\n- NT25 -> 't33' (from \"NT25 -> 't33'\")\n\n- NT33 -> 't33' (from \"NT33 -> 't33'\")\n\n- NT35 -> 't28' (from \"NT35 -> 't28'\")\n\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n\n- NT45 -> 't25'\n\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n\n- NT59 -> 't49'\n\n- NT67 -> 't30'\n\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n\n- NT81 -> 't30'\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n\n- NT14 -> 't26'\n\nWait, in the given string, the first token is 't13"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure is useful because it simplifies parsing, often used in algorithms like the CYK algorithm for efficiency. \n\nThe given grammar has several rules. For example, the initial symbol is S, which can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67, and so on. Each of these non-terminals on the left-hand side of the rules eventually leads to some terminal symbols or more non-terminals. \n\nThe string I'm supposed to check is `t30 t13 t8 t8 t13 t42 t76 t76 t39 t49 t71 t30 t39 t84 t59 t47 t14 t83 t22 t3 t13 t49 t83 t13 t82 t33 t35 t82 t71 t28 t84 t83 t35 t13 t14 t32 t71 t83 t76 t28 t39 t42 t5 t82`.\n\nSo the goal is to figure out if this string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since CNF is a specific form, each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal. But in this case, looking at the grammar, the rules are only two types: either a single terminal (like 't30', 't8') or combinations like NT5 -> NT61 NT75, etc.\n\nWait, no, looking closer, all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or, in some cases, a mix of NT and terminals? Wait, no. In the given grammar, some rules produce a terminal, like NT45 \u2192 't25', or some produce just a terminal string, like 't8' or 't71'. So some rules directly produce terminals, which means the grammar is not just CNF but can have productions that produce terminals directly. \n\nWait, actually, in CNF, productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So yes, in this case, some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal, like NT45 \u2192 't25' or NT77 \u2192 't8'. So the grammar is a standard CNF, allowing for single terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nSo, each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol, which can be derived from the grammar by breaking down the string into the needed components.\n\nSince the string is quite long, I might need to break it down step by step. Maybe I can approach this by looking for sequences that match the grammar's production rules.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nThe string is `t30 t13 t8 t8 t13 t42 t76 t76 t39 t49 t71 t30 t39 t84 t59 t47 t14 t83 t22 t3 t13 t49 t83 t13 t82 t33 t35 t82 t71 t28 t84 t83 t35 t13 t14 t32 t71 t83 t76 t28 t39 t42 t5 t82`.\n\nI can split it into tokens for clarity: [t30, t13, t8, t8, t13, t42, t76, t76, t39, t49, t71, t30, t39, t84, t59, t47, t14, t83, t22, t3, t13, t49, t83, t13, t82, t33, t35, t82, t71, t28, t84, t83, t35, t13, t14, t32, t71, t83, t76, t28, t39, t42, t5, t82].\n\nTo parse this string, I might start from the start symbol, which is S. Looking at the first production of S: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Both of these produce two non-terminals that, when expanded, should result in the first two tokens, which are t30 and t13.\n\nSo for the first option, if I choose S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then NT45 should produce t30 and NT81 should produce t13. Looking at the grammar, does NT45 produce t30? Let's see: looking for NT rules that have t30. Yes, looking through the rules, I see NT30 \u2192 't82' but wait, that's a non-terminal producing a terminal. Wait, actually, I'm looking for NTs that directly produce t30 or t13.\n\nLooking for t30: Checking the rules for terminals, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t30 except when it's written. Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't71' (from NT81 \u2192 't30' ... No, wait, looking back, some of the rules end with 'tX' where X is a number. Wait, I need to look more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, NT81 has a rule: NT81 \u2192 't30', but actually, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nWait, let's look again:\n\n- NT80 \u2192 NT47 NT53\n- NT81 \u2192 't77' ?

Wait, looking at the grammar, all the rules have exactly two non-terminals except the first two rules:\n\n- S -> NT45 NT81\n- S -> NT19 NT67\n\nSo that's correct for CNF, which allows S (the start symbol) to produce two non-terminals. The rest of the rules are non-terminals expanding into two non-terminals each, except some like NT45 -> 't25' and others that expand into a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals? Wait, no\u2014looking at the rules, some have two non-terminals, like NT45 -> NT60 NT77, others have one terminal and a non-terminal, like NT45 -> 't25'. Wait, no, that's not CNF. In CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals, because in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, hold on. The grammar provided seems to have some productions that have a terminal on one side, which would not be in CNF. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me double-check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example:\n\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n- NT27 -> 't42'\n\nWait, no. Some productions expand into two non-terminals, others into a terminal. That can't be CNF. Wait, maybe in the grammar provided, some non-terminals are expanded into a terminal, which would affect how the string is generated. So perhaps the grammar includes both two non-terminals and terminals as possible expansions.\n\nWait, let me check another example. For instance:\n\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT53\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n\nYes, so some rules result in a terminal. So the grammar might not be in proper CNF, because CNF requires all productions except the start symbol to expand into terminals in two steps, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, regardless, I need to parse the string given against this grammar.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals, each being a 't' followed by a number. For example, the string starts with 't47', followed by 't35', etc. The grammar's terminals are either single letters 't' followed by numbers, like 't25', and others like 't3', 't22', etc.\n\nSo I need to see if the given string can be derived by the grammar. But parsing such a long string manually would be time-consuming. Perhaps I can find the parse tree step by step, but considering the complexity, maybe I can look for patterns or see if any production rules in the grammar produce parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can break down the string into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules and see if the sequence is possible.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is provided, perhaps I can model it as a parse tree and check if the string can be generated. Let me see how the grammar works.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, it can produce two options: NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So any string generated by the grammar must start with two non-terminals whose expansions correspond to these.\n\nWait, no, the start symbol is S, so the entire string is generated from S, but since S has two options, the string must consist of the expansion of either S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So the string must start with NT45's expansion followed by NT81's expansion, or NT19's followed by NT67's.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar's rules for S:\n\nS can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the string starts with two parts: whatever NT45 produces, followed by whatever NT81 produces, or whatever NT19 produces followed by NT67's production.\n\nSo our first step is to see whether both options for S can lead to the given string. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT45 NT81. So the string must be the concatenation of NT45's expansion and NT81's expansion. Let's look at the given string:\n\nt47 t35 t83 t3 t76 t26 t52 t82 t47 t25 t84 t5 t33 t28 t3 t39 t47 t49 t35 t14 t49 t77 t32 t30 t25 t39 t47 t11 t26 t25 t25 t30 t49 t84 t33 t13 t84 t49 t76 t59 t25 t49 t22 t83 t82\n\nSo let me write it as a list of terminals:\n\n1. t47\n2. t35\n3. t83\n4. t3\n5. t76\n6. t26\n7. t52\n8. t82\n9. t47\n10. t25\n11. t84\n12. t5\n13. t33\n14. t28\n15. t3\n16. t39\n17. t47\n18. t49\n19. t35\n20. t14\n21. t49\n22. t77\n23. t32\n24. t30\n25. t25\n26. t39\n27. t47\n28. t11\n29. t26\n30. t25\n31. t25\n32. t30\n33. t49\n34. t84\n35. t33\n36. t13\n37. t84\n38. t49\n39. t76\n40. t59\n41. t25\n42. t49\n43. t22\n44. t83\n45. t82\n\nNow, for S \u2192 NT45 NT81, we need the string to be NT45's output followed by NT81's output.

{"custom_id":"request-867","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which makes it a bit easier to parse because each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left. \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar rules and see how the strings can be formed. The string to evaluate is: `t8 t39 t28 t8 t13 t13 t25 t52 t83 t25 t71 t71 t77 t47 t59 t49 t59 t8 t39 t59 t49 t22 t8 t11 t49 t42 t32 t84 t3 t39 t77 t76 t76 t42 t59 t14 t39 t25 t8 t3 t3 t25 t59 t14 t32`\n\nEach rule in the grammar is either S -> NT1...NTN or N -> NT1...NTN, where each NT is a non-terminal. Looking at the end of the string, it consists of several 't' followed by numbers. Some of these 't' are single letters, like t8, t39, etc., which should correspond to the terminals in the grammar, perhaps the right-hand sides (RHS) of some productions.\n\nI notice that many non-terminals have productions that produce two non-terminals, and some have productions that produce a terminal followed by another non-terminal or two terminals. For example, NT5 is defined as NT9 NT53, which may then resolve to terminals.\n\nI think a recursive approach might help here. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a dynamic programming approach like CYK would work. But since I'm just evaluating, I can try to break down the string step by step.\n\nLet me start from the beginning of the string: t8. I need to see if this can be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar. Looking at the rules, I see NT5 -> t25, but that's not t8. Wait, no, NT9 can sometimes produce a terminal. Let's check the rules for NT36, which has two options: NT84 NT53 or NT50 NT36. But that gives non-terminals again. Maybe NT9 has a production that leads to a t.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar has NT9 -> t26 and also NT9 -> t22. Hmm, but t26 and t22 are part of the terminals. For example, looking at the rules, NT36 -> t42, which is a single terminal, or other combinations. Wait, perhaps each terminal in the string corresponds to a production that leads directly to that terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some non-terminals have productions that include a terminal. For example, NT84 -> t77, and so on. So each terminal in the string must be generated by a production that eventually leads to it.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work backwards. I'll start with the entire string and see if it can be split into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nThe first part is t8. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t8? Looking through the RHS, I see NT10 -> NT50 NT47, but that's non-terminals. There's also NT53 -> t30, which is another terminal, but that's not t8. Wait, looking through all the rules, let me see if any rule's RHS includes t8.\n\nLooking at NT47 -> t84, which is t84, not t8. Hmm, looking through the rules, I have to check each production for terminals. \n\nWait, in the rules for NT27, I see NT27 -> t35, which is a terminal but not t8. Let me check all possible productions for each non-terminal that might end up in a t8.\n\nLooking through the rules, I realize that perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe each t in the string corresponds to a specific non-terminal that can derive into that t. For instance, NT19 -> NT84 NT8 and also may produce a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at NT19: it has two rules. One is S -> NT19 NT67, but I'm looking at individual non-terminals. Let me check NT19's productions:\n\nLooking back, I see NT19 -> NT84 NT8. So NT19 can produce non-terminals that may lead to terminals. For example, NT84 may produce t77, which is another terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to construct a table of what each non-terminal can produce in one step, then see how the string can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can list all the non-terminals and their possible RHS productions that produce terminals.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and see which RHS can produce a terminal:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- S: NT19 NT67 or NT45 NT81\n- NT5: NT61 NT75\n- NT0: NT47 NT53\n- NT12: NT40 NT13\n- NT74: NT72 NT5\n- NT36: nt84 nt53 or nt50 nt36\n- NT60: NT30 NT81\n- NT71: NT9 NT75\n- NT58: NT27 NT47\n- NT14: NT25 NT52\n- NT19: NT84 NT8 or other nt rules\nWait, no, looking at the specific NT19 rule: NT19 -> NT84 NT8. So NT19 can produce two non-terminals, not terminals. So that doesn't help directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of non-terminals that can produce a terminal directly, or via a chain.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT40: NT14 NT71\n- NT14: NT25 NT52\n- NT25: t33\nSo NT25 can produce t33, which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT71: NT9 NT75\n- NT9: NT36 NT45\n- NT36: t42 or other combinations. Wait, looking at NT36's rules: \n\nNT36 has two options:\n1. NT84 NT53\n2. NT50 NT36\n\nHmm, but none of these are terminals. So maybe NT36 can't produce a terminal directly. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, I see rules where the RHS might include more non-terminals leading to a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT36 can have multiple options, but some might eventually lead to terminals through their productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for non-terminals that have direct terminals in their RHS. For example:\n\n- NT84 -> t77\n- NT75 ->t32\n- NT53-> t30\n- NT44->t59\n- NT59->t49\n- NT27->t35\n- NT25->t33\n- NT67->t2\n- NT5->t9\n- NT71->nt52 (but NT52's rules: NT23 NT52? No, wait NT52 is defined as NT29 NT47? Wait, wait, looking at the rules, perhaps I'm mixing it up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a map of which non-terminals can directly produce a terminal and what they produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT74 ->NT72 NT5. Neither terminal yet. NT58->NT27 NT47. NT27->t35. So NT27 can produce a terminal. But then, the production NT27->t35 allows NT27 to derive 't35'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT58->NT27 NT47 can produce t35 followed by NT47's output.\n- NT36 has two options. The first option: NT84 and NT53. NT84 is a terminal. So NT84->t77, so that option can derive t77. The second option is NT50 and NT36. Not immediately terminal.\n\nWait, so NT84 can be a terminal, so any production that includes NT84 as a component can produce a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT75->t32. So that would produce a terminal.\n\nNT53->t30.\n\nNT72->NT10 NT44. NT10->NT50 NT47, which may produce terminals. Wait, NT50->NT49, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach this by building a lookup of all non-terminals and the terminals they can produce.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal:\n\n1. NT2: Not in any RHS, so doesn't produce a terminal.\n2. NT5: NT61 NT75; both non-terminals.\n3.

The grammar is quite extensive with non-terminals and rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier because the grammar is structured in a way that each production either directly produces a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: `t59 t35 t49 t14 t49 t8 t22 t33 t32 t52 t14 t77 t26 t33 t47 t25 t71 t47 t22 t33 t77 t59 t35 t30 t14 t3 t76 t13 t11 t8 t59 t35 t42 t11 t77 t39 t30 t28 t71 t25 t22 t71 t42 t52 t32 t42`.\n\nI notice that when the grammar uses the production rule, it's either directly producing a terminal symbol or two non-terminals. Since the string is a sequence of terminals (all lowercase letters like 't' followed by numbers), the task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nI'll start by looking for where the string begins with 't59'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT44 \u2192 t59 and NT52 \u2192 t71, but there's also NT45 \u2192 t60 and NT44 \u2192 t76. Wait, but in the provided grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 t60 NT77: Wait, that's not a terminal. Wait, no, actually, some rules directly have 't' as a terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the given grammar, some rules produce a terminal followed by another symbol. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking for any NT rule that has a production into 't' and another symbol:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT14 NT71\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7\n- Wait, some rules produce a terminal without another symbol. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT61 NT74\n- Wait, that's two non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me re-examine all the rules because some might have terminals:\n\nWait, the rules provided have lines like:\n\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT53\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n- NT44 -> NT83 NT7\n- And then there are lines like:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t39\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT30 \u2192 t82\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n- Wait, wait!

So, for instance, NT40 can directly produce the terminal 't39', NT47 \u2192 't84', etc.\n\nSo our task is to see if the given string can be derived by expanding non-terminals into these terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with 't59 t35 t49 t14 t49 t8 t22 t33 t32 t52 t14 t77 t26 t33 t47 t25 t71 t47 t22 t33 t77 t59 t35 t30 t14 t3 t76 t13 t11 t8 t59 t35 t42 t11 t77 t39 t30 t28 t71 t25 t22 t71 t42 t52 t32 t42'.\n\nI'll start by trying to match the beginning of the string.\n\nThe first token is 't59'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't59'? Let's check the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I can see that NT45 \u2192 t60 NT77, which involves 't60', and NT44 \u2192 t76. Hmm, maybe NT44? Or wait, let me check all rules that have 't' as a terminal.\n\nLooking for any production where the non-terminal is directly producing 't' followed by something else, or just 't' alone.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t39\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT30 \u2192 t82\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n\nWait, actually, in the rules, several non-terminals directly produce a terminal symbol, such as NT22 \u2192 t22, meaning it directly outputs 't22'. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 t26, so 't26'.\n\nLooking further, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT75 \u2192 t32\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is 't59', but none of the direct productions produce 't59'. That means that 't59' must come from a non-terminal that produces another non-terminal which eventually leads to 't59'. So, the first step is to find a non-terminal that can produce 't59' as part of a chain.\n\nLooking back, the rules that produce 't59' would need to come from a production that has 't59' in it. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules: I see NT53 \u2192 t30, but that's 't30'. NT36 \u2192 t42. NT13 \u2192 t47. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me parse the rules again carefully.\n\nLooking at the rule: NT44 \u2192 t76. Wait, that's 't76', not 't59'. So, maybe 't59' comes from a production like NT44 \u2192 t59? Let me check.\n\nLooking for a production where a non-terminal ends with generating 't59'. Scanning through all the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t39\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT30 \u2192 t82\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n- NT75 \u2192 t32\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT53 \u2192 t30\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT13 \u2192 t47\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce 't59'. Hmm, that could be a problem because that means 't59' must be produced by a chain of non-terminals. So, let's trace back from 't59' to see possible non-terminals that can produce it.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the other end, how 't59' can be produced. Maybe in a production like A \u2192 B t59, but I don't see any rules like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't59' is an output of some non-terminal that eventually reduces to it through other rules. Let's check the rules for non-terminals that can produce 't59' as part of their output.\n\nWait, perhaps considering that NT53 \u2192 t30. Hmm, that's 't30'. Not helpful. Or NT45 \u2192 t60 NT77, which eventually leads to 't60'.\n\nWait, looking back, the initial part of the string is t59. So, the first token is 't59', which suggests that the first step in the derivation must be a production that generates 't59', but according to the rules, no non-terminal I see directly produces 't59'. That seems like a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-891","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is quite long and consists of a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Each token is either a non-terminal or a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Importantly, each production only has two symbols on the right side. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing, but I don't know if that's relevant here since I need to check if a specific string is generated, not parse it.\n\nThe grammar provided has various productions. Let me list the important ones that might be relevant to the string. Some non-terminals like S, NT5, NT19, etc., lead directly to a terminal, which can be 't' followed by a number. Some non-terminals produce two other non-terminals. \n\nLet's look at the given string: `t71 t84 t47 t8 t52 t26 t32 t59 t77 t49 t30 t84 t42 t76 t71 t33 t5 t28 t13 t42 t49 t76 t84 t8 t5 t76 t28 t32 t8 t22 t84 t13 t30 t5 t71 t39 t42 t14 t30 t13 t47 t32 t77 t13 t22 t83`.\n\nEach token is either a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal or is a terminal. The strategy should be to see if starting from S, I can derive this string by applying productions step by step.\n\nFirst, let's see if the grammar can produce any of the 't' tokens. From the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n- NT13 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't11'\n- NT36 \u2192 't42'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT12 \u2192 't3'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT23 \u2192 't14'\n- NT50 \u2192 't49'\n- NT83 \u2192 't30'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n- NT71 \u2192 't52', 't76', etc.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols on the right. So each production in the grammar is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 B, where B and C are non-terminals. So, in the context of the given string, each token in the string must correspond to a single terminal or a non-terminal that can produce that terminal when derived through a chain of productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't71'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't71':\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't71' (Production: NT81 -> 't71')\n- NT52 \u2192 't71' (Production: NT52 -> 't71')\n- Also, looking at other non-terminals, for example, NT23 -> NT74, which in another production may lead to 't71' eventually.\n\nBut also, there's NT71 \u2192 't52' or 't76' (I think in the production list, NT71: NT72 \u2192 NT44, which isn't directly; wait, I need to double-check the grammar. Let me look through the productions:\n\nLooking back, I see that NT71 -> NT12 NT84 (from production: NT71 \u2192 NT12 NT84), which would then need to derive to 't71'. Also, NT12 -> 't3' (Productions: NT12 \u2192 't3').\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me get back.\n\nEach production in the grammar is given. So, I should consider which non-terminals can produce each terminal when derived through a chain.\n\nFor example, 't71' can be produced directly by NT81 and NT52.\n\nLooking further, let's check if 't71' can be part of a larger string. Since each production is in CNF, the string given is a sequence of terminals, so it must be a result of applying productions that ultimately lead to terminals. So each step in the derivation must replace non-terminals with terminals or pairs of non-terminals, but since the string is fully terminal, the derivation must have completely reduced all non-terminals.\n\nWait, but to generate the given string, each step must not leave any non-terminals, as it ends in fully terminal symbols. So the string provided must be the result of starting at S and expanding all non-terminals to terminals through the productions.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of 35 tokens (including the initial letters). Let's count the given tokens:\n\nBreaking down the string:\n\nt71, t84, t47, t8, t52, t26, t32, t59, t77, t49, t30, t84, t42, t76, t71, t33, t5, t28, t13, t42, t49, t76, t84, t8, t5, t76, t28, t32, t8, t22, t84, t13, t30, t5, t71, t39, t42, t14, t30, t13, t47, t32, t77, t13, t22, t83.\n\nWait, maybe I should count them accurately.

Hmm. So the user might have miscounted, but the user wrote 46 tokens.\n\nBut regardless, I need to see if the given string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst step: Check what the start symbol S can produce. Looking at the grammar, S can produce:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 NT81\nS \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo both options start with two non-terminals. Either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst case: S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nThen, NT45 can produce 't25' (from NT45 \u2192 't25') or, other productions? Checking NT45 productions: it also appears in other productions, such as NT53 \u2192 't30', but wait, NT45 has a production NT45 \u2192 't25' (line NT45 -> 't25').

Hmm, let's see. The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces: 't71 t83 t71 ...' etc. Each of these could be either a terminal or a non-terminal symbol, since some start with 't'.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar rules. The grammar is in CNF, meaning all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All the rules here are like that.\n\nMy plan is to work backwards from the string, trying to parse it step by step using the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-906","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's see, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the given grammar seems to be in CNF because all the productions either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t26 t14 t32 t76 t13 t26 t76 t30 t83 t35 t13 t14 t5 t49 t83 t49 t30 t49 t30 t3 t11 t32 t71 t28 t11 t11 t39 t11 t42 t33 t5 t22 t39 t13 t83 t13 t22 t77 t52 t77 t5 t83 t71 t25 t39 t25 t39`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminals, so each token in the string must be produced by some rule in the grammar. My task is to check if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of the string. It starts with t26, which I see is produced by NT9 -> 't26'. So, the first step is that S must derive a production that starts with NT9. Looking back at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Neither of these starts with NT9, so I must have gone wrong somewhere.\n\nWait, no. The first production from S is NT45 followed by NT81, which would produce the first two components of the string. Let me see if the string starts with t26, which is from NT9. But looking at the grammar, NT9 has two productions: one to 't26' and another to 't22'. So, maybe the first part of the string is not directly from S's first production because NT45 is involved, which leads to t26. Hmm, this seems a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of trees. Let's see, the string is a flat sequence of terminals, so it's a linear sequence, and each step in the derivation should produce a part of the string. But in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, so the derivation would involve expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree that consumes the entire string step by step, using the productions. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. S has two productions: NT45 NT81 and NT19 NT67. Let me pick the first one: NT45 followed by NT81. Now, I need to check if the string starts with the terminal symbols produced by NT45 and NT81.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions, it can derive 't44' via NT44 -> 't44' or via other paths. But the first symbol in the string is t26, which is from NT9. So, this doesn't match. Maybe the other production for S: NT19 NT67. Let's see, NT19's productions include t84 and other terminals, but the first symbol is t26, so that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is the concatenation of the terminal symbols derived by the non-terminals. So, for example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81 would mean that NT45 produces some terminals, followed by NT81 producing more terminals. So, the entire string should be the concatenation of the derivations of NT45 and NT81.\n\nSo, first, let's see what the first part of the string is. The first symbols are t26 t14 t32 t76 t13 ... up to t39 t25 t39.\n\nBut the start symbol S has two options: NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. We need to see which of these can be matched by the start of the string.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is t26, which comes from NT9. Neither production from S starts with NT9, so that suggests that maybe the start symbol's productions don't directly lead to t26. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look deeper into the productions. NT45 can be derived to t44 via a production, but t44 can be derived further. Alternatively, NT45 can go through several steps. For example, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, then NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, and so on.\n\nWait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Maybe I should try to match the string step by step, expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nThe string starts with t26. Let's look at all non-terminals that produce t26. Looking at the grammar, NT22 \u2192 't22' and NT27 \u2192 't76', but wait, is there any NT that produces t26? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT44 -> 't76' (from NT44 \u2192 t84, but wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT36 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't76'\n\nNT22 -> 't22'\n\nWait, is there an NT that produces t26? Let's check. The user provided a lot of productions, but I don't see any NT that directly produces t26. Maybe I missed it. Let me scan again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT9 -> 't26' and nt99? Oh wait, here's one:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't26' \u2014 yes, production 10: NT9 -> t26.\n\nSo, now, the string starts with t26, which is generated by NT9. So, the first production from NT9 is t26. Now, what comes after t26? The next token is t14.\n\nSo, after t26, we have another terminal. That implies that the production for NT9 must have at least two symbols beyond t26. Wait, but each production for a non-terminal in CNF can only produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, if NT9 produces t26, then the next step would be to see if the next part of the string can be generated by another non-terminal or directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of the string as a sequence of steps where each step is replacing a non-terminal with a terminal or another set of non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to try to parse the string.\n\nLet me attempt a top-down parsing approach, starting with S. The string is:\n\nt26 t14 t32 t76 t13 t26 t76 t30 t83 t35 t13 t14 t5 t49 t83 t49 t30 t49 t30 t3 t11 t32 t71 t28 t11 t11 t39 t11 t42 t33 t5 t22 t39 t13 t83 t13 t22 t77 t52 t77 t5 t83 t71 t25 t39 t25 t39.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t26, which comes from NT9. So, the first step is to expand S's production that starts with NT9. Looking at the production options for S, I don't see NT9 as a starting symbol. Instead, S starts with NT45 and NT19.\n\nHmm, this is the problem. The string starts with t26, which comes from NT9, but S doesn't produce NT9. So, this suggests that the derivation might be using the other productions. But perhaps S can produce something where NT45 eventually leads to t26? Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 (via production 16: NT45 -> NT60 NT77)\n\nThen NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81 (via production 26: NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81)\n\nAnd NT30 \u2192 NT82 (from production 30: NT30 -> 't82') \u2014 wait, no: looking back, production 30 is NT30 -> 't82'? Or is that production 26?\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81 (production 26)\n\nThen, NT30 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-925","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that all the rules either have two non-terminals on the right or have a terminal as their right-hand side. That's consistent with CNF.\n\nThe string we're testing is: `t25 t71 t35 t35 t8 t35 t84 t59 t25 t52 t84 t13 t13 t28 t8 t13 t30 t35 t13 t49 t49 t83 t28 t3 t13 t13 t42 t47 t14 t35 t76 t32 t47 t28 t22 t25 t33 t84 t30 t47 t8 t33 t39 t5 t76 t35 t77 t42`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with `t25`, `t71`, etc., and ends with `t42`. The grammar has several rules where non-terminals directly produce terminals, such as `NT5 -> 't25'`, `NT22 -> 't22'`, and others. So, any sequence of these terminals must match the derivation according to the grammar.\n\nI should check if the string can be broken down using the grammar's productions. Since the grammar has a lot of productions, I might look for the sequence of terminal symbols and see if there's a way to parse them step by step.\n\nLet's look for possible starting points. The first symbol is `t25`. Looking at the grammar, I see that `NT5 -> 't25'`. So, that could be the first step.\n\nNext, the string after `t25` is `t71 t35 t35 t8`. Hmm, let's see what `t71` could come from. Looking through the grammar, I don't see an immediate production for `t71`; instead, most are non-terminals. Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I see that `S -> NT45 NT81` and `NT71 -> NT9 NT75`. So perhaps `t71` comes from NT71, which is derived from `NT9 NT75`. But looking for `t71`, I'm not sure if it's directly produced. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the terminals can only appear on the right side directly as terminals, not through non-terminals. So, perhaps the initial steps generate non-terminals, and the terminals appear towards the end.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of `t`-prefixed tokens. So each `t`-prefixed is a terminal, and the non-terminals are combinations of other non-terminals. So, perhaps the grammar allows for a sequence of terminals to appear at the end of a left derivation.\n\nWait, maybe instead of starting with the top symbol S, which is `S -> NT45 NT81` and `S -> NT19 NT67`, perhaps the string starts with one of these, and the non-terminals are expanded until we get to the terminals.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the string is made up entirely of terminals. So each non-terminal in the derivation will eventually be expanded into terminal symbols.\n\nSo perhaps I can try to parse the string by breaking it down into the productions.\n\nLet me try to see the string chunk by chunk.\n\nThe first part is `t25 t71 t35 t35 t8`. Since `t25` is `NT5`, let's look at how `NT5` is defined. From the grammar: `NT5 -> NT9 NT53`. So that's two non-terminals. Then, those non-terminals need to be expanded further.\n\nWait, but that seems too complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps the string is the result of a specific sequence of productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n`t25 t71 t35 t35 t8 t35 t84 t59 t25 t52 t84 t13 t13 t28 t8 t13 t30 t35 t13 t49 t49 t83 t28 t3 t13 t13 t42 t47 t14 t35 t76 t32 t47 t28 t22 t25 t33 t84 t30 t47 t8 t33 t39 t5 t76 t35 t77 t42`.\n\nIt's a long sequence, but perhaps each symbol is a terminal, and the non-terminals are expanded in a way that produces these terminals.\n\nWait, but the thing is, non-terminals in the grammar produce other non-terminals or terminals. So, the string starts with a terminal `t25`, which must be the result of some non-terminal derivation ending with `NT5`. Similarly, the end of the string is `t42`, which might be another terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for units in the grammar that produce the terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't25'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT8 -> 't83'\n- NT13 -> 't47'\n- NT39 -> 't28'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT36 -> 't42' (twice, once for NT36 -> t42 and also via NT9->NT26->t39)\nWait, maybe I should check if the terminals in the string correspond to any of these.\n\nSo, the string has `t25` which is produced by NT5, `t71` which I'm not sure about, as NT71 is defined by NT9 NT75. Hmm, wait, perhaps `t71` isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces `t71`. Only NT31 is defined as `t22`, but that's not helpful here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-express the grammar rules to see if any non-terminal directly produces `t71`. Looking through all the rules, I don't see `t71` appearing on the right-hand side of any production, except maybe in `S` rules or via other non-terminals. So perhaps `t71` is part of a non-terminal derivation path, but the way the grammar is structured, perhaps some non-terminals combine to produce `t71`.\n\nWait, perhaps `t71` is the result of a non-terminal that eventually produces `t71` through its leftmost derivation. Let's look for any non-terminal that can derive `t71`.\n\nLooking again, NT71 -> NT9 NT75. So to get `t71`, perhaps through NT9 and NT75.\n\nNow, considering that, maybe NT9 produces `t26` and NT75 produces `t32`, but that would be `t26 t32`, not `t71`. So that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to construct the tree or a sequence of productions that produce the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to check each of the terminals and see if their productions are correct. Let's list all the terminals in the string and see if they exist as primary productions in the grammar. The terminals in the string are:\n\nt25, t71, t35, t8, t35, t35, t84, t59, t25, t52, t84, t13, t13, t28, t8, t13, t30, t35, t13, t49, t49, t83, t28, t3, t13, t13, t42, t47, t14, t35, t76, t32, t47, t28, t22, t25, t33, t84, t30, t47, t8, t33, t39, t5, t76, t35, t77, t42.\n\nNow, each terminal in the string should correspond to a rule where a non-terminal expands directly to that terminal. Looking through the grammar rules, I can spot these:\n\n- NT5 -> t25\n- NT22 -> t22\n- NT2 -> t5\n- NT8 -> t83\n- NT13 -> t47\n- NT39 -> t28\n- NT77 -> t8\n- NT36"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-933","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It seems like all the non-terminals are split into NT followed by a number and they produce other non-terminals or terminals. The start symbol is S, which can produce combinations like NT45 NT81. These eventually lead to terminal symbols ending with 't' followed by numbers or some specific words like 't25', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. Let me list them out:\n\nt35, t52, t59, t25, t26, t39, t33, t33, t71, t32, t5, t39, t32, t83, t52, t83, t42, t83, t77, t14, t82, t11, t14, t3, t14, t33, t47, t32, t42, t8, t26, t84, t26, t26, t76, t83, t42, t71, t14, t5, t42, t49, t13, t5, t52, t14, t5, t52.\n\nI notice that some of these are quite long, like t77, t83, etc. So I'll need a systematic way to map each terminal back through the grammar to see if they can terminate correctly.\n\nFirst step: For each terminal in the string, I should find which non-terminal can produce it. Let me look through the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the terminals are:\nt5, t8, t11, t14, t25, t26, t32, t33, t39, t42, t47, t52, t53, t59, t60, t61, t71, t72, t75, t77, t83, t84, t22, t23, t27, t36, t44, t45, t50, t72, etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the terminals are all of these except possibly some others. Let me see:\n\nIn the string, I see t5, t39, t32, t83, etc. So each of these must have a corresponding production rule in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, each non-terminal has a production to either 't' followed by a two-digit number or other non-terminals. Wait, no, looking closely, some rules end with 't' followed by a number, like NT45 -> 't25', or some are combinations of other non-terminals, like NT19 -> NT84 NT8, which further produce terminals.\n\nBut for the string's terminals to be valid, each must be directly produced by a non-terminal in one step, or through a chain of productions that ultimately resolve to a terminal.\n\nWait, but this might be complex. Maybe a better approach is to construct a parse tree for the string, starting from S and building it up.\n\nBut given the length of the string, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I could break down the string into smaller parts and try to see if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reverse the process: for each terminal in the string, trace back the possible production rules that can produce it. If I can find a path from S down to the entire string, then it's generated.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Maybe I can instead build a top-down parse and see if I can match the entire string.\n\nAnother idea: look for factors that might not match.\n\nFor example, some terminals appear multiple times. Let's check if each occurs as a terminal or can be derived.\n\nLooking at the string, let me list all terminals and see if each has a production rule in the grammar:\n\nt5: Yes, NT72 -> 't52'? Wait, no. Looking back, wait NT77 -> 't8' etc. Wait, looking for t5. NT50 -> 't49', but in the rules, NT50 -> 't49' and that's not directly t5. Hmm, wait NT50 -> 't49', which is another terminal. Also, NT45 -> 't25' and other rules.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check which terminals are present:\n\nIn the string, the terminals are as listed, so I need to find for each whether it has a production rule ending with that.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\n\nSo t25 is a terminal because NT45 can produce it. Similarly:\n\nNT52 -> 't52'? Wait, in the rules, I see NT23 -> 't14', NT9 -> 't9'. Hmm, wait, actually looking at the rules, NT52 appears on the left in some cases, like NT14 -> NT25 NT52, but do any rules produce 't52'?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal ends with 't52' directly. Wait, but let me check each rule:\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\n- NT45 -> 't25'\n- NT52 -> 't52'? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the rules, for example:\n\nNT52 -> 't71'? No, I think I made a mistake. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see N Ts ending with 't25', 't26', 't39', 't42', 't5', 't32', 't83', 't47', 't77', 't8', 't11', 't33', 't14', etc. So 't52' is not in any of the produced terminals. Hmm, that's a problem because in the string, there's a 't52' at the beginning.\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar rules again to see if any rule produces 't52'.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT23 -> 't14', which is a t, followed by 14.\n\nNT52 -> NT9 NT0, or other combinations, not directly a 't' terminal.\n\nWait, so if 't52' is in the string, but the grammar doesn't have a rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't52', then that 't52' is a problem.\n\nSo the first terminal in the string is 't52'. Do any non-terminals in the grammar have a production that ends with 't52'?\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT23 -> 't14'\n\nNT52 -> NT9 NT0, which would require NT9 and NT0 to generate the next parts.\n\nSo there's no production where a non-terminal directly produces 't52'. Therefore, the production cannot derive 't52' because it's not in the list of terminals defined by the grammar.\n\nWait, that would mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it contains a terminal that's not present in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because perhaps I misread the rules. Let's see:\n\nLooking again at the grammar rules, I'll scan each rule:\n\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8\n\n- NT40 -> NT14 NT71\n\n- NT75 -> NT72 NT5\n\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, looking for any terminal like 't52'\u2014there is no such rule in the given grammar. All the terminals in the production rules are like 't5', 't8', 't11', 't14', etc., but I don't see a rule where a non-terminal produces 't52' exactly.\n\nSo that would mean that 't52' cannot be generated by any non-terminal in the grammar. Hence, the string includes a terminal that cannot be derived.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-945","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me first recall what I know about Chomsky Normal Form. In CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That means each production has either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that all the productions seem to follow this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81 is a production with two non-terminals, S \u2192 NT19 NT67 is another two non-terminals. On the other side, I also see some productions ending with terminals like NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75 and NT45 \u2192 't25'. So that matches the CNF structure.\n\nNow, the string I need to check is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Let me write it down: `t5 t22 t84 t13 t25 t35 t42 t47 t13 t49 t59 t22 t71 t14 t76 t32 t28 t14 t25 t84 t14 t13 t77 t49 t76 t33 t71 t3 t8 t35 t25 t33 t39 t77 t22 t84 t8 t25 t83 t47 t83 t52 t39 t5 t13 t77 t82 t32 t52`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the string is a series of 't' and numbers, which suggests that these are terminals produced by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each terminal can only appear as the right-hand side of a production. So for the string to be generated by the grammar, every terminal must be directly derived from a production without any non-terminals.\n\nWait, but actually, in CNF, during derivation, non-terminals are expanded until they reach terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be produced directly from a production in the grammar. So each segment of the string should correspond to a production that directly produces 't' followed by a number, right?\n\nAlternatively, in the grammar, some productions directly produce a terminal, like NT45 \u2192 't25', so 't25' is a terminal string of length 1. But the given string is a series of terminals, each being a single 't' followed by digits, like 't5', 't22', etc.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the string is provided as a sequence of space-separated tokens, each starting with 't' followed by numbers. So each of these is a separate terminal symbol, like 't5', 't22', 't84', etc. So in the derivation, the start symbol S must expand into a sequence of these terminals through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some productions that directly produce a single terminal like NT45 \u2192 't25', NT5 \u2192 't26', NT0 \u2192 't39', and so on. So each terminal in the string must be produced by one of these productions. \n\nLet me now parse the string token by token to see if each is covered by a production in the grammar. \n\n1. 't5' - Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that directly produces 't5'. Let me check. Hmm, in the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't11', NT2 \u2192 't5', so 't5' is produced by NT2. So that's okay.\n\n2. 't22' - Checking the grammar, yes, NT22 is a non-terminal, but do any of the productions produce 't22'? Looking through, I see NT22 \u2192 't22'... Or wait, actually, looking at the rules, NT22 is a non-terminal, but in the grammar, I see that NT22 is not a production. Instead, looking at the rules, for example, NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45, and NT45 \u2192 't25', so 't25' is a terminal. So maybe 't22' is directly produced by NT22? Wait, but in the given grammar, there's a rule: NT22 \u2192 't22'? Let me check. Yes, under NT22 \u2192 't22' is in the list. So 't22' is directly produced by NT22.\n\n3. 't84' - Checking the grammar, there's NT84 \u2192 't77' and other productions, but is 't84' a terminal? Wait, no, in the grammar, all the productions either have two non-terminals or a terminal at the end. So 't84' would have to be produced by a production like NT84 \u2192 't84', but I don't see that in the provided grammar. All the NT84's go to other NT's and terminals like 't77'. So 't84' is never a terminal; the NT84 is a non-terminal that can produce other things. Therefore, the string cannot have 't84' as a token unless it's produced by a production that directly has 't84', which I don't see. So that would be a problem. But in the string, the first few characters include 't84', which might indicate a problem. Let me look back. Wait, the string given starts with 't5 t22 t84 t13 t25 t35 t42 t47 t13 t49 t59 t22 t71 t14... So the third token is 't84', which is a terminal. But in the grammar, there is no production that directly produces 't84', so that means that 't84' cannot appear in the derived string. Therefore, the string is not possible because 't84' is not a terminal in the grammar. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The grammar includes 't5' from NT7 \u2192 't11', but for 't84', does any NT produce 't84'? Looking through the rules, perhaps NT84 has a production that ends with 't77', but perhaps I missed it. Let me look at the grammar again: \n\nLooking through, I don't see any production that directly produces 't84' except for possibly NT84? Let me check:\n\nThe grammar has lines like NT84 \u2192 't77', NT39 \u2192 't28', etc. There's an NT44 \u2192 't76', NT40 \u2192 't39', etc. So 't84' is only produced as part of longer strings? No, it seems 't84' is a terminal that is not produced directly by any rule. So if 't84' appears in the string, it must be because it's produced by a direct production, but since none exists, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo that immediately makes me think the answer is 'No'. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Perhaps the 't84' is part of a larger non-terminal expansion elsewhere. But in CNF, all terminals are single characters, so if 't84' is a terminal, it has to be directly produced. If it's part of an NT, then it has to be expanded further, which would require that the NT can derive into that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a 't84' somewhere, but let me check the string again. The given string starts with 't5 t22 t84 t13 t25 t35 t42 t47 t13 t49 t59 t22 t71 t14 t76 t32 t28 t14 t25 t84 t14 t13 t77 t49 t76 t33 t71 t3 t8 t35 t25 t33 t39 t77 t22 t84 t8 t25 t83 t47 t83 t52 t39 t5 t13 t77 t82 t32 t52'.\n\nSo the 't84' appears at the 3rd token, the 10th token is 't49', 11th is 't59', 22nd is 't84', 36th is 't84', etc. So that's multiple 't84's.

{"custom_id":"request-949","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm going to try to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me take this step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. Looking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and S has multiple productions, like S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So, string starts must begin with combinations like NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces: `t82 t33 t77 t5 t42 t52 t49 t82 t5 t32 t82 t76 t71 t84 t49 t84 t35 t3 t22 t83 t25 t71 t84 t30 t13 t84 t71 t25 t33 t49 t77 t32 t42 t59 t11 t39 t71 t35 t35 t39 t82 t13 t3 t47 t59 t22 t76 t8 t83`.\n\nEach production in the grammar either expands a non-terminal to another non-terminal and a terminal, or eventually to terminals only. So, to parse the string, I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI think using a top-down parsing approach, like the CYK algorithm, might be the way to go. But since the grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals, it might be time-consuming to apply CYK manually. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be built by recursively applying the productions.\n\nLet me try to identify key parts of the string. The string starts with 't82', 't33', 't77', 't5', etc. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT45 \u2192 't25', NT5 \u2192 't11', etc. So, any substring in the input string that matches these direct productions could be a part starting from a specific non-terminal.\n\nLet's look for such substrings in the string:\n\n1. 't82': Does any production directly produce 't82'? In the grammar, NT30 \u2192 't82', for example. So, looking for 't82' in the string, it could be the result of NT30.\n\n2. 't33': Looking for 't33' in the grammar. I see NT27 \u2192 't76', but maybe there's a production for 't33'. Wait, in the grammar, NT27 \u2192 't76'? Or wait, looking through the rules: NT27 is mentioned in multiple places, but specific terminals like 't33' aren't directly obvious. Maybe I need to see how to derive 't33' from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps 't33' comes from a production of a non-terminal. Let's check if any non-terminal directly produce 't33'. Looking at the grammar, I don't see a rule like NT... \u2192 't33' directly. So perhaps 't33' is part of a longer derivation. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a production that leads to 't33' eventually.\n\nHmm, maybe 't33' is the result of NT27 \u2192 't76' or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of this differently. Maybe I should work backward from the start symbol S and see how I can derive the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces combinations like NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the first part of S must be either NT45 followed by NT81, or NT19 followed by NT67. Let's check the string.\n\nThe first few symbols are 't82 t33 t77 t5 ...' So, if S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then the first two parts would be NT45 and NT81. Let's see if the string starts with 't82' followed by 't33'...\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe it's better to try to match the string step by step, breaking it down into possible non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split into the right sequence of non-terminals and terminals as per the grammar. Let's take the string step by step:\n\n1. Start with 't82': In the grammar, NT30 \u2192 't82'. So maybe the first step is NT30.\n\nThen, the next part would need to be followed by another NT or a terminal. Wait, but according to the grammar, each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, 't82' can't be a direct result, unless it's a production like NT30 \u2192 't82'? But NT30 is a non-terminal, so 't82' is a terminal. So perhaps the first part of the string starts with NT30, which produces 't82'.\n\nBut wait, NT30 is on the left side of a production where it's expanded to 't82'. So to produce 't82', the NT30 must be expanded, meaning that in the context of a larger production, we'd have something like NT30 followed by another NT... Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Let's try to see if the string can be broken down into segments that match the grammar's rules. For example, each time a non-terminal is produced, it should be a combination that matches a production in the grammar.\n\nStarting from the beginning of the string:\n\n1. 't82 t33 t77 t5 t42 t52 t49 t82 t5 t32 t82 t76 t71 t84 t49 t84 t35 t3 t22 ...'\n\nLooking for possible starts, S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nSuppose the first production is S \u2192 NT45 NT81. So, the first two symbols should be the results of NT45 and NT81.\n\nSo, the first part is NT45, which according to the grammar, NT45 \u2192 't25' or 't42' (from NT30 and other rules). Wait, I see NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44, among others. So, perhaps NT45 cannot be directly 't25' or 't42'; those are terminals produced by NT30 and others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT45 must be derived from other non-terminals until it reaches a terminal. Let me check if there's a terminal under NT45. Looking at the rules, I don't see any direct NT45 \u2192 'a', only expansions to other non-terminals. So, to get 't25', I need NT5 \u2192 't11', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start from the beginning of the string and see if it can be derived step by step.\n\nStarting with 't82', which is produced by NT30. So, perhaps the first part is NT30 \u2192 't82'. But in the grammar, NT30 is a non-terminal, and according to the rules, NT30 \u2192 't82'. So, to get 't82', we need to expand NT30, which requires that NT30 is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the string must start with a production that leads to the first symbol. Since S can only start with two non-terminals, 't82' can't be the start of the string, because the first symbol is a terminal, but the start symbol S produces a combination of non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string must be generated by expanding S, and each expansion contributes terminals and non-terminals. So, the string's first symbol must come from a derivation that starts with S \u2192 something that eventually produces 't82' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S can only produce combinations of non-terminals. So, the first symbol of the string must come from one of the non-terminals in these initial productions.\n\nLooking at the given string: The first symbol is 't82', which is produced by NT30. So, for 't82' to be the first symbol, there must be a production that starts with NT30. Looking at the grammar, is there a production starting with NT30?\n\nYes, I see NT30 \u2192 't82', but that's a terminal. So, in the string, 't82' must be produced by NT30. So, in the derivation, at some point, NT30 must be derived to 't82'.\n\nBut how does that happen? Because NT30 can't be expanded in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-961","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens, which include 't' followed by numbers and some number-like tokens. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier, though I don't know if I need to do that here.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. The given grammar follows this structure, as all the productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to check is: `t33 t11 t30 t82 t28 t32 t52 t49 t25 t25 t26 t32 t84 t39 t42 t71 t8 t11 t30 t49 t30 t84 t14 t5 t59 t47 t71 t3 t71 t52 t35 t11 t30 t42 t33 t22 t3 t33 t83 t77 t35 t49 t32 t52 t30 t76 t59 t28 t25 t14`.\n\nLet me first note that all the tokens in the string are terminals, specifically those that appear as leaf nodes in the productions. For example, 't33' appears in the productions of NT22 and NT33. Similarly, other tokens like 't71', 't8', etc., are terminals.\n\nTo determine whether the string is generated by the grammar, I can try to find a sequence of productions that, when expanded, produce this exact string. Alternatively, since the string is quite long, perhaps I can check for each step whether the given productions can generate that token.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string step by step. I'll go through each token and see if I can find a production that can produce it, moving from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the string starts with two non-terminals. Looking at the string, the first token is 't33', which is a terminal. But in the initial expansion, S directly produces non-terminals. That seems odd. Wait, perhaps I misread the string. Let me check: the first token is 't33', which is a terminal. But the start symbol S can only produce non-terminals initially. That suggests that the first token must come from some non-terminal expansion that eventually produces a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the very first production is S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67, and each of these NTs eventually expands into a sequence that starts with 't33'.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't33', but S directly produces NT45 and NT81. So how does NT45 or NT81 produce 't33'?\n\nLooking at the productions for NT45: in the grammar, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 't25'. Wait, no. Looking through the given productions, I see that NT45 has two productions: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 't25'? Wait, wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the list, under NT45: NT45 -> NT60 NT77; NT45 is also a terminal?

Yes, because NT25 has: NT25 -> 't33' is a production.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT25 NT5 something? No, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So perhaps the string starts with NT45 and NT81 each expanding into a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut the first token is 't33', which is a terminal. So let's see how 't33' is produced. Looking through the grammar, the production NT25 \u2192 't33' exists because I can see NT25 -> 't33' is a production, yes, because when I looked, I saw under NT25: \"t33\".\n\nSo, if we have a derivation that starts with NT25, then NT25 can directly produce 't33'. But our start symbol S is producing NT45 and NT81. So how do these NTs connect to the tokens?\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with 't33', which would have to come from some NT that eventually produces 't33', but the initial production from S can't be that NT because S directly produces NTs.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I made a mistake. The string begins with 't33', but the start symbol S must produce a sequence of terminals, but in the grammar, S directly produces NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So each of these NTs must expand into a sequence of terminals that, together, form the given string.\n\nLooking more closely, the first token in the string is 't33'. Let's see how 't33' is generated.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT25 -> 't33' is indeed a production.

{"custom_id":"request-967","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. \n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two on the right, except for the starting symbol which can produce a terminal string. The string I'm given is a sequence of terminals, so my job is to see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that it consists of multiple non-terminals and terminals ('t' followed by numbers). Each non-terminal on the left side of a production rule can be replaced by two other symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). \n\nFirst, let's list out all the production rules. I'll go through the grammar and write down each production. Starting with S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n- S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nThen, for NT5:\n- NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75\n\nNT0:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT47 NT53\n\nNT12:\n- NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13\n\nNT74:\n- NT74 \u2192 NT72 NT5\n\nNT36:\n- NT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53\n- NT36 \u2192 NT50 NT36\n\nNT60:\n- NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81\n\nNT71:\n- NT71 \u2192 NT9 NT75\n\nNT58:\n- NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT47\n\nNT14:\n- NT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52\n\nNT19:\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n\nNT27:\n- NT27 \u2192 NT60 NT47\n\nNT23:\n- NT23 \u2192 NT61 NT74\n\nNT9:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45\n- NT9 \u2192 NT22 NT7\n\nNT5:\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n\nWait, I see there's a rule for NT5, which is the same as above. I think that's a mistake, but perhaps it's intentional, maybe to confuse. Let me proceed.\n\nNT72:\n- NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44\n\nNT45:\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n\nNT40:\n- NT40 \u2192 NT14 NT71\n- NT40 \u2192 NT58 NT39\n\nNT44:\n- NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7\n- NT44 \u2192 NT84 NT30\n\nNT67:\n- NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n\nNT9:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT22 NT7  # Duplicate, but okay.\n\nNT13:\n- NT13 \u2192 NT61 NT74\n\nNT7:\n- NT71 \u2192 NT52 NT53\n- NT7 \u2192 NT36 NT45\n\nWait, there's a rule for NT7? Let me check: There's NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45 and NT77 \u2192 't8', so NT7 is probably not a production, but looking again, in the provided grammar, I see that NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45, and NT77 \u2192 't8'. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check each line.\n\nOK, so NT77 \u2192 't8', and NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45. Hmm, maybe the 't' rules are the terminals we're considering.\n\nProceeding, I'll list all the terminal symbols. The string given is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so that's all terminals. Non-terminals are the NT followed by a number, like NT45, NT72, etc.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to build a parse tree step by step, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the given string by expanding non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals, until I end up with the string.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt25 t22 t42 t84 t14 t82 t77 t35 t5 t59 t84 t84 t49 t42 t82 t32 t71 t49 t83 t33 t14 t22 t71 t76 t28 t47 t25 t76 t13 t28 t52 t76 t83 t11 t13 t3 t82 t8 t84 t25 t59 t84 t14 t82 t42 t5 t52 t11 t25 t59.\n\nThat's a long string of 45 tokens. I need to see if it's a valid derivation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the grammar's start symbol: S, which can produce two alternatives:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo the first step is to choose one of these. Let's see if either can start with the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t25. So I need to see if NT45 or NT19 can produce a production that starts with t25.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n\nSo NT45 can only produce non-terminals, not terminals. T25 is a terminal, so NT45 cannot directly produce t25. Therefore, the first alternative (S \u2192 NT45 NT81) cannot produce t25 as the first symbol, so that path is invalid.\n\nSo the only possible starting point is S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at the first token, t25, which comes from NT19. Checking NT19's productions:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n\nSo NT19 can produce either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, no\u2014it can only produce two symbols. So to get t25 as the first symbol, either:\n\n1. NT19 \u2192 t25 A, where A is another non-terminal, or\n2. NT19 \u2192 A t25, but that seems unlikely since in CNF, each production is two symbols, so NT19 must produce something that starts with t25.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t25. So we need a production for NT19 that starts with t25. Checking NT19's rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that NT19 can produce:\n\n- NT84 NT8\n- NT60 NT5\n\nNeither of these includes t25 as the first symbol, let alone directly. Wait, but looking again, perhaps I missed a production. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nAh, I see here:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT27 NT47\n\nWait, that's a different rule. Not sure if that's relevant. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check NT19's productions again more carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar as provided includes:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n\nSo NT19 can't produce t25 directly. So maybe that's a problem. Or perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a production of NT19 into a terminal? Let's check another line:\n\nWait, in the grammar rule list, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, but NT53 \u2192 't30', etc., but I don't see a rule where NT19 is a terminal. So NT19 must always produce non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, the starting production S \u2192 NT19 NT67 would first expand NT19 and NT67.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t25, so perhaps I need to look for a way that one of these non-terminals can lead to t25 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the first production for NT19: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8. Neither of these is t25. So that path seems stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT67 can lead to t25. Let's check NT67's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT67 is defined as:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n\nWhich are both non-terminals. So can't get t25 from NT67.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the non-terminals that can produce t25. So, I need to find all NTs that can produce t25.\n\nLooking through the grammar, perhaps some NTs can produce t25. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT60 NT47\n- NT23 \u2192 NT61 NT74\n- NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n- NT27 \u2192 NT60 NT47"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-12","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I have to determine if the string `t25 t71` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a string is generated by a grammar if there's a sequence of productions that starts with the start symbol and ends with the string when all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. In this case, the start symbol is S. The string has two terms: `t25` and `t71`, so I'm looking for a derivation that leads to S -> stuff that eventually becomes `t25 t71`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that S has two options:\n1. S -> NT45 NT81\n2. S -> NT19 NT67\n\nI guess I'll check both to see if either can lead to `t25 t71`.\n\nLet's start with the first option: S -> NT45 NT81. So now I have to see if NT45 can produce `t25` and NT81 can produce `t71`.\n\nLooking at the NT45 production rules, I see that NT45 can be expanded in a few ways. One of them is NT45 -> NT60 NT77. Wait, but in the given string, NT60 would eventually have to produce something. Let me check NT60. From the grammar, NT60 can produce NT30 NT81 or NT84 NT39. Hmm, but NT30 is a terminal, right? Because in the grammar, NT30 -> 't82' as a production. So NT60 could become 't82' if it expands to NT30. But wait, if NT60 is expanded, perhaps I need to track how that would get to `t25`. Alternatively, maybe NT45 can produce `t45` or something else.\n\nWait, another production for NT45 is 't45', so that's a terminal. If NT45 is 't45', then if NT45 is followed by NT81, but the string is `t25 t71`, that doesn't match because NT45 would be `t45`, not `t25`.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the second option for S: S -> NT19 NT67. So now looking at NT19 and NT67.\n\nNT19 has two productions: NT19 -> NT84 NT8 and NT19 -> NT60 NT5. So let's see both possibilities.\n\nFirst, NT19 -> NT84 NT8. Then NT84 can be 't77' because in the grammar, NT84 -> 't77'. So NT84 becomes 't77', and NT8 can be 't83' because NT8 is 't83' in the production. So combining these, NT19 becomes `t77 t83`. But that doesn't help us with `t25 t71`.\n\nAlternatively, NT19 can be NT60 NT5. Let's look at NT60. As before, NT60 can produce NT30 NT81 or NT84 NT39. So from NT60, maybe NT30 becomes 't82', and NT81 could be... Hmm, looking at NT81, from the grammar, NT81 can be NT30 NT2 or 't71'. Oh! So if NT81 becomes 't71', then that's part of our string. So let's see:\n\nIf S -> NT19 NT67, then NT19 becomes NT60 NT5, and NT67 can become 't2'. Wait, does NT67 produce 't2'? Let me check the grammar. I see that NT67 -> 't2' is not a production. Wait, looking back, I see NT67 -> 't30' or 't2'? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT67's options are: NT67 -> NT30 NT2. Oh, so NT67 can become NT30 NT2, and then NT30 is 't82', so NT67 becomes 't82' 't2' which is 't82t2'. That doesn't help. Alternatively, if NT67 is 't30', which is 't82', and that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try another angle. Maybe the string `t25 t71` comes from S -> NT45 NT81. Let's see.\n\nIf S -> NT45 NT81, then NT45 needs to produce `t25` and NT81 needs to produce `t71`. So let's see if NT45 can produce `t25` and NT81 can produce `t71`.\n\nLooking at NT45, one of its productions is 't45', which isn't helpful. Another is NT60 NT77. But NT60 can produce NT30 NT81 or NT84 NT39. NT30 is 't82', NT84 is 't77', so NT60 could become something like 't82t77' but that's 't82t77', which is 't8277', which is way longer than `t25`. Alternatively, NT60 -> NT84 NT39, so 't77t39', but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check if there are other paths. NT45 also produces NT5 NT36. No, that's from NT5, which is 't45'. Wait, maybe I miswrote.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar for NT45 is: 't45' and also 'NT60 NT77'. Wait, maybe I should consider NT45 -> NT5 NT36. Is that correct? Wait, in the grammar, looking back:\n\nYes, the grammar has NT45 -> NT5 NT36. Oh, okay, so that's another production. So NT45 can become NT5 NT36. Let's see if that can lead to `t25`.\n\nSo, NT5 can produce 't45' or another option. Wait, looking at NT5: it can produce NT9 NT53 or 't25'. Oh, right! NT5 can directly produce 't25'. Perfect. So if NT45 becomes NT5, then NT5 can be 't25', which is the first part of our string.\n\nNow, what about the other part, NT81? It has a production 't71' directly, which is the second term. So if S -> NT45 NT81, and NT45 becomes 't25' and NT81 becomes 't71', then the derived string is exactly `t25 t71`. So that works!\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Start with S -> NT45 NT81\n- NT45 -> NT5 (since NT45 can produce 't25' via NT5)\n- NT5 -> 't25' (a direct production)\n- NT81 -> 't71' (direct production)\n\nThus, the string is generated by the grammar.

Since these are terminal symbols, I need to see if they can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. \n\nI know that in Chomsky normal form, every production is either of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one.\n\nLooking at the string, \"t25\" and \"t3\" are both terminals. So, they must be generated by the non-terminals that produce them.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT25 -> 't25' (I think this is the production for NT25)\n- NT3 -> 't3' (if there's such a rule, but I don't see it in the provided list. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.)\n\nWait, the provided grammar doesn't directly show a rule for NT3, but in the string, we have \"t3\". So, to produce \"t3\", there must be a non-terminal that can produce it. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces 't3'. All the terminals are either single letters or multi-letter: t25, t36, t45, etc.\n\nWait, no, looking more closely, the list includes \"t7\", \"t11\", \"t22\", \"t25\", etc. But I don't see a rule for NT3 -> 't3'. So, that's a problem. The string has \"t3\", but if there's no production rule for NT3 that outputs 't3', then the string can't be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, let me scan each production to see which ones produce terminals:\n\n- NT25 -> 't25' \u2705\n- NT27 -> 't35' \u2705\n- NT22 -> 't22' \u2705\n- NT25 -> 't33' (No, that's wrong, NT25 was already covered)\n- NT22 -> 't42' \u2705\n- NT23 -> 't14' \u2705\n- NT71 -> 't52' \u2705\n- NT50 -> 't49' \u2705\n- NT83 -> 't30' \u2705\n- NT36 -> 't42' \u2705\n- NT84 -> 't77' \u2705\n- NT77 -> 't8' \u2705\n- NT72 -> 't10' \u2705\n- NT39 -> 't28' \u2705\n- NT7 -> 't11' \u2705\n- NT36 -> 't45' \u2705\n- NT75 -> 't32' \u2705\n- NT44 -> 't59' \u2705\n- NT75 -> 't32' \u2705\n- And so on.\n\nSo for 't3', I'm not seeing any production rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't3'. Therefore, the string \"t25 t3\" requires a non-terminal that can produce 't3', but there isn't one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's produced through multiple steps. But considering the Chomsky normal form, each production is a binary split. So, for a symbol to produce a terminal, it must have a production like A -> a.\n\nIn our case, \"t25 t3\" requires two symbols. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, \"t25\" could come from NT25 \u2192 t25. Then, \"t3\" would need to come from some other non-terminal. But since there's no rule for that, perhaps the string can't be formed.\n\nWait, but maybe the start symbol S can generate a longer string that includes both \"t25\" and \"t3\" through some intermediate steps. Let me see.\n\nLooking at S, the start symbol, it can produce NT45 followed by NT81 or NT19 followed by NT67. Then, each of those non-terminals can split further, but ultimately, the terminals would have to be produced by their respective non-terminals.\n\nSo, for example, let's try to derive \"t25 t3\". \n\nFirst, S can go to NT45 NT81.\n\nNow, NT45 can split into other non-terminals, but eventually, to get a terminal, it must reach one of the a symbols.\n\nFrom NT45, looking at the rules:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\n\nAnd then, NT60 can split into NT30 NT84, and so on. But nowhere in this path do we get 't25' or 't3' as terminals.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT25 -> 't25' \u2705 So, to get 't25', there must be a non-terminal that can produce 't25'.\n\nSo, maybe part of the derivation goes through NT25, which produces 't25', and another part goes through NT3, which produces 't3'. But I don't see a rule for NT3\u2192 t3.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' \u2705\n- NT25 \u2192 't25' \u2705\n- NT27 \u2192 't35' \u2705\n- NT22 \u2192 't42' \u2705\n- Others produce other terminals.\n\nSo, 't25' is from NT25, and 't22' is from NT22. So, 't3' is not present as a terminal in any production rule. That means the string \"t25 t3\" can't be derived because there's no way to produce 't3' from any non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's produced via another route, but I'm not seeing it. Since the grammar doesn't have a production for 't3', the string can't be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided has several rules of both types, so I can use them to try and parse the string.\n\nThe target string is `t49 t76 t30`, which breaks down into three terminal symbols: t49, t76, and t30. My goal is to see if these can be derived starting from the start symbol S, using the given productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The grammar has two initial productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nI'll consider both possibilities because the derivation might go either way. But I suspect that only one path will lead me to the target string, if at all.\n\nLooking at the first production, S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Let's see what happens if I follow this path. NT45 and NT81 are both non-terminals, so they need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT45, I see that NT45 can produce either 't60' or 't44' followed by NT44. Wait, no, actually, let me check the grammar again. The productions for NT45 are:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n- NT45 \u2192 NT27 NT7 (Wait, no, looking back, maybe I misread.

The grammar as given starts with S, then the NT and T rules follow, ending with some 't's as terminals.\n\nSo, to parse `t49 t76 t30`, I think I should work backwards, starting from the string and seeing if I can find a derivation path that builds it.\n\nEach word in the string is a terminal symbol, so I can try to match them from the rightmost side of the rules. Let me use the standard method of leftmost or rightmost derivation, but perhaps working backwards from the string.\n\nThe string is t49 t76 t30. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each step should replace a non-terminal into two others or a terminal.\n\nLet me think of this as a parse tree where the leaves are the terminals, and we're trying to see if they can be formed starting from S.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string from the end. The last symbol is t30. So, can any non-terminal directly produce t30?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT30 isn't listed, but wait, looking back, under NT2, it says NT2 -> 't5'. Under NT30, it doesn't have a production, but looking again, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT81 -> 't71'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't52'\n- NT50 -> 't49'\n- NT61 -> 't13'\n- Others lead to various 't's.\n\nSo, let's check for t30. Under NT53, it produces 't30' (rule NT53 -> 't30').\n\nSo, t30 can come from NT53, which is a non-terminal. Now, looking at where NT53 appears. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT53 -> 't30' is one of the rules. So, for the last token t30, it must come from NT53.\n\nNow, so the string `t49 t76 t30` must be derived as something ending with NT53, which expands to 't30'. Therefore, the substring before that must be the expansion of the other symbols.\n\nNow, the second token is t76.

So t76 is covered.\n\nt71: Is there an NT that produces t71? Let's check the list above. Hmm, I don't see anything that directly gives t71. So perhaps t71 is derived from another NT that ultimately reduces to a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, t49: Is there an NT producing t49? Let's check: I don't see any NTs that directly produce t49. So t49 must be produced by a non-terminal that is eventually reduced to t49, but looking through the NTs, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly produces t49.\n\nLet me check again: In the given grammar, do any NTs produce t49? Looking through the productions, I don't see any. The closest is NT75 -> t32, which is not 49. NT77 is t8. NT67 -> t30. Other NTs: NT45 -> t25, NT5 -> t26, etc.\n\nSo, without an NT producing t49, it's impossible for the string to have t49 as its terminal.

So that leads to NT72 and NT5.\n\nWait, but to get t71, does any NT go into producing t71? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly produces t71. So t71 isn't in the terminals that the grammar produces, unless it's derived through some step, but I don't see any path to t71.\n\nWait, but the string is t49 t76 t71.

{"custom_id":"request-48","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string \"t82 t71 t8 t71\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can go to a terminal. Here, the start symbol is S, which goes to combinations of other non-terminals, and eventually some terminals.\n\nFirst, let's break down the string into its components. The string is a sequence of four tokens: t82, t71, t8, t71. Each token can be a terminal or a non-terminal, but in this case, they all look like terminals because they start with 't' followed by numbers. However, wait\u2014no, actually, looking at the grammar, some of these might be non-terminals. Let me check which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nThe grammar has a bunch of rules, but many of them have the right-hand side as two non-terminals. For example, S -> NT45 NT81. Then, looking further down, NT81 has a rule that eventually goes to a terminal 't81'. Similarly, NT45 goes to 't45'. So the right-hand side of S can be terminals, but when there's another non-terminal, that complicates things.\n\nWait, but in our string, we have \"t82\", \"t71\", \"t8\", \"t71\". Each of these is a terminal symbol. So, for the string to be generated by the grammar, each of these terminals must have a production rule that directly results in them. But looking at the grammar, let's check if any of these exist as non-terminals that lead to the terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT39 -> 't28'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT13 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT81 -> 't71'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n\nAh, here we go. NT30 produces 't82'. So, 't82' can come from NT30. Similarly, 't71' comes from NT71. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't71'. Looking at NT71, I don't see a direct production rule in the initial part of the grammar, but looking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT71 -> NT975 (Wait, maybe I'm misreading\u2014actually, looking back, maybe it's a typo here. Let me check: the grammar does have NT71 -> NT975? No, wait, looking at the provided grammar, it's:\n\nNT71 -> NT9 NT75, and NT9 is producing something else. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some rules. Let me look carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar list is a bit long, and I might have missed some rules. For example, looking at NT71: \"NT71 -> NT9 NT75\". So that's NT9 and NT75. NT9 has a rule NT9 -> NT36 NT45, which in turn produces 't36' and 't45', but then looking further, there's a rule for NT9 -> 't26' as well. Wait, no\u2014it seems in the provided grammar, some non-terminals directly go to terminals, like NT5 -> 't5', etc.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nEach line starts with a non-terminal, then arrow, then two other symbols (could be non-terminals or terminals).\n\nSo, for example:\n\nNT30 -> 't82'\n\nSo, NT30 can directly produce 't82'. Similarly, NT71 can eventually produce 't71'? Wait, let's see:\n\nNT71 -> NT9 NT75\n\nNT9 -> 't26' (Directly from a rule? Or wait, no. Let's look again. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT9: I see \"NT9 -> NT36 NT45\" and \"NT9 -> 't26'\". Wait, so NT9 can go to either NT36 NT45 or directly to 't26'. But where is 't26' in the string? Let's see our string: \"t82 t71 t8 t71\".\n\nWait, the string has t82, t71, t8, t71. So 't8' comes from somewhere. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce 't8'. Looking for rules where RHS includes 't8'. Looking, I see NT30 produces 't82', and NT81 produces 't71'. Wait, not seeing 't8' yet.\n\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules, I see NT81 -> 't71', NT77 -> 't8', NT45 -> 't45', etc. So, where is 't8' coming from? Let me check:\n\nLooking for rules that have 't8' as a terminal. I see NT77 -> 't8'. So, NT77 can directly produce 't8'. Similarly, any NT that can reach NT77 would be able to produce 't8'.\n\nNow, in the string, there's \"t8\", which is the third token. So that would need to come from a production that results in 't8'. So, perhaps NT77 can produce 't8', so that's how we get 't8'.\n\nSo, to build the string, the first token is 't82' from NT30, the second is 't71' from NT71, third is 't8' from NT77, fourth is 't71' from NT71 again.\n\nWait, let's go back. How do the non-terminals expand to the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can go to NT45 NT81, or other rules, but looking at S's rules: S -> NT45 NT81. Wait, NT45 leads to 't45', and NT81 leads to 't71'. So, that would give us t45 t71 as the expansion from S. But the string we have starts with t82 t71, so that doesn't fit directly from S.\n\nWait, perhaps the string comes from a different parse tree. Maybe S goes to NT45 NT81, but perhaps one of those non-terminals can expand into a longer string. But wait, looking at the grammar, S can only go to two non-terminals, but those non-terminals end up being terminals or other non-terminals that eventually go to terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is the result of a longer derivation.\n\nLooking at the string 't82 t71 t8 t71', let's see if each part can be traced back.\n\nFirst, 't82' comes from NT30, as we saw. So, to get 't82', there must be a non-terminal that goes to it, which is NT30.\n\nSimilarly, 't71' comes from NT71.\n\nSo, let's assume the string corresponds to the production S -> ... -> NT30 NT71, which then expands to t82 t71, but then we have more tokens. Wait, but the string has four tokens, so the production path must involve more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps S -> NT45 NT81 (each goes to a single terminal, giving t45 t71), but that doesn't directly lead to our string. Alternatively, perhaps the string comes from a more nested expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is generated by a different production. Let's think: maybe S -> NT45 NT81 is the starting point, and then NT45 and NT81 expand further.\n\nWait, let's look at NT45. From the grammar, NT45 can be:\n\n- NT45 -> 't44'\n- NT45 -> NT36 NT45\n- And others.\n\nSimilarly, NT81 can be:\n\n- NT81 -> 't71'\n- NT81 -> NT36 NT2\n- etc.\n\nBut the string has 't82 t71 t8 t71', which is four tokens. So, perhaps we need a longer derivation.\n\nWait, let's think about each token step by step.\n\nThe first token is 't82', which comes from NT30.\n\nSo, we need a non-terminal that eventually goes to 't82'. Looking at NT30's rules, it's directly 't82', so NT30 is a terminal in this case.\n\nWait, no, if a non-terminal's rule includes a terminal in the RHS, then the entire production is a terminal. So, NT30 can produce 't82' directly.\n\nSimilarly, 't71' comes from NT71, which"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-49","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the string `t49 t30 t11 t3` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar provided. It consists of a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT1, etc.) is rewritten into a combination of other symbols, eventually leading to terminal symbols (like 't11', 't22', etc.).\n\nThe input string is `t49 t30 t11 t3`. Since this string is fully composed of terminal symbols, I need to see if the grammar can derive this string starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll approach this by working backward from the string. Each component of the string must be matched by a production rule in the grammar. Let's split the string into its components:\n\n1. t49\n2. t30\n3. t11\n4. t3\n\nStarting with the first part, t49. Looking at the grammar rules, I see a production for NT50 -> 't49'. So, t49 can be directly derived from NT50.\n\nNext, t30. Checking the rules, NT27 -> 't30'. So, t30 comes from NT27.\n\nThen, t11. From the grammar, NT7 -> 't11'. That means t11 is produced by NT7.\n\nAnd finally, t3. Looking through the rules, I spot NT1 -> 't3'. So, t3 is generated by NT1.\n\nNow, putting this together, the string would correspond to the sequence of non-terminals: NT50, NT27, NT7, NT1.\n\nSo, to generate the string, the leftmost derivation would start with the start symbol S and derive through these non-terminals. But wait, I should check if the start symbol S can produce a chain of these non-terminals leading to the string.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- S can go to NT49 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n- From S, we might need to see if any of these can eventually lead to NT50, followed by NT27, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me see if I can structure this better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check each part of the string to ensure they can be derived step by step.\n\nStarting with the entire string, breaking it into the four terminal symbols. So, the string is \"t49 t30 t11 t3\". Let's group them into the order they appear, which is t49, t30, t11, t3.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of productions that can generate this in order. Since each production is a direct rewrite, the terminals must appear in the leftmost position at each step.\n\nLet me start by considering how to derive the entire string. Each 't' symbol corresponds to a specific non-terminal:\n\n- t49 comes from NT50\n- t30 comes from NT27\n- t11 comes from NT7\n- t3 comes from NT1\n\nSo, the entire string is equivalent to NT50 NT27 NT7 NT1.\n\nNow, looking at the start symbol S, it can produce two main options: NT49 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nWait a minute, but in the string, we have NT50, which isn't directly part of the start symbol's initial productions. So, I must have made a mistake because the start symbol S can't directly produce NT50. The initial productions only produce NT49 and NT19 as direct children.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps I need to reconsider how I'm breaking down the string. Maybe the string isn't directly mapped to a sequence of NTs from a single S production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about how the string can be broken into parts that correspond to the grammar's production rules.\n\nLooking again, let's see if the string can be split into components that correspond to the grammar's productions starting from S.\n\nThe string is t49 t30 t11 t3. Let's see if these can be grouped into two parts as per S's production rules.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT49 NT81. If that's the case, then the string must start with t49 and then t30. So, t49 is from NT49, and t30 would come from NT81, but NT81 doesn't produce t30 directly. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT81 has a production to 't71' or 't3'. So, if S produces NT49 (t49) and NT81 (which can produce 't3'), then the string t49 t30 t11 t3 would require that NT81 somehow produces t30 and t11 and t3, which doesn't align because NT81 can only produce 't71' or 't3'.\n\nSo that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT19 NT67. Then the string would start with t19 (from NT19) and t67 (from NT67). But looking at the grammar, NT19 produces t84 and t8, and NT67 produces t30 or t2.\n\nWait, let me check NT19's productions: NT19 can go to NT60 NT5 or NT60 NT53, but I'm looking for 't19', which is from NT19's productions. Wait, no, in the grammar, the terminal symbols are 't' followed by numbers, each corresponding to a specific non-terminal. So, in the grammar provided, we have:\n\nNT1 -> 't3'\n\nSo, to get 't3', NT1 must be the one.\n\nLooking back, the string starts with t49, t30, t11, t3.\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be broken down into pairs as per the start symbol's productions.\n\nWait, the start symbol can go to NT49 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So, maybe the string starts with either NT49 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at the string: t49 is from NT50, which doesn't appear in the start symbol's first option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT50's production: NT50 -> 't49'. So, 't49' comes from NT50.\n\nThen 't30' comes from NT27.\n\n't11' from NT7.\n\n't3' from NT1.\n\nSo, the entire string is NT50 NT27 NT7 NT1. So, how can we derive this string starting from S?\n\nSince S can only produce two parts, either NT49 NT81 or NT19 NT67, but we're looking for NT50, which is not part of either of S's initial productions. That suggests that perhaps the string is not derivable from S because the non-terminals don't form a chain that leads back to S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Perhaps after the start symbol, the productions can chain through other non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider the production possibilities in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n\nEach non-terminal leads to a terminal or another non-terminal. To get the string, we need to see if each terminal can be connected through productions.\n\nSo, t49 comes from NT50.\n\nThen, t30 comes from NT27.\n\nThen, t11 comes from NT7.\n\nThen, t3 comes from NT1.\n\nSo, the string is NT50 NT27 NT7 NT1.\n\nNow, let's see how these non-terminals can be connected.\n\nLooking at the grammar, do any non-terminals lead to NT50, NT27, NT7, and NT1?\n\nLet's check:\n\n- NT50 -> 't49' directly.\n\n- NT27 -> 't30' directly.\n\n- NT7 -> 't11' directly.\n\n- NT1 -> 't3' directly.\n\nSo, all these are terminal productions.\n\nTherefore, the string NT50 NT27 NT7 NT1 can be derived as the result of NT50 producing 't49', NT27 producing 't30', etc.\n\nBut in the grammar, S only has initial productions to NT49 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So, NT50 isn't directly reachable from S. Therefore, the string is not derivable from S because none of the initial productions of S can generate NT50 NT27 NT7 NT1 as an expansion.\n\nWait, but perhaps through left or right cascading productions? Let me see if any of these non-terminals can derive to other non-terminals that eventually lead back to S.\n\nLooking for connections:\n\nFor example, NT27 -> 't30' (terminal), but are there any connections from NT27 to other non-terminals?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT27 has a production to 't30' and another to 't35' (from NT27 -> NT60 NT47 and NT47 -> '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to see which non-terminals can produce 't84'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT72 NT5\n- NT77 \u2192 NT75 NT72\n- NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44\n- NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7\n- NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT77 has a terminal 't8' as one of its possible productions.\n\nWait, but this seems messy. Maybe I should approach this differently, perhaps using a top-down parser approach, building the parse tree from the bottom up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a leftmost derivation path that matches the string.\n\nLet me look for the possible terminal sequences that the NTs can produce. Let's see which NT productions end with a terminal symbol.\n\nFor example, looking for NTs where one of their productions directly yields a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n\nBut wait, any of these NTs could have productions that generate terminals. Let me search for any NT that has a production with a single terminal on either side.\n\nFrom the given productions:\n\nLooking at NT44: NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7 and NT44 \u2192 NT59 NT44. Not terminals.\n\nWait, let me check each NT:\n\nNT45: productions are NT60 NT77 and NT50 NT44, and there's also NT45 \u2192 't25'. Ah, there's a 't25' terminal.\n\nWait no, looking again, in the given productions, NT45 has a rule: NT45 \u2192 't25'. So that's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT82 is in the string, but does any NT produce 't82'? Wait, actually, looking at NT30: NT30 \u2192 't82' because one of the productions is NT30 \u2192 't82'.\n\nWait no, checking the productions, I see:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't82'\n\nYes, NT30 can produce 't82'.\n\nSo now, thinking about the string \"t84 t26 t30 t82 t5\".\n\nEach of these terminals must come from some NT derivation. Let me build this step by step.\n\nLeftmost derivation:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 NT81\n\nSo the first step produces 't84' and 't3' (since I think NT81 can produce 't3'). Wait, no. Let me check each NT production.\n\nWait, let me make a list of NTs that directly produce terminals. These are known as terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't14'\n\nWait, this might take too long. Maybe a better approach is to try to find a path from S to the string by matching each token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm, but that's more complex. Maybe I can build the parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, let's look for the last token 't5'. The productions for NT5 are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n\nNT5 \u2192 't26'\n\nAh, yes, NT5 can directly produce 't26' (wait, looking at the list, I see NT53 \u2192 't30', NT9 \u2192 't26'). So if I can have a sequence leading to 't26' and 't5', perhaps through NT5.\n\nBut let me try to map this. Let me work backward:\n\nThe string is: t84 t26 t30 t82 t5\n\nThis has five tokens, so the derivation should have five steps, involving the productions.\n\nLet me consider the leftmost derivation approach.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n\nSo the string starts with t84. I need to find a production for NT45 that starts with 't84'. Looking at NT45's productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44, and also NT45 \u2192 't25'. Wait, none of these produce 't84' directly. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps using S \u2192 NT45 NT81 leads to an issue because NT45 doesn't produce 't84'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nLet's see the productions of NT19:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 and NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5. So NT19 can generate two sequences, one of which involves 't84' as the first terminal.\n\nWait, yes, in NT19's productions, there's NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8. Since NT8 is a terminal? Wait, looking through the list:\n\nI see NT36 \u2192 't42', NT47 \u2192 't84', wait, let me check. Looking for 't84' in the RHS of any production.\n\nIn the given productions, NT44 \u2192 't76', NT19 \u2192 't84 NT8'? Wait, no, looking through the list:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is 't84' as a terminal:\n\nYes, I see NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, and NT84 is a production. Wait, no, I need to check the RHS for any single terminal.\n\nWait, looking at all the productions:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n\nWait, NT47 \u2192 't84'\n\nYes, that's a terminal. Also, NT5: Hmm, the first production for NT5 is NT9 NT53, and another is 't26'.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Let me check each NT that ends in a terminal.\n\nLooking through, I find:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't84'\n\nNT53 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't42' (but that's for NT36 \u2192 NT82 NT47, wait no, looking again, the productions are:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT82 NT47 and NT36 \u2192 NT50 NT44, and also NT36 \u2192 't42'.\n\nSo NT36 can produce 't42' directly.\n\nOther NTs:\n\nWait, is NT53 producing 't30'? Yes, because NT53 \u2192 't30'.\n\nAnd NT30 \u2192 't82'.\n\nSo, trying to see, starting from the end of the string.\n\nWe have t5 as the last symbol. So perhaps the last two tokens are generated from a single NT.\n\nLooking at NT5: it can produce 't26' directly.\n\nSo the last token 't5' must come from NT5 \u2192 't26', but that seems a mismatch because 't5' isn't 't26'. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last part is NT50 \u2192 't49' or something else, but this seems unclear.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: let's work backwards token by token.\n\nThe string is t84, t26, t30, t82, t5.\n\nEach step, the right-hand side should produce that token in order.\n\nLet me start from the last token, t5.\n\nLooking for which NT can produce 't5'. Wait, in the productions, I see NT5 \u2192 't26' and NT9 \u2192 't26', but that's for NT9.

{"custom_id":"request-63","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t84 t13 t32 t82 t5` is generated by this grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps because it simplifies the way we can expand the string to match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S starts the entire string. The productions for S are S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So, the string must start with either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t84 t13 t32 t82 t5`. Let me break that down. It's five tokens: t84, t13, t32, t82, t5. I need to see if these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLet me check the first case: S \u2192 NT45 NT81. So the first two parts would be generated by NT45 and NT81.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions, I see NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and also NT45 \u2192 't25'. But in the string, the first token is t84, not t25. So NT45 can't be directly expanding to t84. Let me check if NT45 can produce t84 anywhere.\n\nLooking through the NT45 productions again, I don't see any that directly produce t84. So if S starts with NT45, it would have to produce t25 instead. But the string starts with t84, so this path is not possible. So S must expand to NT19 NT67.\n\nLet me check the second case: S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So the first two tokens should be generated by NT19 and NT67.\n\nLooking at NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 and NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5. The first production would generate t84, which matches the first token. So let's take that.\n\nSo, NT19 \u2192 t84 NT8. Now, the next token in the string is t13. So we need to see how NT8 can produce t13.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions. Hmm, I don't see any production for NT8. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT84 \u2192 't77' and NT39 \u2192 't28', etc. Wait, no NT8 is listed as a terminal, so maybe I missed it. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I see NT39 \u2192 't28' and NT13 \u2192 't47'. Wait, is NT8 a terminal or a non-terminal? In the grammar, I don't see NT8 being defined as a non-terminal because all its productions lead to terminals or other non-terminals. Wait, looking back, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and NTs as non-terminals, so each NT must be defined elsewhere.\n\nWait, I'm confused. The productions for the NTs all seem to be rules like NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75, etc. The only terminals are the t-something strings. So in the string, each token is t followed by a number. So t84 is a terminal, t13, t32, etc., are all terminals.\n\nSo, I need to see if the NTs can derive these terminals. Let's go back.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So NT19 can produce NT84 NT8, which gives t84 directly. So the first token is t84, which matches.\n\nNow, the second part is NT67. So NT67 must produce t13. Looking at the production rules for NT67, I see NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2, so that's two non-terminals. Hmm, but t13 is a terminal; so we need to see if NT67 can produce t13 directly, but I don't see that. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for NT variables, I don't see any production that directly expands to t13. Let's check each production for NTs:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't47'\n\nSo NT13 is a non-terminal that produces t47, which is a terminal. But t13 is another terminal. There must be a way for some NT to produce t13. Wait, perhaps through a chain of expansions.\n\nWait, the string after t84 is t13. So after NT19 produces t84, the next part is NT67, which needs to produce t13. But NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2. Neither NT30 nor NT2 directly produce t13. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT30 \u2192 t82, which is a terminal. So NT30 \u2192 't82', which is the next token after t84. Wait, the third token is t32. Hmm, no, that's not matching.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach this differently.\n\nLet's consider the string `t84 t13 t32 t82 t5`. Each token is a terminal. To generate this string, each token must be the result of a terminal production.\n\nSo, starting with S, which splits into either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nNT45 can produce NT60 NT77 or 't25'. The string starts with t84, so only NT45 \u2192 't25' would allow that, which is not the case here. So this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nNT19 can produce NT84 NT8 or NT60 NT5. Let's go with NT19 \u2192 t84 NT8, which matches the first token t84.\n\nNow, the next part is NT67. NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2. So NT30 must produce t82 (third token), and NT2 should produce t13 (second token). Wait, but NT2 is not defined in the grammar, as the last terminal I see is NT22 \u2192 t22, etc. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT27 \u2192 t35, NT25 \u2192 t33, etc. So, perhaps NT2 is defined as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t5\n\nSo NT2 is a non-terminal that produces t5 or something else? Wait, no, NT2 is a terminal? Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking at all the productions, the terminals are:\n\nt25, t8, t77, t28, t47, t36, t84, etc. Wait, I see:\n\nNT25 \u2192 t33\n\nWait, no, looking again, I think NT25 is a non-terminal because it's part of a rule like NT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52. So NT25 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me check each production. It's a bit confusing, but I think that whenever I see a string like 't25', it's a terminal, and other letters followed by numbers are non-terminals except where '\u2192' is used to indicate a terminal production.\n\nSo, in the grammar, for example:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 NT81\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 or 't25'?\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I think the grammar is given with '\u2192' as production. So for NT45, the options are:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n\nNT45 \u2192 t25\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals have options either to produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for NT25, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52\n\nSo NT25 is a non-terminal. However, I don't see a production for NT25 that leads to a terminal. So perhaps NT25 doesn't have a terminal production, meaning it can only be expanded further.\n\nWait, but that would mean that any string containing 't25' must come from a non-terminal that directly expands to 't25'. So, if in the string we have a t25, it must come from that specific production.\n\nBut in our string, we have t84, t13, t32, t82, t5. So, t13 must come from some NT that directly expands to 't13', which I don't see in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me go back.

The grammar provided should have these kinds of rules. Looking at the given grammar, I see that some rules like S \u2192 NT45 NT81 are two non-terminals, and others like NT84 \u2192 't25' have terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t82, t30, t13, t32, t82, t5. Since each token is a terminal, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S step by step by applying the production rules.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's look at the possible expansions. For the string to be valid, each part of the string must correspond to the terminals produced by the appropriate non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider the first production S \u2192 NT45 NT81.

Hmm, so NT60 leads to NT30, which then, looking at NT30's productions, has rules like NT30 \u2192 NT82. Oh wait, in the grammar, NT30 \u2192 NT84 and some other rules, but looking more carefully, I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see that NT81 appears in several rules.

Let me list out the terminals and see where each one can come from.\n\nLet me start by writing down the possible paths for each terminal in the string.\n\n1. The first symbol is t82. Looking at the grammar, NT82 appears in several rules.

NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, and NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81.

Wait no, in the grammar, t82 is a terminal at NT27 \u2192 't76', and various other non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-77","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string `t84 t22 t11 t30 t82 t5` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it makes parsing by hand a bit easier, but it's still a bit tricky. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string is a sequence of terminals: t84, t22, t11, t30, t82, t5. Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions are either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, to generate this string, it should split into exactly two non-terminals at each step, and each non-terminal should break down into either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol.\n\nI think the approach should be to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The string is six tokens long, so we'll need three splits because each split reduces the number of symbols by one. So, the breakdown would be:\n\n1. Start with S, which must produce two non-terminals based on the given rules.\n2. Each of those non-terminals will then produce either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n3. Repeat this process until we get down to the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules to see how the terminals might be generated.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals and some produce other non-terminals. For example, NT5 -> 't25', and NT77 -> 't8', etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is 't84'. So I need to find a non-terminal that can produce 't84'. Let's check the rules. NT84 isn't present in the first level productions, but looking further, I see NT44 -> 't76' and NT27 -> 't76' as well. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's look for each terminal in the string and see how they are produced.\n\nThe string has tokens: t84, t22, t11, t30, t82, t5.\n\nStarting with 't84': looking for the rule that ends with 't84'. I see NT44 -> 't76', but not t84. Let's check the rules again. Wait, there's NT27 -> 't76', NT27 -> 't35' as well. Wait no, let me check the rules again. Let me scan through the provided rules:\n\nLooking for 't84', it's possible in NT44 -> 't76' which doesn't help. Wait, maybe other non-terminals.\n\nWait, the production S -> NT45 NT81. So from S, the first split is NT45 and NT81. Let me see what NT45 and NT81 produce.\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77 or 't44'.\n\nFrom NT45, options are either two non-terminals or a terminal. If it produces 't44', then that's part of the string. But looking at the string, the first token is t84, which isn't t44, so maybe we need a different split.\n\nWait, maybe S -> NT19 NT67. Let's see what NT19 and NT67 produce.\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8 or NT60 NT5.\n\nLooking for a way to get t84. If NT19 -> NT84 NT8, then NT84 would be a non-terminal that's supposed to produce 't84'. Wait, but looking at the rules, is there a rule for NT84? I don't see NT84 -> 't84' in the provided rules. Hmm, maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps NT84 is a non-terminal that's derived from other non-terminals. Let's check the rules for NT84.\n\nWait, in the rules, there's 't76' coming from NT27, which is also a terminal. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to work top-down and see if the string can be built from the start symbol.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that S splits into NT19 and NT67 because S has two productions: one with NT45 and NT81, another with NT19 and NT67. Let me see.\n\nIf S uses the second production, S -> NT19 NT67. Then the string would start with symbols derived from NT19 and NT67. So the string starts with t84, which is from either NT84 or another production. Wait, but NT19 is a non-terminal, so it would split into two parts.\n\nLooking at NT19's rules: NT19 -> NT84 NT8 or NT60 NT5. So, if the first symbol is t84, that suggests that the first part of NT19 is producing t84. So, perhaps NT19 -> NT84 NT8.\n\nThen, the first part of the string is t84, which would come from NT84, but wait, NT84 isn't present as a key in the grammar. Alternatively, NT84 might be a terminal, but I don't see a rule that directly produces t84. Instead, I see that NT44 -> 't76', but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the rules. Looking at NT84, is there a rule that produces 't84'? I don't see NT84 -> anything in the provided rules. Hmm. Maybe I need to see if any other non-terminals can produce 't84'.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT60 -> NT30 NT81 or 't84'? Wait, yes! NT60 -> 't84' is a rule. That's promising. So, if NT60 is a non-terminal, it can produce 't84' directly. That would be useful.\n\nWait, but I thought NT60 is split into two non-terminals. Let me check. NT60's rules are NT60 -> NT30 NT81 and NT60 -> 't84'. So, in that case, NT60 can directly produce 't84'.\n\nSo, if the first split is S -> NT19 NT67, then NT67 must produce... what? Let's see what NT67 produces.\n\nLooking for NT67: in the rules, NT67 -> NT30 NT2 or 't2'... no, wait. Wait, in the rules provided:\n\nLooking through, I see NT67 -> 't30' or NT67 -> NT30 NT2. Because in the provided rules, NT67 is mentioned in several places:\n\nWait, let me scan the provided grammar. I see:\n\nNT67 -> NT30 NT2\n\nBut also, earlier in the list, \"NT67 -> NT30 NT2\" appears. So, NT67 can produce 't30' directly or split into NT30 and NT2.\n\nWait, but in our string, the next token after t84 is t22. So that might not fit. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to think of each non-terminal in the split. Let me outline the possible derivation steps.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\n2. Then, expand NT19 and NT67.\n\nFirst, NT19 can produce either NT84 NT8 or NT60 NT5.\n\nSecond, NT67 can produce either NT30 NT2 or 't30'.\n\nWait, so combining this, the initial expansion of S would split into four parts: either (NT84 NT8) and (NT30 NT2) or (NT84 NT8) and 't30', or (NT60 NT5) and (NT30 NT2), or (NT60 NT5) and 't30'.\n\nBut our string starts with t84, so perhaps NT19 needs to produce something that leads to t84. The only way that could happen is if NT19 produces NT84 NT8, which then produces t84 followed by t8. But in our string, we have t84, t22, so maybe it's not NT84 directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the start as S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Then, let's see what those produce.\n\nNT45 \u2192 either NT60 NT77 or 't44'.\n\nNT81 \u2192 either NT30 NT2 or 't30'.\n\nSo, the string starts with t84, which isn't 't44' or 't30', so that might not be the correct path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT19 NT67 is the correct first split. Let's focus on that.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Then:\n\nNT19 can expand into NT84 NT8 or NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-102","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string `t82 t3 t42 t11 t30 t82 t5` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding each part of the problem and how to approach it.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule either has two terminals on the right side or a non-terminal followed by two non-terminals. But wait, looking closer, some rules have more than two non-terminals on the right. Let me check. Oh, no, actually, the given rules are all either of the form NT->NT NT or NT-> terminals. So yes, it's in CNF.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is `t82 t3 t42 t11 t30 t82 t5`. These are all terminal symbols, as they end with 't' followed by numbers. So the string consists of these seven terminal symbols.\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. So, starting from S, each step should replace the non-terminals according to the rules until only terminals remain.\n\nTo do this, I'll likely need to break down the string into parts that match the productions. First, I notice that the first symbol is 't82'. Looking at the grammar, let's find which rule produces 't82'. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT84 -> 't77' and others, but 't82' is produced by NT30, right? Let me confirm:\n\nLooking for rules ending with 't82'... I see NT30 -> 't82' (since '30' is a non-terminal that becomes 't82'). So, the first symbol 't82' must come from NT30.\n\nSo the first symbol is NT30. Now, looking at S's rules: S can produce NT45 NT81. So S is split into NT45 and NT81. This means the entire string must derive from expanding S into NT45 NT81.\n\nWait, but my string starts with 't82' which comes from NT30, so I need to see how NT45 and NT81 can generate parts of this string. Alternatively, maybe I should try to reverse engineer the string.\n\nActually, another approach is to parse the string from the start, step by step, trying to find an applicable production each time. Alternatively, I can try to find which parts of the string could come from each step of the grammar.\n\nLet's see. The string has seven symbols: t82, t3, t42, t11, t30, t82, t5. So, we can think of the string as a sequence of seven terminals. Since S starts as NT45 NT81 and NT19 NT67, but looking at the string, maybe S should generate NT30 somewhere, which would be the first symbol.\n\nWait, maybe that's conflicting because S's initial expansions don't directly produce t82. So, perhaps the string doesn't belong to the language generated by this grammar. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, let's look again. The production S -> NT45 NT81, which is two non-terminals, so the entire string's first two elements must come from these two. But 't82' is the first symbol, which is produced by NT30. So does NT45 or NT81 lead to NT30? Let me look through the rules.\n\nLooking at the left-hand sides, NT30 appears on the right-hand side of several rules. For example, looking at NT14: NT14 -> NT25 NT52. Not helpful. Let's see if any production ends with NT30.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT30 -> 't82', which is the terminal. But also, looking for where NT30 is on the left: for example, NT8 -> NT83 NT75, etc. Wait, not seeing NT30 appearing on the left. So, the only way a t82 can come from NT30 is if it's directly through that rule. So, perhaps the first NT is NT30, which would make the string start with t82.\n\nBut in the S production, S splits into NT45 NT81. So, how can NT45 or NT81 lead to NT30?\n\nWait, perhaps NT30 is generated by another production. Let me check other rules: Oh, looking at NT12 -> NT40 NT13. Not relevant. How about NT81: the rules are NT81 -> 't71', etc. So NT81 can't become NT30. Wait, let me look for NT45: NT45 -> 't60' is not correct, but in the given rules, I see NT45 -> NT60 NT77, then NT60 -> 't84', and NT77 -> 't8'. Let me see that chain.\n\nWait, but to get NT30, perhaps through other paths. But looking through the left-hand sides, I don't see any production that has NT30 as the left-hand side except for the terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the string starts with t82, which comes from NT30. So, maybe in the derivation, somewhere in the expansion, we have to have NT30, which can only be reached via certain paths.\n\nLet me see the rules leading into NT30. For example, looking for rules that have NT30 on the right side.\n\nYes, I see that NT5 -> NT9 NT53, NT13 -> 't47', etc. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try building a parse tree or see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that the string has 't82' at the beginning, so perhaps the leftmost non-terminal is NT30, which produces t82. But looking at the S rules, S splits into NT45 and NT81, so the first symbol is produced by NT45. So how can NT45 produce t82? Let me see the rules leading from NT45: the production is NT45 -> NT60 NT77. Then, NT60-> 't84' and NT77->'t8'.\n\nWait, but 't84' is 't8' followed by 't4'? Because t84 is 't8' 't4'? No, looking back, no, each rule's right-hand side is either two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Each production's right side is either a terminal or the combination of two non-terminals. So, each symbol is separate. For example, the production NT45 -> NT60 NT77, which in the string would translate to a symbol from NT60 and another from NT77. But if one of those non-terminals ends with 't25', which is not our case here.\n\nWait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's break down each symbol in the string and see what non-terminals they might come from.\n\nThe string is: t82, t3, t42, t11, t30, t82, t5.\n\nEach of these, except perhaps t3, t11, t5, t30, comes from a specific production.\n\nLet's list each symbol and what non-terminal it comes from:\n\n1. t82: from NT30 (since NT30 -> 't82').\n2. t3: from which non-terminal? Looking for NT3 producing 't3'. Scanning the productions, I don't see any NT3 rule, but I do see NT36 -> 't42', NT30->'t82', etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no NT3 rule, so t3 must come from another production. Maybe it's part of a two-symbol non-terminal production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to see if the entire string can be generated step by step.\n\nStart with S, which is NT45 NT81.\n\nLet's check if the first symbol of the string 't82' can be derived from either NT45 or NT81.\n\nLooking at NT45's production: NT45 -> NT60 NT77.\n\nSo, the first symbol would come from NT60 or NT77.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all the production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar consists of various non-terminal symbols (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) and terminal symbols (like 't' followed by a number or just a number, and some that are single letters like 't25', 't8', etc.). The string provided has several terminal symbols, so our goal is to see if we can derive this string by applying the grammar rules step by step.\n\nThe string is: t82 t71 t42 t11 t30 t82 t5.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the grammar and seeing which non-terminals can produce each of these terminals. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each element in the string must come from some production rule in the grammar, possibly after expansions of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT81 -> NT44 NT77, but also NT81 appears in the string as 't81' (though in this case, it's split as 't82 t71 t42...' so wait, no. Let me check the string again: the string is \"t82 t71 t42 t11 t30 t82 t5\". So each element is a terminal, so 't82', 't71', etc. So in the string, each 't' followed by two digits is a terminal.\n\nBut actually, looking at the grammar, some terminals are two digits, like 't82', 't71', etc. Others are single letters like 't', but in the string, it's written as 't82', so I think each token is interpreted as a sequence of 't's and digits. Wait, no, that's not how the grammar is written. Wait, the grammar's terminals are things like 't25' which are two characters, or single letters like 't'. The string is a sequence of symbols like 't82', 't71', etc.\n\nSo the string is: t82 t71 t42 t11 t30 t82 t5.\n\nEach of these is a terminal symbol in the grammar. So for the string, each part is a terminal, so we need to find a production that directly produces each of these terms or derive them through non-terminals.\n\nLet me look at the grammar to see which non-terminals directly produce these terminals.\n\nFor example, looking at NT81 -> 't71' is one of the rules? Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT81 -> 't71', but I see S -> NT45 NT81, etc. Maybe I need to find a non-terminal that directly produces 't82', 't71', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT45 -> 't25'\nWait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking for NT that produce 't82': I see NT81 -> 't71', but not 't82'. Hmm, wait, the string includes 't82', 't42', 't30', 't82' again. Let's check the grammar rules.\n\nWait, looking for terminals, let's list all the terminals from the grammar:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- 't25', 't8', 't77', 't72', 't71', 't9', 't5', 't36', 't40', 't14', 't84', 't8', 't45', 't60', 't30', 't9', 't5', 't71', 't12', 't47', 't52', 't9', 't53', 't61', 't5', 't45', 't50', 't39', 't83', 't7', 't2', 't5', 't30', 't9', 't26', 't39', 't12', 't8', 't47', 't75', 't72', 't76', 't27', 't35', 't2', 't5', 't30', 't9', 't26', 't39', 't52', 't71', 't75', 't32', 't44', 't59', 't52', 't83', 't30', 't9', 't22', 't23', 't71', 't50', 't83', 't44', 't59', 't52', 't71', 't75', 't32', 't44', 't59', 't52', 't83', 't30', 't9', 't22', 't23', 't22', 't25', 't33', etc. Wait, this might be a list of all the terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look at the rules that end with a terminal:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT45 -> 't25'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT72 -> 't10'\n- NT60 -> 't84'\n- NT71 -> 't9'\n- NT58 -> 't27'\n- NT75 -> 't72'\n- NT36 -> 't84'\n- NT40 -> 't14'\n- NT19 -> 't84' or 't5' or 't60' (wait, looking back: NT19's production is NT84 NT8 and NT60 NT5).\n\nWait, in the grammar, S is initially NT45 NT81, and NT45 is 't25' and NT81 is something else.\n\nLooking again, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I need to approach this more systematically.\n\nEach part of the string is a terminal symbol, so I need to find a way for those terminals to be generated by the grammar. So let's look at each terminal in the string and see if it can be produced directly by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. t82\n2. t71\n3. t42\n4. t11\n5. t30\n6. t82\n7. t5\n\nNow, let's check the grammar for any NT that directly produce these terms.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- Is there any rule where the LHS is an NT and the RHS is 't82'?

The string is `t84 t49 t77 t30 t25 t30 t82 t5`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have production rules where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or one terminal symbol. So, looking at the grammar, each rule seems to fit that structure\u2014either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. From the grammar, S can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So, the first step is to see if the string starts with either NT45 or NT19. \n\nBut the string starts with t84. I recall that when a production rule produces a terminal, it's done directly. So, I should check if any non-terminal symbol in the RHS directly produces t84. Looking through the productions, I see NT45 -> t77 and NT44 -> t76, but where is t84 coming from?\n\nWait, wait. Let me check the productions again. Oh, I see NT44 -> t76 and NT27 -> t35, but I'm not seeing t84 directly. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe t84 is derived from a chain of productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t84. Let's trace where that could come from. I look through all the productions where a terminal is on the RHS and see which terminals are present:\n\n- NT44 -> t76\n- NT45 -> t77\n- NT36 -> t42\n- NT81 -> t71\n- NT9 -> t26\n- NT22 -> t22 (wait, that's a terminal generating itself, but that's a problem. It would cause a loop.)\n\nWait, there's a production NT22 -> t22, which is a direct recursion. That might not be helpful unless in combination with other productions. Let's see if any rules generate t84.\n\nLooking at the productions, I only see NT40 -> t39, NT27 -> t35, NT44 -> t76, NT25 -> t33, and NT75 -> t32. I don't see t84 anywhere. Hmm, that seems odd. Did I miss any?\n\nWait, the production NT45 -> t77 and NT36 -> t42. How does t84 get produced? Maybe it's part of a production chain. Let me check if any non-terminals can produce t84.\n\nLooking again, there's NT77 -> t8, which is a terminal. So, perhaps t77 can produce t8. Wait, but NT77 is a non-terminal, and looking back, do any productions have NT77 on the LHS?\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT77 -> t8, so it's a terminal. That means NT77 is a non-terminal that directly produces t8, no further derivation. So, t84 isn't appearing as a terminal in any of the productions, except perhaps as part of a non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the productions for t84. Looking through each production, I don't see any non-terminal producing t84. So, it's possible that t84 is only present in the string because a non-terminal on the LHS of a production expands to it. But if no non-terminal on the RHS directly produces t84, that would mean the string can't be derived from the grammar, right?\n\nWait, but the string has t84 as the first token. So, in the derivation, the first step would involve S producing NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So, the first two non-terminals in the string must be either (NT45, NT81) or (NT19, NT67). \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t84, which would have to come from NT45 or NT19, but neither of their productions directly produce t84. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT45: NT45 -> t77, so that's a terminal. So, if the first token is t84, it would have to come from a different path. Alternatively, maybe T84 is part of a chain that starts with another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the productions. Let me think again. If NT45 is part of a production, say S -> NT45 NT81, then in the string, we have t84. But NT45 is a non-terminal, and its productions go to t77 or in another rule, like NT45 -> NT44 or something? Or wait, looking at the beginning of the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT45 -> NT60 NT77, and NT77 -> t8. Also, NT60 -> NT84 NT53, and NT84 is a non-terminal that can be broken down into NT39 NT25. Wait, this is getting complex. Maybe I should try to expand the string step by step, tracing back possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the string has t84 as the first token, but the grammar doesn't have a rule that produces t84 directly. So, unless it's generated by a chain that somehow reduces to t84, it might not be in the language.\n\nWait, another approach: let's look for the presence of t84 in the grammar. From the given productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t84. The only non-terminals that produce terminals are for t77, t72, t67, t82, t53, t5, etc., but not t84. Therefore, t84 must be generated by a non-terminal that eventually produces it through a path.\n\nBut looking, do any non-terminals have t84 in their productions? Looking at the RHS of each production, I don't see any non-terminal symbol being replaced by t84. So, the only way t84 can appear is if it's part of a production chain that leads to it as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps someone got confused. Let's check all productions. Looking through each RHS, I see NT44 -> t76, NT36 -> t42, etc. There's no non-terminal on the LHS that directly produces t84. Therefore, in the entire grammar, there's no way to derive \"t84\" as a terminal from any non-terminal. That would mean the string containing \"t84\" cannot be derived from this grammar.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because I might have missed something. Let me double-check each production to see if any of them have \"t84\" as a terminal.\n\nLooking through each LHS, each production's RHS is either two non-terminals or one terminal. I need to see if any RHS has a terminal token that's \"t84\". Scanning each production, I don't see \"t84\" in any of them. So, \"t84\" is only present in the string. That must mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because there's no rule that produces \"t84\" as a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the answer should be No. But wait, let me confirm once more. The string starts with t84, which is not produced by any production in the grammar. So, the string can't be derived from S.\n<\/think>\n\nNo\n\nThe string cannot be generated by the given grammar because the term `t84` is not directly produced by any production in the grammar. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT81 -> 't71' (From line NT81 -> 't71') but that's not t82.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar more carefully.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the productions for each terminal in the string.\n\nOur string is: t82 t30 t42 t49 t76 t30 t82 t5.\n\nSo terminals present are t82, t30, t42, t49, t76, t82, t5.\n\nLet me cross-reference each terminal with the grammar productions:\n\nt82 appears in NT83 or perhaps other. Wait, in the grammar, looking:\n\nWait, in line NT40 -> 't39' but that's not t82.\n\nNT75 -> 't72' (But nt72 is part of NT71 production). Wait, perhaps I should look for NT82?\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT82 is not listed. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT75 -> 't32'\n\nWait, maybe it's further down. Let's go through each production.\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\nNT84 -> 't77'\n\nNT23 -> 't14'\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different approach. Maybe I should find the minimal leftmost derivation for the string.\n\nThe string is: t82 t30 t42 t49 t76 t30 t82 t5.\n\nLet me think of the entire sequence as the target string.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the derivation would involve non-terminals expanding into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, but since it's CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, the string's length is 8 terms. Since each production could increase the length by 1, starting from the start symbol S, which might produce two non-terminals, so perhaps the leftmost derivation would need to produce a tree where the leaves correspond to the terminals in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the string is built by a series of productions, each step expanding one non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the parse tree by recursively checking if each substring can be generated.\n\nLet me attempt to see if each component can be derived.\n\nFirst, let me check if t82 can be generated by any NT.\n\nLooking through non-terminals:\n\nLooking for NT that can produce t82. Scanning through the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces t82. All the productions for NT like NT45 produce 't25', NT76 produces 't76', etc. So perhaps t82 is a result of a multi-step expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe I need to see how the NTs can derive to t82.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nIn line NT75 -> 't32', and NT69 isn't present. Maybe I'm too focused on 't's. Let me list all NTs and their productions.\n\nThe grammar has several NTs with multiple productions. For example, NT9 -> 't26' (though that's not in the string), NT5 -> 't53', etc. Wait, perhaps I should look for the NTs that can derive into the required 't's.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is composed of t82 t30 t42 t49 t76 t30 t82 t5.\n\nI can start by trying to find pairs of non-terminals that can expand into these sequences.\n\nFor example, the string starts with t82, which might come from a production of a non-terminal that becomes t82 when expanded.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT with a production that directly results in t82. Let me check:\n\nNT72 -> 't10' and 't44'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go back through the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at NT71: NT71 -> NT9 NT75, among others. So NT71 can produce a sequence that includes t26 and t32 (from NT9 -> t26 and NT75 -> t32), but that leads to t26 t32, not t82.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT23: it's used to produce t14, which is in the string? No, our string has t5, etc. Let's think step by step.\n\nLet me start from the string and see if each word is a terminal and if that can be derived from any NT in the grammar.\n\nStart with t82:\n\nLooking for an NT that can produce t82. Scanning through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t82. So maybe it's a result of multiple steps.\n\nSimilarly, the second word is t30, which is in the grammar as NT81 -> 't71' and NT30 -> 't82', but that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, this seems challenging. Maybe I should build a dependency tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into pairs that match Leftmost derivations.\n\nLet me think about the structure:\n\nWe have 8 symbols: t82, t30, t42, t49, t76, t30, t82, t5.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step introduces one terminal or two non-terminals. Since the string is 8 terminals, the number of steps would be 8, meaning that from S, we'd have to expand in such a way that each production either produces two non-terminals or one terminal, building up until we have eight"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the string is structured. The string is a sequence of 9 tokens: t82, t3, t42, t82, t3, t8, t30, t82, t5. So, it's nine elements long. \n\nIn CNF grammars, the structure of the string must correspond to a binary tree of productions. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until the leaves are terminals. The number of terminals in a string derived from a CNF grammar with n steps is n+1. Here, the string has 9 terminals, which means there should be 8 non-terminals in total.\n\nLooking at the string length, it's 9 terminals. For a CNF grammar, the number of non-terminals needed to reach this string would be 8. Each level of the tree halves the number of non-terminals until you reach leaves. But wait, in CNF, each production results in two symbols, so the derivation tree is binary, and the number of terminals is one more than the number of productions. So, 9 terminals would require 8 productions, hence 8 non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of steps in the derivation is related to the length of the string. For a string of length n, the number of derivations is n-1. So, for 9 terminals, you have 8 steps. Each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the total number of non-terminals in the string would be 9.\n\nBut perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the given rules.

The string is `t82 t71 t42 t82 t71 t8 t30 t82 t5`. Hmm, that's quite a long string, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It seems like all the rules are non-terminals expanding into two other non-terminals or terminals. Some rules have terminals as their right-hand sides, which probably mark the end of a derivation.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, I can see that the grammar uses both types of rules.\n\nMy approach should be to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. If I can successfully derive the string by expanding non-terminals according to the grammar, then it's generated. Otherwise, it's not.\n\nLet me list the possible rules for each terminal in the string. The string has the following terminals: t82, t71, t42, t8, t30, t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules to find where these terminals appear as results.\n\nWait, I notice that some rules end with terminals.

That's helpful because it might be easier to check if the string can be formed.\n\nLet's map out each terminal in the string and see if there's a rule that can produce it:\n\n1. t82: Is there a non-terminal rule that produces 't82'? Looking through the rules, I see NT81 -> 't30' and NT84 -> 't77', etc. Wait, no. Let me check again. Scanning through the rules, I don't immediately see a rule that ends with 't82'.

Scanning through:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't39' \u2192 t39 is a terminal.\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't82'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't7'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n\nWait, no, NT81 appears in a rule where it's part of another production, like S \u2192 NT81 NT45, so that's not terminal.\n\nWait, looking for 't82':\n\nIn the rules, I see NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT82. Wait, that's NT81 expanding into two non-terminals: NT30 and NT82. Then, NT30 expands into 't82' according to another rule.\n\nSo, looking at the production rules, I see that NT81 can produce NT30 NT82. Then, NT30 can produce 't82'. Wait, but in the problem, the string starts with 't82 t71 t42 t82 t71 t8 t30 t82 t5'. So let's parse this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider each token in the string and see if there's a path in the grammar. Let me list the tokens:\n\nPositions:\n\n1: t82\n\n2: t71\n\n3: t42\n\n4: t82\n\n5: t71\n\n6: t8\n\n7: t30\n\n8: t82\n\n9: t5\n\nSo each of these can be terminals produced by certain non-terminals. Now, in order to derive the string, each token must be either a terminal produced directly or via expansion of non-terminals.\n\nLet me check each position for a corresponding non-terminal that can produce it.\n\n- t82: must come from a non-terminal that can produce t82. So looking through the grammar, NT81 can produce 't82' via NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT82, so the NT82 rule is NT12 \u2192 something? Wait no, looking back, NT82 isn't a rule. Wait, no, in the rules, I see NT82 doesn't appear directly. Wait, in the given grammar, the rules are for specific non-terminals like NT82 doesn't appear as a left-hand side. So maybe I'm wrong before.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's ensure that all the rules are correctly parsed. The grammar is given in the problem, so let me clarify:\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the grammar has rules like:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't42'\n\nSimilarly, others:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't83'\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, okay, so the way to get a terminal is when a non-terminal rule's right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nSo looking at the string:\n\nt82: is there a non-terminal that can produce t82? Let's look at the rules. Scanning the rules, we see:\n\n- Does any Non-terminal rule have 't82' as a result? Looking at the rules, I don't immediately see that. The rules have t77, t26, t39, t3, t83, t30, etc. So it seems that unless a non-terminal can produce 't82' through a multi-step expansion, it won't be possible. Wait, but in the rules, is there any rule that leads to 't82'?\n\nWait, I see that NT81 -> NT30 NT82, but NT82 isn't a left-hand side in any rule. So that can't be. Wait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't9'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each rule again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't42'\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n\n- NT77 -> 't7'\n\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n\n- NT45 -> 't60'\n\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n\nWait a second, the rule for NT30 is \"NT30 \u2192 't82'\". So that means NT30 can directly produce the terminal 't82'. So that's correct. So, when I have 't82' in the string, I can expand NT30 to 't82'. Similarly, 't71' would need to be produced by a certain non-terminal.\n\nSo for 't82', I can get that from NT30. Now, let's see how the entire string can be broken down using these rules.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt82 t71 t4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, first, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only terminals are 't' followed by numbers, like 't8', 't25', etc., but wait, some are like 't5' which seems similar to 't5'. So the string provided has several 't' terms. The string is `t82 t71 t30 t3 t14 t82 t30 t8 t82 t5`. So ten tokens, all are 't' plus a number.\n\nNow, the CFG starts with S and through a series of productions, it generates these strings. Each non-terminal (like S, NT1, etc.) has productions that break down into other non-terminals and terminals. The task is to see if the string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's list the productions to see how they can lead to terminals. Since CNF, every step goes from one non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking closely, some of the productions end with a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT81 \u2192 't30'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT82 (Wait, does any NT produce 't82'? Let me check the productions. Scanning through, I see NT36 \u2192 't42', NT40 \u2192 't39', NT71 \u2192 't52', NT52 \u2192 't71', etc. Hmm, I don't see an explicit 't82' production. Wait, no, the string has 't82' multiple times, so where does that come from? Maybe a production that eventually ends in 't82'?\n\nWait, perhaps we should see the structure of the grammar. Alternatively, maybe I can work backwards from the string and see if each 't' can be broken down to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simpler to track the possible steps.\n\nLet me consider each token and see if it can be generated.\n\nLet's take the first token 't82'. Are there any non-terminals that directly produce 't82'? Looking at the productions, I don't see a direct rule for any NT to produce 't82'. The highest is 't84' from NT84, which is a terminal, but none like 't82'. So perhaps 't82' is produced through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT45 \u2192 't25' and 't77' (Wait, no, NT84 \u2192 't77', right? Yes, line 1: NT84 -> 't77'. Then, NT77 \u2192 't8'. So NT77 would produce 't8'. But how to get 't82'?\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo, maybe 't82' is supposed to be 't77'. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, let's look at the productions again. For example, NT71 \u2192 NT9 NT75. Hmm. Let's try to find a way to get 't82'.\n\nLooking for any non-terminals that can produce 't82' directly. I don't see any rules ending with 't82' except perhaps via a chain. Let me check:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45. Hmm, maybe if I can get to NT36 which can go to 't42' (NT36 \u2192 't42'), but that's not 82.\n\nWait, maybe 't82' is from NT53 or NT19 or something else.\n\nWait, looking at NT40 \u2192 't39', but that's 39.\n\nHmm, perhaps 't82' isn't directly produced by any rule, but let's see. Wait, maybe I'm missing a production.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I notice NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, which produces 't77 t8'. NT71 \u2192 NT9 NT75, which could then produce various things.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to get 't82' is through a longer chain. Let's see if there's a non-terminal that produces 't82'. Perhaps NT82 isn't present, but maybe through combining steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar doesn't include 't82' as a terminal, but in the given string, 't82' is present. If none of the CTGs directly produce 't82', then the string can't be generated. But wait, maybe it's a combination.\n\nWait, maybe let's try to see how each 't' token can be produced. Let's take 't82' first.\n\nLooking for any rule that produces 't82' directly. Let's scan through the productions:\n\nLine 3: NT5 \u2192 't9' (Wait, no, line 3: NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53.

Maybe it's better to see what terminals are actually possible.\n\nLooking at the productions, we see:\n\nNT84 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo 't77' and 't8' are produced by NT84 and NT77.\n\nWhat about NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44. So, NT72 can split into NT10 and NT44. Hmm. NT10 is produced by NT50 and NT47: NT50 \u2192 NT49 NT49 (assuming), but I'm not seeing that.\n\nWait, no, NT50 \u2192 NT49? Or wait, looking at the productions, line 19: NT50 \u2192 NT83 NT7 (Wait, no: looking back, in the list provided, there's line 17: NT50 \u2192 't49'. So NT50 can produce 't49'.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) is made up of production rules, and the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires each production to have two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to be in CNF because all productions on the right have either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: t82, t30, t30, t35, t84, t28, t47, t32, t82, t5.\n\nMy plan is to reverse engineer how this string could have been generated by the grammar. Since it's a tree structure, I can think of each terminal as a leaf node, and each non-terminal as a parent connecting two children.\n\nLet me start by identifying possible non-terminals that can produce t82 and see if they connect appropriately. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT82 appears in some productions. Wait, actually, I don't see NT82 in the right-hand sides of any production. Let me check the rules again. Oh, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT82 production. Hmm, that makes me think that the string might not be valid because maybe there's no way to get t82 from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for how t82 can be generated. Let me see. Looking at the terminal rules:\n\n- t82 appears on NT44, NT61, NT81, etc., but no production starts with NT82. So if t82 is in the string, it must come from a non-terminal that can derive t82. Let's check the grammar for any non-terminals that produce t82.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT27 -> 't35' (I think that might be t35)\nWait, I'm looking for non-terminals where 't82' is a result. Maybe NT60 has a rule that leads to t82. Let me check NT60: The production for NT60 is NT30 NT81. So NT60 can generate t30 and t81. So if t82 is in the string, it's not coming directly from a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminal rules and see where t82 comes from. From the rules:\n\nLooking for t82 as a terminal:\n\n- NT60 -> 't82'? Wait, in the given grammar, NT60 is defined as NT30 NT81. So NT60 produces t30 and t81, not t82. So t82 must come from another non-terminal. Let me check if any other non-terminals have t82.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT44 has 't82', but according to the rule, NT44 -> 't59', NT47, and NT44 is derived from something else. Wait no, wait NT44 is a non-terminal on the left side of a production, so it must be expanded into two non-terminals. Let me check the production for NT44. From the given grammar, NT44 -> NT27 NT76 or something? No, looking again, the production for NT44 is NT84 NT76?\n\nWait, no, the production for NT44 is:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT44 -> 't84', but that can't be because that's a terminal. Wait, I'm looking for which non-terminals have terminals in their productions. Let's list them:\n\nCheck each rule for any that have 't' as the only thing on the right:\n\n- NT2 -> t5\n- NT53 -> t30\n- NT27 -> t76\n- NT23 -> t14\n- NT36 -> t42\n- NT39 -> t28\n- NT30 -> t82\n- NT19 -> t84\n- NT81 -> t30, but also appears elsewhere\n- NT60 -> t82 (Wait, actually, no. Wait, looking again, the rule is NT60 -> NT30 NT81, which then generate t30 and t81. So NT60 can generate t30 and t81, but that doesn't produce t82.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me list all the terminal rules again to see where they come from:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, whenever a production has a terminal on the right-hand side, that's how it's generated. So here are the terminals:\n\n- NT2 -> t5\n- NT53 -> t30\n- NT27 -> t76\n- NT23 -> t14\n- NT36 -> t42\n- NT39 -> t28\n- NT30 -> t82\n- NT19 -> t84\n- NT81 -> t30, t36 (from NT81 -> NT36 NT53), t82 (look at NT81's rule: it's written as NT81 -> ... and one of them is t30? Wait, checking NT81:\n\nThe rules are:\n\nNT81 -> NT36 NT53\nNT81 -> NT36 NT53\nWait, no, looking again, I think I might have misread that. Let me find all the rules for terminals:\n\nLooking through each line, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT39 -> 't28'\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n- NT19 -> 't84' and 't5' (Wait, no, looking at the rules for NT19:\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8 and NT45 NT5. Wait, but no, looking at the rules, NT19 is on the left, so production is:\n\nWait, the original CFG has:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\n\nS -> NT19 NT67\n\nAnd so on. So looking for NT19, the production is NT19 -> NT84 NT8 and NT45 NT5. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list each NT and their possible rules.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to build the parse tree for the string.\n\nThe string is: t82, t30, t30, t35, t84, t28, t47, t32, t82, t5.\n\nSince it's a sequence of terminals, each must come from a non-terminal at some level.\n\nLet me see if t82 is possible. The first token is t82. From the grammar, where is t82 generated? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT60 -> 't82' no, wait: The production for NT60 is NT30 NT81, so t30 and t81. So t82 isn't a direct terminal from NT60.\n\nLooking further, are there any non-terminals that produce t82 directly? Checking each rule, I don't see any where a single terminal is t82 except perhaps NT40, but NT40 isn't a terminal\u2014it's NT71.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at every production and see where 't82' appears. Maybe as the result of a production, but I'm not seeing any such rules.\n\nWait, let me go back to the rules. Looking at all the productions, I see rules that say:\n\n- NT44 -> 't84'\n- NT44 can produce 't84' but that's not t82.\n- NT32: Wait, NT32 isn't defined as a terminal. Looking through, maybe NT30 produces 't82'? Yes! Because NT30 is defined as:\n\nLooking at the rules: Yes, indeed, the rule is NT30 -> 't82'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t82, which suggests that NT30 is one of the nodes at the top. But how does that fit into the grammar?\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT45 NT81 and other options. Let me see:\n\nS can be NT45 followed by NT81, or NT19 followed by NT67, etc.\n\nSo, S is a combination of two non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-174","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t82 t30 t49 t49 t77 t30 t49 t59 t30 t82 t5` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember has production rules where each non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The productions for S are:\n- S -> NT45 NT81\n- S -> NT19 NT67\n\nSo, the initial steps involve breaking down S into one of these two forms. Let me think about each possibility.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t82. Let's check the productions for the non-terminals that directly produce these terminal symbols. For example, in the provided rules, NT27 -> 't36' is not there, but I need to check all rules. Wait, looking through the rules, some NTs produce terminals. Let me list out all the NTs that produce terminals:\n\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT8 -> 't83'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT60 -> 't84'\n- NT81 -> 't30', 't3', etc.\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT81 -> 't45' \u2014 Wait, no, some of these are non-terminals, like NT45, which has rules that produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, looking carefully:\n- NT81 -> 't30' (for example, production NT60 -> 't84', NT81 -> 't30').\n\nSo, in the string, the first word is t82, which comes from NT30 -> 't82'. So, the string starts with NT30. So, somewhere in the derivation, we must have a production that starts with NT30. But in the grammar, only NT81 and NT30 are the ones producing 't...'. So, perhaps at the beginning, a NT30 is derived from NT81 or another NT. Let's see.\n\nBut starting with S, which produces NT45 NT81. So the first step is S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. So the first two symbols would be the results of these two productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t82 and t30. Let me see if these can be produced by some NTs derived from S.\n\nWait, S produces two NTs. So the first token is t82, which is from NT30. The second token is t30, which could be from NT40 or NT81, etc. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to reverse engineer the string by seeing if each token can be produced by a NT, and then check if their parents can also be formed by the productions.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into tokens and see if each can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t82 t30 t49 t49 t77 t30 t49 t59 t30 t82 t5.\n\nSo the tokens are in order: t82, t30, t49, t49, t77, t30, t49, t59, t30, t82, t5.\n\nI'll start from the first token, t82. It comes from NT30 -> 't82'.\n\nNow, the second token is t30, which comes from NT30 again because there's a production NT30 NT... Well, but in the grammar, S produces two NTs, so after t82 comes another NT30. Wait, but S can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's see if t30 can come from NT45 or NT81.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT81 -> 't30' (among others), and NT45 -> 't60' and others, but does NT45 produce 't30'? Checking, I don't see NT45 -> 't30' in the rules. So, the second token must come from NT81 producing 't30'.\n\nSo, the first two NTs are NT30 and NT81.\n\nNow, S can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Wait, so if the first part is NT45 and NT81, but our first two are NT30 and NT81, which doesn't fit S's initial productions. Because S would produce NT45 and NT81, which are different from NT30 and NT81. So maybe I'm mixing this up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial S produces NT30 and something else, but from the given rules, S's direct productions are only NT45 NT81 and NT19 NT67. So that makes me think that t82 and t30 must come from the children of these.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider that for each token, I'll find which NT it could come from, and then check if the NTs can be connected back via the grammar.\n\nSo, starting with t82: it can come from NT30, since NT30 -> 't82'.\n\nNext token is t30: it can also come from NT30 (as mentioned before).\n\nNow, looking at the grammar for NT30: according to the rules, NT30 appears on the left-hand side (LHS) of several productions. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT30 is in the LHS of several productions. For example:\n- NT30 -> 't82' (from rule)\n- There are also rules like NT30 -> NT9 NT45.\n\nBut I need to see if the grammar can have NT30 producing 't82' followed by another NT30, which is then producing 't30'.\n\nWait, but the second token is 't30', so if the first NT30 outputs 't82', the next NT30 would need to produce 't30'. So, the initial part is 't82 t30', which would correspond to NT30 followed by NT30.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the production for NT30 is 't82' or other combinations. So, perhaps each 't...' token in the string is coming from a separate NT production.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can reconstruct the steps.\n\nThe string starts with t82 t30, which could be NT30 (from t82) followed by NT30 (from t30).\n\nSo, the first step is S -> NT30 NT30.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, S can only produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So, unless NT30 can be derived from NT45 or NT81, which would require rewriting. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps each 't' token in the string corresponds to a leaf in the parse tree. So the entire string must correspond to a sequence of derivations from S, expanding step by step. Let me try building the parse tree.\n\nLet's consider the entire string as a series of symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost and rightmost symbols must directly come from NT productions that produce terminal symbols.\n\nSo, let's try the leftmost approach.\n\n1. Start with S. The first symbol is t82, which must come from NT30, so S must have a production where the first NT is NT30.\n\nBut from the given S rules, the only productions are S -> NT45 NT81 and S -> NT19 NT67. So, neither of these starts with NT30. Therefore, S must derive a NT30, but S's only options are NT45 or NT19 as the first symbol. So, how can NT30 appear as the first symbol?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the NT30 production again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT30 is on the LHS of several productions: NT30 -> 't82', NT30 -> NT9 NT45, etc. So, the only way NT30 can appear on the left is if it's being rewritten.\n\nTherefore, maybe the initial S can produce NT30 somehow, but from the current S rules, S can't directly produce NT30. So, perhaps the first NT is NT30, but since S's rules start with NT45 or NT19, it's impossible unless there's a rewrite rule for NT45 or NT19 that can produce NT30.\n\nLooking at the rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So for example, NT45 \u2192 't25' would mean that when NT45 is expanded, it produces a terminal 't' followed by 25.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nI think I read it wrong. Let me parse each production line:\n\nThe lines are structured as NTxx -> either other NTs or 't'+number.\n\nFor example, first line: NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75.\n\nSecond: NT0 \u2192 NT47 NT53.\n\nThird: NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13.\n\nWait, wait, each line is like NT## \u2192 either something or 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo for example, NT72 \u2192 't10' 't44'? No, wait, looking at the lines:\n\nWait, for example, the line \"NT45 -> 't25'\" means that NT45 is replaced by t25. So the terminal t is followed by 25, so the string includes \"t25\".\n\nWait, but in the string given, I have terms like t84, t30, etc.\n\nSo starting with option 1: S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nSo the string should start with the terminal produced by NT45, then the terminal produced by NT81.\n\nBut wait, let me check NT45's productions. Let's look for any production for NT45.\n\nI see \"NT45 -> 't25'\". So NT45 can only produce 't25' directly.\n\nThen NT81 has two productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT81 appears in a few lines:\n\nLine 9: NT81 \u2192 't71', and line 10? Wait:\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar seems to have several lines for each NT. Let me list the productions for NT81:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nLine 12: \"NT81 \u2192 't71'\" (I think, need to check)\n\nWait, actually, I need to carefully check each production. Let me go through each NT line by line.\n\nScanning through, I see:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't47'\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n\nThese are some NT productions.\n\nLooking for NT81:\n\nI think line 8: NT81 \u2192 't71' (from: NT81 \u2192 't71').\n\nAnd another line: NT81 \u2192 't30'?\n\nWait, line 18: \"NT81 -> 't30'\"\n\nWait, so NT81 can produce 't71' or 't30'.\n\nSo, going back, in option 1: S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nSo NT45 produces 't25', and NT81 can produce 't71' or 't30'.\n\nSo if we take NT81 as 't71', then the first two parts of the string would be 't25 t71', but the string starts with 't84', so that's a mismatch.\n\nIf NT81 is 't30', then the first two parts would be 't25 t30', but the string starts with 't84', which is different.\n\nWait, but the string is longer. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of a parse tree.\n\nAnother approach: the entire string must be derived from S, so it's a sequence of expansions where, at each step, a production is applied until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut parsing this manually might be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for possible splits.\n\nWait, the string is 13 tokens long. Let me count: t84 (1), t30 (2), t3 (3), t13 (4), t49 (5), t84 (6), t59 (7), t13 (8), t32 (9), t25 (10), t82 (11), t5 (12). Wait, no, wait. Let me recount: the string is:\n\nt84, t30, t3, t13, t49, t84, t59, t13, t32, t25, t82, t5.\n\nThat's 12 tokens. Wait, am I counting correctly? Let me check:\n\n1: t84\n\n2: t30\n\n3: t3\n\n4: t13\n\n5: t49\n\n6: t84\n\n7: t59\n\n8: t13\n\n9: t32\n\n10: t25\n\n11: t82\n\n12: t5\n\nYes, 12 tokens.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT45 NT81, which each produce terminals, the entire string would have to come from expanding those two NTs.\n\nSo starting with S, which expands to two NTs, each of which eventually expand to terminals, so the string is the combination of their terminal expansions.\n\nBut this seems complicated, perhaps I can try to find how the tokens can be split.\n\nAnother idea: maybe we can split the string into two parts, front part from NT45 and the rest from NT81.\n\nGiven that, let's take the first token as t84 from NT45? But from earlier, NT45 only produces 't25', which is t25, not t84. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, wait, so the initial assumption that S \u2192 NT45 NT81 is the first step, but the first token is t84. So if S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then the first production would be 't25' (from NT45) and then the second production. But the string starts with t84, so that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps S must expand to the other production: S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nSo let's check that path.\n\nS \u2192 NT19 NT67: so the string starts with the first NT19 producing t... and then NT67 produces t...?\n\nLooking at NT19 productions:\n\nFrom the grammar: \"NT19 -> NT60 NT53\" and \"NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\". So NT19 can produce either a combination of NTs or a specific terminal.\n\nWait, let me look for NT19's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLine 17: NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT53.\n\nLine 20: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8.\n\nSo NT19 can either be produced by"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to determine if the string \"t82 t30 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t14 t49 t59 t82 t5\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form consists of production rules where each non-terminal symbol is replaced by exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. The string needs to be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice a few key points. The start symbol is S, and the production rules for S are either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the initial step from S must produce either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67.\n\nNow, the input string starts with \"t82 t30 t30 t...\" and ends with \"t5\". I need to see how these terminals can be derived from the production rules.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S: The first symbols are t82 and t30. Looking at the grammar, I see that t82 is generated by NT81 (as per the rules: NT81 -> 't82'). Similarly, t30 is generated by NT30 (since NT30 -> 't82'). Wait, no, looking back, NT30 is 't82', right? But in the grammar, I see NT81 -> 't71' and NT30 -> 't82'. Hmm, wait. I think I need to recheck the production rules.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, for example, NT81 has a production rule NT30 't71'? No, let me check the given rules precisely. The rules provided include NT81 -> 't71' and NT30 -> 't82'. So t82 can be derived from NT81, and t30 from NT30.\n\nBut actually, looking at the input string, the first symbol is t82. So perhaps starting with NT45 and NT81 (from S -> NT45 NT81) would be right because NT81 -> t71? Wait, no, NT81 may have multiple production rules.\n\nWait, the given rules for NT81 include multiple options: looking back, for example, line NT81: I think I might have confusion. Let me list the production rules for NT81 from the given data.\n\nWait, from the given grammar, I see that NT81 has the following productions:\n\nNT81 -> 't71' (from line \"NT81 -> 't71'\", which is line 25),\nNT30 (from line 28: \"NT30 -> 't82'\"), but for NT81, maybe I misread.

For example, line 18: I don't see NT81 there. Alternatively, perhaps there are other production rules for NT81.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all production rules for each NT non-terminal.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- NT5: NT61 NT75; NT9 NT53; NT5 -> 't25'\n- NT74: NT72 NT5; NT74 -> 't32'\n- NT36: NT84 NT53; NT36 -> 't42'; also NT36 -> NT50 NT36\n- NT5: NT9 NT53; etc.\n- NT40: NT14 NT71; NT40-> 't39'\n- NT12: NT40 NT13; NT12-> 't3'\nOther rules:\n\nThe production rules for NT45 are: NT60 NT77; NT44 NT53; NT44 NT84 NT8; NT67 -> 't30'; But wait, that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to methodically go through each step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to reverse the process: starting from the given string and see if each token can be derived from the grammar.\n\nBut the given string is a sequence of terminals, so perhaps I should try to find a derivation that leads to this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from the start symbol.\n\nLet me try to start.\n\nAssuming S is the start symbol.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT45 NT81\n\nNow, the string starts with t82, t30, etc. Let's see if t82 and t30 can be derived from NT45 and NT81.\n\nLooking for production rules for NT45 and NT81 that can generate t82 and t30.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT45 has the following production rules:\n\nLooking at the given data:\n\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT72 -> 't10' ... Wait, maybe I'm mixing up NT45's production rules.\n\nWait, let me look for NT45 in the production list:\n\nLine 26: NT45 -> 't76'\nLine 27: NT45 -> 't84 NT8' (probably not, since NT8 is a non-terminal)\nWait, perhaps NT45 has production rules like NT60 NT77 or other options.\n\nWait, actually, in the given rules, I see:\n\nLine 15: NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n\nLine 16: NT45 -> NT44 NT53\n\nWait, that's possible.

Hmm.\n\nSo for NT81, it can produce either 't71' (terminal) or NT30 (non-terminal).\n\nSimilarly, for NT45, it can produce NT60 NT77 or NT44 NT53.\n\nSo the first step of S -> NT45 NT81.

Therefore, to reach a terminal, we must go through further productions.\n\nHmm, so to get t82, perhaps NT45's production leads to something that can generate t82.\n\nBut looking at NT60 (from NT45 -> NT60 NT77). NT60's production rules:\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81.\n\nSo NT60 -> NT30 NT81, and then NT30 can produce 't82' as per one of its production rules.\n\nSimilarly, NT81 can produce either another non-terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is either two terminals or two non-terminals. Each production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the grammar provided fits that structure.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals: t84, t13, etc. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S starts with two non-terminals: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So any derivation must start with one of these.\n\nWait, let's write down the two initial possibilities:\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nI think each of these leads to a production that then breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals. Let's explore both paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first option: S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Now, I need to see what NT45 and NT81 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions: I see NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. And NT77 has a production that can either be NT23 NT45 or a terminal. Wait, looking at the productions, NT77 can produce 't8' or can split into NT23 NT45. Also, looking at NT45, it has two productions: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44.\n\nWait, actually, I need to list all rules for each non-terminal. Let me go through each rule to see how they can be applied.\n\nStarting with NT45:\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n\nThen NT60:\n- NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81\n- NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n- NT60 \u2192 NT84 NT53\n- NT60 \u2192 NT40 NT14\n- NT60 \u2192 NT27 NT47\n- NT60 \u2192 NT23 NT74\n- NT60 \u2192 NT53 NT12\n- NT60 \u2192 NT45 NT50\n- NT60 \u2192 NT44 NT71\n- NT60 \u2192 NT53 NT36\n- NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT82\n- NT60 \u2192 NT9 NT76\n- NT60 \u2192 NT40 NT47\n- NT60 \u2192 NT58 NT39\n- NT60 \u2192 NT44 NT44\n- NT60 \u2192 NT83 NT7\n- NT60 \u2192 NT27 NT27\n- NT60 \u2192 NT22 NT74\n- NT60 \u2192 NT25 NT33\n\nHmm, so NT60 can produce various combinations. Similarly for other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe instead of getting lost in all the possibilities, I should try to construct the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t84, so let's see which non-terminals can directly produce t84.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that NT36 \u2192 't42' and NT81 \u2192 't71' etc. Wait, but in the given rules, some NTs directly yield 't' plus numbers. For example, NT53 \u2192 't30', NT77 \u2192 't8', etc.\n\nWait a second, in the given rules, I see some non-terminals directly converting to terminals, while others split into other non-terminals.\n\nI think a better approach is to work backwards. Each terminal in the string must be generated by a production that directly yields that terminal, or by splitting into non-terminals that then generate the required terminals.\n\nSo let's start from the string and see if we can match it step by step.\n\nThe string is: t84 t13 t13 t49 t84 t59 t30 t3 t32 t49 t76 t82 t5\n\nLet's break it into tokens: [t84, t13, t13, t49, t84, t59, t30, t3, t32, t49, t76, t82, t5]\n\nWe can try to match these in reverse, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Then NT45 should produce t84, and NT81 should produce the rest.\n\nWait, but looking at the productions, can NT45 generate t84? Looking back, I see that NT36 \u2192 't42' and also NT72 \u2192 't10' etc., but I don't see NT45 directly generating t84. Instead, NT45's productions all involve splitting into two non-terminals. So NT45 cannot directly produce a terminal; it must split. So if we have S \u2192 NT45 NT81, both NT45 and NT81 need to produce sequences that can build up to the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all possible ways each non-terminal can generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see which non-terminals produce t84. For example, looking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44, and NT10 produces 't50' and 't47', etc. Not directly t84.\n\n- Looking for a non-terminal that directly produces t84: Wait, in the given rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t84. The only terminals are 't's with numbers, and some have numbers followed by t's, but I don't see any NT directly yielding t84. So maybe t84 is produced by a chain of splits into non-terminals which eventually produce t84.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any NT that can split into a terminal that's part of the string.\n\nFor example, in the string, the first token is t84. So I need a production that generates t84, either directly or via a chain.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT60 NT47, and NT27 also \u2192 t35.\n\nWait, no, NT27's production is 't35' directly. So that's a terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce 't84'? Let me search:\n\nYes, looking back, I see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n- NT81 \u2192 't30', etc.\n- NT36 has a production to 't42' and also to NT30 NT45\n\nWait, perhaps t84 is not directly produced by any NT. So maybe the only way to get t84 is via a chain of splits that eventually produce a terminal that starts with t84, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The terminals are like t84, not t followed by 84. So each token is a single 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the given string, which is `t84 t13 t13 t...` etc. So each token is a 't' followed by a two-digit number. So 't84' is a single terminal.\n\nSo I need to find a way to derive 't84' from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, the only way to produce a terminal is via a production that directly produces that terminal. So let's look through the rule list to see if any non-terminal directly produces any 't' token.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't25' (but 5 is lowercase, not uppercase, but in any case, just checking)\nWait, actually, in the given rules, NT77 \u2192 't8', so that's a production that directly outputs 't8' as a terminal. Similarly, NT36 \u2192 't42', NT53 \u2192 't30', etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, some terminals are like 't84', which is a single 't' followed by 84, not a separate 't' 8 and 't' 4. So each token is a single string starting with 't' and followed by two digits.

Or perhaps another way.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't84'. So, to get 't84' as the first symbol, the first symbol must come from a production of a non-terminal. So either NT36 or NT19 can produce 't84' as part of their production.\n\nLooking at NT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53, so if NT36 is used in the first step, how can 't84' come first?

The given grammar starts with S and has productions that generate other non-terminals, ultimately leading to terminals (t's and numbers). Chomsky Normal Form usually consists of productions where each non-terminal generates two other non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions: both start with two non-terminals.

Probably not unless another rule, but looking at NT45's production, which can produce 't60' and 't77', but then those might have further productions.\n\nWait, some of these non-terminals produce terminals directly, others require chains of productions. So perhaps I should build a parse tree.\n\nThe given string is: t82 t30 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t59 t13 t32 t49 t59 t82 t5.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t82, which comes from NT30 -> 't82'. So the first production is NT30, which must be the first non-terminal in the initial production. Looking back, in the grammar, does any production derive to NT30? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT30 is produced by NT45 (because from the grammar, NT45 has a production NT30 -> 't60' and others, but also, maybe another non-terminal. Wait, no, looking at the given grammar rules:\n\nWait, the productions that result in terminals:\n\n- NT30 -> 't82' according to one rule.\n\nSo, the first t82 comes from NT30, so the initial string starts with NT30.\n\nNow, how does NT30 derive? From the grammar, looking for NT30 in the productions. Oh, wait, in the given grammar, NT30 isn't directly listed as a production on the left, but perhaps it's on the right. Wait, NT30 is on the right-hand side of productions as well. Let's check the full list.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT36 -> NT50 NT36 and NT81->... but perhaps I'm missing specific rules for NT30. Wait, no, in the initial list of rules, I don't see NT30 as a left-hand side; instead, I see productions where it's appearing on the right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nNo, in the given grammar, NT30 is not a left-hand side. So how is NT30 derived? Wait, that seems impossible because it's a non-terminal but not defined in any production on the left. So this would be a problem because a production rule cannot have a non-terminal on the left that doesn't have a production on the right.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in the first rule, S-> NT19 NT67, and NT19 and NT67 are non-terminals. Similarly, S-> NT45 NT5. So perhaps in the rest, NT30 is a non-terminal that must be derived from other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again: in the list of given productions, I don't see any rule where NT30 is on the left. All the other non-terminals have rules except NT30. Hmm, so this would mean that NT30 is undefined because there's no production that leads to it. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me make sure. The grammar given starts with S, and all the non-terminals are defined recursively. So for example, S-> NT19 NT67, and if NT19 and NT67 are defined in other parts, perhaps building up to NT30.\n\nWait, looking back, I might have missed a production that defines NT30. Let me recheck the list:\n\nLooking through the list, I see rules like NT36 -> NT50 NT36, NT40 -> NT58 NT39, etc., but I don't see any rule that defines NT30. Wait, so perhaps the string cannot be generated because the first symbol arises from NT30, which isn't defined in any production. That would mean the answer is No.\n\nWait, but that might be a false conclusion because perhaps the NT30 appears somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the grammar works.\n\nWait, perhaps looking again, perhaps I missed that NT30 is derived from another rule. For example, looking through the productions, maybe NT30 is derived from NT45, something like NT45 -> NT30 something. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT45 -> NT60 NT77 and NT45 -> NT50 NT44 and others, but perhaps another rule. Oh, wait, looking more carefully, there's a rule: NT44 -> NT83 NT7, which isn't relevant. Hmm, wait, no. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nIf NT30 is not defined, then the string cannot be generated. Because the first symbol is t82 which comes from NT30, but NT30 isn't a terminal, and there's no production that leads to NT30. So perhaps the answer is No. But I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing the rule that defines NT30. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, I think I see NT45 -> NT30 NT5. Yes!

No, in the grammar, I see NT45 -> t60, but no rule for NT82. So perhaps t82 is an NT, but where does it produce it?\n\nWait, the only NTs in the grammar start with letters A to Z, like S, NT, etc. So t is a terminal, but perhaps in the grammar, some NTs can produce t82.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT67 -> t30, t2\n- NT40 -> t39\n- NT27 -> t76\n- NT36 -> t42\n- NT52 -> t9\n- NT22 -> t22 (terminal)\nWait, but where is t82? Hmm.\n\nWait, the string is t82, t3, t30, etc. None of the rules I see produce t82. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check all the rules again for any terminal that starts with t. The strings include t82, t3, t30, t33, t42, t25, t84, t30, t3, t77, t47, t32, t82, t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT84 -> t77\n- NT45 -> t60, t77 (so t77 is produced by NT45)\n- NT36 -> t42\n- NT27 -> t76\n- NT52 -> t9\n- NT22 -> t22\n- NT23 -> t61, t74\n- NT71 -> t12, t84\n- NT50 -> t49\n- NT83 -> t30\n- NT27 -> t76\n- NT22 -> t42\n- NT25 -> t33\n- NT61 -> t13\n- NT44 -> t76, t7\n- NT40 -> t39\n- NT44 -> t59\n- NT52 -> t71\nWait, but where is t82 coming from?\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT rules that directly produce t82.

NT83 -> t30, yes. Also, NT52 -> t9, but that doesn't produce t30.\n\nSo, let's see: t82 is the first token.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. That's good because it simplifies parsing, but here I'm just trying to generate or check a string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t84 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t59 t42 t84 t8 t30 t49 t59 t82 t5`.\n\nWait, actually, the string seems to be a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, right? So each token is either a two-digit number or a single letter followed by a number, but in this case, all the tokens are like 't84', 't30', etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some NT symbols are connected to terminal symbols (the 't's and numbers). For example, `NT45 -> 't25'`, `NT77 -> 't8'`, and so on. So each NT eventually reduces to a terminal.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of these terminals. I need to see if there's a derivation path that constructs this string step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me first write down all the non-terminal productions to see their connections. Starting from S:\n\nS can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with 't84'. Let me check which NT productions can derive t84.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT84: Checking the grammar, I don't see NT84 directly. Wait, let's check the rules provided. Hmm, in the list, I see NT84 only appears in NT44: NT44 -> 't83' 't7'. So maybe I'm missing something. Wait, let me check all the NT rules again.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT45 -> 't25'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't52'\n- NT83 -> 't30'\n- NT52 -> 't71'\n- NT81 -> 't30'\n- NT60 -> 't84'\n- Others like NT72, NT40, etc.\n\nWait, NT60 has a production: NT60 -> NT30 NT81. And NT30 is part of the grammar.\n\nWait, looking for 't84', where does it come from? From NT60: NT60 -> 't84' according to the rules? Let me check:\n\nLooking at all the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT5 -> 't25'\n- NT45 -> 't25' (from earlier rules); wait, no, NT60 is derived from NT30 and NT81.\n\nWait, let's list all the NT and their productions:\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53 (and terminal)\nNT9 -> NT26 NT45 (and terminal)\nNT53 -> NT26 NT44 (and terminal)\nWait, this seems like a chain leading to terminals.\n\nLooking for t84, let me see:\n\nt84 comes from NT60: looking, does NT60 produce t84? Yes: NT60 -> t84.\n\nWait, checking: looking at the rules, I see NT60 -> NT30 NT81, and both NT30 and NT81 can produce terminal symbols. Let me see NT30: NT30 -> t82, and NT81 -> t3. Wait, because:\n\nNT81 in the rules is present in two places: once as NT81 -> 't3' (looking at the list, yes, line 44 says NT81 -> 't3'), and another time. So NT60 -> NT30 (which is t82) and NT81 (which is t3). So NT60 becomes t82 t3, which is 't82 t3'. But wait, in our string, we have t84 at the start, not t82.\n\nHmm, so maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in finding where t84 comes from.\n\nWait, looking again, I see that NT44 -> t76, which isn't t84. Wait, perhaps there's another NT.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. Maybe I missed a rule that leads to t84.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT60 -> 't84' \u2014 line 46 says NT60 -> t84, correct?\n\nWait, let me check the given rules again. The user provided a long list. Let me scan for any production that directly gives t84 as the terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, yes, I see:\n\n- Line 35: NT22 -> 't5'\n- Line 49: NT50 -> 't49'\n- Line 67: NT60 -> 't84' \u2014 yes, that's one.\n\nSo NT60 can directly produce 't84'. Then NT60 splits into NT30 and NT81, and both NT30 and NT81 derive to terminals.\n\nWait, let me check what NT30 and NT81 produce.\n\nLooking for NT30:\n\nNT30 appears in two places. One is in line 23: NT30 -> t82. Another in line 17: NT47 -> 't84' \u2014 but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, let's check NT30:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see an explicit production for NT30. Wait, line 30 says NT40 -> 't39', but that's different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me scan all the rule lines.\n\nLooking through each line, perhaps NT30 is only derived from something else.\n\nWait, NT30 is present in several productions, like:\n\n- NT27 -> NT60 NT47 (line 22)\n- NT23 -> NT61 NT74 (line 24)\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77 (line 29)\n- NT44 -> NT83 NT7 (line 46)\n- NT22 -> NT22 NT7 (line 68)\n- NT25 -> NT33 (line 69)\n- NT61 -> NT53 NT12 (line 70)\n- NT45 -> NT50 NT44 (line 74)\n- NT44 -> NT83 NT7 (line 74 again)\n- NT52 -> NT71 NT52 (line 75)\n- NT81 -> NT30 NT2 (line 76)\n- NT27 -> NT60 NT47 (line 80)\n- NT23 -> NT61 NT74 (line 81)\n- NT71 -> NT12 NT84 (line 82)\n- NT50 -> NT49 NT0 (line 87)\n- NT83 -> NT30 NT7 (line 90)\n- NT52 -> NT9 NT0 (line 91)\n- NT81 -> NT30 NT2 (line 93)\n- NT44 -> NT59 NT44 (line 94)\n- NT27 -> NT76 NT47 (line 95)\n- NT22 -> NT42 NT7 (line 96)\n- NT25 -> NT33 NT (line 97)\n- NT61 -> NT13 NT (line 98)\n- NT45 -> NT50 NT44 (line 99)\n- NT44 -> NT59 NT44 (line 100)\n- NT52 -> NT33 NT (line 101)\n- NT81 -> NT30 NT2 (line 102)\n\nWait, I think I miscounted.

CNF grammars have rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. This means each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the rules are non-terminals on both sides, like S -> NT45 NT81. The only terminals are single tokens like 't8', 't71', etc. So, the strings in the language will be sequences where each 't' is a terminal symbol and the numbers correspond to specific non-terminals.\n\nThe string I have is a sequence of these terminal symbols. My task is to see if there's a way to derive this string step by step using the given rules.\n\nStarting from S, the top-level rule is S -> NT45 NT81.

So from NT81, I get 't71' directly. From NT45, I go to NT60 and NT77. NT77 is a terminal, so that's 't77'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't82', 't3', etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, the string is `t82 t3 t30 t33 t77 t30 t25 t84 t30 t52 t47 t14 t25 t82 t5`. The first symbol is 't82', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals may directly produce 't' symbols.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT84 -> 't76'\n- NT72 -> 't10'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT39 -> 't28'\n- NT9 -> 't26' (but that's another one)\n- NT8 -> 't83'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT50 -> 't49'\n- NT83 -> 't30'\n- NT61 -> 't13'\n\nWait, but 't82' isn't directly listed. So that's a problem. Maybe one of the non-terminals derived from S eventually produces 't82' via a chain.\n\nWait, S -> NT45 NT81. NT45 -> NT60 NT77. NT77 is terminal 't77'. Wait, but the string starts with 't82', which isn't any of the terminals in NT45 or NT81.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look deeper into the rules to see if any path leads to 't82' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT9 -> 't26' or 't22', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a path where NT starts with 't82'. Looking through all the rules, I don't see a rule that directly starts with 't82'. So maybe the string isn't possible because the first symbol isn't any of the terminals in the grammar. But the start symbol is S, which produces NT45 and NT81. Let's see what those can produce.\n\nNT45 can produce NT60 and NT77. NT77 is a terminal 't77'. So if I have to get 't82' as the first symbol, maybe the first rule is different, but in the given grammar, the first non-terminal in S is NT45, so the first symbol in the string would have to come from NT45 or NT81.\n\nWait, wait. S produces NT45 and NT81, so the string would be two parts: the expansion of NT45 followed by the expansion of NT81. So the string would consist of the expansions of NT45 and then NT81. So the first part is derived from NT45, the second from NT81.\n\nLooking at NT81: NT81 can expand to 't77' or 't30' (from the rule NT81 -> 't71' and also NT81 -> 't30'). Wait, no, looking back, in the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT71 has multiple rules, but in the provided list, I don't see NT81 directly; actually, looking at the provided rules, I notice that some may have typos. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I see:\n\nFor example, nt40 -> nt14 nt71, but I'm focusing on nt81.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT81 -> 't71' (from the original list, somewhere down there)\n- NT60 -> 't84' as per the rule NT60 -> NT30 NT81, but wait, the terminal comes from NT81. Wait, no, the grammar has strings like NT60 -> NT30 NT81, which would then produce 't71' as NT81 is 't71'.\n\nWait, but in any case, let's get back to the first symbols:\n\nThe start string is S which expands to NT45 NT81. So the first symbol has to come from NT45, and the second from NT81.\n\nLooking at NT45's rules:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT45 can also expand to NT50 NT44, but I think that's more steps down.\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81\nWhich would become 't71' as NT81 is 't71' and NT30 leads to NT9, which has rules like 't26' or 't22'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first symbol is 't82', which isn't in any of the initial terminals from S's productions.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's go through the grammar again.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce 't82'. The only terminals are from the rules like NT27->'t35', NT25->'t33', etc.\n\nBut wait, looking again, perhaps I missed something. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through each rule to see which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT9 -> 't26' or 't22', etc.\n- NT84 -> 't76'\n- NT39 -> 't28'\n- NT13 -> 't47'\n- NT74 -> 't72' and 't5' (but 5 is 't5')\nWait, and looking deeper, NT9 can produce 't26' or 't22', but 't82' isn't in any of these.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule for NT27: NT27 -> 't35'. Wait, but 't82' isn't there either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some rules. Let me go through the entire list again.\n\nLooking at all the rules, I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't82'. The start symbol S produces NT45 and NT81, which then need to expand into sequences that, when combined, would produce 't82' as the first symbol. But since NT45 and NT81 don't produce 't82', the string can't start with 't82'. \n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol 't82' doesn't have a corresponding production in the given rules.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t84 t30 t3 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t59 t42 t25 t30 t84 t8 t82 t5\". Hmm, that's a lot of 't's followed by numbers. Let me look at the grammar rules to see how these 't' sequences are formed.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol which can go to a terminal. Looking at the production rules, I notice that some NTs produce terminals directly. For example, NT44 \u2192 't76' and NT40 \u2192 't39'. These must be the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nSo, the problem is to see if the string can be derived by applying these productions step by step. Let's break down the string into individual tokens and see how they can be formed.\n\nThe string is:\nt84, t30, t3, t30, t39, t47, t49, t84, t59, t42, t25, t30, t84, t8, t82, t5.\n\nI'll list these in the order they appear, since the grammar produces strings by concatenating these 't' sequences.\n\nNow, looking at the NT productions, I notice that many NTs produce combinations of other NTs until it reaches a terminal. For instance, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, and then NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, which eventually produces 't84' and 't71'. Wait, but in the string we have 't84 t30'... Hmm, maybe I'm not looking correctly.\n\nWait, the string starts with t84 followed by t30, which are both from NT44 and NT53, respectively. Let me check the production for NT44. From the grammar, NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7. So that would produce something that eventually becomes 't83' and 't7'. Wait, but in the string, after t84 comes t30, which is more like a production that leads to t30. Hmm, maybe I need to see how each terminal could be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should build the parse tree in a bottom-up manner. Let's see. The first token is t84. Looking at the productions, where does t84 come from? Looking through the NTs, I see NT83 \u2192 't30'? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the only terminal is 't84' from NT84, 't30' from NT30, 't3' from NT3, 't39' from NT39, etc. Wait, maybe I should list all the NTs that produce terminals:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't84'\n- NT30 \u2192 't30'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT39 \u2192 't39'\n- NT47 \u2192 't47'\n- NT76 \u2192 't76'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25' (but wait, looking at the production, NT25 isn't in the grammar as a terminal, but NT22 is 't22' and NT23 is 't14'... Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me list the NT productions that produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't76'\nNT40 \u2192 't39'\nNT25 \u2192 't33' (no, wait that's not a terminal. Wait, looking again, some lines like NT71 \u2192 't52', so 't52' would be a terminal. But in the string, I see 't49' which doesn't directly appear in any production as a terminal. Wait, no, let's check each production:\n\nWait, looking through the productions, NT44 has 't76', NT40 has 't39', NT39 has 't39' in the production, but that's not a terminal. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe string has 't84' which, from NT84, is a terminal. So in the parse tree, that's a leaf. Then 't30' would be NT30. Next is 't3', which is NT3. Then 't30' again, 't39' (NT39), 't47' (NT47), 't49' (NT49), 't84' (NT84), 't59' (wait, is that a terminal? Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that produces 't59'. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Let's check the productions again.\n\nLooking through each production, none of them produce 't59' as a terminal. The same goes for 't49'\u2014is that a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT52 \u2192 't71' which is a terminal. But 't49' isn't listed anywhere. So if the string contains 't49', that's a problem because it doesn't exist in the grammar. So perhaps the string isn't possible because of the presence of 't49'?\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me check all the NTs in the grammar:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't76'\nNT40 \u2192 't39'\nNT39 \u2192 NT36 NT45 (which are non-terminals)\nNT25 \u2192 't33' (non-terminal)\nNT61 \u2192 NT53 NT12 (non-terminals)\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 (non-terminals)\nNT77 \u2192 't8' (terminal)\nAnd so on. It seems that some 't's are produced only by specific NTs, but 't49' and 't59' aren't directly produced by any NT in the grammar. So that would mean the string can't be generated because it contains 't49' and 't59' terminals that are not produced by any NT.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a production that I missed that leads to these 't's. Let me list all the 't's in the string and see if they correspond to any terminal productions.\n\nThe string is:\nt84 (NT84)\nt30 (NT30)\nt3 (NT3)\nt30 (NT30)\nt39 (NT39)\nt47 (NT47)\nt49 (unknown)\nt84 (NT84)\nt59 (unknown)\nt42 (NT42)\nt25 (NT25)\nt30 (NT30)\nt84 (NT84)\nt8 (NT8? Wait, but is there an NT8? Looking at the productions, yes, NT84 is 't84', but no NT8. Hmm, maybe NT22 produces 't22', etc. Wait, let me check each 't' token:\n\nLooking at each 't' in the string:\n\nt84 \u2192 NT84\nt30 \u2192 NT30\nt3 \u2192 NT3\nt30 \u2192 NT30\nt39 \u2192 NT39\nt47 \u2192 NT47\nt49 \u2192 ?\nt84 \u2192 NT84\nt59 \u2192 ?\nt42 \u2192 wait, NT42? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT producing 't42'. Wait, actually, the productions are like NT22 \u2192 't22', NT27 \u2192 't27', etc. So perhaps 't42' comes from NT22, which produces 't22', but that's only 't22', not 't42'. Hmm, so 't42' is another problematic terminal because it's not directly produced by any NT.\n\nSimilarly, 't25' is from production NT25 \u2192 't33' but wait, no, looking again, NT22 \u2192 't22'. Let me double-check:\n\nFrom the grammar, the production NT22 \u2192 't22' is listed, so 't22' is okay. But 't25' might come from NT25 \u2192 't33', which isn't a terminal. So the 't25' in the string is problematic as well.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For example, the string has 't59' and 't42' and 't25'. None of these are directly produced by any NT in the grammar. So that would mean the string is invalid since those 't's don't exist in the grammar.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe I'm miscounting or misinterpreting the NTs. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar again, some NTs produce 't' followed by numbers:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT39 \u2192 't39'\n- NT83 \u2192 't30'\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-279","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided with several production rules, and the string to evaluate is `t82 t71 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t39 t47 t32 t49 t59 t82 t5`. \n\nFirst, I'll start by trying to understand the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol here is S. \n\nLooking at the first few rules, S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So S is directly connected to these non-terminals. Then, each of these non-terminals can produce other combinations or terminal symbols. For example, NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75, and so on.\n\nI'll also note that some of the non-terminals lead directly to terminal symbols, marked by the presence of 't' followed by a number or specific terms like 't30', which are probably already terminal symbols. I need to see if the given string can be derived from S using these rules.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t82, t71, t13, etc. Each of these must be generated by some production rule. The approach is to see if each part of the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nStarting from S, which can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let me pick one and see if I can form the string. Let's say I choose NT45 NT81. \n\nNT45 has a production rule to either NT60 NT77 or 't44'. But in the string, the first term is t82, so maybe NT45 becomes 't44'. But looking at the grammar, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 or 't44'. Wait, actually, in the grammar, I see NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and also NT45 \u2192 't44' is there? Wait, looking back, the production rules, the last one is NT44 \u2192 't59'... Wait, in the initial rules, NT45 \u2192 't44' isn't listed. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT45, the first rule is NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, and then other rules for NT45: wait, looking through, under NT45, I see:\n\nWait, actually, under the grammar, let me re-examine:\n\n- NT45 has two rules: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44.\n\nWait, no, looking at the initial grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT45 -> NT50 NT44\n\nYes, so NT45 can produce either NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44.\n\nBut in the string, the first part is t82. So maybe we need to see if any of the non-terminals can produce t82. Looking through, I see NT36 \u2192 't42', NT81 \u2192 't71', NT44 \u2192 't76', NT27 \u2192 't35', NT81 \u2192 't3', etc. Hmm, let's see where t82 comes from.\n\nWait, looking through the terminals, I notice NT30 \u2192 't82', yes, in the grammar, under NT30, one of the rules is NT30 \u2192 't82'. So t82 is terminal NT30.\n\nSo the first token in the string is t82, which comes from NT30. Therefore, in the derivation, we must have a path that leads to NT30.\n\nSo starting from S, perhaps S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Let's explore that.\n\nNT45 can go to NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44. Let's try NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. Now, NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81. NT30 \u2192 't82', which is the first token. So that seems promising.\n\nSo:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 NT81\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81\nNT30 \u2192 't82'\n\nNow, after using NT60, we have NT77 left. NT77 can produce 't8'. So the next token is t71, but that's not 't8'. Wait, something's wrong here. Because after NT60 \u2192 't82', NT77 would produce 't8', making the sequence t82 t8, but the string starts with t82 t71. So this path leads to 't8' next, which doesn't match. So this path is incorrect.\n\nSo maybe I should try the other option for NT45. Let's try NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44.\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT49, from the grammar: NT50 \u2192 NT49. Then NT49 has a production rule NT49 \u2192 't49', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT49 is a non-terminal, I think.

The string is: `t84 t30 t39 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t14 t84 t8 t49 t76 t82 t5`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. This structure simplifies the parsing process, so I might consider a parsing algorithm like CYK or something else, but since I'm just analyzing the string step by step, I'll proceed differently.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and each production for S starts with NT followed by another NT. The top-level string generated by S will consist of these NT parts combined through the productions.\n\nThe string starts with `t84`, which must come from one of the productions. Looking at the grammar, many non-terminals have productions that end with a 't' and a number. For example, NT45 \u2192 't25', and others like NT5 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nLet me list out the possible non-terminals that can produce each 't' token in the string:\n\n- `t84` occurs once. Looking through the grammar, where is 't84' defined?\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production starting with NT... that has 't84' directly. Wait, in the grammar, NT36 \u2192 't44' among others, but not 't84'. Let me check again. Maybe NT84 is a non-terminal? Wait, no, because all the NT symbols are like NT0, NT1, etc., or NT5, etc. So perhaps NT[xx] can produce 't' followed by some number, but looking at the rules, I see that NT5 \u2192 't5', NT25 \u2192 't33', and several others, but I don't see NT84 producing 't84'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the string has `t84` appearing twice at the beginning. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, in the rules, NT45 \u2192 't25', but where does 't84' come from? Maybe I need to find the non-terminals that can produce 't84'.

Hmm, that's a problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the rules do not have any productions for NT... that result in 't84'. So how can 't84' appear in the string? Because none of the non-terminals directly produce 't84', unless perhaps it's derived through a chain of productions.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the grammar. Let me look through the rules more carefully. Let's see:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't42' (twice)\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' and 't53' possibly? Wait, looking at NT5's production:\n\nLooking back, the rules have:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n- NT53 \u2192 NT30 NT45\n\nSo NT5 can produce sequences through these. Wait, but to get a terminal 't...', the non-terminals must produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up NT and other symbols. For example, is there a rule that leads to a terminal 't84'?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, is there a rule that ends with 't84'? Let me search:\n\nLooking through all rules, I don't immediately see any rule that ends with 't84'. Let me check each rule again:\n\n- S and other NTs have complex right-hand sides, mostly combinations of NT terms, except for some that produce terminals.\n\nWait, let's list all the production rules that have terminals:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't11'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26' twice\n- NT10 \u2192 't50'\n- NT12 \u2192 't3' (twice)\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT45 \u2192 't60' ... Wait no, wait, NT45 appears in two places:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n\nSo NT45 can produce both 't25' and a sequence via NT60 and NT77. But in our string, `t84` appears, so is there a way to produce 't84'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe the problem is that 't84' is appearing multiple times, and perhaps one of those is possible via a production.\n\nWait, maybe in a deeper derivation, 't84' is produced through a chain. Let me think about this: looking at the grammar, perhaps a non-terminal can generate a chain that ends with 't84'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't correct because none of the non-terminals produce 't84'. So the string starts with 't84', which cannot be produced by the grammar, so the answer would be 'No'. But wait, let me verify.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the grammar.

Maybe the fact that the string starts with 't84' makes it immediately invalid because no non-terminal in the grammar directly produces 't84' as a terminal.\n\nBut wait, looking again at the grammar rules:\n\nThe rules for NT60 include:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81\n\nAnd NT30 \u2192 NT82.\n\nNT60 also has another production: NT60 \u2192 NT14 NT71.\n\nBut looking at the rules again, I don't see any NT... that has a terminal 't84'.\n\nSo since the string starts with 't84', which isn't produced by any of the non-terminals in the grammar, it's impossible for the grammar to generate this string.

The string is `t82 t30 t13 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t76 t42 t49 t59 t30 t84 t8 t82 t5`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S. The string is a sequence of t-terms, so I think each part like 't82' corresponds to a terminal symbol, and the grammar must generate this sequence through its productions.\n\nHmm, to check this, maybe I should look at how the terminals in the string are derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Let's see if each terminal appears on the right-hand side of any production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see non-terminals that produce terminals. For example, NT9 has a production NT9 \u2192 't26', and NT2 \u2192 't5'. So those are straightforward. But many non-terminals also produce other non-terminals, so I need to see if the sequence can be built step by step.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by constructing the parse tree or seeing if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules. Since the string starts with 't82', I need to find a production that starts with 't82'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT60 \u2192 't84' and NT30 \u2192 't82', but in the initial productions, S can only go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Oh, wait, but the string starts with t82, which is derived from NT30. So maybe S can't directly produce t82. But wait, in the initial productions, S doesn't produce a single NT that leads to t82 directly. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check.\n\nWait, the initial productions of S are S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So each S production gives two non-terminals. So the entire string is a sequence of several terms derived from these non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string has 17 terms. Let's list them:\n\n1. t82\n2. t30\n3. t13\n4. t30\n5. t39\n6. t47\n7. t49\n8. t84\n9. t76\n10. t42\n11. t49\n12. t59\n13. t30\n14. t84\n15. t8\n16. t82\n17. t5\n\nSo the first term is t82, which comes from NT30 (since NT30 \u2192 't82'). So the first part of the derivation must have produced NT30.\n\nLooking at the initial productions, S can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So if we start with S \u2192 NT45 NT81, let's see if we can derive t82 from NT45. Wait, NT45 has production NT45 \u2192 't60' via NT60 \u2192 ... but let me check.\n\nLooking at NT45, in the productions, I see NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 't60'. Oh, no, wait, looking at the original grammar, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking back, for NT45: I see NT45 -> 't60'? Wait, no, I think I misread. Let me go through the productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT45 has two productions: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 't60'. Oh, so NT45 can produce 't60' directly via NT45 \u2192 't60'. Wait, no, looking back: NT45 is actually producing 't45'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the NT symbols with the t-terms. Wait, no, in the grammar, it's written as, for example, NT45 \u2192 't60'. So, NT45 can directly derive 't60' as a terminal. So, if the first term is 't82', that comes from NT30, which is not involved in the first step since S is producing NT45 NT81.\n\nWait, so perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Then, NT45 produces 't60' and NT81 produces, say, NT45 or another node. But 't82' is not 't60', so that doesn't align. So maybe the first term 't82' cannot come from S directly because S's initial productions don't have a direct path to t82.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The string is a sequence of t-terms, but each non-terminal's productions may lead to multiple terms. So maybe I should try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the grammar's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct a parse tree. Let's see:\n\nThe string has 17 terms. Let's group them into pairs as per the initial S productions, which are two non-terminals each. But 17 is odd, which might be an issue unless the last term can be part of a production that requires a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal expansion corresponds to a certain number of terms. For example, NT45 might expand to one or more terms, so perhaps the total number of terms must be even? Let's count the terms: 17 is odd. So if each S production leads to two non-terminals, each of which may expand into multiple terms, then the total number of terms should be a sum of the terminals produced. But 17 is odd, so perhaps that's a red flag. Wait, but some productions might expand to multiple terms, so the total could be even or odd. Hmm, maybe that's not a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should see if each of the terms in the string can be derived through the grammar's productions, regardless of their position. For example, check if each 't' term can be derived from the non-terminals, but that might not be sufficient because the structure also needs to match.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a parsing problem. Let's see if the string can be parsed using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm. But since the grammar is large and the string is relatively long, that might be time-consuming, but let's try a partial parse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for any contradictions. For instance, does any terminal in the string not appear on any production's right-hand side? Let's check each term:\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\nt82: present in NT60 \u2192 't84' and NT30 \u2192 't82' (I think earlier I saw NT30 \u2192 't82').\n\nt30: NT30 \u2192 't82', NT90 \u2192 't30' is not in the grammar. Wait, looking at the grammar: NT30 \u2192 't82', so 't30' must come from NT30? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT30 \u2192 't82'. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar after NT2, etc., I see NT30 \u2192 't82' but also other productions. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the specific lines:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't82' is present. So 't30' must come from NT30? Or wait, no, the production is NT30 \u2192 't82', so 't30' is not a terminal; perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no, maybe the terminals are only those with 't' as part of their definition. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nThe terminal symbols are those that end with 't...' or a single letter? From the productions, when a rule ends with 't' followed by a number, like 't25', 't30', etc., those are terminals. Otherwise, letters like NT, etc., are non-terminals.\n\nSo 't82' is a terminal, 't30' is another, and so on.\n\nSo, for each term in the string, I need to see if it appears as a terminal in the grammar, and if so, if there's a path to it via the productions.\n\nSo, let's list all the terms and see if they are terminals:\n\nt82: Yes, in NT30 \u2192 't82'\n\nt30: In the grammar, I don't see a production that ends with 't30' except perhaps looking for 't30' in the RHS of any rule.

{"custom_id":"request-321","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t82 t30 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t49 t77 t30 t25 t30 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5`. Let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are defined by production rules, and in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow that structure since all left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by two non-terminals? Wait, actually, looking at it again, some rules have more than one non-terminal on the right, like NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75, but others have a mix. Hmm, maybe I should check if all productions are in CNF. Wait, CNF requires each production to be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So if any production has more than two non-terminals on the right, or a terminal in between non-terminals, that's not CNF. Checking the given grammar, most produce three symbols, like NT0 \u2192 NT47 NT53, which has two non-terminals, but some like NT39 \u2192 't28' have a terminal, but others like NT77 \u2192 't8' might not be in CNF. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So maybe I'm confused here. Alternatively, perhaps some rules are in the form of two non-terminals, which would be acceptable in CNF. Wait, I think the given grammar might actually be in CNF because each production is either a non-terminal producing two other non-terminals or a terminal. Let me clarify: the rules like NT5 -> NT61 NT75 are fine because they're two non-terminals. The ones like NT77 -> 't8' are terminals, so that's okay in CNF because A \u2192 a is allowed. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so A can produce two non-terminals or a terminal, but in this case, NT77 -> 't8' is A \u2192 a, so that's fine. Okay, so the grammar is correctly in Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the string I'm given is a sequence of terminals: t82, t30, t13, etc. The task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces two NTs at a time. The first rule is S \u2192 NT45 NT81, and the second is S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So the string must be generated through a series of productions starting from S, applying these rules, and eventually all non-terminals must be expanded into terminals.\n\nThe string has 18 tokens, which is an even number, which makes sense because each production of S contributes two parts, and each of those parts would eventually produce some terminals. So 18 tokens would mean 9 productions in the derivation path.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. I'll start from the beginning.\n\n1. The first symbol is t82. I need to find which production rule produces t82. Looking through the rules, I see NT77 \u2192 't8', but that's just one element, so maybe in a longer production. Wait, let me check the rules again. Wait, in the given rules, I see lines like NT75 -> 't8', NT36 -> 't42', etc. Wait, for NT53, I see a rule: NT53 \u2192 't30'. So perhaps I can find which NTs produce t82.\n\nWait, looking through the terminal rules, I see NT52 \u2192 't71' (line 52), NT81 \u2192 't30' (line 81), but I'm looking for t82. Wait, is there a NT that produces t82? Wait, line 72: NT72 \u2192 't10' and maybe others. Wait, looking through, I see line 82: NT82 \u2192 ... Wait, let me check all the rules again. Oh, the initial list only goes up to NT84. Wait, line 5: 't5', line 7: 't11', line 8: 't23', line 9: 't26', line 10: 't27', etc. Let me check for 't82' specifically. Looking through all the rules, I see that NT61 \u2192 't13' (line 21), NT50 \u2192 't49' (line 34), NT44 \u2192 't76' (line 46), etc. Hmm, I don't see any rule that directly produces t82. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through each line, line 44: NT44 \u2192 't76'. Line 77: NT77 \u2192 't8' wait, that's 't77'? Wait, no, looking at the lines:\n\nAfter NT61, line 21: NT61 \u2192 't13'. Line 22: NT45 \u2192 't44'. Then line 44: NT44 \u2192 't76'. Line 53: NT53 \u2192 't30'. Line 76: NT76 \u2192 which rule? Hmm, the given rules don't have a rule for NT76. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps t82 is produced by a NT that's further down the rules. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for where t82 is mentioned. Wait, in the string, the first token is t82, so I need a production that can generate it as the first step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree starting from S and see if I can reach this string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to see the possible derivations of the string step by step. Since the string is 18 tokens, the derivation would involve S \u2192 NTx NTy, each of which then expand further until all are terminals.\n\nLet me first note the order of the symbols: t82, t30, t13, t13, t49, t84, t30, t11, t49, t77, t30, t25, t30, t49, t30, t11, t82, t5.\n\nSince the string starts with t82, I need to find a production that starts with a non-terminal that can produce t82 as the first symbol. Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see any NT that when expanded starts with t82. But wait, perhaps in some production rule, the first symbol after a non-terminal can be t82. Let me think: perhaps in NT45 \u2192 't44' (line 22) or NT53 \u2192 't30' (line 32), but t82 is a terminal, so it must come from a NT production.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t82. So perhaps the first step is NT45 \u2192 't60' (line 2), NT84 \u2192 't77' (line 48), but how do we get t82? Alternatively, maybe t82 is derived through a more complex production, perhaps via another NT. Wait, maybe looking again at the rules further down: line 76: NT76 is defined, but no, I don't see a rule. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider that perhaps the first token t82 comes from a non-terminal NT that's further down the parse tree. Perhaps I need to expand it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is too long, but maybe I can find a pattern or a way to structure this. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for how each token can be linked back to the grammar. Let's start with the first token, t82, and see if it can be produced by any NT.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT82 appears on the left-hand side of a rule? Let me check: no, in the given rules, the left-hand sides are all S and various NTx, but NT82 appears on the right-hand side in line 39: NT39 \u2192 't28', but that's a terminal. Wait, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note that in the given rules, most of the NTs produce two other NTs. So the string must be constructed by expanding these into terminals. So perhaps each step in the derivation reduces the count of non-terminals step by step until all are terminals.

The string is `t82 t71 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t13 t14 t49 t30 t11 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5`. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. The right-hand side of each production has exactly two symbols. So, for parsing, we can use the CYK algorithm, I think that's what it's called.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by filling a table where each cell represents whether a certain non-terminal can derive a substring of the input. The string has to be exactly parsed, not too short or too long. Also, each production is non-ambivalent, so every step should have clear transitions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S. The initial productions are S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. So any valid sentence would start with two non-terminals, each expanding into a sequence that eventually produces terminal symbols like t25, t8, etc.\n\nLet's list all the S productions:\n- S can go to NT45 and NT81. So the start would be NT45 NT81.\n\nNow, each of these NT symbols eventually produces terminal t-something. So I need to see if the start symbols can expand into the given string.\n\nAlternatively, the other option is S -> NT19 NT67, but looking at the string, it's t82 t71 t13 etc. I wonder if that's relevant. Let's see the grammar's NT19.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT19 can go to NT84 NT8 or NT60 NT5. Wait, looking at the productions, let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar rules, for example, NT19 -> NT84 NT8 (the second option), or maybe NT19 can go to other things? Let me see: In the grammar, I see NT19 -> NT84 NT8 and NT19 -> NT40 NT5 from another rule? Wait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules have:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\n\nS -> NT19 NT67\n\nNT5 -> NT61 NT75\n\nNT0 -> NT47 NT53\n\nNT12 -> NT40 NT13\n\nNT74 -> NT72 NT5\n\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\n\nNT75 -> NT23 NT45\n\nNT36 -> NT50 NT36\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81\n\nNT71 -> NT9 NT75\n\nNT58 -> NT27 NT47\n\nNT14 -> NT25 NT52\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\n\nNT72 -> NT10 NT44\n\nNT40 -> NT14 NT71\n\nNT19 -> NT60 NT5\n\nWait, so NT19 has two productions: one to NT84 NT8 and another to NT60 NT5. Hmm, but wait, looking again, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me confirm:\n\nIn the grammar, the productions for NT19 are:\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT19 -> NT60 NT5\n\nSo, both options are available.\n\nSimilarly, the other productions for S are S->NT19 NT67 and S-> NT45 NT81.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t82, so maybe we need to see how to produce t82.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some NT symbols directly produce a 't' followed by a number. For example, NT9 -> NT36 NT45, but further expansions can lead to 't26' or 't25'. Let's see where each terminal comes from.\n\nLooking for t82: The parser should trace back which NT symbol leads to 't82' and then proceed.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT3 -> 't26' (Wait, NT9 -> ... looking back, let me check.)\n\nWait, let me list the terminal productions:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\n\nNT77 -> 't8'\n\nNT84 -> 't77'\n\nNT39 -> 't28'\n\nNT13 -> 't47'\n\nNT7 -> 't11'\n\nNT36 -> 't42'\n\nNT81 -> 't71'\n\nNT44 -> 't76'\n\nNT27 -> 't35'\n\nNT22 -> 't42'\n\nNT40 -> 't39'\n\nNT12 -> 't3'\n\nNT8 -> 't83'\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nNT75 -> 't32'\n\nNT44 -> 't59'\n\nNT52 -> 't71'\n\nNT81 -> 't3'\n\nWait, wait, so let me find where each 't' comes from.\n\nLooking at the string: first is t82. So, which NT produces t82? Scanning through:\n\nLooking at the terminals in the grammar, I see NT40 -> t39, but that's 39, not 82.\n\nWait, is there any NT that can produce t82 as a terminal directly? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules: it seems that t82 isn't a terminal produced directly, but perhaps through the leftmost derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's via a chain. For example, NT81 -> 't71', but that's 71, not 82.\n\nHmm, maybe t82 comes from NT81->'t71' and then other steps? Wait, no, because 't71' is one token. Wait, the string has t82, which is just the initial token, so that would require some NT that directly produces t82, or perhaps via a chain of productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar rules again for t82.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, none directly produce 't82' as a terminal. So perhaps 't82' is the result of a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT81 can produce multiple ts, but no, each production of NT81 leads to non-terminals.

But t82 is another token. So where does t82 come from?\n\nWait, perhaps 't82' is derived from a chain of non-terminal productions.

Wait, but in standard CNF, all productions except the start symbol have two non-terminals, and terminals are not allowed on the RHS except for the base cases. However, since some rules have terminals, maybe it's slightly different or maybe it's a mix. I'll proceed with that in mind.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. The starting symbol is S, which goes to either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. These, in turn, break down into other non-terminals, and some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81, and NT45 has a production that can directly produce 't25' or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals: t82, t3, t30, t33, t77, t30, t49, t59, t84, t30, t76, t84, t28, t47, t77, t47, t32, t82, t5. I need to parse this string into the non-terminals of the grammar.\n\nSince the string is all terminals, each part must come from the derivations where each terminal is generated by a production rule that directly produces that terminal or a non-terminal that eventually expands into that terminal.\n\nI'll start by mapping each terminal in the string to possible non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals have direct productions to terminals, like NT45 can be 't25', but others go further, like NT5 is a mix of non-terminals and terminals. So, I need to check for each terminal in the string, which non-terminals can produce it directly or through a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree starting from S, expanding the non-terminals, and seeing if the leaves of the tree can match the given string in order.\n\nBut given the string length is 19, that might be tedious. Alternatively, I can look for possible combinations.\n\nFirst, let me check the start symbol S:\n\nS can be derived into NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let me first see if S \u2192 NT45 NT81 can generate the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two terminals are t82 and t3. Suppose I take NT45 and NT81.\n\nWhat can generate t82? Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT84 \u2192 't77', but NT36 \u2192 't42' etc. Wait, looking for 't82' is produced by NT84, but NT84 is produced by NT44, which is then 't76'. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT30 can produce 't82' or 't2' (since rule says NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT45, or directly 't82' is in NT2's production). Wait, no, looking for 't82', let's see:\n\nLooking for rules where RHS is just 't82'. Wait, in the provided rules, I see NT84 \u2192 't77', but no rule seems to produce 't82' directly. There's a rule for NT27 \u2192 't76', NT2 \u2192 't5', NT9 \u2192 't26' or 't22', NT36 \u2192 't42', etc. Wait, perhaps 't82' comes from NT9 NT8? Wait, wait, let me check all productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT30 can produce 't82' (from the line NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT45, which is 't26' followed by something else, but perhaps something else produces 't82'. Wait, maybe not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each terminal to their possible origins.\n\nLooking for t82: Is there a rule that directly produces t82? From the grammar, I see NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT45, which doesn't produce t82 directly. Other non-terminals: NT27 \u2192 't76', NT2 \u2192 't5', NT9 \u2192 't26' or 't22', NT36 \u2192 't42', NT40 \u2192 't39' and possibly more. Hmm, perhaps my approach is not effective. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nWait, maybe the string is long enough, but perhaps breaking it down into possible non-terminals:\n\nLet's think step by step. The string starts with t82, followed by t3, t30, t33, etc.\n\nt82: Let's see where it could come from. Looking for non-terminals where one of the productions includes t82.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT44 \u2192 't76', NT67 \u2192 't30', NT60 \u2192 't84', NT71 \u2192 't9', etc. Hmm, perhaps looking through:\n\nWait, maybe 't82' is produced by NT30. There's a rule NT30 \u2192 't82', which is in the grammar? Let me check the given rules:\n\nLooking down the list, towards the end:\n\nAt the bottom, I see:\n\nNT30 -> 't82'\n\nYes, that's one! So, NT30 can produce t82 directly. So the first t82 in the string could be from NT30.\n\nThen the next terminal is t3. So the second part of the string is t3. What produces t3? Looking through the grammar:\n\nHmm, in the rules, I don't see any production that directly gives 't3', but maybe through non-terminals. Wait, perhaps 't3' comes from NT2. Let me check:\n\nYes, at the end, NT2 \u2192 't5'. Wait, no, actually, looking through, I see NT27 \u2192 't76', but looking for 't3', I think it's not directly present. Wait, maybe 't3' is part of another production. Let's check:\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce 't3'. Let's go through the list:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (not helpful)\n- NT12 \u2192 't3' directly? Wait, no: looking back, NT12 is 't3' in one of the grammar rules? Wait, let me check the given grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT12 is given as: NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13. Hmm, but I see that there's a rule for NT12 elsewhere, like:\n\nLooking at the list, earlier I see:\n\n\"NT12 -> NT40 NT13\"\n\nBut then further down, at \"NT12 -> t3\" \u2014 no, wait, no:\n\nWait, the grammar rules are listed as:\n\nLooking through the list, for example:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 t83\n- Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, is there a rule like NT12 \u2192 t3? Or perhaps 't3' is somewhere else.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNo direct rule that produces 't3'. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, but perhaps in the rules, something else produces 't3'.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps 't3' comes from NT2's production, but I don't see that. Alternatively, maybe 't3' comes from another non-terminal, but I'm seeing nothing direct. Hmm, perhaps I need to think again. Alternatively, maybe the 't3' comes from NT12, but NT12 is broken down into more non-terminals.\n\nWait, for now, let's tentatively assume that after NT30 produces t82, the next non-terminal in the parse tree is NT3 (but not found), or maybe the grammar allows 't3' to come from somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps the 't3' is produced by NT27, but I don't see that. Or maybe through a more complex path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string doesn't match any possible derivation. But maybe my initial assumption is wrong, so I need a better approach.\n\nAnother approach: look for the entire string as a series of"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-338","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t84 t13 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t59 t30 t33 t71 t52 t47 t32 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of a set of production rules starting from S and breaking down into non-terminals and terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). It's in CNF, which means each rule is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string can be derived from S by applying these rules.\n\nBut looking at the problem, maybe I can approach it by working backwards. I can try to parse the string starting from the end, seeing if it can be broken down into the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me list out the tokens in the string: t84, t13, t30, t39, t47, t49, t84, t59, t30, t33, t71, t52, t47, t32, t49, t30, t11, t82, t5.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two production rules:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\nS -> NT19 NT67\n\nSo the string must start with either NT45 or NT19, then NT81 or NT67. The given string starts with t84, so I need to check if t84 can be part of NT45 or NT19.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the rules:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nAlso, in the production list, there's an alternative for NT45: NT50 NT44. Wait, but in the initial rules, NT45 is only listed as NT60 NT77 and NT50 NT44? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has multiple production rules for some non-terminals. For example, NT45 has two rules:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT45 -> NT50 NT44\n\nSo when constructing the derivation, at any point, a non-terminal like NT45 can branch into either of its two options.\n\nNow, focusing on the first token, t84. I need to see if there's a way t84 can be generated from either NT45 or NT19.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT45:\n\nLooking through the list, one of the rules is NT45 -> 't84' and NT8 other... Wait, no:\n\nWait, in the production list, let me check each rule.\n\nLooking for rules that produce t84 as a terminal.\n\nI see:\n\nNT44 -> 't28' or 't76' etc. Wait, specifically, under the rules, the ones that produce terminals are when a non-terminal expands to a 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking for 't84' as a result:\n\nNT47 -> 't84' is one of the rules: NT47 -> 't84'\n\nSimilarly, NT53 -> 't30', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the production list:\n\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT36 -> 't84' (twice) ?\nWait, let me scan the rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT45 -> 't84' ? No, I see under NT44: `NT44 -> 't76'` and elsewhere, NT47 -> 't84'.\n\nYes, there's a rule for NT47: `NT47 -> 't84'`. Also, there's another rule for NT19: `NT19 -> 't11'`.\n\nWait, but the string starts with `t84`, so maybe it comes from NT47.\n\nSo, to get `t84`, it must come from a non-terminal that expands to 't84'. The only such is NT47: NT47 -> 't84'.\n\nSo, if the string's first token is t84, we can think that the derivation starts with NT47, which produces t84. Now, we need to check what comes before it.\n\nWait, but wait: the entire string is built by expanding the right-hand sides of the grammar rules into terminal symbols until we reach the initial symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string starting from the end, since the grammar's structure might limit the possibilities.\n\nSo, let's try to parse the string from right to left, applying the inverse rules.\n\nThe string is: t84 t13 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t59 t30 t33 t71 t52 t47 t32 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to reverse the string and parse from right to left, since S is the starting symbol, which has two rules.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by S's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem as trying to find a leftmost derivation, but that might take a lot of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a tree and see if each step aligns with the grammar rules.\n\nBut perhaps a more efficient way is to see if each part of the string matches the grammar's rules, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe first token is t84. The first rule for S is NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nWe need to determine whether t84 is generated by NT45 or NT19.\n\nBut NT45 expands to, say, NT60 NT77, which might eventually produce t84. Alternatively, NT47 directly produces t84.\n\nWait, that's a different point. Looking at the grammar, NT47 has a production to 't84', so NT47 can be replaced by 't84'.\n\nBut if the string starts with t84, perhaps it's the result of expanding NT47 in the initial production. But S's initial rule is either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nSo, unless NT45 or NT19 can produce something that can lead to the correct structure, it might not be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is derived by a series of NT productions.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe instead, I can check each symbol and see if it's compatible with the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is pretty long, I can try breaking it into smaller parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the last few tokens to see if they can form a production.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: the last few tokens are t11, t82, t5.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the last symbol for S is S -> NT67, which is one of the possibilities.\n\nLooking at the last non-terminal before 't9', for example, NT22: `NT22 -> 't22'`, which is a leaf node. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last token is t5. Looking in the rules, 't5' is the expansion of certain NTs.\n\nLooking for 't5' in the production rules: \n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT22 -> 't22'\nNT23 -> 't14'\nNT25 -> 't33'\nNT50 -> 't49'\nNT52 -> 't71'\nNT53 -> 't30'\nNT58 -> 't27'\nNT61 -> 't13'\nNT77 -> 't8'\nNT82 -> 't2'\n\nWait, but t5 is a terminal. Looking through the rules, is there an NT that expands to t5?\n\nWait, in the production list, 't5' is generated by:\n\nLooking at each rule, no. Wait, actually, looking again, is there a production for any NT that produces 't5'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the production list, for example, NT58 -> NT27 NT47, which isn't t5. NT2 -> 't5' is one of the rules? Wait, no, in the rules I have, there's NT77 -> 't8', which is for 't8', while 't5' is also a terminal somewhere. Wait, wait, checking:\n\nWait, the given rules have 't5' as one of the terminals, but looking through the production rules, I don't see any NT producing 't5'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar by looking at the productions. The start symbol is S, which immediately branches into either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Each NT seems to be a non-terminal that further expands into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t82 t3 t13 t13 t49 t84 t59 g49 g49 g49 g42 g82 g30 g8 g30 g49 g30 g11 g82 g5`.

The string starts with `t82`. Looking at the grammar, T12 produces `t3`, but in this case, the first symbol is `t82`. Let me check the productions for 't82'. From the grammar, I see NT60 \u2192 t84 and NT81 \u2192 t30, but I don't see 't82' in any production. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again, I see in NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45, and another production for NT9 is 't26'. Also, NT25 \u2192 't33'. Hmm. Wait, the string starts with `t82`, but I don't see any production that directly gives 't82'. That's a problem.

That might mean that the first symbol 't82' is derived from some NT that eventually produces t82. Let me check which NT can produce t82.\n\nLooking through the grammar, does any NT production have 't82' as a terminal? Looking through the list, I don't see 't82' listed as a terminal in any production. Wait, maybe it's derived from multiple steps. Or perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the grammar.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t82`, but none of the NT productions directly produce 't82'. That's an issue. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the NT productions, the only terminals are those with 'tX' where X is a number. The NT productions are combinations of other NTs, except for a few that produce terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT45 has a production NT60 NT77, which might eventually lead to t84 and t77. But how does that help with 't82'? Hmm, maybe I'm looking at this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial NT branches produce different things. Let me try to see how the string can be constructed.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT45 NT81. So, the string would start with t82, which comes from NT45 or NT81, but neither NT45 nor NT81 produce t82 directly. So this approach is stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with another production. Wait, the string is given as a series of tokens, but perhaps I should parse it into the NTs and terminals. Let me look at each 't' as a terminal and the rest as NTs or more terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't82' is from some NT production. Let me list all the NTs and their possible productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and also other combinations but one of them is 't60' \u2192 't84' and 't77' \u2192 't8'\nWait, looking at NT45, do any of its productions result in 't82'? It seems not. Let's check NT60: NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, and also 't84'. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t82. Maybe that can't be derived from any of the NTs. If that's the case, then the entire string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the string. Wait, perhaps I should look at the string again: it's \"t82 t3 t13 t13 t49 t84 t59 t49 t49 t49 t42 t82 t30 t8 t30 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the string represents the symbols concatenated without spaces, meaning it's a sequence of tokens, some of which are NTs and others are terminals. But I'm not sure how to parse that.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a sequence of symbols where each symbol is either a non-terminal (NT) or a terminal (tX). To parse it, I need to build a derivation from S to this sequence.\n\nSince the string starts with t82, I need to find a production that starts with t82. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any production where an NT directly produces t82. That means either t82 is not part of the language, or the string cannot be generated because it starts with a symbol not derivable from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NTs are supposed to break down into terms that include t82. Let me see the possible NTs that could produce t82.\n\nWait, NT72 \u2192 't10' and 't44', which is t10 t44. Then t44 could be from another production, maybe NT44 \u2192 't42' and 't76'. Hmm, but the string starts with t82, so I don't see a way to get t82 from any of the NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the string is not a sequence of terminals and NTs, but a single token stream. That wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of symbols, each of which is the result of some production.\n\nBut the initial step from S requires producing either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. For example, if S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then NT45 must produce a sequence that starts with t82, which isn't possible because NT45's productions don't include t82. Alternatively, NT81 would need to produce t82, but NT81's productions don't have t82 either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through all the NTs and their possible terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the entire grammar, I'm trying to find which NTs can produce a 't' symbol. Let's list them:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 | NT40 NT53 | NT27 NT47 | etc. None of these directly produce t-something except for one production where NT45 \u2192 't60' which then can become t84 or something. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I see. For example, NT39 \u2192 't28', so that's a terminal production. Similarly, NT27 \u2192 't35', etc.\n\nWait, let me make a list of NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't11'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT11 \u2192 't5'\n- NT13 \u2192 't47'\n- NT14 \u2192 't25'\n- NT19 \u2192 't60' (when combined with others), but wait: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 for itself? Or is that another production?\n\nWait, looking again, in the grammar:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n\nWait, but that seems off.

{"custom_id":"request-355","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t82 t3 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 t52 t47 t13 t49 t84 t59 t22 t11 t30 t84 t8 t82 t5`. Hmm, that's a lot of tokens. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side. That might help in constructing the parse tree or at least understanding the structure.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production rules are S -> NT45 NT81 and S -> NT19 NT67. So, the start string must be derived from one of these. Since the string starts with `t82`, I need to see which non-symbol can produce it.\n\nWait, the initial step when starting with S (non-terminal) should produce two non-terminals. So the entire string starts with `t82`, which is a terminal, so perhaps the initial production is S -> NT45 NT81. Then, each of these NT needs to derive into the corresponding t's.\n\nLooking at NT45, according to the grammar, NT45 can go to NT60 NT77 or 't44'. Oh, wait, in the grammar, NT45 has two options: -> NT60 NT77 and -> 't44'. Hmm, but in the string, the first token is `t82`. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nWait the string given is: t82 t3 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 t52 t47 t13 t49 t84 t59 t22 t11 t30 t84 t8 t82 t5\n\nI think I might have confused the initial production. Wait, the start symbol S is a non-terminal, which has to generate two non-terminals. But the string starts with t82, which is a terminal. So how does that work?\n\nWait, maybe the initial production is S -> NT45 NT81, and each NT45 and NT81 must produce a string that starts with t82 and then maybe other terminals. Let me see.\n\nWait no, that can't be because each NT45 would produce a t string, and the entire parse would have to concatenate them. So, perhaps S expands into NT45 NT81, and each of those needs to generate some terminal sequence.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the NT45 can produce either NT60 NT77 or 't44'. Hmm, t44 is a terminal. So if NT45 produces 't44', that could be part of the terminal sequence. But in our string, the first token is `t82`. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT.\n\nWait another option is that perhaps the string is built by expanding S into NT45 NT81, then each NT45 and NT81 needs to expand into sequences of terminals. Let me look at NT45's productions:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT45 -> 't44'\n\nSimilarly, NT81 can produce 't82' according to the grammar. Let me check:\n\nWait, for example, NT81's productions:\n- NT81 -> 't71'\n- NT81 -> 't30'\n- NT81 -> 't84'\n- Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, I need to find if any NT81 produces 't82'.\n\nWait let me list all NT81 productions:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\nNT81 -> 't71'\nNT81 -> 't30'\nNT81 -> 't84'\nAnd in another part: NT81 also appears in S -> NT81, so perhaps I should see if NT81 can produce 't30', 't71', or 't84'.\n\nWait, in the given string, the very first token is 't82', but NT81 can't produce t82. Let me check the NTs to see which ones can produce 't82'. Looking through all the NT's, I notice:\n\nNT30 produces 't82', according to the rule NT30 -> 't82'.\n\nSo somewhere in the string, the NT30 must produce 't82'. Hmm. So perhaps the initial NT81 must expand into something that eventually builds up to 't82' through some NTs.\n\nWait, let me start over. The initial string is t82 followed by other tokens. So perhaps the first non-terminal in S must produce somehow the starting t82.\n\nBut looking at S's productions, it expands into two NTs, and each must be terminals in the end? Or maybe through a series of steps. For example, S-> NT45 NT81.\n\nThen NT45 could produce 't44', and NT81 could produce 't82'. But in the string, the first token is t82, which would come from NT81 \u2192 't82'. So then, for the string to start with t82, the initial S must produce something that starts with the production of NT81 \u2192 't82', but wait, S is the start symbol.\n\nWait, no: S is a non-terminal. So when the parser starts, S must expand into two NTs, which in the end will have to produce a string that matches the input. So the first token is t82, which must be the terminal part produced by NT81 expanding. But how does that happen? Because when S expands to NT45 NT81, each NT45 and NT81 need to generate a part of the string, and the two concatenated parts should match the input.\n\nWait, so the first two non-terminals are NT45 and NT81. Let's see:\n\nNT45 can be either 't44' or generate more NTs. Let me see:\n\n- NT45 can produce 't44' or NT60 NT77.\n\nIf S expands to NT45 NT81, and both produce terminals, then we might have two possible contributions: 't44' and 't82', which would make the string start with 't44 t82' or 't82 t44', depending on which NT produces first.\n\nBut in our input, the string starts with t82. So perhaps NT81 produces 't82', and NT45 produces 't44', making the string start with 't44 t82', but that's not our case. Alternatively, maybe NT45 produces a longer string.\n\nWait, maybe I should see if both NT45 and NT81 can generate sequences that, when concatenated, match the start of the string. The first token is 't82', which must come from one of the NTs.\n\nLooking back, the only NT that can produce 't82' directly is NT30 through NT30 -> 't82'. So perhaps one of the NT45 or NT81 branches down to NT30, which then produces 't82'.\n\nSo let's try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. Start with S -> NT45 NT81.\n\n2. Now, NT45 and NT81 each must expand into a sequence of terminals or other NTs, which will produce the string when concatenated.\n\n3. For the first token 't82', this must come from either NT45 or NT81. Let's suppose it comes from NT81.\n\n4. So NT81 must expand into a string that starts with 't82'. How? Looking at the NT81 productions:\n   - NT81 can produce 't30', 't71', or 't84', depending on the production. So one of these must eventually lead to 't82' somewhere.\n\n   Looking further, NT30 produces 't82'. So the path would be NT81 \u2192 NT30 \u2192 't82'.\n\nSo let's see: If NT81 produces 't30', then we have 't30' as the first token. But the string starts with 't82', which would not match unless there's an error. Alternatively, if NT81 somehow leads to 't82' directly, but according to the grammar, NT81's productions don't have a 't82' option.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial NT45 produces 't44', and NT81 produces a string that starts with 't82'. So the first two tokens would be 't44 t82'. But in our string, the first token is 't82', so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps both NT45 and NT81 produce multiple tokens, and their concatenation starts with 't82'.\n\nHmm, maybe I should try to simulate the parse.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the entire string and see if it can be broken down into sub-sequences that match some production rules.\n\nLet's list the tokens:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-383","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by it. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might take a while, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. The given grammar has a bunch of these rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t84 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t13 t49 t84 t59 t77 t30 t49 t30 t11 t30 t49 t59 t82 t5`. That's a lot of t's followed by numbers. I notice that some of these are terminals, like 't8', 't25', etc., which are the actual terminal symbols, but others are like 't84', which might be non-terminals or their expansion.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, in the grammar, terminals are the ones on the right-hand side that are not split further. For example, 't25' is a terminal because it appears as a terminal in some production.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand into two non-terminals or into a terminal. The terminals are the ones that appear on the right side without being split, like 't5', 't7', etc.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is parse the string and see if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking for the start symbol, which is S. The start symbol S in the grammar is given by S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. So, S expands into two non-terminals. That means the string starts with either NT45 followed by NT81 or NT19 followed by NT67.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first two tokens are t84 and t30. Hmm, wait, NT45 and NT81 are non-terminals, but t84 and t30 are terminals. So, I think I might need to see how the string can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's try building a parse tree from the string, starting with S. Since S is at the top level, it has two non-terminals: either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67. Let's check which one makes more sense with the string.\n\nLet me see: the string starts with t84. Let me check which non-terminals can expand into t84. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n- NT45 also appears as NT45 -> 't25' (so that's a terminal)\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT81 -> 't71' and others\n- NT36 -> t42\n- NT44 -> t76\n- NT47 -> t84\nWait, so NT47 expands into 't84', which is exactly the first token in the string. So maybe the first symbol is part of NT47.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the productions for 't84':\n\nLooking for t84 on the right side of the productions. I see that NT47 is a non-terminal that can produce 't84'. So NT47 -> t84. Similarly, NT74 -> t72 and 't5', but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo the first token in the string is t84, which comes from NT47. Therefore, the first part of the string is derived from NT47. Now, in the grammar, which production for NT47 is there?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\nNT47 -> t84. So that's a direct production. So the first symbol t84 comes from NT47. But wait, that would mean that NT47 is a non-terminal that can produce t84 directly. But in the grammar, NT47 only has that production. So NT47 must expand into t84.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. In the given grammar, I see NT47's productions:\n\nLooking for NT47:\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\nNT47 -> t84.\n\nYes, that's the only production for NT47. So that means NT47 can only produce t84. So if the first token is t84, then the non-terminal is NT47.\n\nSo the string starts with t84, which is from NT47. Now, since S is S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67, and NT47 is part of the expansion of S in the second option: S -> NT19 NT67, but wait, NT19 was another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify: The production is S -> NT19 NT67, meaning S expands into NT19 followed by NT67. So both are non-terminals. So the entire string must be generated by expanding all these non-terminals into the appropriate terminals.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that T84 is the first symbol, which comes from NT47, so that would require that the first expansion is part of a different production.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the approach. Maybe I should consider that each non-terminal can generate sequences of terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by breaking the string into parts and seeing if they can match the productions.\n\nLet me list out the string again:\n\nt84, t30, t84, t84, t84, t28, t47, t13, t49, t84, t59, t77, t30, t49, t30, t11, t30, t49, t59, t82, t5.\n\nWait, that's 21 symbols. Since S is S -> NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67, which are both two non-terminals, each of which will expand further, we'll have a parse tree of depth 3, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this string as starting from S, expanding each non-terminal into the appropriate sequence until we get all the terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to reverse-engineer the string.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStart from the beginning: t84 is produced by NT47. So the first part of the string is produced by NT47, which directly turns into t84.\n\nSo the first part is \"t84\", which comes from NT47, and the next part would be NT81, because S -> NT47 NT81 in this case. So after t84, the remaining string should be the expansion of NT81.\n\nWait, no, S is either NT45 followed by NT81 or NT19 followed by NT67. If the first symbol is NT47, which is part of S's second option (S -> NT19 NT67), but wait, NT19 is a non-terminal that produces t84 among other things. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should note that each non-terminal in the grammar has specific productions, so I should know how to expand them into other symbols.\n\nLet me list out some key non-terminals that can produce terminals we see in the string:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t84: only NT47.\n\nLooking for NT that produce t28: I see that NT27 -> t35, but t28 is produced by NT2 via NT22 -> t22 and others? Wait, looking through the grammar:\n\nNo, the production for NT2 is likely something else. Wait, looking:\n\nIn the grammar, NT2 is only used in parts where it can produce other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I should look for NT that produce the specific string fragments.\n\nLooking for t30, which is present multiple times. Let me see: NT30 can be found in multiple productions. For example, NT72 -> t10 NT44, but not directly. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t84, which must come from NT47 (since NT47 -> t84).\n\nSo the first two symbols are t84, which is NT47, followed by the next symbol. Wait, no, S -> NT47 NT81 would mean the string should start with NT47 followed by NT81's expansion. Or if S is S -> NT19 NT67, then S would start with NT19 followed by NT67.\n\nBut the first symbol is t84, which is from NT47, so perhaps the first expansion is S -> NT47 NT81.\n\nWait, but according to the rules, S can only"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-395","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) can be parsed using methods like the CYK algorithm, which checks if a string can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. That should simplify the parsing a bit.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive. The start symbol is S, and each production either starts with S or another non-terminal NT followed by 't' and a number. Each production eventually terminates with a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t82 t71 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 t39 t47 t77 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t32 t49 t76 t82 t5.\n\nThat's 20 tokens, each a terminal. So, I need to see if the entire string can be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is a single step replacing one non-terminal with two other non-terminals. The CYK algorithm involves filling a table based on the grammar and the input string.\n\nBut since I might not remember CYK in detail, I can try to find if there's a way to build the string step by step. Let's see how the grammar can generate these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the main productions are:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\nS -> NT19 NT67\n\nSo, S can generate strings that start with either NT45 followed by NT81 or NT19 followed by NT67.\n\nEach NT is a non-terminal, like NT1, NT2, up to NT84, etc. Wait, in the list of productions, I see NT5, NT7, etc. Each production on the non-terminals either produces another pair of non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT5 -> NT9 NT53 | 't26' (Wait, looking back, actually one of the productions is NT9 -> 't22' and another is NT71 -> 't52'. Wait, I need to check the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT45 -> 't25'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT39 -> 't28'\n- NT13 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT81 -> 't71'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT27 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't83'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't59'\n- NT52 -> 't71'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT23 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't52'\n- NT50 -> 't49'\n- NT83 -> 't30'\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT22 -> 't42'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT61 -> 't13'\n\nWait, I think I miswrote some of that. Let me look again. Each production is of the form NTx -> NTy NTz or NTx -> 'tnumber'.\n\nI notice that for example, NT60 -> NT30 NT84. NT30 -> 't82' and NT84 -> 't71', so NT60 can produce 't82 t71'.\n\nSimilarly, NT71 -> NT52, and NT52 -> 't71' (since one of the productions is NT52 -> 't71'), so NT71 can produce 't71 t71'. Wait, no, NT52 -> 't71' only, so NT71 is NT52, which would produce 't71' directly? Wait, no: NT71 -> NT52, which then produces 't71', so NT71 can produce 't71'.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is a list of terminals: t82, t71, t30, t33, t26, t84, t30, t39, t47, t77, t47, t13, t49, t84, t30, t11, t13, t32, t49, t76, t82, t5. Wait, wait, actually no, let me count again. Wait, the string is: t82 t71 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 t39 t47 t77 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t32 t49 t76 t82 t5. Wait, that's 21 tokens. Wait, initial string was 20, but I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the string is written as:\n\nt82 t71 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 t39 t47 t77 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t32 t49 t76 t82 t5\n\nWait, let me count the number of tokens. Each space separates tokens, so let's see:\n\nt82, t71, t30, t33, t26, t84, t30, t39, t47, t77, t47, t13, t49, t84, t30, t11, t13, t32, t49, t76, t82, t5. That's 21 tokens.\n\nHmm, but the start symbol S produces two non-terminals. Each production step replaces a non-terminal with two others, and each non-terminal eventually produces a terminal.\n\nThis means that for the string of n terminals, the derivation tree must have n leaves, and the number of internal nodes would be such that the entire string can be generated starting from S.\n\nSince S can produce two non-terminals, the initial step would break down into two parts. Then, each of those could produce more non-terminals, and so on, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, but since it's context-free, it's more about the structure of the tree.\n\nGiven the string has 21 terminals, the parse would require 20 non-terminals, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful. Instead, perhaps it's better to try to parse the string from the start.\n\nAnother approach is to list all possible production sequences that can reach the terminals. Let's try to see if we can find a parse tree for the string.\n\nStarting from S, S can be NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLet me check the possibility for both branches.\n\nFirst, let's assume S produces NT45 NT81.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT45 and NT81. Each of these needs to produce a string that starts with their respective productions.\n\nLooking at NT45: productions:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77 or 't25'\n\nBut 't25' may not be part of our string. Our first terminal is 't82', so NT45 must produce 't82' via the second option. Wait, wait, looking back: one of the productions is NT45 -> 't77' or something? Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\n\nWait, looking through, I see:\n\nWait, under the grammar, one of the NT productions is 't45' -> 't25', so NT45 can directly produce 't25' which is not part of the string. Another production is NT45 -> NT60 NT77, so that would yield two non-terminals. So to start, NT45 can produce either 't25' (but not in the string) or NT60 NT77.\n\nSimilarly, NT81: NT81 can produce 't71' directly as per production NT81 -> 't71'. So, in S -> NT45 NT81, the second part produces 't71' immediately.\n\nSo, the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-422","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain optimizations, but it also restricts how the non-terminals can expand.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which branches into two non-terminals in two different productions: NT45 NT81 and NT19 NT67. So, any string generated by the grammar will start with a sequence derived from one of these two.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t82 t3 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t42 t49 t76 t30 t25 t84 t8 t82 t5`.\n\nI'll start by checking if the string starts with any of the productions starting from S. The grammar has two initial options: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nSo the string must start with a derivation that begins with NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLet me analyze the first few symbols of the string: t82, t3, t13, t13, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals that expand into terminals are several, like NT0, NT5, NT12, etc., but I need to see if any of them produce 't82' directly because that's the first symbol in the string.\n\nScanning the productions, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT60 \u2192 't84'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n- NT45 \u2192 't42'\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (from NT5's production)\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (from NT2's production)\n- NT71 \u2192 't52'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8' (from NT45 \u2192 't25' and NT45 \u2192 't60' etc.)\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I don't immediately see an NT that directly produces 't82'.

Therefore, that's a terminal.\n\nWait, so back to the original string. The string starts with 't82 t3 t13 t13 t49...'\n\nHmm. So the first symbol is 't82', which is a terminal. Let's see if any non-terminals A have A \u2192 't82'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't71' (from NT81)\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the productions, I see that NT61 produces 't13', because:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT53 NT12\n\nAnd looking at NT53, there's a production NT53 \u2192 't30'\n\nAnd NT12 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't82' comes from NT9's production.

The string to evaluate is: `t82 t30 t30 t82 t3 t84 t84 t28 t47 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t76 t42 t11 t30 t82 t71 t8 t82 t5`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a grammar in CNF has rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. Each production either breaks a non-terminal into two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal.\n\nGiven the grammar, it's a set of productions defined for various non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.), and terminals (the 't' followed by numbers). The string consists entirely of terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived starting from S.\n\nI'll start by looking at the possible top-level productions for S. The grammar has two initial S productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, the first step is to see which of these can derive into the given string.\n\nLet me analyze the string: it's a sequence of 't's and numbers. The terminals like t82, t30, etc., correspond to specific production rules. I'll need to break down the string into parts that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NT rules are broken down into pairs of NTs, so each production for S will generate two NTs. Each of these NTs must then produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLet's take the first S \u2192 NT45 NT81. NT45's production is: NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44 and NT50 \u2192 NT49; NT44 can be 't42' or 't76'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT44 has two productions: NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT7 and NT44 \u2192 't59'. Similarly, NT50 \u2192 NT49 and NT49 \u2192 NT84 NT39. Wait, perhaps I should outline all possible NT productions.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be split into two parts, each derived from the NTs in the S production. Let me consider S \u2192 NT45 NT81 first.\n\nSo, the entire string would need to consist of two sequences: one from NT45 and another from NT81. Let's split the string into two parts. The first part could be the first few tokens, and the second part the rest. Alternatively, the split can be at any point, but given the string length, perhaps the middle splits would be around 13-14 tokens each.\n\nWait, but the string is 25 tokens, so each part would need to account for some number of tokens. Let's consider how the NTs can produce terminal sequences. For example, Ntwould start as:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n- Then NT50 \u2192 NT49\n- And NT44 can be either 't76' or 't59'\n\nSo, NT45 can produce 't76' or 't59' followed by 't49'. Wait, no: NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44 and NT44 \u2192 t76 or t59. So NT45 can become a sequence ending with t76 or t59.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should list all the possible terminal sequences each NT can produce.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be generated by either of the two S productions.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Then, the overall string is [NT45 production] followed by [NT81 production].\n\nSimilarly, for S \u2192 NT19 NT67, the string would be [NT19 production] followed by [NT67 production].\n\nSo, let me first check if the string starts with NT19 or NT45, etc.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't82'. So I need to see if any NT can produce 't82' as the terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT81 has two rules:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT45 NT36 (but this isn't directly 't82' but further breaks down)\n- NT81 \u2192 't30'\n\nWait, no, the grammar has NT81 \u2192 't30' because looking at the rules, there's: NT81 -> 't30'\n\nWait, checking the grammar, I have:\n\n- NT81 -> 't30'\n\nYes, because the rule is written as NT81 -> 't30'. Similarly, other NTs may produce specific terminals.\n\nWait, let me check all the NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT72 -> NT10 NT44\n- NT30 -> 't82'\nWait, no, NT30 is defined as NT30 -> 't82'? Or looking back:\n\nWait, the full list:\n\nNT30 -> 't82'\nYes, that's correct. So NT30 \u2192 't82'.\n\nTherefore, if a production results in NT30, it will produce 't82'.\n\nSimilarly, NT92? Wait, no, let's check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, any NT that directly becomes 'tX' where X is some number.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT72: NT10 -> NT50 NT47, etc., so NT72 doesn't produce a terminal directly.\n- NT36: two options, neither produce terminals directly.\n- NT84: two options, both non-terminals.\n- NT45: NT50 NT44, so no terminal.\n- NT75: NT23 NT45, no.\n- NT5: NT9 NT53, no.\n- NT71: NT9 NT75, no.\n- NT58: NT27 NT47, no.\n- NT14: NT25 NT52, no.\n- NT19: NT84 NT8, no.\n- NT45: already checked.\n- NT72: checked.\n- NT40: NT14 NT71, no.\n- NT19: as above.\n- NT27: NT60 NT47, no.\n- NT23: NT61 NT74, no.\n- NT9: NT36 NT45, no.\n- NT5: NT9 NT53, no.\n- NT71: NT12 NT84, no.\n- NT52: NT9 NT0.\n- NT81: NT30 NT30, or NT60 NT77, etc. But wait, NT81's rules include NT30 \u2192 't82' in some cases.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT81 -> NT45 NT36 or 't30'\n\nSo, NT81 can produce 't30' directly, via NT81 -> 't30'.\n\nSimilarly, for NT30: NT30 -> 't82'\n\nSo, if I have a sequence of NT81 and NT30, they could generate 't30' and 't82' respectively.\n\nWait, the string is: t82 t30 t30 t82 t3 t84 t84 t28 t47 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t76 t42 t11 t30 t82 t71 t8 t82 t5\n\nSo, let me look for the entire string and see if it can break down into two parts, each derived from either S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider if the string can be split into two parts where each part is matched by NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67.\n\nLet me first consider S \u2192 NT45 NT81. So, the first part is NT45 and the second part is NT81.\n\nLet's look for the production of NT45. From the grammar, NT45 can be:\n\n- NT50 NT44\n- 't76'\n\nNo, wait, checking: NT45 \u2192 't76' or NT75 \u2192 't32'? Wait, no.\n\nWait, the grammar for NT45 is: NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 or 't76'?\n\nWait, checking again: According to the grammar, NT45's production is:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- Also, is there another production? No. So NT45 only produces NT60 NT77, which are non-terminals. So NT45 cannot directly produce 't76'; that must be via the production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t82 t71 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t76 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t42 t11 t30 t25 t82 t71 t8 t82 t5`. \n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which helps because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form makes it easier to analyze using parsers like CYK, but maybe I can approach this differently since the string is already provided.\n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar rules and trying to see what strings can be formed. The terminals start with 't' and some numbers, which are terminals. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT5, NT6, etc.\n\nThe string starts with t82, t71, t30, etc. I need to see how these can be produced by the grammar. Let's break down the string into tokens since it's a sequence, but in the grammar, it's a single string with these letters and numbers. Wait, actually, the grammar's productions have terminals as t followed by numbers or letters like t25, t8, etc. Or sometimes it's just 't' followed by a number, like 't25'.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar rules, some terminals are like 't25', but others might be 't' followed by a number. Wait, no, all the terminals are of the form 't' followed by two digits, like 't25', 't71', etc., except for 't' itself? Wait, no, let me check. The grammar has NT5 -> 't9', but wait, wait: I see rules like NT5 -> 't9', NT7 -> 't11', etc. So some terminals are single characters with numbers, like 't9', 't11', etc., while others like 't2', when written as 't25' would be two characters but in the string, each token is separated by spaces, so it's 't82', which is 't' followed by 82 as a single terminal token.\n\nWait, no, in the string, the tokens are 't82', 't71', etc., each being a single terminal symbol consisting of 't' followed by two digits. So each token in the string is 't' followed by two digits, like 't82' or 't23'. So, in the grammar, each terminal seems to be either 't' followed by two digits or a single digit, but looking at the rules, NT5 -> 't9', which is 't' followed by a single digit 9. So that's a terminal of length two? No, wait, 't9' would be a two-character terminal token. Similarly, 't25' is a three-character token? Wait, no, actually, the way the rules are written, 't25' is a terminal symbol that's just the string \"t25\", meaning a token consisting of 't', '2', and '5'\u2014three characters.\n\nWait, but the given string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, each token being e.g., 't82', which is two characters. However, the grammar has rules like NT5 -> 't9' which is a terminal symbol that is the string \"t9\"\u2014two characters. Similarly, NT71 -> 't52' is the string \"t52\", which is three characters. But in the given string, all tokens are two characters long. So I need to check which terminals in the grammar correspond to two-character tokens.\n\nLooking back, I see that some rules produce two-character terminals, like NT9 -> 't26', which is \"t26\"; NT84 -> 't77', \"t77\"; NT2 -> 't5'; wait, 't5' is two characters. Also, NT81 -> 't30'; \"t30\" is three characters, but in the string, it's a separate token. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The string is a list of tokens: 't82', 't71', etc., each of which is a single terminal symbol consisting of 't' followed by two digits. So in the grammar, each terminal must correspond to such a token.\n\nSo I need to see which non-terminals can produce these exact terminals. For example, 't82' is produced by NT82? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, do any rules produce 't82'? Looking through the production rules:\n\nI see NT60 -> 't84' and NT40 -> 't39'. Wait, but I don't see any rule that directly produces 't82' or 't71'. Hmm, that might be a problem. So, perhaps none of the rules produce 't82' or 't71' directly, so they must be produced as a combination of steps.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me list the rules again to check:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\n- S produces NT45 NT81 and other combinations. But 't82' and 't71' don't seem to be direct productions of S or intermediate non-terminals. So perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to see which non-terminals can produce 't82' and 't71' as terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, the only way 't82' could be produced is if a non-terminal like NT82 has a rule -> 't82', but I don't see such a rule. Similarly, NT71 -> 't52', which is a three-character string. So perhaps the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe through a series of productions. For example, perhaps a path like S \u2192 NT45 NT81, and then each of those non-terminals split further.\n\nBut to get 't82' as the first token, let's see if any non-terminal can produce 't82' as a terminal. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any rule where nt -> 't82'. Similarly for 't71', the rule NT71 \u2192 't52' is the only production for NT71, which is 't52', not 't71'.\n\nSo unless 't71' is produced by another route, but I don't see any production that ends in 't71'. Therefore, the initial token 't71' in the string cannot be generated by any of the non-terminals in the grammar.

The grammar starts with S and has several production rules that break down into non-terminals and terminals. Terminal symbols are the ones that correspond to the 't' followed by numbers or other standalone symbols. For example, 't84' is a terminal, just like 't5' or 't22'. \n\nI notice that many of the non-terminals (NTx) have production rules that either split into two other non-terminals or connect directly to a terminal.

No, wait, actually, looking at the production rules, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check the full list again.\n\nWait, I think I might have the rules wrong. Let me look at them more carefully.\n\nThe production rules are a bit confusing because some of them have 't' followed by numbers as part of a NT rule, but others might have NT rules that split into other NTs and terminals.\n\nFor example, I see that NT45 -> 't25' which would mean that NT45 produces the terminal 't25'. So if the string has 't25', that would be correct, but 't84' needs to be produced by some NT.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that NT77 -> 't8', so that's for 't8', NT72 -> 't10', NT75 -> 't32', NT44 -> 't76', NT71 -> 't52', etc. Hmm, perhaps I should make a list of all terminal symbols in the grammar and see if 't84' is among them.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT30 -> 't82'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT53 -> 't30'\n\nNT81 -> 't71'\n\nNT40 -> 't39'\n\nNT9 -> 't26'\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nOh! Wait, here's NT47 -> 't84'. That's important. So NT47 can produce 't84'. So in the string, whenever there's a 't84', it could have come from NT47.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't84', so that would need to come from NT47. So that's possible.\n\nMoving forward, after 't84', the next token is 't13'. So I need to find out which NT can produce 't13'.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT13 -> 't47'. So, NT13 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal 't47', not 't13'. Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe I misread that. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the rule is NT13 -> 't47', which produces 't47', not 't13'. So that's a problem because in the string, we have 't13'. So is there any NT that can produce 't13'? Looking through, I don't see any NT in the rules that directly produce 't13' except possibly NT53 or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nNT71 -> NT9 NT75 \u2192 But NT9 -> 't26' and NT75 -> 't32'. So NT71 can eventually produce 't26' or other terminals.\n\nWait, let me approach this differently. I'll try to parse the string step by step, assuming possible substitutions.\n\nThe string is: t84 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t33 t42 t11 t84 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t77 t47 t32 t25 t82 t5.\n\nI can try to split the string into a sequence of production rules. Each part of the string must come from either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So each token in the string must correspond to either a single terminal, which must match a terminal in the grammar, or a pair of non-terminals, each of which can be replaced further.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, all the non-terminals produce either terminals or two non-terminals. However, the string contains only terminals, so each token in the string must come from a terminal in the grammar, or from a non-terminal that can produce that terminal.\n\nSo, for each token in the string, it must be a terminal that exists in the grammar's terminal symbols, or it must be the result of a production that eventually terminates in that token.\n\nBut wait, the string only has tokens like 't84', 't13', 't30', etc., and in the grammar, each non-terminal either splits into two non-terminals or connects to a terminal.\n\nHowever, in the string, some tokens don't seem to be direct terminals in the grammar. For example, 't30' is in the grammar as NT30 -> 't82', so that's possible. 't13' is not a terminal in the grammar. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't13'. Similarly, 't49' is another token; I don't see any NT that directly produces it.\n\nSo this is a problem. If 't30' isn't a direct terminal, but a result of a production from NT30 -> 't82', then the string can't have t30 unless the grammar has a way to derive t30 from t82 or something else.\n\nWait, but no. Let me clarify: In Chomsky normal form, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal. So in this grammar, each production is A->BC or A->a.\n\nMeaning, each terminal in the string must be the result of a production that directly maps some non-terminal to it.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal symbols are:\n\n- 't5', 't25', 't8', 't77', 't36', 't42', 't11', 't84', 't30', 't9', 't40', 't27', 't71', 't53', 't30', 't22', 't23', 't74',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-462","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to check if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens, each of which ends with a 't' followed by a number. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) is a set of production rules that generate all possible strings of a formal language. In Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for simplifying parsing because it restricts the structure of the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, every non-terminal symbol on the left side of the production rules has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for a few productions where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal character (like NT27 \u2192 't35'). So, this is in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nNext, I need to determine if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules. The string to evaluate is:\n\n`t82 t30 t13 t13 t49 t84 t59 t30 t39 t47 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t49 t49 t42 t25 t30 t25 t49 t59 t82 t5`.\n\nI notice that each token ends with a number, which suggests these are terminals. However, in CNF, most productions have each non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals. But some terminals can be directly produced, so perhaps this is a mix of both.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C can be non-terminals or terminals? No, no\u2014Wait, CNF requires all productions to have B and C as non-terminals, except for the cases where A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So, in any case, each production either expands into two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nBut in our grammar, some rules have a terminal on the right side, but the way the rules are structured, for example, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, which is two non-terminals. NT45 also appears in other rules like S \u2192 NT45 NT81, so S is derived from two non-terminals.\n\nBut for each token in the string, unless it's a non-terminal that appears as a right-hand side in some production, the token must be generated directly. So, let's first list all the terminal symbols in the string and see if they match the ones in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are 't8', 't25', 't27', 't22', 't47', 't36', 't14', 't15', 't9', 't5', etc. Wait, let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nI realize that some of the productions expand to a single terminal, like NT45 \u2192 't25', which is just a terminal. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 't8', and NT8 \u2192 't83'. So these are terminals.\n\nBut the string has tokens like 't82', which might need to be derived from some non-terminals if they are on the right-hand side of a production.\n\nSo perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and terminals present in the grammar and check the string accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can approach this by building a parse tree from the start symbol and see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can note that the string starts with 't82', but in the grammar, 't82' is a terminal, right? Let me check: in the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't26', NT36 \u2192 't42', etc. Wait, looking through the productions:\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides, I see that NT81 \u2192 't71', NT84 \u2192 't77', etc. Hmm, I don't see 't82' being directly produced by any non-terminal. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking at NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, which expands to 't84' and 't71', so that's not 't82'. NT9 \u2192 't26'. NT13 \u2192 't47'. Oh, wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through all the productions that have terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT53 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT81 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT60 \u2192 't84'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't59'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT81 \u2192 't30'\n\nWait, I don't see 't82' being a terminal. All the terminals seem to be 't25', 't8', 't26', etc. So 't82' isn't a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because in the string, the first token is 't82', but 't82' isn't a terminal in the grammar. So unless 't82' can be derived from a non-terminal, it can't appear in the generated string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there any production where a non-terminal expands to 't82'? Scanning all the non-terminals, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly goes to 't82'. The closest is NT50 \u2192 't49', and NT30 \u2192 't82'.\n\nSo NT30 \u2192 't82' is a production. But in the grammar, NT30 is a non-terminal, so 't82' is a terminal. Therefore, 't82' must be a terminal symbol. But in the grammar, 't82' is not present as a terminal. Therefore, 't82' cannot be produced by any non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I don't see a production that ends with 't82'. So that suggests that 't82' is not in the terminals of the grammar, meaning that the string contains a terminal symbol that's not allowed, so the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in checking. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nFor example, NT30 \u2192 't82' is not present. Instead, NT30's production is NT84 NT2. Wait: No, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, I think I misread the productions. The grammar provided is:\n\nS-> NT45 NT81\n\nS-> NT19 NT67\n\nNT5 -> NT61 NT75\n\nNT0 -> NT47 NT53\n\nNT12-> NT40 NT13\n\nNT74-> NT72 NT5\n\nNT36-> NT84 NT53\n\nNT75-> NT23 NT45\n\nNT36-> NT50 NT36\n\nNT60-> NT30 NT81 \u2192 So NT60\u2192 't84' (from NT30\u2192't82'? Wait no, NT60\u2192't84' via NT30\u2192't82'? Wait no.\n\nWait, perhaps I was confused earlier. Let me list all the productions where a non-terminal produces a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the productions in the grammar, here are the ones that produce terminals:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't84'\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't59'\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't30' [duplicate]\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n\nHmm, so 't82' is produced by NT30, which is a non-terminal. So the string can have 't82' as the first symbol only if it's the result of NT30 expanding to 't82'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't82'. So for the start symbol S, which expands into NT45 and NT81, then NT45 can be NT60 and NT77, and NT77 \u2192 't8'. Wait, but the string starts with 't82', which would require a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if 't82' can be reached from S.\n\nBut S's productions are NT45 and NT81. So starting with S, the first expansion would give NT45 NT81.

{"custom_id":"request-460","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, context-free grammars... I remember they work with production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side can be any combination of terminals and non-terminals. Chomsky Normal Form usually has each production rule being either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar given, I see it's indeed in Chomsky Normal Form because each production on the right side has either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Some examples are S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75. So that's reassuring.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t84 t30 t33 t71 t39 t47 t77 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t14 t49 t30 t11 t25 t82 t5. It looks like it's a sequence of terminal symbols, so the problem is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how the grammar and the string relate. The start symbol is S, and from S, the only productions are S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So the first step is to see if the string starts with either of the terminals generated by NT45 or NT19.\n\nLooking at the NT45 production rules:\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\nBut wait, looking back, some of these non-terminals expand into terminals. For example, NT45 can eventually produce 't25' or other terminals. But in the given string, the first symbol is t84, which isn't directly produced by any of the initial productions. Let me check the NT45 and NT19 rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out all the production rules to see which terminals are present. Let me scan through them:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, which eventually can produce t25, t26, etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 t11\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t83\n- NT9 \u2192 various t symbols\n- NT1 \u2192 I don't see one defined here, but looking at the rules, I don't see a production for NT1. Hmm, wait, S goes to NT19 and NT45. So maybe NT19 is a non-terminal. Or perhaps NT19 is part of another production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to see which terminals are present in the string and if they can be generated by any of the non-terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t84. So I need to see if there's a production rule that can generate t84 as a terminal. Scanning through the productions:\n\n- I see NT77 producing 't8', but t84 isn't directly there.\n- NT44 can produce 't76'.\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71' and 't30', among others.\n- NT30 \u2192 't82' and others.\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n\nHmm, t84 isn't directly a terminal in any production. Looking further, maybe through some non-terminals, but I'm not seeing t84 as a direct terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the NT84 rule: NT84 \u2192 't77'? Wait, no, looking back, it's actually NT77 \u2192 't8'. So that's a different symbol. Similarly, NT84 isn't directly a terminal; it must be derived from a production that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see if any production can directly or indirectly generate the string. Perhaps I should start from the string and try to see if it can be split into parts that match the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long, so another approach could be to see if any part of the string can be matched to a production, especially the start symbol S. But looking at the first symbol, t84, which I don't see being directly produced, so perhaps S can't produce a string starting with t84 because its only productions are starting with NT45 or NT19, which don't directly produce t84.\n\nWait, but maybe through some productions, NT45 or NT19 can eventually produce t84. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the NT45 production:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n\nThen, NT60 can go to NT30 NT81. NT30 \u2192 NT82, etc. But does any path from NT45 eventually produce t84? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the NT5 production: NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53. NT9 can go to 't26' or other terms.\n\nWait, maybe the tree would have to branch in a way that combines the terminals. This might get complex, but I think the main issue here is that the first symbol is t84. Since S can only produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67, which are combinations of non-terminals, and none of these directly produce t84 as the first symbol, then the string can't start with t84 unless some of the non-terminals produce it.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT45 NT81: So the string would start with what NT45 produces as a terminal plus what NT81 produces. Similarly, S \u2192 NT19 NT67: string would start with what NT19 produces plus NT67.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, let's check if any non-terminal can produce t84.\n\nWait, looking through all the non-terminals, I see production rules where some non-terminals expand into 't...' symbols, but none directly produce 't84' as a terminal. For instance, NT77 \u2192 't8', NT75 \u2192 't32', NT74 \u2192 't72', etc. So I don't see any NT generating t84 as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the start symbol S to derive a string starting with t84 because S's first productions lead to sequences starting with NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67, which don't directly produce t84. Hence, the string starting with t84 can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe through some left or right derivations, but since all the non-terminals are producing terminal symbols further down, not starting with them, so no, it's impossible.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Also, the start symbol is S. The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens, which I assume are terminal symbols, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe string given is: `t84 t13 t13 t49 t84 t76 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t76 t13 t13 t49 t84 t76 t22 t11 t30 t25 t84 t8 t25 t82 t5`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice some terminal symbols like 't25', 't8', etc. So, my first step is to see how each of these terminal symbols can be derived from non-terminals.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string from left to right, trying to match each token using the grammar. Alternatively, reverse the approach where I try to generate the string from the start symbol.\n\nWait, but given it's a context-free grammar, the parsers can be top-down, like recursive descent. So maybe I can simulate that process.\n\nLet me list out the production rules for the non-terminals that have 't' as part of their right-hand sides.

For example, NT45 can produce 't25', NT77 is 't8', and so on.\n\nI think I should create a mapping of which non-terminals can produce which terminal symbols. Let me make a list:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't25' (1 production)\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n- NT13 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't11'\n- NT36 \u2192 't42'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT44 \u2192 't59'\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT12 \u2192 't3'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT60 \u2192 't84'\n- NT81 \u2192 't3' (another production, so NT81 can produce both 't71' and 't3'?)\nWait, looking back, NT81 has two productions: NT81 -> NT30 NT81 and NT81 -> 't71'. Wait no, looking back at the grammar, I see that NT81 is defined as:\n\nNT81 -> NT30 NT81\n\nand\n\nNT81 -> 't71'\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. In the grammar:\n\nNT81 -> NT30 NT81\nNT81 -> 't71'\n\nWait, so NT81 can produce either NT30 NT81 or 't71'. But that seems like a left recursion. So I should probably eliminate that to avoid infinite loops.\n\nSimilarly, NT60 -> NT30 NT81 and NT60 -> 't84'. So NT60 can be 't84' or a combination involving NT30 and NT81.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should first process all the non-terminals that can directly produce terminals, and then see how they can be combined.\n\nLet me list all non-terminals that have productions ending with terminals:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n- NT13 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't11'\n- NT36 \u2192 't42'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71' (and others)\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n\nAdditionally, NT81 has a production to itself (left recursion) which I should eliminate. So I can rewrite the left recursion as:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT30 NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT30 NT81 \u2192 ... until it terminates with 't71'.\n\nSimilarly, NT60 can produce 't84' or NT30 followed by NT81, which would then produce 't71'.\n\nBut perhaps for parsing, it's easier to process each token step by step, checking if it can be derived from any non-terminal.\n\nSo the string is:\n\nt84 t13 t13 t49 t84 t76 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t76 t13 t13 t49 t84 t76 t22 t11 t30 t25 t84 t8 t25 t82 t5.\n\nFirst, let's count the tokens to see the structure. Each token is a single 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string has 27 tokens.\n\nNow, I'll try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nWait no, S is the start symbol, and the production is S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. So the start is two non-terminals.\n\nSo the first two tokens must be derived from NT45 and NT81, or NT19 and NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't84', which must come from one of the non-terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Similarly, NT44 has two rules: one giving 't76' and another giving 't59'. I need to make sure I correctly handle these. Probably,NT44's rule (44 -> t76) might have been intended as the earlier one, and the other was an error or repetition.

So, I need to see if S can derive to this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So, the string must begin with one of these pairs.\n\nFirst, split the string into the first two tokens: `t84 t30`. Wait, the first token is `t84`, which is a terminal, and the next is `t30`. But according to the grammar, S's first production is NT45 followed by NT81. Both NT45 and NT81 are non-terminals. So, each must be derived into a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the production NT45: NT45 can produce 't25' (producing a single 't') or other combinations.\n\nWait, looking at the rules for NT45:\n\nRule 15: NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n\nRule 26: NT44 -> NT50 NT44\n\nRule 39: NT36 -> NT50 NT36\n\nRule 44: NT44 -> 't76'\n\nWait, rule 44: NT44 -> 't76' but there's another rule for NT44 earlier? Oh, wait, I think I might have misnumbered earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT45 has two rules: one at rule 15 (NT45 -> NT60 NT77) and another at rule 39 (NT36 -> NT50 NT36). Wait, no, NT45's production is defined as NT45 -> NT60 NT77, and I also see NT44's production. I think I might have misnumbered earlier, but in any case, let's list all NT45's productions:\n\nRule 15: NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n\nRule 44: NT44 -> 't76'\n\nWait, maybe I should list all NT45's produce:\n\nLooking in the given grammar:\n\n15. NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n\nI think that's the only production for NT45. So, NT45 can only produce NT60 NT77, which are non-terminals.\n\nThen, NT60 produces either NT30 NT81 or NT30. Wait, rule 10: NT60 -> NT30 NT81, and rule 54: NT60 -> 't84'. So, NT60 can either produce a combination of NT30 and NT81 or the terminal 't84'.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 is a terminal 't8' (rule 33).\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT45 NT81.\n\nSo the first two symbols should be produced by NT45 and NT81, respectively.\n\nBut in the string, the first two symbols are 't84' and 't30'.

{"custom_id":"request-499","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I need to evaluate is `t82 t3 t30 t76 t84 t28 t47 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t26 t30 t84 t8 t82 t71 t8 t82 t5`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, except for the case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly, like A \u2192 a. So, looking at the grammar, it does have some production rules that result in terminals, such as NT44 \u2192 't25', NT81 \u2192 't3', etc. So, the start symbol is S, which branches into different non-terminals, and these eventually expand into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nThe string provided consists of a sequence of terminal tokens. My task is to check whether this specific sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules of the grammar.\n\nOne approach to tackle this is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be generated. Alternatively, I can simulate the process step by step, keeping track of the non-terminals that need to produce each part of the string.\n\nLet me look at the first terminal in the string: t82. I need to find if any non-terminal can produce t82. Looking through the productions, NT84 \u2192 't77' and NT77 is defined as NT45 \u2192 NT45, which seems like a loop and probably not useful here. Wait, actually, looking back, there's a production NT44 \u2192 't76' and NT27 \u2192 't35', but t82 is not directly produced by any single non-terminal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the production rules where a non-terminal leads to a terminal.\n\nChecking the productions:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't25'? No, wait, let's look correctly. No, wait, according to the list, NT44 \u2192 't76'. But looking at the string, I see 't82' as the first token. Hmm, so wait, maybe I misread the productions. Let me check again. \n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't52'\n- NT72 \u2192 't10' \u2192 oh wait, NT72 \u2192 NT47 NT5, but also NT72 \u2192 't10' and 't44'? No, actually, in the grammar, it's multiple productions. For example, NT72 can produce NT10 NT44 or 't8' and 't82'? Wait, looking carefully, the productions are:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\nNT60 \u2192 't84'\nNT77 \u2192 't32' (from NT44 \u2192 't32')\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminal productions. Let's go through the rules:\n\nLooking at the entire grammar:\n\nThe terminal productions are those where a non-terminal immediately goes to a terminal, without further expansion. These include:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT60 \u2192 't84'\n- NT39 \u2192 't28'\n- NT13 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't11'\n- NT36 \u2192 't42'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT27 \u2192 't35'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' (maybe terminal, but need to see context)\n- NT23 \u2192 't14'\n- NT71 \u2192 't52'\n- NT81 \u2192 't3' \nWait, that's a typo, NT81 is defined as NT81 \u2192 NT44 NT53 and NT81 \u2192 't3'. So, NT81 can produce 't3' directly.\n\nSimilarly, let's check for every rule if it ends in a terminal:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' via NT53\nNo, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, which then perhaps leads to 't26'\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list all the non-terminals and see which can directly produce a terminal:\n\nLooking at each production rule:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 NT81\nS \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nThese are both S going to two non-terminals.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, correct, NT77 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\nNT53 \u2192 't30'\n\nSo, NT53 produces 't30'\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n\nNT84 \u2192 't77'\n\nSo, NT84 produces 't77', and NT8 also.\n\nWait, let's go through each rule:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-495","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t82 t3 t13 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t59 t30 t33 t42 t82 t3 t8 t84 t30 t3 t77 t47 t14 t25 t82 t3 t8 t82 t5`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals, with B and C not both being non-terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal on the left, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals OR exactly two terminals, but I think the actual definition can vary slightly. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that, but for now, I'll proceed assuming it's correct.\n\nThe given grammar has a set of production rules, each of which defines how non-terminals can be expanded. The terminals are strings of 't' followed by numbers (like t82, t3, etc.), and non-terminals are denoted by a single uppercase letter followed by a number (like NTx, etc.). But wait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals are written without a number, like S, NT5, etc. So, the non-terminals are those starting with NT or S, followed by digits, perhaps?\n\nThe string to evaluate has a sequence of terminals, all of which end with 't' and a number. For example, t82, t3, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each rule starts with a non-terminal (like S, NT5, NT19, etc.) and is replaced by some combination of non-terminals and terminals. The right-hand sides seem to consist of two symbols each, except for those where both symbols are terminals, which would terminate a derivation path.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal on the left, and the right-hand side is either two terminals or two non-terminals. This means that each production step in a derivation can split a single non-terminal into two parts, which can themselves be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nTo parse the given string, I can consider it as a sequence of symbols. Starting from the start symbol S, I need to derive a tree that represents this string.

So, for example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81, meaning S can be replaced by NT45 and NT81. Then, each of these NTs can be further replaced.\n\nThe terminals in the string are t2, t3, t5, t7, t8, t11, t13, t22, t25, t26, t27, t28, t30, t35, t39, t42, t43? Wait, the numbers vary. Let me list them all:\n\nLooking at the string: t82, t3, t13, t30, t39, t47, t49, t84, t59, t30, t33, t42, t82, t3, t8, t84, t30, t3, t77, t47, t14, t25, t82, t3, t8, t82, t5.\n\nSo each token is like t82 (t followed by two digits) up to t5.\n\nMy goal is to see if each of these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nMaybe it's easier to start trying to parse the string backward or forward. Let's take the first token, t82, which should come from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, which NTs can produce t82? Let me see:\n\nLooking through all productions, the ones that produce a terminal:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT13 \u2192 't47'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT9 \u2192 't22 NT7' \u2014 no, that's NT9 \u2192 t22 t7, which is a terminal 't22' and NT7.

{"custom_id":"request-523","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar structure and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several production rules starting from S and NT with various non-terminals. Each production seems to break down a non-terminal into two other non-terminals or a terminal followed by another terminal. This is typical in CNF where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nMy string is: `t82 t30 t30 t76 t84 t28 t47 t30 t33 t71 t42 t49 t76 t14 t25 t47 t49 t84 t59 t77 t30 t25 t30 t82 t71 t8 t82 t5`.\n\nI notice that 't' is a terminal symbol, so the string is a sequence of these terminals. To check if the string is in the language, I'll try to derive it step by step, starting from S and applying productions until I get the entire string.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S. S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSince the string starts with 't82', I need to find a production that leads to 't82'. Looking through the production rules, I see that NT48... Wait, there are a lot of non-terminals, so let me look for any non-terminal that can produce 't82'. Scanning the productions, I see NT30 -> 't82' and NT30 is present in other productions, like S \u2192 NT45 NT81, but I need to see how NT30 is generated.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, NT30 has a production NT30 \u2192 't82', so that's straightforward. Also, looking at other rules, I see NT27 \u2192 't76', NT35 \u2192 't33', etc. So the strategy is to break down the string into parts that match the non-terminals.\n\nBut before that, let's note that each step in the CFG's derivation splits a non-terminal into two others or two terminals. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each terminal must be generated directly from some production rule that leads to a terminal.\n\nLet's see which non-terminals generate 't' symbols. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' (since it's NT22 \u2192 NT22 't22', but that's an issue because it's recursive and can't be part of a useful derivation unless used in a way that terminates. Wait, no, looking again, NT22 \u2192 't22' is actually a production, so that's a terminal.\nWait, actually, looking back, I might have misread. Let me check each production rule for terminals:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT14 \u2192 't14'\n- NT19 \u2192 't84' and 't5' (wait, no, looking again, each production is A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 't'.

{"custom_id":"request-515","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, alright, I remember that CNF requires each production rule to have a non-terminal on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit that structure, with all productions except the terminals ending two symbols.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t82 t3 t30 t39 t47 t30 t33 t49 t42 t49 t76 t84 t30 t77 t30 t49 t59 t32 t47 t49 t84 t59 t13 t32 t49 t59 t82 t5`.\n\nFirst, I should probably parse this string step by step. The string consists of a sequence of 't' tokens followed by numbers. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar, starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n- S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let me look at the string. The first token is t82, which isn't directly a non-terminal, so maybe I need to see which NT production leads to a terminal.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar can be expanded into other non-terminals or a terminal. The NT symbols have their own productions, so I'll need to track each step.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens: t82, t3, t30, t39, t47, t30, t33, t49, t42, t49, t76, t84, t30, t77, t30, t49, t59, t32, t47, t49, t84, t59, t13, t32, t49, t59, t82, t5.\n\nHmm, that's 23 tokens. Let's see if the production rules can lead to this.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT45 NT81. So the first step would generate NT45 NT81, which then needs to be expanded into terminals until we get the tokens.\n\nLooking at the NT45 production, it has multiple rules. One of them is NT45 \u2192 't25'. Wait, but in the given NT45 productions, one is NT45 \u2192 't25', but the string starts with t82. Hmm, that doesn't quite add up. Maybe I need to consider another path.\n\nWait, or perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the NT45 productions again. Yes, one of them is NT45 \u2192 't25', but the string starts with t82. That suggests that the NT45 might not be the first step to consider here. Alternatively, maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at NT19, one of its productions is NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, which can then lead to 't77' and 't83', but the string starts with t82, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong NT. Let me think again. Each NT can produce several things. For example, NT45 can also produce NT60 NT77.\n\nLooking at NT45's possible productions:\n- NT45 \u2192 't25'\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- ... others, but the important ones for the string.\n\nThe string starts with t82, but none of the NT45 or NT19 direct productions start with t82. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine each step carefully.\n\nLet me first consider the starting point. S can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's assume the string starts with NT45 NT81.\n\nSo the first two non-terminals would be NT45 and NT81. Let me see how these can produce 't82 t3...'.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't25' (but starting with t25, which isn't the case here)\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n\nLooking at NT60, it can produce:\n- NT30 NT84\n- ... (other rules)\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT84. Now, let's see if that can lead to t82.\n\nWait, NT30 can produce NT82, perhaps? Let me check NT30's rules.\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT82. Yes, in the list, NT30 \u2192 't82' is one of the options. So maybe this is the path.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT84\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT84? Hmm, but the next token after t82 is t3, which isn't an immediate production, so perhaps we need to consider another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me try to parse the string token by token, seeing if each can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT84.\n\nNT30 \u2192 't82' (token 1).\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT77.\n\nNT77 \u2192 't30' (token 2).\n\nSo now, after the first two steps, we have t82 t30 so far. But the actual string is t82 t3, which doesn't match. Hmm, so perhaps the initial assumption of S \u2192 NT45 NT81 is incorrect, or maybe there's another production path.\n\nAlternatively, let's try S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT77.\n\nNT77 \u2192 't30' (token 1), but the string starts with t82, which doesn't match. So this seems off.\n\nWait another idea: Maybe the string starts with t82, but let's see if any NT can produce 't82' as a direct terminal.\n\nLooking at NT tokens that directly produce a 't' symbol:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't71' (not t82)\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (no)\n- NT36 \u2192 't42' (no)\n- NT9 \u2192 't26' (no)\n- NT75 \u2192 't32' (no)\n- NT44 \u2192 't76' (no)\n- NT84 \u2192 't77' (no)\n- NT27 \u2192 't35' (no)\n- NT53 \u2192 't30' (no)\n- NT30 \u2192 't82' (yes, NT30 can produce 't82')\n- NT77 \u2192 't30' (no)\n- NT36 \u2192 sometimes 't42', sometimes 't42' via another path?

{"custom_id":"request-542","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slowly and make sure I understand everything properly.\n\nSo, the task is to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and either a single terminal or non-terminal on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce the empty string. But in this case, the start symbol S seems to produce other non-terminals, not terminals, so I guess the empty string isn't an option here.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided to understand the structure. The grammar consists of several production rules, each starting with a non-terminal and replacing it with combinations of other non-terminals (NT followed by numbers) and terminals (t followed by a number). Some of these rules directly produce terminals, like S -> NT45 't25', which means NT45 can produce the terminal 't25'. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t82 t3 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t49 t42 t49 t76 t30 t49 t76 t49 t59 t82 t5`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I'll probably need to reverse-engineer the string, starting from the start symbol S and expanding the non-terminals step by step until I reach the terminals in the string. \n\nLet me list down all the production rules again for clarity:\n\n1.

NT61 -> 't13'\n\nNow, my goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nFirst, let's look at the start symbol S. The two options for S are:\n\n- S -> NT45 NT81\n- S -> NT19 NT67\n\nSo the string must start with either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67. Let's check the given string:\n\nThe string starts with t82, t3, t30...\n\nLooking at the terminal symbols: t82, t3, t30, t3, t13, t49, t84, t76, t30, t35, etc.\n\nLooking at the first production, S -> NT45 NT81. Let's see what NT45 and NT81 can produce.\n\nFrom the rules, NT45 can produce 't25' directly (rule 32), which is a terminal. But in our string, the first few terminals are t82, t3, etc., so t25 isn't the first symbol. So maybe the other option, S -> NT19 NT67, is more appropriate here because NT19 and NT67 might produce t82 and other symbols.\n\nLooking at NT19: Rule 14 says NT19 -> NT84 NT8, and rule 18 says NT19 can also produce NT60 NT5.\n\nWait, let me check NT19's rules again:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT19 is defined in two ways:\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8 (rule 14)\n- NT19 -> NT60 NT5 (rule 18)\n\nSo both these productions produce non-terminals, not terminals. Therefore, NT19 must be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT84: Rule 28 says NT84 -> NT40 NT39.\n\nNT40: Rule 27 says NT40 -> NT58 NT39.\n\nWait, rule 27 is NT40 -> NT58 NT39. But then, looking further, let's expand those non-terminals.\n\nNT58: Rule 24 says NT58 -> NT9 NT0.\n\nNT9: Rule 21 says NT9 -> NT36 NT45.\n\nNT36: Rule 20 says NT36 -> NT60 NT47.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me see if I can link the terminals in the string to the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this using the CYK algorithm, which is designed for recognizing strings in context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form. However, I need to be cautious because this grammar is in a specific form, and sometimes CYK might not handle it correctly if the rules are not strictly CNF, but in this case, it seems to be in CNF except for the right-hand sides which can have a single terminal symbol.\n\nBut let's try a more straightforward approach. I'll start building the parse tree.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t82. Looking at the rules, the only non-terminal that directly produces t82 is NT44 (rule 60) and NT81 (rule 53). So t82 must come from either NT44 or NT81.\n\nLooking at the string, after t82, we have t3, t30, etc. Let's see how these can fit.\n\nIf we consider that t82 comes from NT81 (rule 53: NT81 -> 't30'), but wait, that's not matching. Wait, rule 38: NT81 -> 't71'. Wait, no, rule 53 says NT81 -> 't30' (actually, rule 53 is `"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, context-free grammars are about generating strings through production rules. Since this is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So, the string is made up of terminals, and we need to see if they can be produced by the grammar's start symbol, which is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions from S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 NT81\nS \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, the initial step is to see if the string can start with either of these pairs.\n\nLooking at the string: the first words are t84, t30, etc. Let's see if t84 comes from NT45 or NT19.\n\nWait, NT45 and NT19 are non-terminals. So, let's check the productions for NT45 and NT19.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77.\n\nBut then, do NT60 and NT77 have anything that would produce terminals? Let's look. NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81. So NT60 can go to NT30 and NT81, which are non-terminals. NT81 can be a terminal? Wait, looking at the productions, NT81 has a production to t30, t39, ... but not t30. Wait, let me check each NT81 production.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT77 -> 't8' (a terminal)\nAnd looking at other terminals, like NT28, etc., but wait, the first NT is NT45.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT81 has a production: NT81 -> 't71' and another: NT81 -> 't3' (t3 is a terminal). Wait, no, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT81 -> 't71', 't30', 't2', 't33', 't42', 't5', etc.\n\nWait, in the list, NT81 has multiple productions:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\n...\nNT81 appears in several productions, including NT81 \u2192 't71', NT81 \u2192 't30', NT81 \u2192 't2', etc. So, yes, NT81 can produce terminal strings like 't71', 't30', 't2', etc.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the start symbol S: S can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t84, does that correspond to a terminal produced by NT45 or NT19?\n\nWait, let's see. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Now, if NT45 can produce t84 and NT81 can produce the rest, then yes.\n\nBut how does NT45 produce t84? NT45 -> NT60 NT77. So, NT60 and NT77 need to produce the right terminals.\n\nThen, NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree for the string step by step, reducing from the string up to the start symbol.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe string is: t84 t30 t3 t30 t3 t49 t84 t76 t13 t30 t33 t42 t11 t84 t30 t52 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t39 t47 t32 t49 t59 t25 t82 t5.\n\nThat's quite long, 30 terms. Let me note down the order: t84, t30, t3, t30, t3, t49, t84, t76, t13, t30, t33, t42, t11, t84, t30, t52, t47, t49, t84, t76, t30, t39, t47, t32, t49, t59, t25, t82, t5.\n\nI need to see if the entire string can be parsed into the start symbol S.\n\nLet me consider that S has two possible productions: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nFirst, let's try starting with S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nSo, the entire string must be a concatenation of the productions of NT45 and NT81.\n\nNow, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77.\n\nSo, the first part of the string should be produced by NT60 NT77.\n\nBut wait, wait, the start production is S \u2192 NT45 NT81, so the first symbol t84 would come from NT45. Let me check NT45's production chain.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77.\n\nThen, NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81.\n\nAnd NT81 can produce several terminals, like 't30', 't84', etc. Hmm, does NT81 have a production to t76 or t13 or the other terms?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions for NT81:\n\nNo, looking through the list, I don\u2019t see NT81 \u2192 't76' or 't13' directly. Wait, let me check each occurrence.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking for NT81 productions:\n\n- NT81\u2192 't71'\n- NT81\u2192 't30'\n- NT81\u2192 't2'\n- NT81\u2192 't33'\n- NT81\u2192 't42'\n- NT81\u2192 't5'\n- NT81\u2192 't59'\n\nNope, not 't76' or 't13' from NT81. Hmm.\n\nNext, NT77 \u2192 't8'. So if NT77 is a terminal, that's fine.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t84, t30, t3, etc. So, perhaps the NT45 can't produce t84 directly, because NT45 produces NT60 NT77. So, the first symbol t84 must come from NT60 or NT77? But NT77 is a single terminal 't8', which is not a symbol we have at the beginning.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen expanding S \u2192 NT45 NT81, the NT45 and NT81 are the next symbols to produce. So, the first symbol of the string should come from NT45. If NT45 can produce t84, then that's a match.\n\nSo, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. So, t84 must come from NT60 or NT77.\n\nBut NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, which are non-terminals, so NT60 can't produce t84 directly unless NT30 or NT81 can produce t84.\n\nWait, let's look at NT30. NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT45.\n\nWait, NT30 can expand to NT9 and NT45. NT9 can lead to several options, as per the grammar.\n\nWait, this is getting complex.

{"custom_id":"request-561","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar (CFG). The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps because it simplifies parsing and makes certain analyses easier.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar is. It looks like the grammar consists of several production rules that define how the non-terminals (NTx) can be expanded into other non-terminals or terminals. Each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left for the non-terminal productions and one terminal or non-terminal on the right for the terminal productions. I notice some terminals like 't25', 't8', etc., so the strings we're dealing with are sequences of these t's.\n\nThe given string is `t84 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 t3 t77 t47 t13 t49 t84 t59 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t76 t42 t49 t30 t11 t30 t49 t30 t11 t25 t82 t5`. That's quite a long string, so I'll need to break it down systematically.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I can use a parsing approach. Since it's in CNF, I can attempt a leftmost derivation or use something like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars. Alternatively, I can simulate the parsing step by step.\n\nLet me check if the string can be generated by starting from the start symbol, which is S. Looking at the production rules, S can only be replaced by two options:\n1. NT45 NT81\n2. NT19 NT67\n\nSo, the string must start with NT45 followed by NT81 or start with NT19 followed by NT67. Looking at the string, the first element is t84. Let's check which NT can produce t84.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n- NT84 has a production NT84 -> 't77', but not directly to t84.\nWait, no, looking more carefully, I think I need to check all the rules where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example, NT44 can produce t76, NT40 can produce t39, etc. I need to find which NT can produce t84.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT19 has a production NT19 -> NT84 NT8 (via NT19 -> NT84 NT8) but let me check. Wait, actually, NT19 can produce NT84 NT8, which is a production, but that's in one step. Wait no, looking more carefully, the production rules for NT19: NT19 -> NT84 NT8 and NT19 -> NT60 NT5. So, none of the productions for NT19 directly produce t84. Let me check other NTs.\n\nLooking at NT84: I don't see any production for NT84; perhaps I'm looking at the wrong ones. Wait, actually, in the production list, I see NT44 -> 't76', but I'm looking for t84.\n\nWait, no, let me look again. Let me list out all the production rules where RHS is a single terminal:\n\n- NT45 -> 't60' (no, wait, checking each rule: NT45 has production NT45-> 't8'? Wait no, looking through the list:\n\nLooking through each production rule:\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53\nNT75 -> NT72 NT5\n...\nWait, some of the rules like NT44 -> 't76', NT27 -> 't35', etc.\n\nWait, to find which NT can produce t84, I need to look for a production of the form NTx \u2192 't84'.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\nNo, in the given rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t84. Wait, that can't be right because the string contains t84. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's see: The string starts with t84, so the first part of the string must come from a production that leads to t84. So, I need to find an NT that can directly produce t84 via a production. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule where RHS is 't84'.\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8 \u2192 so that's two non-terminals. So that's a production, but it's not a direct terminal. It produces NT84, which is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT84 -> 't77' \u2192 that's a production, so NT84 can produce 't77'. So that's a terminal.\n\nWait, let me list all the rules with RHS as a single terminal:\n\n- NT45 -> 't60'?\nWait, let's go through the rules methodically:\n\n1. S -> NT45 NT81\n2. S -> NT19 NT67\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-557","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the structure of both the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar consists of a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol expands into two other non-terminal symbols, except for the terminals which are the actual characters that make up the string. The initial symbol is S.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string:\n\nt84 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t13 t49 t84 t76 t22 t11 t30 t82 t71 t8 t25 t82 t30 t8 t82 t5\n\nI notice that there are 31 tokens here. Each production rule in the grammar produces exactly two symbols, so the length of the string should be 2^n where n is the number of steps taken from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me check: the string length is 31. Since 2^5 =32, 31 is 1 less than 32. Hmm, but perhaps the number of steps is such that the length is a power of 2 plus 1? Or maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the string is being generated through a left or right derivation, and each step doubles the number of symbols, so the total number of symbols should be a power of 2.\n\nWait, maybe I should instead look for the start symbol's derivation. Let's see: S produces NTs, each of which can further expand. Let me see the structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly expands to NT45 followed by NT81. Or alternatively, S can also expand to NT19 and NT67. So S can produce two different structures.\n\nBut wait, looking at the production rules, S has two options: S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. So the string must come from one of these two initial productions.\n\nLet me pick one. Let's say the string starts with NT45 NT81. So the first two tokens would need to come from NT45 and NT81. Let me check if the string starts with t84 t13, which could correspond to NT45 and NT81.\n\nLooking at NT45: in the grammar, NT45 can be replaced by NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44, and so on. Wait, looking at the production for NT45: according to the grammar, NT45 -> NT60 NT77 or NT50 NT44.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT45 -> NT60 NT77 and also NT67 -> NT30 NT2, as well as other longer productions. But the terminals in the string are t84, t13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should track how the non-terminals expand into terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals have productions that include terminals, such as NT45 -> NT60 NT77, but not t. Wait, no, for example, NT77 -> 't8', so when NT77 is encountered, it becomes 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, NT45 has a production that includes 't77' but not 't84'. Wait, looking back, no, in the grammar I see NT77 -> 't8', so when NT77 is expanded, it's converted into 't8'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, is there a rule that produces 't84' from any non-terminal? Let me check. Looking through the clauses:\n\nYes, I see NT74 -> NT72 NT5, and other productions, but also NT47 -> 't84'.\n\nWait, checking: NT47 -> 't84'. Yes, so when NT47 is encountered, it becomes 't84'.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals:\n\nNT81 -> 't30'\n\nNT36 -> 't42'\n\nNT22 -> 't22' (which is just 't22' as a terminal)\n\nWait, but 't13' is a terminal. Does any non-terminal generate 't13'? Yes, looking at the production rules, NT25 -> 't33' and other NTs with terminals. Wait, I need to see if any non-terminal can become 't13'.\n\nLooking for a production where a non-terminal is replaced by 't13' and something else. Wait, for example, S produces NT45 NT81, so the first step is to expand NT45 and NT81.\n\nWait, no, S is the start symbol and the initial expansion is S -> NT45 NT81 or S-> NT19 NT67. So the string must start with either the production of NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t84. If S is expanding into NT45 and NT81, then t84 should come from NT45 and the next token from NT81. Alternatively, if it's expanding into NT19 and NT67, t84 would come from one of those.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT45 can produce t84? Or is it another non-terminal that does.\n\nWait, let me check each NT that has a terminal production.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT45 can expand into NT60 NT77, or into NT50 NT44. Those are non-terminals, so unless those further expand into terminals, but perhaps some other NTs have terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT74 -> NT72 NT5\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nWait, so NT47 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't84' as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals:\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53 (both non-terminals)\n\nNT75 -> NT72 NT5 (also non-terminals)\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produce 't84': Only NT47. So 't84' must come from NT47.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is t84, which would require that the first NT produced was NT47, not from S's expansion of NT45 or NT19. But S expands into NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So for the string to start with t84 (which is 't84'), it must come from NT47. But in the initial expansion of S, the first NT was either NT45 or NT19. So can NT45 produce NT47? Let me look at the productions of NT45.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe initial S expands into NT45 and NT81. So S -> NT45 NT81. So the first symbol is NT45, the second is NT81. Now, each of these can expand into more symbols. So the string starts with 't84', which must correspond to one of these NTs.\n\nBut wait, NT45's productions are:\n\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77\n\n- NT45 -> NT50 NT44\n\nSo unless NT60 or NT77 can produce 't84', the first token 't84' cannot come directly from NT45. Similarly, if the first NT was NT19, as in alternative S -> NT19 NT67, let's see:\n\nNT19's productions are:\n\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8\n\n- NT19 -> NT60 NT5\n\n- NT19 -> NT60 NT5 (same as above)\n\nWait, looking at the given productions:\n\nS has two initial options:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\n\nS -> NT19 NT67\n\nIn our case, the first token is t84. To get 't84' from NT19, since NT19 can produce NT84 NT8, which would expand into symbols.\n\nBut let's think: Is the first NT19 or NT45 producing 't84'?\n\nWait, for the first token 't84', the initial NT must be such that it can produce 't84' either directly or through its productions.\n\nLooking back, NT45's productions lead to non-terminals, so unless those expand into a terminal that's 't84', but I don't see NT45 directly producing 't84'. So the only way 't84' appears is if the NT before it is NT47, because NT47 -> 't84'.\n\nSo to get 't84' as the first symbol, the initial NT must be NT47, but that's not an option in the initial S expansion. Therefore, this suggests that the first token 't84' in the string cannot be generated from the start symbol S, because S expands into either NT45\/NT81 or NT19\/NT67.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. Let me check again.\n\nThe initial S expansion"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-579","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each corresponding to a specific production rule in the grammar. \n\nLet me start by understanding the structure of the grammar. The grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NTx, etc.) and terminals (like 'tX', 'tY', etc.). Each production has the form A -> BC, where A is a non-terminal and B, C are either non-terminals or terminals. This means the grammar can generate strings where each non-terminal replacement adds exactly two symbols, and terminals are the leaves.\n\nThe given string is: `t82 t30 t30 t33 t22 t11 t84 t30 t42 t11 t13 t49 t84 t59 t13 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t39 t47 t32 t25 t82 t3 t8 t47 t32 t82 t5`.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar rules. Since each non-terminal expands into exactly two symbols, the string length must be a power of 2. Let's check: the string has 33 symbols. 33 is not a power of 2 (since 2^5=32, 2^6=64), so maybe I made a mistake? Wait, no, the initial productions start with S -> NT... which are non-terminals. Each non-terminal expansion adds two symbols, so the total length should be 1 more than a power of 2. Because S is the starting symbol, which may be replaced into a sequence of non-terminals, each of which expands until all are terminals. So the length would be 2^n -1, where n is the number of expansions. 33 isn't such a number (since 2^6=64; 64-1=63, which is longer than 33), so that might be an issue. Alternatively, I'm not sure if that's the exact rule, but perhaps I'll proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is structured in such a way that it can fit into the grammar's production rules without requiring the length to strictly follow 2^n -1. Let me think: starting from S, each step replaces a non-terminal into two non-terminals or terminals. So the depth of the parse tree would determine the sequence length. If S starts as NT45 NT81, each step can replace non-terminals, so the total number of symbols can vary. Hmm, perhaps it's better not to dwell on the length but to try to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nBut another approach is to work backwards, starting from the string and trying to reduce it to S through the grammar rules. Each step involves finding two consecutive symbols that form a production of a non-terminal.\n\nLet me list the productions again to see which are terminals and non-terminals. The grammar has non-terminals like S, NT5, NT19, etc., and terminals like 't8', 't5', etc. So each production is of the form NTx -> a b or a single production of a terminal? Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, productions are either A -> BC or A -> a, but in this case, the grammar seems to have only two-symbol productions because all the rules have NTx -> NTy NTz. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nIt seems that some productions end with a single terminal symbol. For example, NT45 -> 't25'? No, looking again, I see NT45 -> 't44' or 't8', etc. Wait, let me see specific rules:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, some of the productions end with a terminal. For example:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77 | NT8 | ...\n\nWait, no, the production NT45 has a rule like -> NT60 NT77 and also -> 't44'? Or maybe I misread. Wait, looking at the grammar more carefully:\n\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77 | 't8'?\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, there's a line: NT45 -> NT60 NT77, another: NT45 -> 't44'? Or did I misread? Let me scan again:\n\nNo, actually, looking back, I don't see any NT45 -> 't25' or similar. Wait, the last few lines in the grammar have:\n\nNT84 -> 't77', NT77 -> 't8', NT39 -> 't28', NT13 -> 't47', etc. So each production like NT45 -> 't44' is possible? Hmm, no, in the grammar, NT45 has production NT45 -> NT60 NT77, another is NT45 -> 't44'? Or is that my mistake.\n\nWait, let me check line by line:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT36 -> 't42'\nNT40 -> 't39'\nNT22 -> 't22'\n...\nAnd also:\n\nNT25 -> 't33'\nNT27 -> 't76'\nBTW, in the provided grammar, are any of the productions for non-terminals ending with a single terminal, meaning they produce a single terminal? For example, looking at:\n\nNT45 -> 't44' - wait no, I think in the given grammar, all productions are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, but I don't see any that end with a single terminal. Hmm, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, in the very beginning of the grammar, the first line is:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\n\nThen the line:\n\nNT5 -> NT61 NT75\n\nSo yes, all productions except perhaps some end with two non-terminals? Or perhaps they are two non-terminals. So actually, each rule is production to two non-terminals, meaning each non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals until a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, but then for a string of terminals to be formed, all symbols must be replaced by terminals, but the grammar must have a way for non-terminals to produce terminals. Otherwise, the language would consist only of non-terminals, leading to strings of length that are powers of 2 minus 1. But the given string is t82, etc., which suggests all are terminals. So that implies that all non-terminals must be able to derive into a string of terminals. Therefore, the grammar must have rules that allow certain non-terminals to produce a single terminal symbol, not just two non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, do any of the non-terminals have terminals as production options?\n\nYes, for example:\n\nNT36 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't76'\nNT44 -> 't44'?\nWait, in the given grammar, does any NT produce a terminal? Let me search through the rules:\n\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- NT39 -> 't28'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT81 -> 't30'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT75 -> 't32'\n- NT44 (another rule?) -> 't59'?\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for any rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal. For example, does NT44 have a rule like NT44 -> 't76'?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT44 -> NT83 NT7\nNT27 -> 't76'\nNT22 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't33'\nNT45 -> 't44'? No, wait NT45's rules are:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77 | NT8 | 't44'?\n\nWait, checking the grammar:\n\nThe last few lines include:\n\nNT44 -> 't76'\nNT52 -> 't71'\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nWait, no, the given grammar ends with lines like:\n\nNT50 -> 't49'\nNT83 -> 't30'\nNT39 -> 't28'\nNT13 -> 't47'\nNT71 -> 't52'\nNT50 -> 't49'\nNT83 -> 't30'\nNT27 -> 't76'\nNT22 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't33'\nNT61 -> 't13'\n\nSo, wait. It looks like NT27 produces 't76' as a terminal. Similarly, NT44 -> 't76', but wait no, looking again:\n\nNT44's rules are:\n\nNT44 -> NT83 NT7\nNT44 -> NT59 NT44?\n\nWait, in the grammar, line:\n\nNT44 -> NT83 NT7\n\nand\n\nNT44 -> NT59 NT44\n\nWait, no, looking at all rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-580","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. So every production either generates two non-terminals or a single terminal. I also remember that CNF grammars can be parsed efficiently using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I need to use that here or if I can approach it differently.\n\nThe given grammar has multiple production rules, and each non-terminal breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: `t84 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t39 t47 t30 t33 t42 t82 t71 t8 t84 t30 t3 t77 t47 t49 t84 t76 t26 t30 t84 t8 t25 t82 t5`.\n\nI notice that each part of the string is separated by spaces, so each \"token\" is a terminal that corresponds to a single character. So I can think of this as a sequence of terminals, each potentially derived from production rules in the grammar.\n\nMy first thought is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the non-terminals in the grammar. Each non-terminal in the grammar either expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string should be a series of terminals, each of which is directly produced by some non-terminal or part of a chain of productions.\n\nI'll start by checking if the initial symbol of the string, 't84', can come from any production. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't77'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\nWait, no. Let me look through the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see some terminals starting with 't'. For example, NT22 \u2192 't22', NT23 \u2192 't14', NT25 \u2192 't33', NT61 \u2192 't13', NT40 \u2192 't39', NT33 \u2192 't42', NT50 \u2192 't49', NT44 \u2192 't76', NT82 \u2192 't82', NT71 \u2192 't71', NT84 \u2192 't84', NT77 \u2192 't8', NT9 \u2192 't26', etc.\n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. The production rules sometimes have terminals like 't25', 't30', etc. For example, NT45 \u2192 't77' and NT77 \u2192 't8', as I saw earlier. But looking deeper, I notice that some rules have terminals like 't5'. So, for example, NT74\u2192't?'. Wait, no. Wait, let me check the rules again carefully.\n\nLooking carefully, I see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't77' (since 'a' would be 't77' because the rule is S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, and then NT77 \u2192 NT32 \u2192 't8'). Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list out all the direct terminal productions first.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't9'? Or wait, the rule is NT5 \u2192 't9' 'something'? Wait, let me check the rules provided.\n\nWait, the user input includes a long list of production rules. Let me look for any rules where the right-hand side is a terminal with 't' followed by a number.\n\nFrom the structure, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't22' (rule 13)\nNT23 \u2192 't14' (rule 14)\nNT25 \u2192 't33' (rule 15)\nNT61 \u2192 't13' (rule 16)\nNT40 \u2192 't39' (rule 17)\nNT33 \u2192 't42' (rule 18)\nNT50 \u2192 't49' (rule 19)\nNT44 \u2192 't76' (rule 20)\nNT82 \u2192 't82' (rule 21)\nNT71 \u2192 't71' (rule 22)\nNT84 \u2192 't84' (rule 23)\nNT77 \u2192 't8' (rule 24)\nNT36 \u2192 't45' (wait, but 't45' isn't in the string, right?) No, the string has t84, t13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find all the terminals in the grammar that match parts of the string.\n\nLet me list the string again: t84 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t39 t47 t30 t33 t42 t82 t71 t8 t84 t30 t3 t77 t47 t49 t84 t76 t26 t30 t84 t8 t25 t82 t5.\n\nSo we have: t84, t13, t30, t11, t30, t39, t47, t30, t33, t42, t82, t71, t8, t84, t30, t3, t77, t47, t49, t84, t76, t26, t30, t84, t8, t25, t82, t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar for terminal symbols, I see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't47' (rule 7)\nNT71 \u2192 't71' (rule 22)\nNT84 \u2192 't84' (rule 23)\nNT77 \u2192 't8' (rule 24)\nNT30 \u2192 't82' (rule 30)\nNT49 \u2192 't49' (rule 43)\nNT82 \u2192 't82' (rule 21)\nNT71 \u2192 't71' (rule 22)\nNT71 \u2192 't71' (rule 22)\nWait, not seeing 't26' in the grammar directly, but NT9 \u2192 't26' (rule 26).\n\nSimilarly, NT25 \u2192 't33' (rule 15)\nNT22 \u2192 't22' (rule 13)\nNT23 \u2192 't14' (rule 14)\nNT61 \u2192 't13' (rule 16)\nWait, but in the string, t13 occurs in the string. Let's see where t13 can come from.\n\nFrom the rules, looking for 't13'.\n\nNT61 \u2192 't13' (rule 16)\nSo t13 is produced by NT61.\n\nThen, t61 would need to be in the string. But our string is directly a sequence of terminals, so I think they're individual symbols. So in the string, any occurrence like 't13' would be from NT61, right? Similarly, NT50 \u2192 't49', so t49 can come from NT50.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is a list of terminals, so each one must be either directly a terminal from a production or must be derived from two non-terminals, each of which can be further broken down.\n\nSince this is a top-down approach, or maybe a bottom-up? But I think it's better to see if the entire string can be parsed.\n\nWait, but the string is a long list of terminals, so perhaps I can see if each terminal in the string corresponds to a production, perhaps directly or through expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a CYK-style parsing, but given the time, I might try to see if each token is present in the grammar's direct productions.\n\nLooking again at the grammar:\n\nLooking for each token in the string:\n\n- t84: yes, NT84 \u2192 't84' (rule 23)\n- t13: yes, NT61 \u2192 't13' (rule 16)\n- t13: same as above\n- t49: yes, NT50 \u2192 't49' (rule 19)\n- t84: same as before\n- t30: yes, NT30 \u2192 't82' (rule 30)\nWait, no.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form is a specific way of writing grammars where each production is either to a single terminal, two terminals, or a non-terminal followed by another non-terminal. This helps because it simplifies parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the starting symbol is S. Let me look at the productions available for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, every derivation starts with either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67. Each of these NTs (non-terminals) can then be replaced according to the given productions.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. Each terminal corresponds to a letter or a number followed by 't' and a number. For example, 't84', 't30', etc. These must correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. \n\nI think the process involves checking if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's structure. Since each production either splits into two terminals, two non-terminals, or a non-terminal and a non-terminal, I might need to parse the string step by step.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces exactly two symbols. So the length of the string would relate to the derivation depth. For example, if the string has n symbols, the derivation depth would be about (n-1)\/2 or something like that. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, I can work backwards, trying to see if each part of the string corresponds to a production. Let's take the string:\n\nt84 t30 t33 t49 t49 t49 t49 t42 t25 t84 t30 t33 t71 t26 t32 t47 t77 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t42 t84 t8 t30 t82 t30 t8 t82 t5\n\nThat's a long string with 33 terminals. Since S is the start symbol, which in the first production splits into two non-terminals, each of those would need to produce more non-terminals, eventually leading to the terminals of the string.\n\nLet me consider the structure step by step. The initial step from S gives either (NT45, NT81) or (NT19, NT67). I'll need to see if either path can produce the given string.\n\nLet's pick the first option: S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Now, I need to see if NT45 can produce a substring that matches the first few terminals, and similarly for NT81.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\nNT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n\nSo, NT45 can branch into two non-terminals each time. Let's consider NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77.\n\nNow, NT60's productions:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT28 (Wait, checking the grammar again, NT60 is \u2192 NT30 NT81 and \u2192 NT30 NT28? Or is it NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81 and NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT28? Wait, I might have misread earlier. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, the grammar entries:\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81\nWait, is there another production for NT60? Looking through, yes:\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81\nLooking back, I see it's only NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81 and NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT28? Wait, in my initial reading, I might have missed.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT45 NT81, etc., and then I see lines like NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT47, then later on, lines like NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81 and NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT28. Hmm, wait, checking again:\n\nLooking at the grammar entries provided, I see:\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81\nand then later:\nNT60 -> NT30 NT28\n\nSo yes, NT60 can produce either NT30 NT81 or NT30 NT28.\n\nBut in the string, after t84 t30, the next is t33. Hmm, let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the entire process step by step, but this might take time. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to match the string to the grammar.\n\nLet me think of the string as a sequence of terminals and try to see how they can be generated by the grammar. Each split should correspond to a non-terminal step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed from the bottom up using the grammar's productions.\n\nBut given the length of the string, maybe it's easier to see if any of the non-terminals can generate substrings that match.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for a production where a non-terminal directly generates a terminal. For example, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal, e.g., NT22 -> 't22', NT25 -> 't25', etc.\n\nSo if the string contains a 't22', then the non-terminal NT22 must be used to produce that. Similarly for others.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if each part of the string can be traced back to a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I can split the string into parts that match the grammar's productions. Let's try.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt84 t30 t33 t49 t49 t49 t49 t42 t25 t84 t30 t33 t71 t26 t32 t47 t77 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t42 t84 t8 t30 t82 t30 t8 t82 t5\n\nLet's take the first few tokens:\n\nt84 t30 t33 t49 t49 t49 t49 t42 t25 ...\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps we can see where t84 comes from.\n\nLooking for productions that produce t84 as the first symbol.

Wait, let me list the nt productions that produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some entries directly map an NT to a terminal:\n\nNT22 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't25'\nNT13 -> 't47' (Wait, no, 13 -> 't47'?

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, all the productions seem to fit this form. For example, S -> NT45 NT81, that's A (S) becoming BC. Each non-terminal on the left has exactly two non-terminals on the right except where terminals are present, like NT45 -> 't25'.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t82 t71 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t59 t13 t30 t33 t71 t33 t71 t39 t47 t77 t47 t77 t47 t49 t84 t76 t22 t11 t30 t49 t59 t84 t8 t82 t5.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions. Let's think about how this works. Each production can generate two symbols (non-terminals), which can themselves be expanded until we get down to terminal symbols matching our target.\n\nLet me try to map the string's indices to non-terminals. Each production step in the derivation produces two symbols, so the number of symbols should be related. But wait, the string has multiple terminals, so maybe this approach isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a leftmost derivation path that can generate the string. But with 36 symbols, this would be tedious. Maybe a better approach is to simulate the process using a pushdown automaton or by checking if each terminal in the string can be associated with a corresponding non-terminal decomposition.\n\nAnother idea is to see if each substring of two non-terminals (before terminals are expanded) can match the string step by step. For example, the string starts with t82 t71. If S can produce NT45 NT81, then each of these can further produce their parts. But looking at the given grammar, I don't see a production for S -> NT81 where NT81 leads to anything other than the terminal. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two rules: S -> NT45 NT81 and S -> NT19 NT67. So if the string starts with t82 t71, perhaps it comes from NT81 which somehow produces t82 t71.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT45 -> 't25', NT71 -> 't52', and so on. I need to see which NTs can generate which t symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT81 -> 't30'\n\nHmm, but the string starts with t82. Let me look for any NT that has an expansion starting with t82. Scanning the production rules, I see NT44 -> 't76', NT47 -> 't84', NT22 -> 't22', NT2 -> 't5', etc. Wait, looking at the last few productions:\n\nLooking for a production where the first symbol is 't82':\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see:\n\nWait, the grammar has NT44 -> 't76', NT27 -> 't35', but I don't see any NT that when expanded gives a 't82' as the first symbol. Wait, let me list out all the terminal rules:\n\nLooking again, the terminal productions are:\n\nNT44 -> 't76'\n\nNT27 -> 't35'\n\nNT22 -> 't22'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\n\nNT77 -> 't8'\n\nNT36 -> 't42'\n\nNT84 -> 't77'\n\nNT39 -> 't28'\n\nNT13 -> 't47'\n\nNT7 -> 't11'\n\nNT36 -> 't42' (duplicate)\n\nNT81 -> 't30'\n\nNT44 -> 't76' (duplicate)\n\nNT27 -> 't35'\n\nNT22 -> 't22'\n\nNT53 -> 't30' etc.\n\nWait, but I don't see any production for a non-terminal that starts with 't82'. So the first symbol t82 must be a terminal, which means it's the result of a production where something directly expands to 't82'.\n\nBut in the given grammar, all terminal productions are for individual symbols like 't11', 't22', etc. So is there any NT that expands to 't82'? Scanning through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't82'. That means the string cannot start with 't82' because there's no such production rule. Therefore, the string is not possible to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed a rule. Let's list them all:\n\nLooking through the productions, the only terminal symbols are single 't' followed by a number, each corresponding to a specific production. So no NT in the grammar leads to a terminal starting with t82.\n\nThat would mean the string cannot be generated because the first terminal t82 has no corresponding production.\n\nSo the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-616","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar. It's given in a form where each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT1, etc.) has productions that break it down into other non-terminals or terminals ('t's and numbers). Chomsky normal form usually has productions where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit that structure.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The string to evaluate is: t82 t30 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t76 t30 t3 t30 t33 t71 t26 t14 t49 t59 t47 t49 t84 t59 t49 t49 t77 t30 t25 t30 t25 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5.\n\nMy approach would be to parse the string using the given grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, I can use a parser that handles such grammars, possibly using the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent parser. But since the string is quite long, doing it manually might be error-prone, so perhaps I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build a parse tree, starting from the string and looking for where the non-terminals can expand into terminals or smaller non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the terminals for quick reference: t25, t26, t27, t28, t3, t4, t5, t8, t11, t13, t14, t22, t23, t30, t33, t35, t36, t39, t40, t44, t45, t47, t49, t53, t59, t60, t61, t71, t72, t74, t75, t76, t77, t81, t82, t83, t84, ... and others not listed but are numbers.\n\nWait, actually, the terminals are any elements that are not non-terminals. In the grammar, elements like 't25', 't8', 't77', etc., are terminals because they cannot produce further non-terminals\u2014they are terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, I should check if the string ends with a terminal. The string ends with 't5', which is a terminal, so that's fine.\n\nNext, I'll try to parse from the start symbol S. The grammar has S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So the string must start with one of these two options.\n\nLooking at the string: starts with t82, which is a terminal. None of the initial productions start with NT45 or NT19 directly, so perhaps the first step is to find where these could expand.\n\nLooking for the first symbols in the string: t82. Do any productions have t82 as a terminal? Looking through the productions, I see NT93 \u2192 t77, NT45 \u2192 t60, NT60 \u2192 t84, NT84 \u2192 t77, etc. Wait, I don't see t82 among the direct terminals. Let me check: No, in the productions, the only terminals beyond t5 are:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t36, t45\n- NT5 \u2192 t9, t53\n- NT75 \u2192 t72, t5\n- NT45 \u2192 t60, t77\n- NT72 \u2192 t10, t44\n- NT40 \u2192 t14, t71\n- NT19 \u2192 t84, t8\n- NT84 \u2192 t77\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'? Wait, no, looking again: no, the productions for NT77 are not given. Wait, no, the grammar is given as a list. Let me check for the terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only terminals are:\n\nFrom the grammar list:\n- t25, t8, t77, t36, t9, t5, t72, t10, t44, t14, t71, t52, t75, t23, t61, t45, t53, t84, t27, t22, t26, t33, t71, t21, t82, t30, t3, t49, t59, t47, t30, t30, t33, t71, t26, t14, t49, t59, t47, t49, t84, t59, t49, t49, t77, t30, t25, t30, t25, t49, t30, t11, t82, t5.\n\nWait, that's a lot, but the key is that most of the non-terminals are represented by NT followed by a number, and the terminals are the 't' followed by other numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The grammar is given as a set of rules, each starting with a non-terminal and then having a production. The non-terminals are NT followed by a number, and the others are terminals. So for example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81 is a production where S is split into two non-terminals, NT45 and NT81.\n\nBut wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So in the grammar, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, each line is of the form X \u2192 YZ or X \u2192 a, so that's in CNF. Now, the start symbol is S, and it has two productions: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nSo the string must be derived from one of these.\n\nNow, let's see. The given string starts with t82, which is a terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, the only way a non-terminal could produce t82 is if there's a production where NT82 \u2192 't82', but looking through the productions, I don't see that. Instead, I see NT84 \u2192 t77, which is different. Wait, perhaps I need to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nWait, let me think. Perhaps I can try to parse the string backward, as sometimes that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for parts of the string that match the terminals from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the full string: t82 t30 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t76 t30 t3 t30 t33 t71 t26 t14 t49 t59 t47 t49 t84 t59 t49 t49 t77 t30 t25 t30 t25 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5.\n\nLet me see if the first symbol t82 can be part of a production. Looking through the grammar, I see NT82 isn't a non-terminal because it's not the start of any production.

Looking at the grammar, NT84 has production rules ending with 't77' or 't8' or even 't76', 't42', etc.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT75, it's NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45, which further breaks down.

No, NT75 is split into non-terminals. Similarly, NT84 \u2192 't77', which is a terminal. Also, NT64 has a rule, but not sure.\n\nWait, I think I missed some rules. Let's list all terminals:\n\nt25, t8, t77, t30, t42, t71, t26, t39, t83, t11, t13, t53, t30, t32, t2, t5, t28, t76.\n\nSo the string has these terminals:\n\nt84, t30, t39, t47, t13, t49, t84, t30, t11, t30, t33, t22, t11, t84, t30, t42, t25, t30, t3, t49, t84, t76, t30, t3, t14, t49, t59, t25, t47, t32, t25, t82, t5.\n\nWait, let me check each terminal in the string:\n\n1. t84: It's a terminal, so it must come from a production that directly produces t84. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT44 \u2192 't76' and 't59', but I don't see a rule that directly produces t84. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, NT47 \u2192 't84', that's correct. So t84 is from NT47's production. Wait, but NT47 can be broken down as NT44 followed by 't84'. Hmm, but the rule is NT44 \u2192 't76' and 't59'. No, wait, no. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't84' is a terminal? No, the rule is NT47 \u2192 't84' is not in the rules I have.

{"custom_id":"request-641","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string that's supposed to be checked against this grammar. If the string can be generated by the grammar, I answer \"Yes\"; otherwise, \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier, but I'm not sure if it's necessary here.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's mostly non-terminals transforming into other non-terminals, with some terminals mixed in. Terminals are denoted by lowercase letters, right? So, I can see that when a sequence of non-terminals is expanded, eventually they all have to produce terminals like 't' followed by numbers, and some are 't' alone without numbers, like 't25'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t84 t30 t76 t84 t28 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t13 t49 t84 t59 t22 t11 t30 t25 t49 t59 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5`\n\nThat's a lot of tokens separated by spaces, so each token is a terminal symbol. I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of applicable productions.\n\nStarting from S, which appears to have two productions: S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So the string can start with either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's check the string: it starts with t84. So I need to see which non-terminals can produce t84.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT45 \u2192 ... and NT45 has a production that goes to 't25' in one step. Wait, maybe I should look through the productions to see which ones produce t84.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT44 \u2192 t76, NT77 \u2192 t8, but I'm looking for something that results in t84. Hmm. Let me scan through the productions. \n\nWait, in the productions, NT44 has a production NT44 \u2192 t76, but that's not t84. Oh! I saw NT72 \u2192 t10 t44, which is part of the grammar. But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t84, so I need to find a way to generate a t84 from a non-terminal. Let's check each production that outputs t84. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals directly producing 't84' except maybe through some chain.\n\nWait, looking at NT77 \u2192 't8', that's just 't8'. So no. How about NT36 \u2192 't42'? That's 't42', not 't84'. NT75 \u2192 't32' and so on. Hmm.\n\nWait, what about NT40 \u2192 't39' and that's not it. Maybe I should list all the productions where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT50 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT81 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't76'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't28'\n\nWait, perhaps I missed one. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, the terminals are all on the right side, so for example, NT75 \u2192 't32', NT36 \u2192 't42', NT19 \u2192 't84 t8', Wait a minute! NT19 has a production NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, and another NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5.\n\nWait, yes, so NT19 can produce 't84 t8' when expanding NT84. Let me check what NT84 expands to. Looking at grammar, NT84 \u2192 't77', which is 't77'. So NT19 \u2192 't84 t8' would be the expansion for NT19.\n\nBut looking at our string, the very first token is 't84', so maybe NT19 is a starting point, but wait, S's productions are S\u2192NT45 NT81 and S\u2192NT19 NT67. So the string starts with 't84' which is from NT19's expansion (since NT19 can produce t84 in a chain).\n\nWait, but let me see: NT19's productions are:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 \u2192 't84 t8' because NT84 \u2192 't77', and NT8 \u2192 't83'.\n\nWait, no, that's more steps. Let's see, NT19 can be expanded as NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, but NT84 is a non-terminal that may produce further terminals.\n\nLooking at NT84: NT84 \u2192 't77', which is a terminal. So, when we expand NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, it becomes 't77' 't77' since NT8 \u2192 't83'. Wait, no, because NT8 is:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't83'\n\nWait, I think I'm getting tangled here. Let me clarify.\n\nNT19's productions are:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n\nand\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n\nSo, to get t84, let's assume the first path: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8. Now, NT84 is 't77', and NT8 is 't83'. So, NT19 \u2192 t84 followed by t83? But in our string, the first token is t84, but nothing else follows as a t83. But the string is \"t84 t30 t76...\". So perhaps NT84 is producing more than just t77?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to break it down further. Let's take each production step.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string according to the grammar, using a recursive descent approach or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a top-down parsing problem. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. That should make it easier because at each step, I can split the string into parts that match each production.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of terminals, so the parser would try to start from the start symbol, which is either S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Then, each of these non-terminals (NT45, NT81, etc.) would need to be expanded into the corresponding terminals or further symbols.\n\nLet me try to see which parts of the string can be derived from which non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S: if we take S \u2192 NT19 NT67, then we need NT19 to produce the first part and NT67 to produce the rest. Alternatively, if we take S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then NT45 produces the first part and NT81 the rest.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't84'. So let's see which non-terminals can produce 't84'. From the list, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't84' except in chains. Wait, actually, there's NT72 \u2192 NT10 t44. Hmm, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again at the productions for NT19.\n\nYes, NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 and NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5.\n\nSo when NT19 is expanded into NT84 NT8, and NT84 \u2192 't77', and NT8 \u2192 't83', then the expansion would be 't77 t83'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't84' which doesn't match 't77' or 't83'.

{"custom_id":"request-637","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I've got a context-free grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to determine if a specific string is generated by this grammar. The string provided is `t84 t30 t39 t47 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t59 t30 t76 t84 t28 t47 t30 t33 t71 t52 t47 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t3 t32 t84 t8 t82 t30 t8 t82 t5`.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and from the given productions, I see that S can produce two non-terminals, so S -> NT45 NT81 and S -> NT19 NT67. So S branches into two paths.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit extensive, with multiple non-terminals. Each production either immediately goes to a terminal or splits again into two non-terminals. terminals are things like t25, t8, t77, etc. I notice that in the productions, some non-terminals lead directly to a terminal followed by another non-terminal, such as NT45 -> 't25' or NT5 -> 't26', etc.\n\nThe string we're testing contains a lot of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' probably represents a terminal symbol, and the following number might be part of the derivation, but it's also possible that some numbers are terminals with the same prefix 't', like t84 is a single terminal.\n\nWait, looking closely, each production sometimes leads to a terminal like NT45 -> 't25', and other times it splits further, like NT45 -> NT60 NT77. So, the grammar can generate a mix of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nNow, the challenge is to see if the given string can be generated by the grammar step by step, reducing the string from left to right or right to left, replacing terminals and non-terminals as per the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use dynamic programming or memoization to check if the string can be parsed according to the grammar. Since the string can be quite long, that might be tedious, but perhaps we can break it down.\n\nAlternatively, constructing the parse tree from the string and checking if each step is allowed by the grammar. Here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Identify which symbols in the string are terminals. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So in the string, every occurrence of t followed by a number is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals? Wait no, that's not correct. Actually, all symbols in the string that start with 't' and have a number attached, like 't84', 't30', etc., are terminals. The other non-terminals would be parts of the productions, like S, NT19, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the string, every element starts with 't', so all symbols are terminals. Hmm, that's strange because the grammar has non-terminals, so if the string only contains terminals, it's possible, but whether the grammar can derive that string is the question.\n\nWait, but if all the symbols in the string are terminals, then we need to check if each sequence of two non-terminals corresponds to a terminal pair. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIn the grammar, each production is either a single non-terminal (like NT5 -> 't26') or two non-terminals (e.g., S->NT45 NT81, NT5->NT61 NT75). So, each production corresponds to either a terminal or generating a pair of terminals via two steps.\n\nSo, when parsing the string, which is a sequence of terminals, we need to see if it can be generated by the grammar by breaking it down into the right structure.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I can try to split the string into possible pairs and see if they match the grammar's terminals. Wait, but each non-terminal production can sometimes result in two terminals or two non-terminals. For example, NT5 -> 't26' is a single terminal, but if another non-terminal leads to two terminals, that would be something like NT12 -> NT40 NT13, and then each of those could be terminals or further splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to parse the string using the grammar's productions. To do this, I can attempt to break down the string from the start, using the grammar's productions to match the next symbols.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLet's first check the start with NT45. Looking at NT45's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT45 has two productions: NT45 -> 't25' and NT45 -> NT60 NT77. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I need to check.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\n\nSo, NT45 can either produce 't25' or split into NT60 and NT77.\n\nSo, if the first symbol in the string is 't84', maybe S produces NT45 and NT81. But in the string, the first symbol is 't84', so S -> NT45 NT81.\n\nLet me see the string: it starts with t84, so if S is NT45 NT81, then NT45 must produce 't84', or split.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions, it can produce 't25' or NT60 NT77. But none of these directly produce 't84'. So perhaps this is not the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with another split from S. Let's look at the second production for S: S->NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at NT19's productions:\n\nNT19 -> 't84' and NT19 -> NT84 NT8 (from the given productions: NT19 -> NT84 NT8 and NT19 -> NT60 NT5, among others).\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT19 has productions:\n\nLooking up:\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8\nNT19 -> NT60 NT5\n\nSo, NT19 can split into two non-terminals or produce 't84' (but wait, no: looking at the given grammar, I don't see NT19 -> 't84'; instead, I see NT45 -> 't25', etc. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the given grammar includes:\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8\nNT45 -> 't25'\n\nSo, if NT19 has a production to 't84' (but it doesn't; wait, no, wait in the given grammar, NT45 produces 't25', but let me double-check all NT productions.\n\nWait, let me parse through the entire grammar:\n\nThe given grammar has NT and T productions, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me list all the NT productions and see if any of them lead to terminals.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT5 -> 't26'\nNT7 -> 't11'\nNT36 -> 't42'\nNT39 -> 't28'\nNT13 -> 't47'\nNT27 -> 't35'\nNT9 -> 't22'\nNT45 -> 't25'\nNT53 -> 't30'\nNT2 -> 't5' (wait, is that NT2 or T2? Probably T2 is a terminal symbol)\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting NT2 as a terminal. But in the grammar, all NT productions either split or produce a terminal followed by another non-terminal or another split.\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar, NT45 is 't25' or splits. So, each NT has a set of productions, some of which are splitting into two NTs, and others producing a terminal.\n\nSo, the strategy is to start with S and try to match the entire string by breaking it down.\n\nLet's assume S -> NT19 NT67 because the first symbol is t84.\n\nSo, S -> NT19 NT67. Now, we need to see if the string starts with 't84' as the result of NT19 and NT67's productions.\n\nWait, but looking at NT19's productions, do they produce 't84'? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the given NT19 productions:\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8\nNT19 -> NT60 NT5\n\nWait, no production for NT19 to produce 't84' directly. So where does 't84' come in? Let's look through the grammar for any T84 terminals.\n\nLooking through, I see 't84' is a terminal in NT84's productions:\n\nLooking at NT84's productions:\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-658","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t82 t71 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t76 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t30 t82 t3 t84 t84 t28 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t22 t11 t30 t25 t49 t59 t84 t8 t82 t5`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the CFG works. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, which simplifies parsing. The grammar's start symbol is S, and from the rules, I can see that S can produce combinations of other non-terminals, ending in terminal symbols eventually.\n\nI think the best approach is to try and derive the string step by step, breaking it down into smaller parts. But given the string's length and the many non-terminals, it might be easier to reconstruct the entire string by starting from the non-terminals that generate 't's and then track back up to S.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't82', which probably comes from NT30 because in the rules, NT30 -> 't82'. Similarly, 't71' is in the rules as NT0 -> 't71'. 't13' is from NT13 -> 't47' and then another production of NT47.\n\nI'll map each token back to the non-terminals that generate them. Let's list the tokens and possible sources:\n\n- t82: NT30\n- t71: NT0\n- t13: NT13 (since NT13 is defined as 't47')\n- t30: NT30 (but also NT30 is 't82', wait, that can't be. Wait, no, 't30' is another rule. Let me check: NT30 is defined as 't82', but there's also NT30 -> NT30 NT9. Hmm, maybe I need to re-express or think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing. Let's look at all the rules where terminals appear. Each rule ends with either a terminal or, in some cases, a combination that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT30 has rules like NT30 -> NT82 and also NT30 -> NT50 NT44, which then becomes 't82'. So NT30 is 't82'. NT0 is 't71'. NT13 -> 't47', which is generated by NT47's production. NT40 has a rule that ends in 't39', but that's probably not needed here.\n\nNow, looking at the string: the first part is t82 t71 t13... So t82 is from NT30, t71 is NT0, t13 is NT13. Then t30 is another NT30. So from the start symbol S, which produces NT45 NT81. So the string must start with something that S can produce.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be split into parts that each come from the productions. Let's try to break it down.\n\nThe string is: t82, t71, t13, t30, t3, t49, t84, t76, t13, t30, t3, t49, t84, t59, t30, t82, t3, t84, t84, t28, t47, t13, t49, t84, t76, t22, t11, t30, t25, t49, t59, t84, t8, t82, t5.\n\nLet's see:\n\nt82 could be from NT30.\nt71 from NT0.\nt13 from NT13.\nt30 from NT30.\nt3: Where does 't3' come from? Looking at the rules, I see NT9 has a production to 't26', and NT5: Wait, looking at the rules, some nt produce t3. Let me check each rule. Looking for where 't3' is a terminal. For example, NT22 -> t22, but in the rules, NT22 is 't22'. Hmm, but 't3' might be from NT9: NT9->'t3', no. Wait, checking rules: Yes, looking at the rules:\n\nNT30 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't5'\nNT13 -> 't47'\nNT22 -> 't22'\nNT9 -> 't26', but in some cases, like NT9 -> 't36'?\n\nWait, let me list all rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT2 -> t5\nNT3 -> 't3'? Wait, no. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking for any rule that directly produces a terminal t.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT2 -> t5\n\nNT3 -> t61? Wait, no:\n\nLet me scan all the rules:\n\n- NT2 -> t5\n- NT3 has a rule NT3 -> NT49 NT53\n- NT53 -> t30\n\nSo NT3 doesn't produce terminals directly. How about NT30? It has two rules: NT30 -> NT30 NT9 (which is a terminal path) and NT30 -> NT40 NT71, but that eventually becomes NT40 and NT71. Wait, but looking further:\n\nNT40 has a rule NT40 -> NT14 NT71, which then leads to NT9 and others, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to have each token correspond to a specific non-terminal, and then track how those non-terminals can be derived from the start.\n\nGiven the string starts with t82, t71, t13, t30, I can think the beginning is something like NT30 NT0 NT13 NT30...\n\nBut the start symbol is S -> NT45 NT81. So perhaps the entire string must be a combination of NT45 and NT81.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Another method might be to look for possible chains or to check recursively if each token can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's take each token and see which non-terminals can produce them:\n\nt82: NT30\n\nt71: NT0, NT81 (NT81 has a rule generating t30 and others, but not directly t71. Wait, no, NT0's rule is NT0 -> NT47 NT53. Then NT47 is 't84', and NT53 is 't30', which are both not t71. Wait, wait, no. Looking back:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT0 has a production: NT0-> NT47 NT53, and NT47 is 't84', NT53 is 't30'\u2014so NT0's terminal is 't84 t30'.\n\nBut earlier, I thought NT0 -> 't71', but that might not be correct.

All the non-terminals are on the left side, and each production has the form A -> BC or A -> a, which fits the Chomsky normal form. \n\nLooking at the string: `t82 t30 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t76 t13 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t76 t13 t32 t49 t30 t11 t82 t71 t8 t49 t59 t82 t5`.\n\nI notice that each word is a t followed by numbers, except for 't' alone, but in the grammar, the right-hand sides have various 't' instances like 't25', 't77', etc. So I think each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nNow, I need to see if the string can be derived from the grammar. To do this, I might use a top-down or bottom-up parsing approach. But since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser would be suitable, but maybe I can approach it step by step by breaking down the string.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Each of these can be further broken down into non-terminals. So the first step is to split the string into components that match these.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't82 t30 t13', which might correspond to some production. Let's see if any of the NT rules have a direct terminal output. For example, NT22 is 't22', but the string starts with t82, so that's different.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the entire string being a sequence of terminal symbols. Since the grammar's productions are all of the form A->BC or A->a, the generated strings will be sequences of terminals, and each production contributes either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string should be a series of terminals, and each of those terminals must be matched by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. For example, NT22 -> t22, so t22 is a terminal. Similarly, NT25 -> t25, etc.\n\nSo the string consists of terminals. I need to check if the derivation can produce this sequence.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to start from the string and apply the inverse, i.e., for each step, check if any production can be reversed.\n\nWait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can build the parse tree starting from the start symbol and see if the string can be covered.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a top-down approach. Start with S, and try to match the first part of the string.\n\nThe first production of S is NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLet's take the first option: S -> NT45 NT81.\n\nSo, I need to derive the string starting with NT45 and NT81.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t82. Let's see if NT45 can produce a terminal that starts with t82 or if it needs to derive to produce a sequence that includes t82 as the first terminal.\n\nWait, NT45 appears in several productions: NT45 -> NT50 NT44 and NT45 -> 't25'. So NT45 can either produce a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nIf I choose NT45 -> 't25', then that would give the first terminal as t25, but the string starts with t82, which doesn't match. So maybe I need to proceed via the non-terminal path.\n\nFrom NT45, perhaps produce NT50 NT44. Then each of these will have their own productions.\n\nNT50 -> NT83 NT7 and NT50 -> 't49'. If I take NT50 -> 't49', then that would give t49 as a terminal. But our first terminal is t82.\n\nHmm, this doesn't seem to match. Maybe I need to take NT45 -> NT50 NT44, but then both need to produce terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking S as NT19 NT67 would lead to a different sequence of terminals.\n\nLet's try S -> NT19 NT67.\n\nNT19's productions: NT19 -> NT84 NT8 or NT19 -> 't26'. So if I choose NT19 -> 't26', but the string starts with t82, so that's a mismatch. So perhaps NT19 should produce two non-terminals.\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8. Now, NT84 -> NT77 and 't47'. NT84 can produce a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nIf I take NT84 -> NT77, then NT77 -> 't8'. That would give t8 as the first terminal. But the string starts with t82. So that's not matching. Alternatively, NT84 could produce 't47' as a terminal. That would give t47, but the string starts with t82.\n\nSo that approach isn't working either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the string is split into tokens based on the spaces, each token is a unit that can match a terminal or derived from a non-terminal.\n\nSo let's list the string as a list of terminals:\n\n['t82', 't30', 't13', 't30', 't3', 't49', 't84', 't76', 't13', 't30', 't39', 't47', 't49', 't84', 't30', 't11', 't13', 't30', 't39', 't47', 't49', 't84', 't76', 't13', 't32', 't49', 't30', 't11', 't82', 't71', 't8', 't49', 't59', 't82', 't5']\n\nNow, each of these can be checked against the grammar's terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each 'tX' is a terminal where X is a number. So each token in the string is indeed a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, each token can be matched by some production directly.\n\nSo, each step in derivation would involve a non-terminal producing a terminal. Let's try to see if such a sequence exists.\n\nLooking at the first token 't82'. Which non-terminal's production includes 't82' as a terminal? Looking through the grammar, 't82' is a terminal. So which non-terminal produces 't82'? Scanning the grammar, NT19 -> NT82 isn't in the grammar. Wait, looking back, I don't see any production with 't82' directly. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, do I see any production that ends with 't82'? Let me look:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT23 -> t14\n- NT71 -> t52\n- NT50 -> t49\n- NT83 -> t30\n- NT76 -> t76\n- NT22 -> t22\n- NT25 -> t25\n- NT61 -> t53\n- NT77 -> t8\n- NT84 -> t77\n- NT39 -> t28\n- NT13 -> t47\n- NT7 -> t11\n- NT36 -> t42\n- NT81 -> t71\n- NT44 -> t76\n- NT27 -> t35\n- NT2 -> t5\n- NT45 -> t25\n- NT30 -> t82 \u2192 Wait, did I miss this?\n\nWait, let me scan the grammar again:\n\nLooking for NT productions that result in 't82':\n\nAh, here's one: NT81 -> 't71', not 't82'. Next, check each production:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT30 -> t82 is present. Yes! So NT30 can produce 't82'.\n\nSo the first token can be generated by NT30.\n\nNow, we have to check if in the grammar, the S can generate a sequence that includes this structure. But S only directly produces NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67, so how does NT30 come into play?\n\nTherefore, NT30 must be derived from one of the non-terminals in the initial S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-678","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar provided and the string to evaluate. The grammar has a set of non-terminals (like S, NT5, NT19, etc.) and terminals (like 't25', 't8', etc.). The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nContext-free grammars can be parsed using methods like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just starting, maybe I can try a top-down approach or see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The grammar has two productions for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo S expands into two non-terminals. Now, I need to see if the string can be derived from either of these.\n\nLooking at the string: the first part is 't82 t71 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t3 t30 t33 t42 t11 t84 t30 t3 t77 t47 t49 t84 t30 t11 t49 t42 t82 t71 t8 t30 t84 t8 t82 t71 t8 t82 t5'.\n\nWait, that's quite long. Maybe I should check if the entire string can be generated starting with S.\n\nLet's pick one production for S. Let's take S \u2192 NT19 NT67 and see if we can derive the string from that.\n\nNT19 has two productions:\n1. NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n2. NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n\nWait, actually looking back, I think I need to double-check the grammar. Let me list out the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar provided:\n\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n- S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 | NT60 NT5 | NT27 NT47 (Wait, am I seeing that right? Let me check the grammar list again. Hmm, I see NT19 has two productions: one to NT84 NT8 and another to NT60 NT5. Wait, did I miss another? Looking through, it seems NT19 is only present in S and in NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, etc. Wait, in the list, under NT19, it's only S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Wait, looking at the grammar list, NT19 is part of the productions for S, but I need to confirm if NT19 has other productions.\n\nWait, no, the grammar as provided seems to have S producing NT19 NT67, and I need to see if other non-terminals have productions starting with NT19. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the non-terminals. Let me structure this better.\n\nEach non-terminal is on the left, and the productions are on the right. So for example, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, NT0 \u2192 NT47 NT53, etc. So each production is a rule for that non-terminal.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The productions are for each non-terminal, so S has two rules, but the other non-terminals have their own rules. For example, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, and so on.\n\nSo S can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's take S \u2192 NT19 NT67 and see if the string can start with that.\n\nThe first token in the string is 't82', which must come from one of the terminals in the grammar. Looking at the productions that end with terminals, I need to see if 't82' is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several 't' terminals:\n- NT36 \u2192 't42'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n- NT45 \u2192 't60' etc. Wait, wait, let's get this right.\n\nWait, some of the productions directly produce a terminal. For example, looking at NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53, etc. But some non-terminals produce a terminal directly, like NT53 \u2192 't30', NT47 \u2192 't84', NT75 \u2192 't32', etc.\n\nWait, no, looking again, some non-terminals have productions that are direct terminals. For instance, NT44 \u2192 't76', NT84 \u2192 't77', etc.\n\nSo, back to S \u2192 NT19 NT67. The first step is to produce NT19 and NT67. Each would then produce strings, which together would form the entire string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't82', so maybe NT19 produces 't82' directly? Looking at the productions for NT19, I see:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n\nSo NT19 doesn't directly produce a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because if I start with S \u2192 NT19 NT67, then NT19 needs to be expanded into something, but the first token in the string is 't82', which isn't among the terminals produced directly by NT19.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try the other production for S, which is S \u2192 NT19 NT67, but wait, that's the same. Wait, no, the other production for S is S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nLet me check NT45. From the grammar, NT45 has the production NT60 NT77. So NT45 doesn't directly produce a terminal either. Hmm, so neither of the initial productions for S directly start with a terminal.\n\nWait, that suggests that I might need to look at the grammar to see which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I can list the terminals as follows:\n\n- 't82' is produced by... looking at the grammar, I see NT27 \u2192 't76', NT81 \u2192 't71', etc. Wait, let me check each production to see if any directly produce a 't' terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT45 \u2192 't60' (since NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77)\nWait, wait, no. NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, but NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, and NT81 \u2192 't71'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the direct terminal productions:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT36 \u2192 't42' (twice)\n- NT44 \u2192 't76' (twice)\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71' twice\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n\nWait, so for example, NT30 \u2192 't82' because looking at the grammar, I see NT30 is part of the production rule NT72 \u2192 NT10 NT44, and NT72 \u2192 NT30 NT44. Wait, maybe not. Let me check each production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the direct terminal outputs:\n\nLooking at each production, if it ends with a terminal, that's important. For example:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT36 \u2192 't42' (twice)\n- NT44 \u2192 't76' (twice)\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT77 \u2192 't8'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71' twice\n- NT84 \u2192 't77'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n\nWait, but are any non-terminals directly producing 't82'? Yes, NT30 \u2192 't82'. So if a non-terminal can produce 't82', it would do so by that production.\n\nSo, to start with the string, the first token is 't82'. That suggests that the initial non-terminal must expand into something that starts with NT30, because NT30 \u2192 't82'.\n\nSo perhaps the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT19 NT67, but then NT19"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-680","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is pretty long, and the grammar has a lot of production rules. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that CNF has a specific structure. Each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, every rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit this structure since all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the RHS are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t82 t3 t30 t3 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t33 t71 t52 t47 t30 t33 t71 t3 t77 t47 t49 t84 t30 t11 t77 t30 t25 t30 t84 t8 t82 t71 t8 t82 t5`.\n\nNow, each part of the string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this entire sequence can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either terminates with a terminal or splits into two non-terminals. This suggests that the derivation tree is a binary tree, and each path from the root to a leaf corresponds to a sequence of terminals.\n\nGiven that, I need to find a parse tree that matches the entire string. But with a string of 37 tokens, that's a lot. Maybe I can approach this by trying to break down the string into segments that match the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, starting from S, the first step will produce two non-terminals. Let's pick one of them. Let's say we take the first production: S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nNow, NT45 can produce a terminal or two non-terminals. Let's check the production rules for NT45. Looking through the rules, I see NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. So, NT45 is two non-terminals. Then NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81. NT30 \u2192 NT82 (terminal). NT81 \u2192 NT30 (terminal), but looking again, the rules for NT81 include NT81 \u2192 't71' and NT81 \u2192 't3'. Wait, in the grammar, there are multiple rules for NT81:\n- NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, actually, I need to list all the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for NT81, I see:\n- NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo NT81 can either produce 't71' or 't3', or split into NT30 and NT2.\n\nBut in the string, the first tokens are 't82', 't3', 't30', etc. Let's see if I can build a parse tree for the string.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by the grammar's terminal productions. Alternatively, perhaps I can work backwards by trying to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for possible ways to split the string into parts that fit the grammar rules. Let's try to parse the string by matching the possible sequences that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut with 37 tokens, that's a lot. Maybe I can look for some patterns or key nodes. For example, the string starts with 't82', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the only rule that ends with 't82' is NT36 \u2192 't42'... Wait, no, let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT36 \u2192 't42'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT23 \u2192 't14'\n- NT71 \u2192 't52'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n- NT12 \u2192 't3'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT44 \u2192 't59'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT81 \u2192 't30'\n- NT60 \u2192 't84'\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n- NT22 \u2192 't42'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n\nWait, I notice that NT30 \u2192 't82', as per NT30 \u2192 NT82 (terminal). So when NT30 is on the LHS, it can produce 't82'. Good. So the first token in the string is 't82', which can be produced by NT30, so I can have a subtree where NT30 \u2192 't82'.\n\nNow, let's see, the string after that would be: t3, t30, t3, t30, t3, t49, t84, t30, t11, t30, t33, t71, t52, t47, t30, t33, t71, t3, t77, t47, t49, t84, t30, t11, t77, t30, t25, t30, t84, t8, t82, t71, t8, t82, t5.\n\nSo after 't82', the next is 't3', which is a smaller token. Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't3'? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the terminal rules:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't42' \u2192 42\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT30 \u2192 't82'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT23 \u2192 't14'\n- NT71 \u2192 't52'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT53 \u2192 't30'\n- NT61 \u2192 't13'\n- NT12 \u2192 't3'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT44 \u2192 't59'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT81 \u2192 't30' or 't3' or 't71'\n- NT60 \u2192 't84'\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n- NT22 \u2192 't42'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n\nAh, yes, NT12 \u2192 't3'. So perhaps the next part is NT12, producing 't3'. So then the string after 't82 t3' would need to be parsed as part of NT12's derivation.\n\nBut wait, the second token is 't3', which is 't3', so that would be produced by NT12. So then, after that, the next tokens are 't30', 't3', 't30', etc. So let's see, after 't3', we have 't30', which is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't30'? We have NT81 \u2192 't30', as per the rules.\n\nSo perhaps after 't3', we have 't30', which comes from NT81. So maybe the path is S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then NT81 \u2192 't30', but wait, that would be 't30', so that's just one token.\n\nBut in our string, after 't82 t3', we have 't30', so the subtree would be NT81 (from S) \u2192 't30'. So that seems possible.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, S \u2192 NT45 NT81. So S splits into NT45 and NT81.

{"custom_id":"request-701","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the grammar starts with the start symbol S, which can produce other non-terminals. For example, S can be NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Each of these non-terminals (NTs) then further break down into other combinations, all the way down to the terminals 't' followed by some numbers. Some of these terminals directly correspond to the tokens in the string we're evaluating.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t84 t30 t39 t47 t13 t49 t84 t59 t30 t33 t71 t49 t77 t30 t25 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 t52 t47 t14 t25 t25 t47 t32 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5.\n\nEach 't' followed by two digits is a terminal in the grammar. So, for each token in the string, I need to see if it can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to build a parse tree from the string upwards, starting from the terminals and trying to match them to the productions of the grammar. If I can successfully build the parse tree without any leftover symbols (i.e., everything matches and I reach the root S), then the string is in the language.\n\nLet me list out the tokens in the string:\n\nt84, t30, t39, t47, t13, t49, t84, t59, t30, t33, t71, t49, t77, t30, t25, t30, t3, t49, t84, t59, t30, t33, t26, t84, t30, t52, t47, t14, t25, t25, t47, t32, t49, t30, t11, t82, t5.\n\nI'll start from the top-level grammar rules for S. S can be either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLet me look at the first rule S -> NT45 NT81. So, the entire string must derive into NT45 NT81. That means the first symbols generated should be derived from NT45 and NT81.\n\nLet's inspect NT45. Looking at the grammar, NT45 can produce 't25' directly. Hmm, that's one of the terminals. So, t45 would be replaced by t25. However, in our string, the first token is t84, which isn't t25. So, let me check the other production for NT45.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT45 has two productions: one is NT60 NT77, and the other is 't25'. So, one way to derive NT45 is to have t25, and another way is to have NT60 NT77. Since the string starts with t84, which doesn't match t25, we need to check if NT45 can produce something else that starts with t84.\n\nLooking further, NT60 is another rule for NT45. Wait no, NT45's first production is NT60 NT77, so it's more complex. Let me check if any of the terms in that chain can produce t84.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree. Let's see if t84 can be derived from any NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar, t84 appears as a terminal. So, which NTs produce t84? Checking each production:\n\n- NT47: 't84' is a production. So, NT47 can directly produce t84.\n\n- NT74: Not directly, since NT74 produces 't72' and 't5'. Wait, actually, looking again, NT74 -> NT72 NT5, and NT5 can produce 't25', but that doesn't lead to t84.\n\nWait, let's list all the NTs that directly produce t84:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n\n- NT84 -> 't30'\n\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n\n- NT30 -> 't82'\n\nWait, wait, looking again:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar rules, some of the production rules are like NT45 -> NT60 NT77. So, NT45 can produce NT60 NT77, and other rules.\n\nBut specific terminals are:\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nNT77 -> 't8'\n\nNT60 -> 't84' (looking at production NT60 -> NT30 NT81, no, that doesn't produce t84. Wait, let me check all the rules again.\n\nAh! Here's the rule NT47 -> 't84', so NT47 can produce t84.\n\nAnother rule: NT36 -> 't42'? Wait no, looking at NT36's rules:\n\nNT36 -> NT84 NT53\n\nNT36 also has NT50 NT36, which is recursive.\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce t84:\n\nWait, I need to find all NTs that have 't84' as a terminal.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n\n- NT77 -> 't8' (no)\n\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n\nWait, no. Let's check each rule.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't84' \u2192 so NT47 can produce t84.\n\nNT77 \u2192 't8' \u2192 no.\n\nNT36 \u2192 't42' \u2192 no.\n\nNT84 \u2192 't30' \u2192 can't produce t84.\n\nNT30 \u2192 't82' \u2192 no.\n\nNT52 \u2192 't71' \u2192 no.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules again, I can see NT47 can produce 't84'. Any others?\n\nLooking back, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, let's go through each rule to see if any NT directly produces 't84':\n\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n\n- S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n\n- NT71 \u2192 NT12 NT84\n\nWait, so NT71 has a production NT84, but does NT71 produce 't84'?\n\nLooking: NT71 can produce NT9 NT75. So, the production for NT71 includes 't9' and 't5' perhaps? Wait no, looking at the NT71 rules:\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT12 NT84, NT52 NT47, etc. Wait, actually, wait: NT71 can be 't52' (does any rule for NT71 lead to a terminal 't84'? Let me check: NT71 \u2192 NT44 NT52, but looking at NT71's own productions:\n\nWait, the rule is NT71 -> NT9 NT75. So that's not producing a terminal. Let me see, is there a production for NT71 that leads to a terminal?\n\nLooking through all the rules I have, perhaps I can re-express this.\n\nWait, perhaps in the grammar, NT71 has a production NT71 -> 't52' or something. Let me check:\n\nNo, looking through the rules again, I don't see any production where NT71 directly produces a terminal. So NT71 can't directly produce 't84', but perhaps through some other NT that it goes through.\n\nWait, but wait, if NT71 can be rewritten as something that includes 't84', then perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach this differently.\n\nWe need to parse the entire string, starting at the top. Let's see if we can split the string into two parts that can be parsed as S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t84, which could be produce by NT47, which is in the production S \u2192 NT45 NT81.\n\nWait, so if S is NT45 NT81, then we need the entire string to be the combination of NT45 and NT81 derivations.\n\nSo, let's see if we can split the string into two parts that each derive from NT45 and NT81 respectively, or other combinations.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that approach.

{"custom_id":"request-697","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t82 t71 t30 t3 t30 t33 t49 t42 t25 t84 t30 t76 t84 t28 t47 t77 t47 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t76 t42 t11 t30 t25 t25 t82 t5`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nSo, the strategy should be to parse the string using the given productions. I'll need to see if the string can be decomposed into a sequence of non-terminals that can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and S \u2192 NT19 NT67 are the two initial productions. So the first two symbols from the string must correspond to the NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67 chains. Let's check the string: the first two tokens are t82 t71. Neither of these are 45 or 19 or 81. Wait, no, NT45 is the non-terminal, and the production is S \u2192 NT45 NT81, which means that when we expand S, the first step would generate NT45 and NT81. So the string must start with the outputs of NT45 and NT81.\n\nWait, no\u2014it depends on the order. Let me think again. The start symbol is S, and from S, it can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the derived string will start with nt45 nt81 or nt19 nt67, translated into terminals. So the first part of the string must match either the expansion of NT45 or NT19 or the other way.\n\nWait, no. NT45 is a variable, and when we derive, it expands into terminals or other non-terminals. So for example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81, which then would be NT45 followed by NT81. So the first token in the string must be the result of NT45, and the second must be the result of NT81. Similarly, for S \u2192 NT19 NT67, the first token is NT19 and the second NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t82 t71. So, which of these production paths would result in starting with t82 and t71?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I should see what each non-terminal (like NT45, NT81, etc.) expands into. For example, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. Then, if NT60 and NT77 can produce t82 and t71 respectively, that would make sense. Alternatively, NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT2, so if NT30 is t82 and NT2 is t71, that would work.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step.\n\nLooking for NT45's expansion:\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. Then, NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, and NT77 \u2192 't8'. So NT60 would produce terminals t30 and t71 if NT81 is t71? Or is it NT30 is t82 and NT81 is t71? Wait, the terminals are t followed by a number.\n\nLooking at the productions, some non-terminals have terminals as their right-hand sides:\n\nFor example, NT77 \u2192 't8', NT44 \u2192 't76', NT36 \u2192 't42', NT84 \u2192 't77', etc. So, certain non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo, for NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. Then, NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, and NT30 \u2192 't82' (from NT30 \u2192 't82'), and NT81 \u2192 't71' (since NT81 \u2192 't71' directly). So NT45 would expand into t82 t71.\n\nSimilarly, for NT81 \u2192 NT30 NT2. NT30 is t82, NT2 \u2192 t5. That's not matching the second token, which is t71. So that wouldn't work.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Let's re-express each non-terminal's possible terminals:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81\nNT30 \u2192 't82'\nNT81 \u2192 't71'\n\nSo, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 \u2192 NT30 NT81 (from NT60) \u2192 't82 t71'? Because NT77 is 't8'? No, wait, earlier the production for NT77 was 't8'.\n\nWait, the productions listed are:\n\nLooking through them:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81\nNT30 \u2192 't82'\nNT81 \u2192 't71'\nNT77 \u2192 't8'\nSo, if NT60 is 't82' and NT81 is 't71', then NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 would be 't82 t8' (since NT77 is 't8'), but that's not matching the initial tokens. Alternatively, if NT60 is 't82' and NT77 is 't8', that would make 't82 t8', but the string starts with t82 t71. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the order wrong. Let me check again:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 NT81. So first NT45, then NT81. NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 \u2192 which would be NT60 and NT77, which each expand to terminals or more non-terminals. Similarly, NT81 \u2192 't71'.\n\nSo, how do we get from NT45 to the first tokens?\n\nWait, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. Then NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81. NT30 \u2192 't82', and NT81 \u2192 't71'. So expanding NT45 would give 't82 t71' as the first two symbols. That would match the string starting with t82 t71.\n\nSo that would mean S \u2192 NT45 NT81, where NT45 \u2192 't82 t71' and NT81 \u2192 't71'?\n\nWait no, NT81 is already 't71'. Wait, let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT81, there are two productions:\n\nNT81 \u2192 't71' OR NT30 NT2.\n\nSo, if the first NT45 expands to 't82 t71' and the second NT81 is 't71', then the entire first two productions (S \u2192 NT45 NT81) would expand to 't82 t71 t71', but in the string, it's t82 t71 followed by t30, which is the third token.\n\nWait, the string is t82 t71 t30 t3 t30 t33... So after t71, the next token is t30. That can't be right because if S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then the first two are 't82 t71' and then the next two would be 't30 t...' because NT81 is 't71' (from the NT81 production). So the first two tokens would be 't82 t71', then 't71' from NT81, making the first three tokens 't82 t71 t71', but the string is 't82 t71 t30 t3...'. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S uses the other production S \u2192 NT19 NT67.\n\nLet's see what NT19 and NT67 produce.\n\nLooking up NT19: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 or NT60 NT5. Wait, the given productions show:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 OR NT60 NT5.\n\nSo, NT19 can expand into two different paths.\n\nSimilarly, NT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2, or perhaps another production? Looking at the list:\n\nLooking for NT67:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT30 NT2 OR 't5'?\n\nWait, in the given productions, I see NT67 \u2192 't5'?\n\nWait, no, let me check the list:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-719","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t84 t13 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t59 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t14 t49 t59 t82 t3 t8 t49 t59 t84 t8 t82 t5`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see various non-terminals (NT followed by numbers) and some terminals (with 't' prefixes and other numbers, and some single 't' with no digits, like 't25', 't8', etc.). \n\nThe string starts with several 't' terms: t84, t13, t30, etc. The grammar's start symbol is S, which breaks down into combinations of these NTs and terminals. \n\nI think I should start by breaking down the string into its components and see if they can be matched by the productions of the grammar. Since the string is quite long, I'll try to parse it step by step, looking for possible production rules.\n\nStarting with the first symbol: t84. Looking at the grammar, NT84 is a non-terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, I see that some NTs expand into terminals. For example, NT45 can become 't44' if the rule is present. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT45 -> 't25' and other rules, but I'm trying to find if any NT directly produces 't84'. \n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see any NT that directly expands to 't84'. Hmm, so maybe I need to see if a longer chain can produce it. Alternatively, perhaps 't84' is part of a production that eventually leads to other non-terminals and then to this terminal. \n\nWait, I see that NT77 expands to 't8'. But that's perhaps not relevant here. Let me look for rules leading to 't84'. Let's see: some NTs have rules that end with 't84'. For example, NT39 -> 't28', which isn't 84. NT24 isn't present. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't84'. So maybe the string isn't valid, but I need to double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string was generated by a series of expansions that lead to these terminals. For example, a non-terminal might expand into other non-terminals which then expand into these terminals.\n\nWait, looking at some of the more complex rules, for example, NT84 -> NT45 has a production NT84 -> NT45, but then NT45 can break down further. So let me see. NT45 can produce 't25' or other combinations. But that might not lead to 't84' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules. Oh, I see that NT52 can produce 't71'. But again, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the string starts with symbols that are too long or don't fit any production. Let me check the first symbol: t84. If there's no rule that directly produces t84 as a terminal, then the string can't be derived from the grammar, unless it's produced by a non-terminal that can become t84 through expansion.\n\nWait a second, looking back at the rules, I see that NT84 is not a non-terminal in the grammar. The only non-terminals I can see are NT followed by numbers, like NT84 is part of a production, but perhaps not as a terminal. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S -> NT45 NT81\n- S -> NT19 NT67\n- ... (and many others)\n  \nSo S starts with two non-terminals. The string begins with t84, which could come from one of these non-terminals. \n\nLooking at NT81 in the rules, it can produce NT36 and 't71', and another rule that produces 't30'. So NT81 can become 't71' or 't30'. So t84 might come from NT81's production if it can generate t84 somehow, but I don't see NT81 producing t84 directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t84 is produced elsewhere. Wait, looking at the grammar, I notice that some rules produce terminals, like NT38 -> 't24' ? Wait, no, looking through, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed by attempting to parse the string according to the grammar. Let me see.\n\nI'll start with the entire string:\n\nt84 t13 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t59 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t14 t49 t59 t82 t3 t8 t49 t59 t84 t8 t82 t5\n\nI'll try to group this into the possible productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So possible symbols must be either generated by a single non-terminal at the top level or a combination of non-terminals.\n\nFirst, S -> NT45 NT81 or S-> NT19 NT67.\n\nSo either the entire string starts with NT45 and NT81, or with NT19 and NT67.\n\nBut the string starts with t84, so let's see if any of the NTs in the productions expand to t84.\n\nLooking at NT45: in the rules, NT45 can produce 't25' or NT60 and 't77'. So if NT45 expands, it can't produce 't84' directly. So if S->NT45 NT81, then the first part would have to be NT45 producing something, followed by NT81.\n\nSimilarly, S->NT19 NT67 would require the first part to be NT19 followed by NT67.\n\nLooking at NT19: it can produce NT84 and NT47, or NT60 and NT5, etc. So NT19 can expand into NT84, which itself can produce 't77' or other things.\n\nWait, if NT19 -> NT84 NT5, then NT84 can be 't77', which is t77, not t84. Alternatively, NT19 could expand into other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is invalid because none of the rules allow for a top-level production to produce 't84' directly. Or perhaps the first part is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the first symbol in the string: t84. Is there any non-terminal NT such that NT can derive t84?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't84'. For example:\n\n- NT36 can produce 't42' (via the rule NT36 -> 't42'), but t42 is not t84.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nNT27 -> 't35', which is another terminal.\n\nLooking deeper into the grammar, perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the production NT52 -> 't71' or NT52 -> NT9 NT0. Let's see, but that still doesn't lead to 't84'.\n\nWait, another approach: the first symbol is t84. If t84 is produced by a non-terminal, say NTx, then I can see NTx's productions to check if any can lead to a terminal 't84'.\n\nLooking at the rules for NTx:\n\nLooking for the first symbol 't84'.\n\nIn the grammar, the rule NT39 -> 't28' comes to mind, but that's not t84.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps t84 is produced by a non-terminal that expands step by step. Let's see: for example, NT12 expands into NT40 and NT13. NT40 can expand into NT14 and NT71, and so on.\n\nWait, NT40 is produced as NT40 -> NT14 NT71. NT14 can produce NT25 and NT52. NT52 produces, say, 't33' or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the path to t84 is longer, but given the time, maybe I should proceed more method"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that I can take advantage of. Let me jot down the grammar rules and the string to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several rules. Each rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the cases where a rule ends with a terminal symbol 't' followed by a number. For example, S -> NT45 NT81 is a rule that produces the terminal sequence 't84 t30' (since NT45 leads to 't45' which I assume is 't77'... Wait, no, looking back, some rules have terminal symbols like 't25', 't8', etc. I think the string has 't84 t30 t33...' and so on.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols. For instance, NT45 -> 't77', NT77 -> 't8', and so on. So each non-terminal either produces a terminal string or breaks down into other non-terminals.\n\nThe given string is: `t84 t30 t33 t42 t49 t76 t84 t30 t49 t77 t30 t49 t30 t11 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 t42 t11 t14 t25 t47 t49 t84 t76 t77 t30 t25 t30 t49 t30 t11 t47 t32 t82 t5`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived by the grammar. \n\nI think the approach here is to model the string as a sequence of terminals that can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which allows rules of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal, I can attempt to decompose the string into a series of production steps.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but since the grammar is large, that might not be feasible manually. Alternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the grammar consists of a fixed set of production rules, and the string is a terminal sequence that must be fully derived from the start symbol S. So I can try to construct a parse tree for the string, starting from the root S and seeing if it can split into the necessary non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the initial rule: S can split into NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's note that the string starts with 't84', which would come from NT45 (since NT45 -> 't77'... Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT45 has multiple rules. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT45 has some rules, including NT45 -> NT50 NT44 and NT45 -> NT60 NT77. But also, NT45 can produce a terminal if that's allowed. Wait, no. Looking at the given rules, some are direct terminals. For example, NT45 is derived from 't77' because I see a rule NT77 -> 't8', and NT45 is somewhere else. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of grammar rules, some of which are terminals. It's a bit confusing. Let me scan through the given rules:\n\nLooking at NT77: 'NT77 -> 't8'', so NT77 produces 't8'. Similarly, NT45: does it ever produce a terminal? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT45 is mentioned in several production rules, but not directly as a terminal. Instead, it's in the left-hand side of rules that produce non-terminals. So perhaps NT45 doesn't produce a terminal directly but only breaks down further.\n\nWait, but the user later lists some NTs mapping to 't25', 't84', etc. For example:\n\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT84 -> 't77'\n- NT77 -> 't8'\n- Also, NT45 has a rule -> 't77'? Wait, no, 'NT45 -> 't77' is not one of the rules. Wait, looking at the list provided by the user:\n\nI see:\n\nNT40 -> 't39'\n\nNT77 isn't directly a terminal except for NT77 -> 't8' (I think that's elsewhere), and several other NT rules like NT27 -> 't35', etc.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT40 -> 't39'\n\nNT22 -> 't22'\n\nBut more importantly, the string starts with 't84', which is likely from NT84 -> 't77', but in the grammar, NT84 is not present except as a component in other rules.

Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the left, right? Wait, no, wait. Chomsky Normal Form requires productions to be in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So every production either has two non-terminals or one terminal. That means the left-hand side (LHS) can only be a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) can be two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals are on the LHS with RHS consisting of two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT45 NT81, or sometimes a non-terminal followed by a terminal, like NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75. Wait, no, hold on. Looking again, some productions seem to have a mix. For example, S \u2192 NT45 NT81: that's two non-terminals, so that fits CNF. Another production is NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75: two non-terminals. However, there are others like NT71 \u2192 NT12 NT84, which is two non-terminals. But then there's NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45, which is also two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but I notice that in the grammar, some productions might actually have a non-terminal and a terminal on the RHS. For example, looking at NT45: one production is NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, which is two non-terminals. But another production is NT45 \u2192 't25', which is just a terminal. Similarly, NT19 \u2192 't84'. So these are productions where a non-terminal is replaced by a single terminal.\n\nBut wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production must be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So in the given grammar, some of the productions are of the form non-terminal \u2192 terminal, which is allowed. But all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS if it's more than one symbol. So checking if any production has more than two symbols on the RHS. Let me check: the productions given don't have any RHS with more than two symbols. The longest RHS seems to be two non-terminals. So I think the grammar is correctly in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nNow, to determine if the string is in the language, I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by replacing non-terminals step by step until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t84, t30, t33, t26, t84, t30, t77, t30, t84, t8, t13, t49, t84, t59, t49, t77, t30, t49, t59, t30, t82, t71, t8, t47, t30, t3, t49, t84, t30, t11, t49, t42, t49, t59, t30, t84, t8, t82, t5.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So the way the string is generated is through a series of steps where non-terminals are replaced, ultimately leading to terminals. The number of terminals in the string suggests the depth of the derivation.\n\nThe string has 37 terminals. Since each production (other than the single terminals) replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, the number of symbols (terminals + non-terminals) increases by 1 with each replacement. Starting from 1 symbol (the start symbol S), after each step, the number increases by the number of non-terminals replaced (each replaced non-terminal adds two, so the net change is +1 per non-terminal replaced).\n\nWait, actually, when a non-terminal A is replaced by B and C, it increases the count from 1 (A) to 2 (B, C). But in our case, since the grammar is in CNF, each replacement replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals. So each replacement increases the number of symbols by 1. Starting with 1 symbol (S), to get a string of k terminals, the number of replacements needed is k - 1. So in this case, the string has 37 terminals, so the number of replacements is 36. Hence, the derivation would have a depth of 36.\n\nBut before getting into that, perhaps it's easier to try to work backwards from the string, trying to parse it according to the grammar. That is, using a top-down approach, seeing if the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, we can also parse the string using the given grammar's productions. Since the grammar is recursive and quite complex, maybe a better approach is to look for a pattern or a possible reduction.\n\nBut with a string of 37 terminals, a manual approach would be time-consuming, so perhaps I can look for recurring patterns or consider the possible structure.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is 't84', which could potentially correspond to a production like NT45 \u2192 't25' or NT19 \u2192 't84'. Wait, in the grammar, NT19 has a production: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8. So if we can split the string into parts where 't84' corresponds to NT19, then the next would be NT84 and NT8.\n\nWait, but let me check the grammar for 't84'. Looking through the productions, I see NT5 \u2192 't25', NT8 \u2192 't83', NT19 \u2192 't84', etc. Specifically, I notice that NT19 has a production NT19 \u2192 't84', which is a direct terminal. So if 't84' is generated by NT19, then the substring starting with 't84' could be the result of NT19.\n\nBut wait, let's think about how that would work. If NT19 \u2192 't84', then the first 't84' would correspond to NT19. Then, we would need to see what's before and after. But since we're starting from the beginning, perhaps it's more straightforward to see if we can find a sequence of productions that lead to the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to see if the string can be split into parts that match the productions. Let's take the string and see if it can be divided into chunks matching the grammar's terminals.\n\nLet's break the string into individual terms for clarity:\n\nList of terms: [\"t84\", \"t30\", \"t33\", \"t26\", \"t84\", \"t30\", \"t77\", \"t30\", \"t84\", \"t8\", \"t13\", \"t49\", \"t84\", \"t59\", \"t49\", \"t77\", \"t30\", \"t49\", \"t59\", \"t30\", \"t82\", \"t71\", \"t8\", \"t47\", \"t30\", \"t3\", \"t49\", \"t84\", \"t30\", \"t11\", \"t49\", \"t42\", \"t49\", \"t59\", \"t30\", \"t84\", \"t8\", \"t82\", \"t5\"]\n\nI notice that the string starts with t84, which I think is generated by NT19. So let me see if after 't84', the next part can be matched.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT19 has a production NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8. So NT19 is replaced by NT84 and NT8, both non-terminals. But then, each of those could be further replaced. Let's think about this.\n\nIf the string is \"t84 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 ...\", then perhaps the first 't84' is from NT19, and then the next non-terminals (NT84 and NT8) would need to generate the rest. Alternatively, perhaps the initial production is not NT19, but another non-terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal. So, no \u03b5 productions or more than two non-terminals on the right side.\n\nLet me look at the grammar first. It has a bunch of production rules where each non-terminal (S, NTx) on the left expands into two other non-terminals on the right, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal (like 't' followed by a number). For example, S -> NT45 NT81, NT5 -> NT61 NT75, and so on.

Identify all the non-terminals that can derive the terminals in the string.\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-761","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to check is a series of symbols ending with 't's and some numbers. \n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky Normal Form works. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production has two non-terminals on the left or just one terminal.\n\nGiven that, the approach is to see if the string can be parsed by the grammar. Since each production has a limited form, perhaps I can model this as a parsing problem using something like dynamic programming or recursive descent. But since I'm just manually checking, maybe I can reverse-engineer the string by finding a reduction that builds up the string from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me look at the string:\n\nt82 t3 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 t52 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t14 t25 t84 t8 t82 t3 t8 t25 t82 t5.\n\nThat's a long string with 58 tokens. Let's see if I can break it down.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which according to the grammar can produce either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the first step is to split the string into two parts based on the first production.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: t82 and t3. But in the grammar, NT5 produces NT61 NT75, among others. Wait, perhaps I should start by trying to find the possible pairs that start the string.\n\nWait, another approach: Each production has either a terminal or two non-terminals. So when parsing, the parser will try to match the next terminals step by step, possibly expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if the string can be split into the components given by the grammar. Let's see.\n\nThe first symbol is t82. Let me look at the grammar for any production that ends with t82. Scrolling through the productions, I see:\n\nNT22 -> 't22'\nBut that's a direct production. So 't22' can be generated directly.\n\nAnother production: NT22 -> 't22' is for token 't22'. But the first symbol is 't82', which isn't directly generated by any production, unless I'm looking through other productions.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I find:\n\nNT84 -> 't84' is a production.\n\nWait, actually, let's go through the productions:\n\nLooking for 't82':\n\nNT82 is not a production in the initial set, but looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT82 is not present, but I have NT82 -> 't82' somewhere? Wait, looking again, the productions include:\n\nLooking for 't82':\n\n- NT22 -> 't22' (so 't22' is terminal)\n- Also, looking at the grammar, I don't see 't82' as a terminal; instead, checking higher ups:\n\nWait, in the initial part, I see:\n\nNT77-> 't8', NT81-> 't71', NT84-> 't77', NT2-> 't5', etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing 't82' as a terminal. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, checking the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see 't82' as a direct terminal. So maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the string is:\n\nt82 t3 t30 t33 t26 t84 t30 t52 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t14 t25 t84 t8 t82 t3 t8 t25 t82 t5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that 't82' is a production? Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, Nts ending with numbers like 22, 30, etc. I don't see NT82 as a non-terminal with a production like NT82-> something. It might be that 't82' is in the symbol, but perhaps it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, actually, I'm looking through the production rules, and the only direct terminals are in the non-terminals, as per the productions. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar. In the list of productions, are there any NT rules that produce 't82'? Or do I have to see if it's part of a longer production?\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't82', except perhaps via NT82. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions like NT53-> 't30' so 't30' is generated. Similarly, NT22-> 't22'. So 't82' would be generated by a non-terminal NT82 that has a production NT82->'t82'.\n\nWait, if I go through the grammar, I see that there's a rule NT22 -> 't22' and NT27->'t35', etc.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm missing some rules. Let me list out the direct terminal productions from the grammar (where NTx is a non-terminal that goes to a terminal):\n\nLooking through the rules, the direct terminal productions (where the RHS is a single 't' followed by something, but from the list, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT26 -> 't26' (Wait, no, looking again, I might have misread.)\n\nWait, no. Let me go step by step:\n\n- The grammar has 45 production rules, but let's check which non-terminals map directly to terminals.\n\nLooking for any production where RHS is a single symbol and is a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only ones that produce terminals like 't' with numbers:\n\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT9 -> 't22' (Wait, no, in the production list, the last few rules are:\n\nNT9 -> 't26' according to this rule: \"NT9 -> NT22' \u2014 Wait, that's a production where NT9 is replaced by NT22 and a terminal? Wait, no, looking again.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the given grammar, the rule is \"NT9 -> NT9'? No, looking through, I see:\n\nLine: \"NT9 -> NT22\"\u2014no, that's a production where NT9 is replaced by NT22 and a terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking again: the user's grammar is:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I think I need to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar string, each line is a production of the form A -> B C or A-> B, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals. So, for example, the first line is S-> NT45 NT81.\n\nSo, looking for any productions where the RHS is a terminal, like 't2'.\n\nSearching through all the given rules:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS has a single terminal. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't26' \u2014 yes, this is a production that outputs 't26'.\n- NT7 -> 't11'.\n- NT9 -> 't22' \u2014 no, looking again, the NT9-> 't22' is 'NT9 -> NT22' \u2014 wait, no, that line is: \"NT9 -> NT22' \u2014 no, wait, no, the rule is NT9 -> NT22 \u2014 meaning it's replaced by NT22. So that's a non-terminal production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list out all the rules and see which have RHS as a terminal:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n1. S-> NT45 NT81\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-755","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a standard form for context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar has a bunch of productions, and the string to check is a sequence of symbols ending with 't' followed by numbers. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF productions are either creating a non-terminal from two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the start symbol S has productions like S \u2192 NT45 NT81, that means the first step would involve S expanding into two other non-terminals. Similarly, other S productions like S \u2192 NT19 NT67 show that S can go into different pathways.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that each non-terminal (NTx) eventually leads to a terminal by a chain of productions. For example, NT45 goes to NT60 NT77, which then go to NT50 and other NTs, until finally it reaches 't8'. So, each non-terminal in the grammar can only produce a terminal symbol through a chain of substitutions.\n\nThe string provided is a list of terminals, so each of these must be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar. To check if the string is in the language, I can try to parse it by working backwards from the string, applying the grammar rules in reverse to see if I can derive the entire string.\n\nThis approach is similar to the top-down parsing method, specifically using something like the CYK algorithm, but since the string consists only of terminals and we're dealing with a context-free grammar, we can try to see if each step can be matched by the productions.\n\nLet's look at the string:\n\nt84 t30 t76 t84 t28 t47 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t30 t82 t3 t84 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t33 t49 t42 t25 t84 t30 t52 t47 t14 t25 t25 t82 t71 t8 t82 t5.\n\nThat's a lot of terms, over 40 symbols. The grammar can only produce certain combinations, and each step must follow the productions.\n\nSince the grammar uses NTx symbols and t symbols, I'll need to check if each t is produced correctly by the non-terminals in the grammar. For example, looking at the first few symbols:\n\nt84, t30, t76, t84...\n\nI need to see if these can be produced by a chain of NT productions. Let me trace back from the end, perhaps.\n\nStarting from the end, the last few symbols are t5 and several 't's. Let me see if any productions end with t5. Looking through the grammar, I see NT53 \u2192 't30', NT33 \u2192 't49', NT42 \u2192 't42', NT25 \u2192 't33', etc. So perhaps t5 isn't directly in the grammar, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, NT50 \u2192 't49', NT53 \u2192 't30', etc. So perhaps t5 isn't part of any production, but wait, looking at NT5 \u2192 't25', so 't25' is possible. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into segments that match the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nEach production in CNF is either generating two NTs or a terminal. So the string must be a concatenation of such productions. Each step in the derivation would produce a sequence of terminals by substituting each node with its production.\n\nBut given the string's complexity, a manual approach might not be feasible, so perhaps I should look for a pattern or see if the string can be split into parts that fit the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if certain terminals are consecutive. For example, looking at the start, t84 comes first. From the grammar, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, NT77 \u2192 't8', and NT60 \u2192 't84'. So, the path could be NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 \u2192 't84' 't8'. So the first two symbols could be t84 t8, but the given string starts with t84 t30, which doesn't match. So that path might not work.\n\nAnother starting point: let's consider the production S \u2192 NT45 NT81. That would lead to two non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. So the first two symbols of the string should be tX tY.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see what NT45 and NT81 expand to. NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, then NT60 \u2192 't84', NT77 \u2192 't8'. So that would produce t84 t8. But the string starts with t84 t30, which doesn't match that.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT19 NT67: NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, NT67 \u2192 't30'. So NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, then NT84 \u2192 't77', NT8 \u2192 't83' (since NT84 \u2192 't76'... wait, no, from the grammar, NT84 appears multiple times.\n\nWait, let's clarify. From the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT84: I see NT75 \u2192 't32', but that doesn't directly help. Wait, looking for production of t84:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are entries like NT40 \u2192 't39', NT75 \u2192 't32', etc. Wait, let me look for 't84' in the grammar.\n\nNo, actually, 't84' is written as t84, t77, etc. Wait, the grammar has these entries:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't8', NT77 \u2192 't8', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps 't84' is a terminal? Or is 't84' a non-terminal? Let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, we have lines like NT53 \u2192 't30', which suggests that 't30' is a terminal. So 't84', 't25', etc., are terminals.\n\nSo, when looking at the string, each symbol is either a non-terminal (like NTx) or a terminal (like t84). So the string is a sequence of both NTx and t symbols.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar has both NTx and 't' symbols. So the string is a mix of NTx (non-terminals) and terminal symbols. That's interesting because in context-free grammars, derivations involve non-terminals, and terminals are the leaves.\n\nBut in this case, the given string has some NT tokens, which must be part of the derivation path. So maybe the string is mixing NTx and 't' symbols, meaning that some NTx are still present as part of the derivation steps until they produce terminals.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't84 t30 t76 t84 t28 t47 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t30 t82 t3 t84 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t33 t49 t42 t25 t84 t30 t52 t47 t14 t25 t25 t82 t71 t8 t82 t5.'\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't84', then 't30', etc.\n\nGiven that, perhaps each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, and the NTx must be resolved to other NTx or 't's.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can check if each 't' is a terminal that's allowed by the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the only terminals are the 't' symbols like t11, t13, etc., so each 't' in the string must be a terminal produced by some NTx.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that 't5' is not present because the non-terminals don't end with 't5'. Similarly, some 't's may be reachable.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT5 \u2192 't25', so 't25' is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-777","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Wow, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should probably understand the grammar and the string we're dealing with. The grammar consists of production rules that start from the start symbol S and have other non-terminals (NT with numbers) and terminals ('t' followed by numbers). The string we're evaluating is a sequence of the form 't84 t30 t33 ...' and so on.\n\nAlright, starting with the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or S \u2192 \u03b5. Here, our grammar only has productions where a non-terminal produces two non-terminals or a terminal. Not seeing any \u03b5 productions so far.\n\nThe string is composed of a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers. My first thought is that these 't's might be the terminals in the grammar, so each 'tX' might correspond to a specific production rule.\n\nI should look for how the string can be split into the terminals specified by the grammar. But first, maybe try to simplify or find a structure.\n\nLooking at the string: `t84 t30 t33 t71 t33 t49 t42 t49 t30 t11 t84 t30 t42 t49 t76 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t39 t47 t32 t25 t47 t77 t47 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t59 t26 t30 t25 t82 t5`.\n\nThat's a long string. I notice that the grammar has several NT rules that eventually produce 't's. For example, NT45 produces 't25' and 't77', right? So any chain that leads down to 't25' would contribute 't25' to the string.\n\nAnother approach is to see the structure of the grammar. Starting from S, which branches into NT45 and NT81. So the string should start with either NT45 or NT81. Let's check the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't84', so I need to see if NT45 or NT81 can produce something that can start with a 't84'. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT45 can produce 't25' and 't77'. But that's direct terminals, not involving any non-terminals. So for NT45, the expansion would start with either 't25' or 't77'. Similarly, NT81 can produce 't71' or 't30' or others? Let me check:\n\nWait, the string starts with 't84', which I don't see directly as a terminal from NT45 or NT81. Let me check NT81's rules. Looking at the grammar, I see NT81 -> NT45 NT77 and also NT81 -> 't30'? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nActually, in the grammar provided, there are several rules. For example, NT19 has a rule NT19 -> NT84 NT8, and later NT19 also has NT84 NT5. Wait, but 't84' is a terminal, so perhaps NT84 can produce 't84'.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Looking at the grammar rules provided, I see:\n\n- NT45 -> 't25' and 't77'\n- NT81 -> 't71' and 't30' as per some rules, but actually, looking at the given grammar:\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the rules. Let me list the rules for each NT:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\nNT77 -> 't77' (I think earlier, perhaps a misindexing, but checking the provided grammar: yes, NT77 seems to be at the end: NT77 is 't77'. Similarly, NT84 is a terminal 't84', I believe. Wait, no: looking at the grammar rules, I see 'nt25' as a terminal with 't25' and similar for others.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, the rules are written as non-terminals on the left and either other non-terminals or terminals on the right. For example:\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\nNT77 -> 't77'\nSimilarly, NT81:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT81 -> 't30'\n\nBecause in the list of rules:\n\nNT40 -> 't39'\nNT45 -> 't25'\nNT58 -> 't27' etc.\n\nWait, actually, some of the higher-level productions might lead to terminals. For example, NT84 might have a production that leads to 't84' or perhaps more non-terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, the initial grammar has the start symbol S with two rules:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\nS -> NT19 NT67\n\nSo the string must start with either NT45 or NT67. But the string starts with 't84', so let's see if either NT45 or NT81 can produce 't84' as the first terminal.\n\nLooking at NT45's rules:\n\nNT45 can directly produce 't25' or 't77', so it can't produce 't84' directly. So does NT45 lead to a chain that can produce 't84'? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT45, it can only go to 't25' or 't77', so it can't produce anything else. So NT45 can't start with 't84'.\n\nWhat about NT81? Its rules are:\n\nNT81 -> 't30' and also something else. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT81 in the rules. From the list provided, I don't see an explicit rule like NT81 -> 't84', so perhaps NT81 can't produce 't84' directly. But maybe NT81 goes through other non-terminals that can.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT81 -> 't71'\n\nBut that's a terminal, so that's a possibility.\n\nWait, let me look again. The last rule in the grammar is NT45 -> 't25' and 't77', and others as well. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some NT81 rules. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT81 being in any other positions except 't30' and others. So perhaps NT81 cannot produce 't84' directly.\n\nBut the string starts with 't84', which suggests that either the entire grammar can't produce such a starting symbol. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but that's too quick. Maybe the string is part of a longer derivation. Let me think.\n\nPerhaps the string starts with 't84', which might come from a non-terminal that isn't explicitly in the given grammar as a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a rule where NT could produce 't84'.\n\nAnother way is to check each rule for NT and see if any can generate 't84'.\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\n- NT25: 't25' (terminal)\n- NT27: 't27' (terminal)\n- NT30: 't30' (terminal)\n- NT36: 't36'... wait, but in the grammar, NT36 has a rule 't36' and can also produce other NTs, which may produce terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT36 can produce 't42' and also can split into NT84 and NT53, which are non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, 't42' appears, so perhaps that comes from NT36's production to 't42'.\n\nBut the initial string starts with 't84', so maybe we need a non-terminal that can derive 't84'. Looking at the NTs, I don't see any rule that has 't84' as a terminal, except perhaps in the rules provided.\n\nWait, let me check again: the list of rules includes:\n\n- NT45 -> 't25' and 't77'\n- NT77 -> 't77'\n- NT84 -> 't84' (I don't see that, but perhaps it's in another part)\nWait, actually, looking back, I think I might have misread the rules. Let me go through each part:\n\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT53\n- NT71 -> NT9 NT75\n- NT36 -> NT84 NT53\nSo, wait, there's a rule NT36 -> NT84 NT53. So that means NT84 is a non-terminal that can be produced from NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

From the start symbol S, the productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n- S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, the initial step is for S to produce two non-terminals: NT45 and NT81. I need to see if these can derive into the string.\n\nLooking at the string provided:\nt82 t71 t30 t33 t49 t49 t49 t77 t30 t49 t59 t84 t30 t52 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t22 t22 ... (and so on with various t's and numbers)\n\nI notice that the string consists of a series of 't' tokens and number tokens. Each non-terminal in the grammar either produces a terminal 't' followed by a number or another non-terminal.\n\nMy approach will be to try tracing back from the string to see if I can reconstruct the non-terminals step by step using the given productions.\n\nStarting with the first non-terminal in S: NT45 and NT81.\n\nLet's take NT45 first. Looking at the productions for NT45:\n- NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT44\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT5\n- There's also NT45 \u2192 't25', but that's a terminal, which won't help here.\n\nSo, NT45 must derive into two non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. Let's explore the production NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77.\n\nNT60: Let's see the productions:\n- NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81\n- NT60 \u2192 NT14 NT71\n- NT60 \u2192 NT40 NT14\n- NT60 \u2192 NT40 NT5\n- There's also NT60 \u2192 't84', which isn't directly relevant here.\n\nSo, NT60 must generate more non-terminals. Let's pick NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81.\n\nNT30's productions:\n- NT30 \u2192 NT82 ('t82')\n- NT30 \u2192 NT9 ('t26')\n- NT30 \u2192 NT53 ('t30')\n- NT30 \u2192 NT39 ('t28')\n- NT30 \u2192 NT53 ('t30')\n- NT30 \u2192 NT45 ('t45') [probably not relevant here]\n\nSo, from NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, we can get 't82' from NT30 and then NT81 would come from the second symbol in the initial S production, which is NT81.\n\nWait, but S initially splits into NT45 and NT81. So if NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, and NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, then:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't82' (so 't82')\n- NT81 \u2192 ... Let's look at NT81's productions:\n  - NT81 \u2192 NT30 ('t30')\n  - NT81 \u2192 NT32 ('t32')\n  - NT81 \u2192 NT71 ('t52')\n  - NT81 \u2192 NT2 ('t2')\n  - NT81 \u2192 't71'\n  \nSo, if NT81 \u2192 't71', then that's another terminal. Alternatively, NT81 could produce other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but we have the string's next element after 't82' is 't71', which is the result of NT81 \u2192 't71'.\n\nSo from S \u2192 NT45 NT81 \u2192 NT60 NT77 NT81 \u2192 ('t82') and then... Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me retrace:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n3. NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81\n4. NT30 \u2192 't82'\n5. NT81 \u2192 't71'\n\nSo that would give us 't82 t71' from just the first part of S. But the string starts with 't82 t71', which matches. So far, that's good.\n\nNow, the rest of the string after 't82 t71' is 't30 t33 t49 t49 t49 t77 t30 t49 t59 t84 t30 t52 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t82 t3 t84 t84 t28 t47 t32 t82 t3 t8 t25 t82 t5'.\n\nWait, but wait, the second part of S is NT19 and NT67. So after 't82 t71', the next part should come from NT19 and NT67.\n\nLooking at NT19's productions:\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n- NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n- So, multiple options.\n\nThe string's third token is 't30', which would have to come from NT19's derivation.\n\nLooking at NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, does that produce anything relevant? Let's see:\n\nNT84's productions:\n- NT84 \u2192 NT30 ('t30')\n- NT84 \u2192 NT28 ('t28')\n- NT84 \u2192 NT39 ('t28 again? Wait, NT39 is 't28')\nWait, maybe I should cross-reference this.\n\nWait, for NT84, the productions are:\n- NT84 \u2192 NT30 ('t30')\n- NT84 \u2192 NT28 ('t28')\n\nSo, if NT84 \u2192 't30', then the 't30' makes sense.\n\nThen NT8, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, if NT19 \u2192 NT84 't30' and then NT8 \u2192 't8', but in the string it's 't84' after 't30'.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let's correct this.\n\nWait, the initial S produces NT45 and NT81. So the first part is 't82 t71', then we have NT19 and NT67 from S.\n\nWait, but the string after the initial 't82 t71' is 't30 t33...', which suggests that after 't71' comes 't30'. So that would be the start of the second part of S: NT19 NT67.\n\nSo from NT19, we have several productions. Let's look at NT19's options again:\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\n\nIf we take NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8, we can have NT84 producing 't30' and NT8 producing 't8'. But the next token is 't30', so perhaps that's the path. So, NT84 \u2192 't30'.\n\nBut in the string, immediately after 't71' is 't30', then 't33', etc. So we have 't82 t71 t30 ...'.\n\nSo, after NT19 \u2192 NT84 ('t30'), then NT8, but the next symbol is 't33'. That's a problem because NT8's only productions are terminals. Wait, no\u2014looking back, NT8 has a production:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't8'\n\nBut in the string, we have 't33' as the next token. Hmm, this suggests that maybe the initial assumption is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing a step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT19 is using another production. Let's check NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5.\n\nIf NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5, then NT60 produces non-terminals and NT5 produces more.\n\nLet's explore NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81 (as before).\n\nThen NT30 \u2192 't82' again, but we have 't30' in the string. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, NT60 \u2192 NT14 NT71.\n\nNT14's productions:\n- NT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52\n- NT14 \u2192 NT27 NT47\n- NT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52\n\nSo, perhaps NT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52.

{"custom_id":"request-802","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier. Each production rule either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and from S, we can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Each of these non-terminals then further break down into other non-terminals, which eventually terminate with terminals like 't11', 't25', and so on, or sometimes a mix where a non-terminal might directly produce a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. The string is: t82 t71 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t30 t33 t71 t26 t13 t49 t84 t59 t13 t32 t25 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t13 t14 t49 t59 t49 t59 t84 t8 t25 t82 t5.\n\nI think the best approach is to simulate the parsing process using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser could work, but perhaps I can manually trace through the string or use some strategy like memoization to see how the string can be broken down by the grammar.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and either a terminal or two non-terminals on the right, except for those that directly produce a terminal. So, the length of the string must be 2^n +1 for some n, but in this case, the string has 55 tokens. Wait, 55 might not be a power of two plus one. Let me calculate: 2^5 is 32, 32+1=33. 2^6=64, 64+1=65. 55 is in between, so maybe the depth isn't the issue here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the steps involve a series of productions that expand the initial S into multiple non-terminals, each expanding further until terminals are reached. Each production step reduces the stack or the current parse tree by splitting into two parts.\n\nSince the string is quite long, I'll need to break it down step by step. Maybe I'll look for the first few steps.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t82. Let's see which productions end with t82.\n\nLooking at NT60: NT60 -> NT30 NT81. Then, NT30 -> NT82 (via NT82 production). Wait, in the grammar, NT30 -> 't82'. Yes, so from NT60, it's NT30 NT81, and then NT30 becomes t82, NT81 becomes something. Wait, I need to see what happens when we have NT60 in the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t82. So to get t82, maybe it's generated directly as a terminal from NT30. So NT30 goes to 't82'.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT30 is defined as -> 't82'. So in order to get 't82', the parser would follow the production NT30 -> 't82'.\n\nNow, let's trace back how NT30 is formed. Maybe in a larger production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, let me find all the productions that include 't82' or other tokens.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT81\nNT30 -> 't82'\nSo, if we have NT60, which expands into NT30 and NT81, which might further expand.\n\nSo, in the string, t82 is preceded by other tokens: let me see, the string is:\n\nt82, t71, t13, t30, t3, t49, t84, t30, t11, t13, t30, t3, t49, t84, t59, t30, t33, t71, t26, t13, t49, t84, t59, t13, t32, t25, t47, t13, t49, t84, t76, t13, t14, t49, t59, g59, t84, t8, t25, t82, t5.\n\nSo, the string starts with t82, which is one of the first tokens. So, t82 comes first, which is likely the result of NT30. Then next is t71, which is generated by NT26, because I see in the grammar:\n\nNT26 -> 't71'\n\nSo, t71 comes from NT26.\n\nNow, let's consider the previous token before t82. It's t71. But wait, in the string, after t82 is t71. So in the parse tree, t82 is left, t71 is right, but that doesn't align since t82 and t71 are at the same level. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parse tree is built from the start symbol. Let's consider that S can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the root is either (NT45 NT81) or (NT19 NT67). Let me check the string to see which one is more likely. The first few tokens are t82, t71, t13, etc. Let me see:\n\nIf we choose S -> NT45 NT81, then the first two symbols would be NT45 and NT81. But in the string, the first symbol is t82, which is a terminal, so likely NT30. Alternatively, if S were the other option, NT19 NT67, which would generate t84 and t8... Wait, looking back, the grammar's S options are S-> NT45 NT81 or S-> NT19 NT67.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t82, which isn't directly produced by NT45 or NT81 in their production. Wait, let me see NT45: NT45 -> NT60 NT77. NT60 -> NT30 NT81, but NT30 produces t82. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me think: a context-free grammar with leftmost derivation.\n\nWe'll have to find the parse tree.\n\nParse tree would start with S, then from S we have either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's see what each of those expands to.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be built up by applying productions in CNF.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation reduces the number of symbols by one, replacing a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a leftmost derivation.\n\nSo let's take the string and check if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut the string is quite long, so this might take a while. Maybe I should see if the string can be broken down into the leftmost symbols generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: create a list of production rules for each non-terminal and see how they can produce the given string.\n\nFor example, starting from the string, we can see if it can be split into parts that match any production.\n\nBut the string is in the order of about 55 tokens, and each production is either two non-terminals (except for terminals) or a single terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps we can work backward, trying to break the string into possible chunks using the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for the start symbol S in the string and see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nBut perhaps a more practical approach is to analyze the structure of the string, seeing how the tokens could be grouped into non-terminals' expansions.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to find where in the string certain productions might occur.\n\nFirst, I see t82. From the grammar, NT30 -> t82. So perhaps t82 comes from NT30.\n\nThen, what comes before t82 in the string? It's t71, which is NT26 -> t71.\n\nHmm, maybe that suggests something like NT26 \u2192 t71 followed by NT30 \u2192 t82, but that would require that NT26 and NT30 are siblings in the parse tree, which would perhaps come from a parent NT that branches into both.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81.

That should make things a bit easier because CNF has some nice properties, especially for parsing, but here I'm just trying to see if the string can be derived.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t82 t3 t30 t33 t77 t30 t84 t8 t84 t30 t49 t42 t82 t3 t8 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t3 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t3 t32 t84 t8 t49 t30 t11 t47 t32 t82 t5`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many of the non-terminals directly produce terminal strings.

{"custom_id":"request-819","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string I need to check if it's generated by the grammar. Hmm, the grammar looks a bit complex with a bunch of productions. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals. The string I'm supposed to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers and maybe some are terminals. Wait, actually, the productions sometimes end up with something like 't5', 't77', etc. So I think in this grammar, some non-terminals are directly connected to terminal strings, which are actually the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to check is: `t84 t30 t33 t71 t76 t84 t28 t47 t77 t47 t30 t33 t42 t49 t59 t84 t30 t42 t11 t14 t25 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t33 t71 t52 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t26 t30 t84 t8 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Let me start by looking at the grammar. The start symbol S has two productions: `S -> NT45 NT81` and `S -> NT19 NT67`. So any string generated by S must start with either NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nWait, but the string starts with `t84 t30 t33...`, which are all terms. Since these are 't' followed by numbers, they might be the result of productions where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal. Let me check the productions for NT45 and NT19.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT45 -> NT60 NT77 and NT45 can also go to 't25'. Oh, right, NT45 -> NT60 NT77, and another way is NT45 -> 't25'. Similarly, NT19 can produce NT84 NT8 and also 't47'. Hmm, so for the first part, maybe the string starts with NT45 which leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, the string starts with t84 t30 t33. Let's see: T84 could be NT45, which can produce 't25' or lead to NT60 NT77. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to break down the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the string can be broken down into a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, perhaps it's better to work backwards, using the reverse of the grammar. That is, construct a parse tree starting from the string and seeing if it can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try that. Let's take the string:\n\nt84 t30 t33 t71 t76 t84 t28 t47 t77 t47 t30 t33 t42 t49 t59 t84 t30 t42 t11 t14 t25 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t33 t71 t52 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t26 t30 t84 t8 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to represent the string as a list of symbols. Each symbol is a terminal, which could be 't' followed by a number, or maybe the numbers are just part of the notation but in the context of the productions, the non-terminals are actually specific symbols.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see some non-terminals like NT45, NT19, etc., and some terminals which are like 't25', which I interpret as 't' followed by 25. So each non-terminal expansion either results in a string of non-terminals or a terminal like 't25'.\n\nBut the input string seems to just list 't's followed by numbers, but perhaps these are the terminals. So, for example, t84 is a terminal, which in the grammar corresponds to NT45 producing 't25'? Wait, not exactly. Because the productions are NT45 -> NT60 NT77 or 't25'. So NT45 can produce either NT60 NT77 (another non-terminal combination) or the terminal 't25'. Similarly, other non-terminals have such options.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, each matching a terminal in the grammar (like 't1', 't2', etc.). So each 't' number must correspond to a production that directly gives that terminal.\n\nWait, for example, 't84' corresponds to a non-terminal that can produce it directly. Let me check the grammar: Looking at the productions, I see NT45 -> 't25', but is there a production for 't84'? Looking through the grammar, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the list.\n\nLooking at NT84: Hmm, no, in the given productions, I don't see NT40 or others leading to 't84'. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see NT44 -> 't76', NT45 -> 't25', NT19 -> 't47', NT75 -> 't32', etc. There's an NT52 -> 't71' and a NT44 -> 't76'. So maybe 't84' is not directly a terminal, but perhaps it's part of a non-terminal chain.\n\nWait, this might get confusing. Let me perhaps represent the string as a list:\n\nSymbols: t84, t30, t33, t71, t76, t84, t28, t47, t77, t47, t30, t33, t42, t49, t59, t84, t30, t42, t11, t14, t25, t47, t49, t84, t76, t30, t33, t71, t52, t47, t13, t49, t84, t76, t26, t30, t84, t8, t49, t30, t11, t82, t5.\n\nHmm, I need to see if this can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the method of working from the string backwards. So, starting from the end, try to find a non-terminal that can produce the last symbol, then move left, etc.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, let me see whether the entire string can be generated by one of the productions starting from S.\n\nS can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the first two symbols after S must come from NT45 and NT81, or NT19 and NT67.\n\nLooking at the input string, it starts with t84, t30, etc. Let me think: if S -> NT45 NT81, then the first symbol should be from NT45's expansion, and the second from NT81's.\n\nSo, looking at the input, first symbol is t84. What can expand to t84? Looking through the productions, I don't see a direct production for t84. Wait, but perhaps there's a non-terminal that can produce t84 as a part of a chain. For example, NT44 has a production NT44 -> 't76', NT44 also can produce NT83 NT7, which is a terminal or non-terminal. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the individual symbols. Let me see if each 't' in the string corresponds to a production's terminal output.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first symbol is t84. Looking for a non-terminal that can produce t84. But in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal with a production ending in 't84'. For example, NT71 -> 't52' or 't13', etc. So perhaps 't84' is not a direct terminal but part of a non-terminal chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input string is not formed correctly, as some terminals don't appear in any production.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking for productions that have terminals as outputs. NT5 -> 't9', NT7 -> 't11', NT83 -> 't30', NT27 -> 't35', NT23 -> 't14', etc. So, 't84' does not appear directly; so perhaps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-817","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. I remember that Chomsky normal form helps simplify parsing because each production is quite restricted.\n\nThe string to evaluate is long, and each part seems to be a series of terminals like 't' followed by numbers. First, I'll try to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t82 t3 t13 t13 t49 t84 t59 t13 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t30 t33 t71 t76 t84 t28 t47 t77 t47 t49 t84 t59 t13 t14 t84 t8 t82 t3 t8 t25 t49 t30 t11 t82 t5.\n\nI think I'll start by looking at the beginning of the string and trying to match the grammar rules.\n\nThe first symbol is t82. Looking at the grammar, I need to find which production leads to 't82'. Scanning the productions, I see that NT81 \u2192 t71 and NT81 also has other productions, but I'm more focused on terminals. Wait, looking through the productions, I notice NT81 has a production to 't30' (like NT81 \u2192 NT44 \u2192 't76' maybe?), but actually, I see NT84 \u2192 't84' and NT84 \u2192 NT44 \u2192 't59'. Hmm, but wait, the string starts with t82. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT75 \u2192 NT23 NT45 and another production for NT75 \u2192 NT72 NT5. But in the string, the first symbol is t82. Scanning all the productions, I see that some non-terminals directly expand to terminals. For example, NT36 \u2192 t42, NT81 \u2192 t71, NT45 \u2192 t60, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each production for terminals.\n\nLooking through all productions, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t9 t53 \u2192 but I'm not sure if this is the case because NT5 has multiple productions, some leading to terminals. Wait, no, the grammar seems to have some productions where a non-terminal leads to a terminal. For example, NT45 \u2192 t60 t77 and then somewhere down the chain, but maybe not directly.\n\nWait, this might be a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to build the string from the top-down, starting with S. The start symbol is S, which can produce two different sequences:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, the string starts with either NT45 or NT19. The string starts with t82, which isn't directly reachable from NT19. Let me check NT19:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 (from the production NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8). Then, NT84 can go to t84 or other non-terminals. Hmm, so perhaps the string starts with t84 t8... but the first symbol is t82, which doesn't match. So maybe it's the other production of S.\n\nLet me check the second production of S: S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So, starting with NT19 and NT67. If the string starts with t82, perhaps NT19 can lead to 't82'? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT82 isn't directly a production. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me list all non-terminals and their productions to see which can expand to terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT53 \u2192 t30, NT47 \u2192 t84, NT75 \u2192 t72, etc. Wait, perhaps I should map each non-terminal to the terminals they can reach. Let me make a list:\n\n- NT45: can expand to t60 t77 (if it goes that route), but in other productions it expands to non-terminals. Similarly, NT75 expands to NT72 or NT5, which in turn go to other NTs or terminals. So perhaps I need to trace the chain.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to trace each production step by step. Let's start with the first symbol t82. I need to find a path from a non-terminal to 't82'. Looking through the productions, I see NT36 \u2192 t42, NT23 \u2192 t14, etc. Wait, is there any production that leads directly to t82? Hmm, in the given productions, I don't see any non-terminal leading directly to t82. For example, looking for NTn \u2192 t82.\n\nWait, I might have missed it. Let me scan all the productions for terminals. For example, looking for 't82', do any NT's have that as a direct production? Checking the productions:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT81 \u2192 t71\n- NT40 \u2192 t14 ...\nHold on, actually, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. The string starts with t82, but looking at the productions, I don't see any NT leading directly to t82. So maybe the string is invalid because the grammar can't produce t82 directly from any non-terminal.\n\nBut that can't be right because the string given includes t3, t13, etc., so maybe it's a longer expansion. Alternatively, maybe 't82' is part of a longer sequence that comes from a non-terminal expansion. Let me think: perhaps t82 is an intermediate step in the derivation.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, every expansion must go through non-terminals until they all resolve to terminals. So if the string starts with t82, there must be a non-terminal that expands directly to t82. But looking through the given productions, I can't find any NT \u2192 t82. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, the terminals are: t2, t5, t8, t11, t13, t22, t25, t27, t28, t30, t33, t36, t40, t44, t45, t47, t49, t53, t60, t71, t72, t75, t76, t77, t83, t84.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t82. Since the grammar's productions don't include a non-terminal that directly expands to 't82', it's impossible for the string to start with 't82'. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar because it starts with a terminal that isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps there's a non-terminal that eventually expands to t82 through a series of steps. Let me check one of the other non-terminals. For example, looking at NT45 \u2192 t60 t77. Then, NT60 \u2192 t30 t81, and NT81 \u2192 t71, etc. Hmm, not getting to t82. Or let's consider NT27 \u2192 t60 t47. Then NT60 \u2192 t30 t81, and NT81 \u2192 t71, which then goes to NT47 \u2192 t84. Hmm, not reaching t82.\n\nAlternatively, starting from NT36 \u2192 t42, but that doesn't help. So I think the conclusion is that since 't82' isn't a terminal in any of the NT productions, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Scanning through, I see some rules like S -> NT45 NT81, but some other rules have something like NT5 -> NT61 NT75, which is two non-terminals, and others like NT9 -> 't22', which is a terminal. So wait, some productions have two non-terminals, others have one non-terminal and a terminal? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, looking at the rules more carefully, I see that some of them have a single terminal, like NT5 -> NT9 NT53, which is two non-terminals, but others like NT9 -> 't22', which is a terminal. Hmm, so actually, the grammar seems to have productions that are either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, which isn't the standard Chomsky normal form. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is modified in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is in extended Chomsky normal form, allowing productions like A \u2192 aB or AB \u2192 CD, but in the given grammar, I see some rules have a mix of non-terminals and terminals on the left side, like NT9 -> 't22'. Oh, right! Some rules are for terminals. So the grammar includes both non-terminal to two non-terminals and non-terminal to a terminal. That's correct for Chomsky normal form. So in that case, some rules are for terminals, which means when generating the string, we can directly produce terminal symbols.\n\nSo, the string provided is a sequence of terminals, where each part is 't' followed by a number, except the initial 't' perhaps? Let's count the tokens: the string starts with 't82', then 't3', 't13', and so on. So each component seems to be a terminal symbol because none of the non-terminals in the string appear again except perhaps at the end, which I'll check later.\n\nThe string given is:\n\nt82 t3 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t3 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t30 t33 t71 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t77 t47 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t59 t13 t32 t84 t8 t25 t82 t71 t8 t82 t5.\n\nSo the length is quite long, with each token separated by space. Now, I need to generate this string by expanding the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar production rules. The start symbol is S, which starts with S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. So any string derived from S must consist of two parts, each derived from NT45, NT81 or NT19, NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that the end is ... t5. The only terminal that ends with 't5' is NT5 -> 't25'? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT53. Also, looking through, there's NT7 -> 't11', NT53 -> 't30', NT25 -> 't33', NT75 -> 't32', NT47 -> 't84', NT77 -> 't8', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, the string ends with 't5', but in the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT ends with 't5' directly. Wait, looking at the given rules:\n\nI see NT9 -> 't22', NT5 -> NT9 NT53, but not 't5'. Wait, no: are there any rules where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal 't5'? Looking through:\n\n- NT4 -> 't83' (no)\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT33 -> 't71'\n- NT52 -> 't71'\n- NT30 -> 't82' (no)\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking at the rules again, I don't see any non-terminal directly mapping to 't5'. So if the string ends with 't5', that would require a production that directly emits 't5', but since I don't see that, then perhaps the string can't end with 't5'. So, wait, maybe 'No', but I'm not sure yet. Let's confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in noting the rules. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- Other non-terminals seem to map to some 't' with numbers, except for a few like NT9 -> 't22' and a few others.\n\nWait, I don't see 't5' being produced directly by any rule. So if the string ends with 't5', that's a problem because 't5' is not directly produced by any rule. Unless I missed a rule where a non-terminal emits 't5'. Let me go through all the rules again to make sure:\n\nLooking through the entire list:\n\n- NT9 -> 't22'\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8 (ends with 't8', so no)\n- NT45 -> NT60 NT77 (both non-terminals)\n- NT77 -> 't8' (so NT77 gives 't8')\n- NT84 -> 't77' and 't84' (some rules produce 't77' and 't84')\n- NT27 -> 't35' and such.\n\nWait, I'm not seeing any non-terminals that produce 't5'. So if the string ends with 't5', it's impossible because 't5' is not produced by any rule. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar. So the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-836","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's dive into this problem. Okay, so I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens ending with 't' followed by some numbers. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. It seems that each non-terminal symbol (like S, N, T) has productions that either expand into two other non-terminals or a terminal token followed by a number. But wait, looking closely, each production seems to be of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ or something like that, ending with a terminal token like 't' followed by a digit. Or some of them are just two NTs, but others have a mix. \n\nHmm, okay, so maybe each production for a non-terminal is of the form NTX \u2192 A B, where A and B can be either other NTs or a terminal and a number. The terminals seem to be in the form 'tN', where N is a digit. So each terminal is a 't' followed by a number from 2 to 84 or something like that. \n\nThe given string is a long sequence of these 't' followed by numbers. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, and looking at the productions, S can go to NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the first step is to see if the string starts with either 't45' 't81' or 't19' 't67'. \n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't84 t30 t33 t77 t30 t84 t8 t84 ...'. It starts with 't84', so that's a single token. None of the initial productions start with 't84', they all start with 't45' or 't19'. So that might be a problem. Wait, no, the productions for NTX may have 't's inside. Let me check the grammar rules more carefully. \n\nWait, the first production for S is S \u2192 NT45 NT81, meaning S expands into NT45 and NT81. So the first step in the parse would be to split the string into two parts, each corresponding to NT45 and NT81. But the string starts with 't84', which doesn't match either 't45' or 't19'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the initial symbol doesn't match. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Perhaps the non-terminals can derive into sequences that generate the terminals. Alternatively, perhaps the NT productions can break down further into terminals. But looking at the productions, for example, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, and NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, and NT81 \u2192 NT82... Hmm, maybe this can get into the terminal tokens. But the issue is that for the string to be generated, every 't' must be the result of some production step. \n\nWait, but the start symbol S is non-terminal. So the first step would be to expand S into two non-terminals. Each of those would then have to expand until they reach terminals. But if the first terminal in the string isn't from the start symbol's production, it can't be generated. So since S starts with NT45 and NT81, their expansions would produce sequences that might have 't45', 't81', or other terminals, but if the string starts with 't84', which isn't part of S's initial productions, then it's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see if the grammar can produce any terminal starting with 't84'. Looking through the productions, I see NT84, so maybe NT84 can expand into a terminal. Let me check the grammar. \n\nLooking for NT84 in the productions. Scanning through all the rules, I see NT84 \u2192 't8'. So NT84 can directly generate 't8'. But what about NT44 \u2192 't76'? Wait, but NT44 isn't an NT in the beginning, unless it's derived from somewhere. But in this case, the initial expansion from S doesn't include NT44 or anything that would lead to 't84' as the first token. \n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check the grammar rules again. S has two options: NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the first symbol of the generated string should be a terminal from NT45 or NT19. But the first token is 't84', which is neither 't45' nor 't19'. Therefore, the string cannot start with 't84' if the grammar only starts with 't45' or 't19'. \n\nSo, to conclude, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the initial part of the string doesn't match any production from S. Therefore, the answer is 'No'. But wait, maybe I'm missing some deeper expansion. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can derive into a longer sequence that starts with 't84' through some intermediate non-terminals. Let's see. Suppose S \u2192 NT45 NT81, and NT45 could expand into other non-terminals. If NT45 can derive into a terminal, then perhaps NT45 \u2192 ... \u2192 't84'. Is that possible? Let me check NT45's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT45 directly. Wait, yes, there is a production: NT44 \u2192 't76', NT36 \u2192 't42', etc. But NT45 is a non-terminal that has a production NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77. So NT45 would have to expand into NT60 and NT77. Wait, but I don't see NT60 or NT77 having terminal productions. Let me check:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, which then breaks down further, etc. Wait, perhaps these non-terminals eventually can produce terminals, but does any of them produce 't84'? Looking at the list, there's NT30 which has some rules, but not 't84'. Let me check NT84: yes, NT84 \u2192 't8'. So from NT84, you get 't8'. But NT45 can't reach NT84 directly or through its expansions, because NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, and NT60 \u2192 NT30 NT81, which then break into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think: each production for a non-terminal is either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a number. So NT45's production is NT60 NT77, which are both non-terminals. Then, each of those have their own productions. So NT60 can go to NT30 NT81, which go on to produce NT30, which goes to 't82' or something else. Wait, let me look at NT30. NT30 \u2192 't82' or other non-terminals? Looking at the productions:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't82' is not there. Wait, yes, there's NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT45. Hmm, so NT30 expands into NT9 and NT45. Then NT9 \u2192 NT36 NT45, and NT36 has a production \u2192 't42', but wait, NT36 has multiple productions, including NT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53, and also NT40 \u2192 't39', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to see if any of the non-terminals can produce 't84'. From the productions, NT84 \u2192 't8', so that's a direct terminal. But how do we get from S to 't84' as the first symbol? Since S starts with 't45' or 't19', which can't be 't84', it seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps through left recursion or some other expansion, but given the structure, I don't think any non-terminal except T (terminal?) leads to 't84' as the first symbol. \n\nSo, putting it all together, since the initial symbol S can only start the string with 't45' or 't19', and the given string starts with 't84', which isn't derivable from S, the answer must be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-856","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means that all the production rules are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLet me first recap the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, and the production rules for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT45 NT81\nS \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, the string starts with either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67. The input string is a series of terminals separated by spaces, so I need to parse this string by following the derivation steps until I determine if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t82 t30 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t30 t33 t71 t26 t30 t76 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t3 t14 t49 t76 t25 t47 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t76 t42 t11 t30 t25 t49 t76 t82 t5`.\n\nI think the approach here is to perform a top-down parsing, starting from the start symbol S and following the production rules until I derive the string. But since CNF has each production producing either two non-terminals or a single terminal, perhaps a recursive descent parser would work, trying each production until the string matches.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to match the production rules. But given the complexity, maybe I should look for the leftmost derivation path.\n\nI'll start by considering the two initial productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't82', so looking at the grammar, I need to find which non-terminals can produce 't82'. Let me see the productions that result in terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT44 \u2192 t76\nNT27 \u2192 t76\nNT36 \u2192 t42\nNT2 \u2192 t5\nNT53 \u2192 t30\nNT30 \u2192 t82\nNT40 \u2192 t39\nNT47 \u2192 t84\nNT76 \u2192 t8\nNT7 \u2192 t11\nNT39 \u2192 t28\nNT25 \u2192 t33\nNT49 \u2192 t49\nNT76 \u2192 t8\nWait, but t82 is the terminal. Looking at the rules, I spot:\n\nNT84 \u2192 t71\nNT30 \u2192 t82\nAlso, looking back, in the grammar, the rule NT30 \u2192 t82. Also, NT82's rule is not present, so it's a terminal itself perhaps. But in the grammar, I don't see any production for NT82. Wait, is it possible that 't82' is a terminal, so NT30 \u2192 't82'?\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT30 \u2192 't82', so that's a terminal production.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't82', which must come from NT30 \u2192 't82'. So, that would mean that in the first step of the derivation, the first symbol is from NT30.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then after S, we have NT45 and NT81. But the string starts with t82, which is from NT30. So that suggests that the initial production can't be S \u2192 NT45 NT81 because that would produce symbols from NT45 and NT81, not NT30. Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is the other production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the first symbol of t82 can come from a non-terminal that has a production leading to t82. So, if the first step is S \u2192 NT45 NT81, then NT45 could generate t82. So I need to check if NT45 can generate t82. Looking through the grammar rules, NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77 and NT45 \u2192 t71.\n\nWait, but that leads to t71, which isn't 't82'. Alternatively, is there any production for NT82?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nIn the grammar, I see the rule NT30 \u2192 't82'. So that's a terminal. So for S to start with t82, the entire string must start with NT30. So perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT45 NT81. But NT45 leads to another set of non-terminals, which may produce t82.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is S \u2192 NT19 NT67, as 't82' is in the middle of that string. Hmm, this requires a more thorough approach.\n\nLet me list the rules again to see which NTs can generate which terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT84 \u2192 't71'\nNT30 \u2192 't82'\nNT9 \u2192 several rules leading to 't22', 't26', etc. But 't82' comes directly from NT30.\n\nSo, to get 't82' as the first symbol, the first non-terminal must be NT30, which directly produces 't82' as a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the production for S, the only way for NT30 to be generated is if S \u2192 NT45 NT81, because S \u2192 NT19 NT67 doesn't have NT30 in it. So that must be the case.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n\nTherefore, the first step is S \u2192 NT45 NT81. Then the first symbol is from NT45 and the next is from NT81.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t82, which comes from NT30. So perhaps this isn't compatible. Because NT45 is the first non-terminal, so it should generate the first symbol t82. But looking at the grammar, NT45's productions are:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\nNT45 \u2192 't71'\n\nSo, to generate 't82', it's not directly possible from NT45. So that would mean that the initial production cannot be S \u2192 NT45 NT81 because the first symbol can't be generated from NT45. Hence, maybe I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\n- NT45 can produce 't71' via NT45 \u2192 't71'\n- Or, via NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77\n\nBut neither of these produce 't82'. So the only way to get 't82' is through NT30.\n\nSo, perhaps the entire string is starting with NT30, which is only possible if S \u2192 NT30 ... but the only productions of S are S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Neither of these involve NT30. So maybe it's impossible to derive 't82' at the beginning, meaning the string cannot be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait, let's make sure. So, S \u2192 NT45 NT81, meaning the first step would produce a string consisting of the first production of NT45 and the first production of NT81. Each of these could be non-terminals that generate parts of the string.\n\nBut in our case, the first symbol is 't82', which must come from NT30. However, since neither of the initial productions of S produce a NT30, it's impossible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm skipping steps. Maybe within the derivation, some intermediate NTs can produce NT30. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the rules, does any NT eventually lead to NT30? Let's see.\n\nFor example, looking at NT45, it can produce 't71' or other NTs. NT71 \u2192 NT12 NT84, and NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13. NT40 \u2192 NT14 NT71. Hmm, but does it ever lead to NT30?\n\nLooking further, perhaps another path. Let's see if any NT eventually leads to NT30, then 't82' can be a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT84 NT53\nNT53 \u2192 't30'\n\nSo, NT53 can produce 't30'. Let's see what other NTs lead to NT53.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce NT53:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT76 \u2192 't8', NT75 \u2192 't32', etc. Hmm"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

And the string to check is:\n\nt82 t30 t13 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t3 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t32 t25 t25 t25 t25 t82 t5\n\nOkay, so each token is a component, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I notice that S can derive two different NT sequences: NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So the string must start with either of these combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t82. Looking at the grammar, I see that some NTs can derive terminals. Let's see which ones.\n\nFrom the grammar, terminal productions (where the right-hand side is a 't' followed by a number) are:\n\nNT45 -> 't25'\nNT77 -> 't8'\nNT84 -> 't77'\nNT39 -> 't28'\nNT13 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't11'\nNT36 -> 't42'\nNT81 -> 't71'\nNT44 -> 't76'\nNT27 -> 't35'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT53 -> 't30'\nNT30 -> 't82'\nNT9 -> 't26'\nNT40 -> 't39'\nNT12 -> 't3'\nNT8 -> 't83'\nNT47 -> 't84'\nNT75 -> 't32'\nNT44 -> 't59'\nNT52 -> 't71'\nNT22 -> 't22'\nNT23 -> 't14'\nNT71 -> 't52'\nNT50 -> 't49'\nNT83 -> 't30'\nNT27 -> 't76'\nNT22 -> 't42'\nNT25 -> 't33'\nNT61 -> 't13'\n\nSo, for example, NT30 can derive t82. So, t82 appears in the string, and it must come from NT30.\n\nSimilarly, let's see where t30 comes from. NT30 is a non-terminal and can only be derived by certain productions. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT30 -> 't82' (from above)\nIs there any other production for NT30? Let me check: looking through the productions, I see NT30 -> 't82' is one option, and earlier in the list, there's another NT30 -> 't3 t30 t3'? Wait, no, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT30, there's:\n\nNT30 -> 't82'\nAnd also, in some other productions, for example:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT30 -> NT9 NT45 (earlier in the list)\nNT9 -> 't26'\nNT45 -> 't25'\n\nOh wait, but that would make NT30 derive t26 t25, which would be 't26 t25', but in the string, we have t82 followed by more tokens. Hmm, so there might be multiple ways for a non-terminal to derive a terminal string.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by looking at the parsing tree or the derivation steps. Since the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the string can be broken down into a series of terminals and non-terminals that must reduce to terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps using a top-down or bottom-up approach would help. But since the string is fairly long, maybe it's better to see if there's a pattern or to check if the productions allow for certain sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be more systematic. Let me recall how CYK works. It's a dynamic programming algorithm that determines if a string can be generated by a CFG by maintaining a table where each cell (i,j) represents whether the substring from position i to j can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nBut this requires a lot of steps, and given that the given grammar has a lot of non-terminals and the string is long, this might be time-consuming. However, maybe I can spot some patterns or see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to try to write out a possible derivation starting from S. Let's look at the string again:\n\nt82 t30 t13 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t30 t3 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t13 t32 t25 t25 t25 t25 t82 t5\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. Let's suppose it's NT45 and NT81.\n\nNow, looking at the first part of the string, it starts with t82. From the grammar, I saw that NT30 can produce t82. So, perhaps NT81"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, so I need to go through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it makes parsing and analysis more straightforward.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions from S are:\n\n- S -> NT45 NT81\n- S -> NT19 NT67\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with the results of these productions. That means the first part of the string should be a combination of the expansions of NT45 and NT81, or NT19 and NT67.\n\nNext, I look at the string to be evaluated:\n\n`t82 t3 t13 t30 t82 t30 t84 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t30 t39 t47 t49 t84 t76 t30 t39 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t42 t11 t30 t82 t3 t8 t82 t3 t8 t84 t8 t82 t5`\n\nThis string has a series of terminals. My goal is to see if each of these terminals can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the start symbol is S and it has two productions, the string must be split into parts that match either S -> NT45 NT81 or S -> NT19 NT67. Let's consider the first part.\n\nAssuming S uses the first production, NT45 and NT81 need to generate the corresponding parts of the string. Alternatively, if it uses the second production, NT19 and NT67 would generate the string.\n\nI'll start by examining the first few tokens to see which part of the string could come from which non-terminals.\n\nThe first token is t82. Looking at the grammar, I check which productions can derive t82.\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't22', 't26', 't39', 't47', etc.\nWait, looking through the items, I see specific productions ending with terminals. For example, NT81 -> 't30', NT77 -> 't8', etc.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nTerminals in the string: t82, t3, t13, t30, t82, t30, t84, t84, t28, t47, t49, t84, t76, t30, t84, t84, t84, t28, t47, t30, t39, t47, t49, t84, t76, t30, t39, t47, t13, t49, t84, t30, t11, t42, t11, t30, t82, t3, t8, t82, t3, t8, t84, t8, t82, t5.\n\nSo each terminal appears in specific productions. Let me note which NT productions result in each terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar, possible mappings:\n\n- 't5' comes from NT53\n- 't25' from NT84\n- 't30' from NT44 or NT36 (since looking: NT44 -> 't76' and NT36 -> 't42' but also NT40->'t39', etc.)\nWait, let me make a proper list.\n\nLooking through the items:\n\n- NT5 -> 't26' (from NT5 -> NT9 NT53; but 9->t22, 53->t30.

{"custom_id":"request-895","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions that are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Oh wait, but looking at the given grammar, I see some rules like S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. Wait, these look more like S \u2192 NT45 NT81, which is replacing S with two non-terminals, each starting with NT. Interesting.\n\nThe string we need to check is `t82 t30 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t84 t84 t84 t28 t47 t30 t33 t71 t26 t32 t47 t49 t84 t76 t49 t42 t49 t76 t30 t49 t30 t11 t25 t84 t8 t82 t5`.\n\nWait, let me count the tokens here. It's a series of 't' followed by numbers, each separated by spaces. So I have a list of production steps that generate this string. Each production in the grammar either introduces a terminal or breaks down into smaller non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to simulate the derivations starting from the start symbol S and see if we can reach the given string through a series of expansions. But considering the size of the string and the complexity of the grammar, this might get quite involved. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a top-down parser or using memoization could help, but that might be time-consuming. Another idea is to look for the structure of the string and see if it matches the rules defined in the grammar.\n\nWait, let's look at the start symbol. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT45 NT81 or S \u2192 NT19 NT67. So any derivation starts with either NT45 followed by NT81 or NT19 followed by NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t82. So I need to find a production chain that eventually produces t82. Let's check the rules where non-terminals lead to terminals.\n\nI notice that NT82 isn't a rule, but t82 is directly reachable from other rules. Looking at the production rules, I see NT45 \u2192 t60, t77, etc. Wait, but are there any rules that directly lead to t82? Let me check.\n\nLooking down the list: \n\n- NT81 \u2192 t71\n- NT84 \u2192 t77\n- NT39 \u2192 t28\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT22 \u2192 t42\n- NT23 \u2192 t14\n- NT14 \u2192 t25\n- NT50 \u2192 t49\n- NT45 \u2192 t60, t50, and so on.\nWait, I don't see a rule that directly leads to t82. Hmm, this is confusing because t82 is in the string, but if there's no production rule that directly creates t82, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rules. Let me check again. The rules for NT82? No, in the given grammar, I don't see any rule where NT82 is a non-terminal step. So, if t82 is in the string, it must be somehow derived from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT53 \u2192 t30. But perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see: Do any non-terminals produce t82? Looking through the list:\n\n- NT82 is not present as a left-hand side, so no rule directly produces t82.\n\nHmm, so if the string contains t82, but there's no production rule that generates it, that would mean the string can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the NT84 \u2192 t77 and other rules could eventually lead to t82 through a chain. Wait, no, NT84 doesn't produce t82. Let me check NT73, which doesn't exist. Wait, looking at the rules again, I don't see any path that leads to t82 from any non-terminal.\n\nTherefore, since t82 is present in the string but there's no production rule that can produce it, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the terminal 't82', but none of the non-terminals in the grammar directly produce 't82'.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar has several non-terminals (like S, NT5, NT0, etc.) and terminals (like 't25', 't77', etc.). Each production rule either splits a non-terminal into two other non-terminals or into a terminal. My goal is to see if the string can be derived step by step by expanding the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is long and consists of a sequence of terminal symbols: `t82 t71 t30 t84...` and so on. I'll need to break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol S. The productions for S are NT45 NT81 and NT19 NT67. So S can be broken into either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67. Let me consider both possibilities.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part starts with 't82'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't82'. Looking at the rules, NT30 can produce 't82' (since NT30 -> 't82'). Also, NT60 can produce 't84' and 't77' and 't45' but not directly 't82'.

So the first symbol 't82' must come from NT30. Now, looking at the possible S productions, which ones can reach NT30 in their chain.\n\nWait, let's look at the productions that involve NT30. For example, NT45 has a production NT45 -> NT60 NT77, but also NT45 -> 't25' (from line 15: NT45 -> 't25').

Let me check each possibility.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT45 NT81.\n\nNow, NT45 has several productions. Let's see: NT45 can produce NT60 NT77, or 't25' (from line 16: NT45 -> 't25'). So for the first part of the string, 't82' comes from NT30, but in this case, expanding S as NT45 NT81, I need to see if NT45 and NT81 can produce something that leads to 't82'.\n\nWait, but S is S = NT45 NT81. So each of these non-terminals will produce a string. So the entire string is produced by NT45 followed by NT81.\n\nIf the string starts with 't82', which is from NT30, then perhaps NT45 must produce a part that includes 't82', but looking at NT45's productions, NT45 can produce 't25' directly, but not 't82'. Alternatively, NT45 can produce NT60 NT77, so maybe NT60 and NT77 can help.\n\nWait, let's explore this. If S -> NT45 NT81, then NT45 could be NT60 NT77. Then NT60 can produce 't84' and 't71', etc. Hmm, but getting 't82' would require NT45 to somehow generate a part that results in 't82', but from NT45's rules, the only terminal is 't25'. So perhaps this path won't get us 't82' as the first symbol.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT19 NT67.\n\nNow, NT19 has a production NT19 -> NT84 NT84 (from line 7: NT19 can be NT84 NT84). So the first part of the string would be 't84' coming from NT19, which is from NT84 NT84. Then the second part is NT67, which can produce 't30' directly (from line 9: NT67 -> 't30').\n\nWait, that's promising because the first symbol is 't84'. So let's check: S -> NT19 NT67.\n\nNT19: NT84 NT84.\n\nNT84 has rules like NT84 -> NT36 NT84 (from line 4: NT84 -> NT36 NT84), or NT36 NT53 (line 5), or NT60 NT77 (line 14), etc. So we need a way to get 't82' as the first symbol.\n\nBut from NT84, I don't immediately see a production that gives 't82'. Alternatively, NT84 can produce NT36 NT84, which could potentially lead to other symbols.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake because the first symbol is 't82' which comes from NT30. So in the case of S -> NT19 NT67, we have NT19 becoming NT84 NT84, which would produce 't84' as the first symbol, but our string starts with 't82', so that's a conflict. Therefore, this path can't be correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to see if 't82' can be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the list of productions, NT30 can produce 't82' (from line 30: NT30 -> 't82'). So the only way to get 't82' is from NT30. So in the string, the first symbol is 't82', which must come from NT30. Therefore, the entire string starts with a production of NT30.\n\nSo perhaps I need to see where S can lead to NT30. Looking at all the productions, none of the S rules produce NT30 directly. Let's look for which non-terminals can produce NT30.\n\nLooking for NT30's productions, I see:\n\nIn line 3: NT30 -> 't82'.\nIn line 30: ??? Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, line 30 is actually \"NT30 -> 't82'\", so it's as I said. Other lines refer to other non-terminals, like NT22, but not NT30.\n\nWait, actually, let me list all productions for NT30 to confirm:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, yes, line 30 is NT30 -> 't82'.\n\nSo how can we get to NT30? Let's see.\n\nAnother look: perhaps another non-terminal can produce NT30. For example, NT60's productions: from line 6, NT60 can produce NT30 NT84 or NT45 NT81. So if a non-terminal A can produce NT60, which then can be followed by NT30, which can produce 't82'.\n\nSo S can produce NT60 if one of the options is available. Looking at S's productions, S can produce NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. If one of these, say NT19 can produce NT60, then that would allow S to produce a path to NT30.\n\nBut looking at NT19's rules: NT19 -> NT84 NT84 (line 7). So NT19 can't directly produce NT60. Let's check NT84: NT84 can produce NT36 NT84 (line 4), or NT60 NT77 (line 14). So NT84 can produce NT60.\n\nSo if we have a production where a non-terminal produces NT84 followed by NT60, then possibly we can reach NT30.\n\nBut this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't82', which is NT30. So the first production must be NT30 -> 't82'. Therefore, the entire string starts from a production of NT30, but the start symbol S doesn't directly produce NT30. So perhaps the string is a concatenation of two NT30 productions? No, because the start symbol S splits into two non-terminals, which are then expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation of NT30 and NTsomething else? Let's see the structure.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't82 t71 t30',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-917","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem to solve. I'm supposed to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let's give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the grammar consists of. The grammar starts with S and has productions that break S down into various combinations of NTs and terminals (which are the 't' followed by numbers). Each production seems to be two non-terminals on the left, and on the right, either more non-terminals or terminating in lowercase t's and numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these lowercase symbols. Let me list them out to get a clearer picture: t82, t30, t30, t33, t42, t11, t84, t30, t49, t77, t30, t25, t30, t3, t49, t84, t30, t11, t49, t77, t30, t82, t71, t8, t30, t84, t8, t47, t30, t3, t49, t84, t59, t13, t13, t49, t84, t30, t11, t77, t30, t25, t30, t49, t76, t25, t82, t5.\n\nWow, that's a lot. I think I'll need to parse the string into its components and see if the grammar can produce it. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nSo, the string is all terminals, and I need to see if there's a way the grammar can generate it through the leftmost derivation. Since it's a binary grammar, each production on the left splits into two, and each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one.\n\nGiven the size of the string, it's probably going to require a lot of steps. I wonder if there's a better way than manually simulating each step, maybe some pattern recognition or looking for substructures.\n\nLet me start by noticing some of the terminals in the string. The first symbol is t82. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals can produce t82. For example:\n\n- NT22 -> t22 (Wait, no, NT22 -> t22? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce t followed by a number. Let me find all the productions that start with t.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here's what I find:\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT53 -> 't30'\nNT81 -> 't71'\nNT27 -> 't76'\nNT25 -> 't33'\nNT82 -> 't62'? Wait, no. Looking through, I see:\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let me scan again:\n\nLooking for any NTs that produce a 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT9 -> 't26' (Wait, NT9? Oh, no NT9, looking back.\n\nWait, let me go through each production:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\n\n... (various productions)\n\nThen looking for NTs or other non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\nNT36 -> 't42' \n\nSo NT36 can produce t42.\n\nOther productions:\n\nNT27 -> 't76'\n\nNT22 -> 't22'\n\nNT53 -> 't30'\n\nNT71 -> 't52' (Wait, 't52' is a terminal? No, wait, in the provided grammar, the productions for NT71 include -> 't52'?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there are several entries where NTs produce terminal strings. Let me go through all of them:\n\n- NT27 -> 't76' (so NT27 produces t76)\n- NT22 -> 't22' (so NT22 produces t22)\n- NT53 -> 't30' (so NT53 produces t30)\n- NT71 -> 't52' (so NT71 produces t52)\n- NT89, wait no. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through each line:\n\nAt the end of the grammar, towards the bottom, there are multiple lines. I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't26'\n\nNT13 -> 't47'\n\nNT71 -> 't52'\n\nNT52 -> 't71' \n\nWait, but does any NT produce a t followed by something else? Let me make sure.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- NT19 -> NT84 NT8\n\nWait, the right-hand side is NT84 and NT8. NT8 is a terminal because in the grammar we see NT8 -> t83, but wait, no. Wait, in the given grammar, NT8 is a terminal. Wait, I'm getting confused now.\n\nNo, in the grammar, when an NT is listed as 'a', it's a terminal. So for example, 't30' is a terminal.\n\nWait, but let me re-examine the grammar for any NTs that produce terminal strings directly:\n\nLooking through all lines, I see that several NTs produce terminal symbols:\n\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT71 -> 't52'\n- Also, NT81 -> 't71' (wait, looking back, the grammar says NT81-> 't71'? Or is it something else?)\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking for any line that has NTx -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- S -> NT45 NT81: Both NTs are non-terminals.\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT53: Both non-terminals.\n- NT53 -> 't30'\n- NT36 -> 't42'\n- NT71 -> 't52'\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT27 -> 't76'\n- NT25 -> 't33'\n- NT81 -> 't71' (Wait, no. Let me check: NT81 -> 't71'? Or is it another production?)\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, the line for NT81 is:\n\nNT81 -> 't71'\n\nSo NT81 can produce 't71' as a terminal. Similarly, NT22 -> 't22', etc.\n\nSo the direct terminals in the grammar are:\n\n- t22 (from NT22)\n- t25 (from NT25)\n- t33 (from NT25)\n- t30 (from NT53)\n- t36 (from NT36)\n- t42 (from NT36)\n- t52 (from NT71)\n- t71 (from NT81)\n\nWait, but the grammar also has other non-terminals that produce more non-terminals, which in turn produce terminals.\n\nSo the string has a lot of these t's, but I need to see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model this as a parsing problem. Given that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals, so the derivation is done by breaking the string down into pairs of symbols, each pair matching a production.\n\nWait, but the problem is the string is quite long, so doing this manually would take forever. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to break it down recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken into parts that correspond to each production step.\n\nBut let me try to see if the string can be divided into sections where each section is derived from a single non-terminal.\n\nLet me list the entire string again:\n\nt82 t30 t30 t33 t42 t11 t84 t30 t49 t77 t30 t25 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t49 t77 t30 t82 t71 t8 t30 t84 t8 t47 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t13 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t77 t30 t25 t30 t49 t76 t25 t82 t5.\n\nThat's a lot. Let me start with the first symbol: t82.\n\nFrom the grammar, I know that some NTs produce t82. Let's look for NTs that have t82 in their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\n- Do any NTs produce 't82'?\n\nLooking for any line ending with 't82', I don't see any.

{"custom_id":"request-922","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal. First, I'll look at the string and the grammar to see if there's a pattern or a way to break down the string into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: `t84 t30 t3 t30 t3 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t3 t30 t33 t71 t42 t11 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t30 t39 t47 t13 t49 t84 t76 t22 t11 t30 t49 t30 t11 t25 t47 t49 t84 t30 t11 t42 t49 t59 t30 t25 t25 t82 t5`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice a lot of `NTx` symbols that eventually lead to terminals starting with 't'. Each terminal corresponds to a number like 't8', 't25', etc. The non-terminals seem to expand into combinations of other non-terminals and eventually into these terminals.\n\nI'll start by trying to split the string into segments that correspond to the top-level productions. The grammar has two options for S: `S -> NT45 NT81` and `S -> NT19 NT67`. So the string should be a combination of parts generated by NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67.\n\nLet me check if the string starts with something that could be NT45 or NT19. Looking at the first few tokens: `t84 t30 t3 t30 t3 t49...`. Since NT45 expands into 't60' and 't77', which are terminals, let's see if the first part could be generated by NT45.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT45's production is `NT45 -> NT60 NT77`. From the string, after 't84', we have 't30', which is likely 't30', so that's consistent with NT45's first step. Then 't3' could be NT60, which can further produce 't30' and 't84', as in `NT60 -> NT30 NT84`. That would fit the first few tokens as `t84 t30 t3 t30 t3...` aligning with `t30 t84` in NT60. Then 't49' could be from NT77, which is a terminal 't76' from NT77's production: `NT77 -> 't8'`? Wait, no, looking at the rules, `NT77 -> 't8'`? Wait, no: Checking the grammar, `NT77 -> 't8'`? Wait, no, the grammar provided shows:\n\nLooking back: the grammar has `NT77 -> 't8'`? Wait no, let me check the given grammar:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar rules, and I think I might have misread. Let me scan through them:\n\nLooking for NT45 and NT77: Oh, I see:\n\n`NT36 -> NT84 NT53`  \n`NT39 -> 't28'`  \n`NT40 -> NT14 NT71`  \n...  \n`NT45 -> NT60 NT77`  \nSo `NT45 -> NT60 NT77`. And NT77 is a terminal? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT77 isn't directly expanded. Looking again: I don't see NT77 being expanded into a terminal. Let me check the rules. I see `NT77 -> 't8'`? Wait, no. Let's go through the entire list:\n\nNo, looking through all the rules provided, I see that NT77 is actually NT77 is not present as a non-terminal that expands to a terminal. Wait, looking for 't77' as a terminal: I see that `NT45 -> 't77'`? No, looking again.\n\nWait, actually, wait: The initial response from the user provides a list of production rules. For example, `NT45 -> NT60 NT77` and `NT36 -> NT84 NT53`, etc. Then, towards the end, the user lists several terminals:\n\nFor example, `NT45 -> 't25'`? No, looking back:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\n`NT5 -> 't36'`? Wait, no, the grammar ends with rules like `NT45 -> 't76'`, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should make a list of all terminal symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string by trying to match the grammar step by step. Starting with S, which can be either NT45 and NT81 or NT19 and NT67. Let's check both cases.\n\nFirst option: S = NT45 NT81.\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77.\n\nSo the first part would be NT45 expanding into NT60 and NT77.\n\nNT60 -> NT30 NT84.\n\nSo now, we have NT30 and NT84. Looking at the string, the first few tokens are `t84 t30 t3...` which can be matched as `t84` (from NT84), then `t30` (from NT30), then `t3` (which would need to be NT60 again, perhaps). Wait, but NT60 -> NT30 NT84, so the first two tokens would correspond to NT30 and NT84.\n\nSo the string starts with `t84 t30`, which is the reverse of NT60. So that's correct. Then the next token is `t3`. But NT60 produces `t30 t84`, so the next would be `t30 t84`, but in the string, after `t30`, it's `t3`. That doesn't match immediately. So maybe this is a different path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after NT45 -> NT60 NT77, the next step is to parse `t84` from NT77. Wait, no: NT45 is followed by NT81. So after expanding NT45, we have NT81, which in turn is a production. Let's see NT81's productions: Checking the grammar, `NT81 -> 't71'`? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, `NT81 -> NT30 NT2` and `NT2 -> 't5'`. Wait, no, perhaps I should list the rules for each NT symbol.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at each possible expansion and see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nLet me start by considering the initial production S -> NT45 NT81. So to generate the string, it should first come from NT45 and NT81. Let's check NT45 and NT81.\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77.\n\nNT81 -> NT30 NT2.\n\nSo NT45's expansion gives us NT60 and NT77, and NT81 gives us NT30 and NT2.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first part is `t84 t30 t3...`.

{"custom_id":"request-934","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The right-hand side of each production has either two non-terminals or one terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process and also makes it easier to determine whether a string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, let's note the production rules. It seems all the rules either combine two non-terminals or a non-terminal to a single terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT75, which is two non-terminals on the right, and S \u2192 NT45 NT81, which is two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t84 t30 t33 t71 t22 t11 t30 t35 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t30 t11 t30 t33 t42 t11 t84 t30 t49 t49 t49 t77 t30 t49 t76 t32 t47 t13 t49 t84 t30 t11 t42 t11 t30 t84 t8 t49 t30 t11 t47 t14 t49 t59 t82 t5`.\n\nEach part separated by a space is a terminal symbol. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols (either terminals or non-terminals). So, each non-terminal expansion increases the length of the string by one, starting from the number of non-terminals in the left-hand side of the production.\n\nThe starting symbol is S. Looking at the productions for S, we have:\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT81\n- S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, S can expand into two non-terminals. Then each of those can expand further. The given string starts with t84, which is a terminal. I need to see what non-terminals can produce t84.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT45 \u2192 t60 t77, NT75 \u2192 t72 t5, NT77 \u2192 t8, etc. But I also see NT45 \u2192 t25, because one of the production rules is NT45 \u2192 't45'. Wait, no, actually, scanning the given rules:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there's a rule like NT45 \u2192 't44'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, yes, there's NT45 \u2192 't44' for one of the rules. And also, NT45 \u2192 't60 NT77' in another production. Hmm, no, looking again, I see that NT45 is also present in some rules as 't44' and other rules where it's not a terminal. Wait, looking more carefully:\n\nFor example, NT45 appears in rules like S \u2192 NT45 NT81 and also NT45 \u2192 t60 NT77, but there's another rule: NT45 \u2192 't44'. Similarly, NT84 has a rule \u2192 t8.\n\nWait, but looking again, in the given rules, I see multiple entries:\n\nLooking for NT45: There's a rule NT45 \u2192 't60 NT77', another NT45 \u2192 't60 NT77' in different lines, and also NT45 \u2192 't44' as a production. Hmm, but that can't be right because a non-terminal can't have two production rules leading to a terminal and a combination. Wait, perhaps I misread the rules.\n\nWait, in the given rules, the lines are:\n\nFor example, line by line:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't60' NT77\n...\nNT44 \u2192 't76' N...\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the production rules for terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, to save time, perhaps it's better to check whether the string can be broken down into parts that match the terminals in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the grammar as a series of possibilities and see if the string can be parsed step by step.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to think about how the string can be generated by the grammar. Each terminal in the string must come from the end of a production. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step adds two symbols, but the string is given, so we need to see if it can be generated by expanding non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them, then see if the non-terminals can be linked in a way that forms the given string.\n\nBut maybe a step-by-step approach would be better.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with t84. So, the first token is t84. Now, in the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t84 as part of their derivation? Looking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t8\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- NT75 \u2192 t72 t5\n- NT45 \u2192 t60 t77\n- NT84 \u2192 t77\n- NT45 \u2192 t44\n- NT84 \u2192 t30\n- NT39 \u2192 t28\n- NT13 \u2192 t47\n- NT71 \u2192 t52\n- NT50 \u2192 t49\n- NT44 \u2192 t76\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT22 \u2192 t42\n- NT71 \u2192 t52\n- NT13 \u2192 t47\n- NT9 \u2192 t22\n- NT12 \u2192 t3\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- NT84 \u2192 t8\n- NT36 \u2192 t42\n- NT53 \u2192 t30\n- NT30 \u2192 t82\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT23 \u2192 t14\n- NT71 \u2192 t52\n- NT50 \u2192 t49\n- NT83 \u2192 t30\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT22 \u2192 t42\n- NT25 \u2192 t33\n- NT61 \u2192 t13\n- NT75 \u2192 t32\n- NT44 \u2192 t59\n\nWait, so looking for t84 as a terminal, it can come from NT47 or NT84.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t84. So, the first non-terminal must derive to t84. Let's consider possibilities: either NT47 or NT84.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT47: There is NT47 \u2192 t84.\n\nFor NT84, it has production: NT84 \u2192 't8'. Wait, no, looking again, I see:\n\nNT84 \u2192 't84' somewhere?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking at the production list:\n\nWait, let me re-examine. The productions include:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- NT84 \u2192 t8\n\nWait, so NT84 can produce t8, not t84. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the production rules where the right-hand side includes a terminal:\n\nLooking for terminals in the productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t22, t14, t71, t9, t45, etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 t11\n- NT36 \u2192 t33, t35, t42, t76, t27, t22, t25\n- NT8 \u2192 t83\n- NT10 \u2192 t50\n- NT30 \u2192 t82\n- NT40 \u2192 t14\n- NT9 \u2192 t26, t22, t47\n- NT44 \u2192 t76, t44 (multiple rules)\n- NT27 \u2192 t76\n- NT22 \u2192 t42, t11, t30\n- NT23 \u2192 t14\n- NT45 \u2192 t60, t44\n- NT61 \u2192 t53, t12\n- NT81 \u2192 t71, t30, t84, t30, etc.\n\nSo, in the given string, the first symbol is t84. Now, looking at the production rules, which non-terminals can produce t84:\n\nFrom the list above, NT47 \u2192 t84.\n\nAlso, NT84 \u2192 t8?

{"custom_id":"request-939","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and it can produce two other symbols: NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67. So each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals eventually leads to terminal symbols, which are things like 't1', 't2', etc., or numbers like NT1, NT2, etc.\n\nNow, looking at the string I need to evaluate: `t82 t3 t30 t33 t71 t49 t42 t49 t76 t32 t47 t30 t33 t71 t26 t30 t82 t30 t84 t84 t28 t47 t49 t84 t59 t22 t11 t30 t84 t8 t47 t49 t84 t59 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t59 t13 t14 t25 t84 t8 t84 t8 t82 t5`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. My goal is to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S using the provided productions.\n\nSince this is a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and each non-terminal eventually expands into terminal symbols.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the start, working from the left, applying the grammar rules step by step. Since it's a tree structure, I might look for possible ways the string can be generated, maybe starting from the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to see if the string can be broken down into sequences that match any of the productions given. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation is a common method, so let's try that.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT45 NT81 or NT19 NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t82. Let's check if t82 is directly produced by any non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT81 -> t30, but that's a production from NT81, but t82 is not directly there. Wait, looking through the list:\n\nI see NT81 is present, and maybe it produces t30, but t82 isn't directly a terminal. Hmm. Let me check all the productions again.\n\nWait, I see that NT81 -> 't71' and also appears in some productions like NT13 -> t47 and others. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT81 -> 't30' and 't30' is also present in some places. Not seeing a direct 't82' production. Wait, let me go through all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that NT81 can produce 't30', and 't30' occurs in the string, but not as part of the first few symbols.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions to confirm:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT45 -> 't25' (line 20)\nNT77 -> 't8' (line 21)\nNT84 -> 't77' (line 22)\nNT39 -> 't28' (line 24)\nNT13 -> 't47' (line 26)\nNT7 -> 't11' (line 27)\nNT36 -> 't42' (line 28)\nNT81 -> 't71' (line 30)\nNT44 -> 't76' (line 35)\nNT27 -> 't35' (line 37)\nNT22 -> 't22' (line 39)\nNT23 -> 't14' (line 40)\nNT71 -> 't52' (line 42)\nNT50 -> 't49' (line 44)\nNT83 -> 't30' (line 46)\nNT2 -> 't5' (line 48)\nNT45 -> 't39' (line 49) Wait, no, wait, NT45 has two productions: line 18 (NT45 -> NT60 NT77) and line 19 (NT45 -> 't25'). But that can't be right because in a CFG in CNF, a non-terminal can only produce one symbol as a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in transcribing the productions.\n\nWait, actually, no, the user provided a list of productions where each line is either a non-terminal producing a pair of non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, line 4 is NT0 -> NT47 NT53, which is a production to two non-terminals.\n\nLine 20 is NT45 -> 't25'.\n\nSo, in other words, NT45 can produce NT60 NT77 or 't25'. Similarly, other lines are non-terminals producing two non-terminals.\n\nSo, back to NT81. From the list, NT81 produces 't30' (line 30). So, in the string, the first symbol is t82. Let me check if any non-terminal produces t82.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't82'. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake, or perhaps t82 is a result of some combination.\n\nWait, let me check all the productions to see if any non-terminal can produce t82.\n\nLooking through lines 47: NT44 -> 't76'\nLine 5: NT40 -> NT14 NT71\nLine 48: NT2 -> 't5'\nLine 3: NT40 -> NT58 NT39\nLine 49: NT45 -> 't39'?

{"custom_id":"request-955","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier because it simplifies the structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which are like A \u2192 BC, except for a few that directly produce terminals like NT5 \u2192 't25' or NT7 \u2192 't11'. So this definitely conforms to CNF.\n\nNow, the string I'm given to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols. Each token is either a 't' followed by a number or a number. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. This suggests that any possible derivation of a string will be a parse tree where every internal node has exactly two children, either both non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal.\n\nSo, the plan is to model the parse tree for the given string and see if all non-terminals can be replaced according to the grammar until we reach the string of terminals.\n\nLet me note that the string can be broken down into tokens: t82, t30, t30, t3, t13, t49, t84, t30, t11, t13, t30, t76, t84, t28, t47, t49, t84, t59, t30, t39, t47, t30, t33, t22, t11, t84, t30, t22, t11, t14, t25, t47, t49, t84, t76, t49, t77, t30, t82, t3, t8, t30, t25, t82, t3, t8, t49, t59, t82, t5.\n\nThat's 49 tokens, which is a lot. Parsing this manually is going to be time-consuming, but let's tackle it section by section.\n\nFirst, starting from the top symbol S, according to the grammar, S can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT45 NT81\nOR\n2. S \u2192 NT19 NT67\n\nSo, the string must start with either the combination derived from NT45 and NT81 or from NT19 and NT67.\n\nLet me look at the beginning of the string: t82, t30, t30, t3, t13, t49, t84, t30, t11, t13, t30, t76, t84, t28, t47, t49, t84, t59, t30, t39, t47, t30, t33, t22, ...\n\nHmm, let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst option: starting with NT45 and NT81.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT45 can be further expanded. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the production for NT45: It's either NT40 NT44 or 't25'. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nWait, let me list out the entries again. Oh, wait, in the grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77\nNT77 -> 't8'\nSo NT45 \u2192 NT60 NT77, and then NT60 is further broken down, etc.\n\nWait, no, let me check the given productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n- NT71 \u2192 NT9 NT75\n- NT52 \u2192 NT9 NT0\n- ...\n\nBut more importantly, the initial NTs that produce terminals include things like NT77 -> 't8', NT45 -> 't25', and so on.\n\nWait, let me see: NT45 is supposed to expand into 't25' according to one of the productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT45 -> 't42' \u2014 Wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me list the relevant NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't25'\n- NT7 \u2192 't11'\n- NT8 \u2192 't83'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT25 \u2192 't33'\n- NT52 \u2192 't71'\n- NT27 \u2192 't35'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT75 \u2192 't32'\n- NT44 \u2192 't59'\n- NT72 \u2192 't10'\n- NT23 \u2192 't14'\n- NT64 \u2192 Not present; wait, I need to check all the given productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a list of all NTs that expand to terminals based on the given grammar.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n- NT7 \u2192 NT36 NT45\n- NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT49\n- NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 or NT84 NT5\nWait, no, one of the productions is NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8? Wait, looking through the list:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 or NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5?\n\nWait, the initial productions are:\n\nS\u2192NT45 NT81\n\nS\u2192NT19 NT67\n\nThen,\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53,\n\nNT75 \u2192 NT72 NT5,\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT27 NT47,\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT25 NT52,\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8,\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing a few steps. Let's parse it carefully.\n\nI think a better approach is to first list all the NTs that expand into a single terminal symbol, as they are terminal and can only replace in one step.\n\nLooking through the grammar entries, let me find all NTs that have a production to a terminal (a string of length 1, just a 't' perhaps):\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n- NT7 \u2192 NT36 NT45\n- NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT49\n- NT12 \u2192 NT40 NT13\n- NT19 \u2192 NT84 NT8 or NT19 \u2192 NT60 NT5\nWait, looking at the entry for NT19:\n\nLooking at the production for NT19: It's NT84 NT8.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nIn the given grammar, the production for NT19 is:\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, actually, the line is:\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT84 ? Or maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT19 -> NT84 NT8\n\nWait, that's a two-symbol terminal: NT84 (which is a non-terminal) and 't8'?\n\nWait, I'm confused.

{"custom_id":"request-956","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by this context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's start by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's structured with non-terminals (NT) on the left and terminals (like 't...' and numbers) on the right. The start symbol is S, which has two productions: S -> NT45 NT81. So, the string must start with something derived from NT45 and NT81.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of 't' strings and numbers. Let me list the terminals: t84, t30, t33, t71, t33, etc. I notice that many of these are 't' followed by numbers, which look like terminal symbols rather than non-terminals (NTs) which have names like NT45, NT33, etc.\n\nSo, first step: check if the string starts with NT45 and NT81. The first symbol of the string is t84, but in the grammar, NT45 has a production to 't76', not to 't84'. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77 and also NT44. Oh, but in the string, the first part is t84 t30... Let me check NT45: in the productions, NT45 can go to 't60' and 't77' (from NT60 and NT77), but in the string, it starts with t84. So that's a mismatch. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering the production correctly. NT45 can be expanded to 't25' or something else? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the productions for NT45: I see NT45 -> NT50 NT44. And NT50 -> t49. NT44 -> t76, right? So combining NT50 and NT44 gives 't49 t76', so NT45 can produce 't49 t76'. But in the string, the first part is t84. Hmm, so perhaps the start symbol S is supposed to produce NT45 and NT81, and each of these non-terminals needs to produce the appropriate terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should trace back from the string. Let's see, each NT has productions to terminals or other NTs. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each part must be produced by a terminal or via chains of NT expansions.\n\nLooking at the string: t84 t30 t33 t71 t33 t49 t77 t30 t49 t30 t11 t84 t30 t42 t11 t14 t49 t30 t11 t47 t77 t47 t30 t3 t49 t84 t59 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t59 t30 t3 t13 t49 t84 t59 t42 t49 t59 t30 t49 t59 t25 t49 t76 t82 t5.\n\nThat's a long string, but I think each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal. So the string is all terminals, meaning each symbol must be generated directly by a non-terminal NT or a terminal, but wait, in the grammar, only certain symbols are terminals (like t84) and others are non-terminals (like NT45, NT30, etc.), but in the string, 't84' is a direct terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either to two terminals or two non-terminals. But in this case, some productions lead to terminals, like NT45 -> 't76', for example. So 't's are terminals, and NTs generate other NTs or terminals.\n\nLooking at the initial production: S -> NT45 NT81. So S must first generate NT45 and NT81.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first thing after S is t84. So perhaps the first NT45 must produce something that starts with t84.\n\nLet me check what NT45 can produce. NT45 has two main productions: NT45 -> NT60 NT77 and NT45 -> NT44.\n\nNT60 produces 't84' and NT77 produces 't77'. So when NT45 -> NT60 NT77, that would be 't84 t77'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, the first part is t84 t30 t33... So perhaps the NT45 is producing 't84 t77', but that would leave the second NT81 to produce something that starts with t30.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t84 comes t30, so maybe NT81 is involved. Let's check NT81's productions.\n\nLooking at NT81: NT81 -> NT30 NT81 and also NT81 -> 't71'.\n\nSo NT81 can produce 't71' directly, or it can produce NT30 and NT81, meaning more symbols.\n\nSo maybe the initial step is:\n\nS -> NT45 NT81\n\nThen, NT45 -> NT60 NT77, which is 't84 t77'\n\nNT81 -> 't71'\n\nBut that would give us 't84 t77 t71', which doesn't match the string starting with 't84 t30...', so that might not be the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT45 is producing NT45 -> 't60' NT77. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, NT45's only productions are to other NTs or to terminals. Wait no, in the given grammar, NT45 has productions to NT60 NT77 and NT44, but never directly to a terminal. Because in the grammar, everything is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is to two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so every production must be of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So I need to check if any of the productions end with a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT45 -> NT60 NT77 (two NTs)\nNT45 -> NT44 (two NTs? Wait, no, NT44 is a production; wait, NT44 can go to NT76 and 't76'? Let me check NT44.\n\nLooking up NT44: NT44 -> 't76' (terminal) and also NT44 -> NT27 NT76 (two NTs). So NT44 can produce either 't76' or more NTs.\n\nWait, so back to S: S -> NT45 NT81.\n\nThen, NT45 can produce NT60 NT77, which is 't84' (from NT60?) Let me see NT60: NT60 has a production to 't84', right?\n\nLooking at NT60: NT60 -> 't84' and also others like 't30', but wait, does NT60 have a production to 't84'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT60: NT60 -> 't84', NT60 also produces NT30 and NT81. So yes, NT60 can produce 't84' directly.\n\nSo if NT45 -> NT60 NT77, this would be 't84' followed by NT77. What is NT77's production?\n\nLooking at NT77: NT77 -> 't77' or others? Checking the grammar, NT77's productions are: NT77 -> 't77', I think.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT77 having any other productions besides 't77'. So NT77 produces 't77' directly.\n\nTherefore, if NT45 -> NT60 NT77, that's 't84 t77'.\n\nThen, NT81: as part of S, we have S -> NT45 NT81. So after NT45 -> 't84 t77', NT81 must produce something. NT81 can produce 't71' or more.\n\nWait, but the string starts as t84 t30, not t84 t77. So that's a problem. So this suggests that the production of NT45 to NT60 NT77 is not matching, since after t84, the next symbol is t30, not t77.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT45 is not being used here. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the S production works. S is producing NT45 and NT81 independently. So each of these NTs must produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nLet's consider NT81 first.
