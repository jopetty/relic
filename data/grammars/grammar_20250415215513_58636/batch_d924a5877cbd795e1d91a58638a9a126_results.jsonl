{"custom_id":"request-8","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t8.\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's see, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should note that the non-terminals are the various NTs like NT49, NT39, etc., and the terminals seem to be sequences of 't's followed by numbers. But looking closer, the terminal symbols are things like 't6', 't7', up to 't90'. Wait, no, actually, looking at the productions, the terminals seem to be single 't' followed by a number. For example, NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and then looking at NT85's production, it's NT64 NT12, and so on until we get to NT0 which becomes 't29', and NT1 which becomes 't70', etc.\n\nWait, but the terminal in the string we're testing is \"t8.\" So that's a single terminal symbol 't' followed by 8, making it 't8'. But looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce 't8'. Wait, but maybe through a combination of productions.\n\nLet me look at the grammar again to see if any rule directly produces 't8'. Scanning through, I see the rules where, for example, NT8 -> 't7', NT20 -> 't17', NT20 -> 't0', etc. Hmm, so 't8' might not be directly produced by any non-terminal. So perhaps the string \"t8.\" is not in the language, so the answer would be No. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check all the terminals to see if any rule produces 't8'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT85 -> NT64 NT12 leads to 't38' (since NT64 -> 't65', but wait, NT64's production is NT65 NT13, which eventually becomes 't66', which goes to 't26', which goes to 't65' (I think I need to trace this). Alternatively, maybe looking for 't8' as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the terminal symbols are listed at the end. Let me parse that correctly. The non-terminals that produce terminals are labeled with \"NTxxx -> ... [terminal]\". For example, NT7 -> 't74', NT12 -> 't85', NT16 -> 't71', and so on. Wait, looking through all of these, I see NT85 -> 't38' because looking through the rules:\n\nNT85's production is NT64 NT12, and both NT64 and NT12 produce specific terminals. Wait, perhaps I should find where a rule directly leads to 't8'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal symbols are 't6', 't7', 't8', 't9', 't12', 't16', etc., but I don't see any rule that directly produces 't8'. So 't8' is a terminal and it's only produced by a specific rule. Wait, wait, looking at the grammar, maybe some non-terminal produces 't8' directly.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT85 -> 't38' (since NT85 -> NT64 NT12, and NT64 is 't65' which goes to 't66' which is 't55' etc., and NT12 is 't85' because wait, the rule is NT12 -> 't85' in one production (look: NT12 -> 't85'). Oh! So NT12 directly produces 't85'? No, wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, under NT12 we have:\n\nLooking back, the grammar lines are listed as:\n\nNT12 -> 't85'\n\nYes, so the non-terminal NT12 produces the terminal 't85'. So that's how you get 't85' as a terminal. But where does 't8' come from?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The string to test is \"t8.\" which is a single terminal symbol 't8' followed by a period. Wait, but the period might not be relevant; perhaps it's just a typo, and the actual string is 't8'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't8'. The only terminals are combinations that come from non-terminals expanding into other non-terminals and eventually terminals. For example, NT17 -> 't73'.\n\nWait, let me check all the terminal rules in the grammar. Let me list them:\n\nFrom the grammar list:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT12 -> 't85'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n- NT49 -> 't73'\n- NT2 -> 't28' or maybe not, wait: in the grammar, under NT2, it says NT28 -> 't20' and NT28 -> 't13', but in the non-terminal list, I see NT2 -> NT28 NT13, and NT13 -> 't31' so NT2 eventually can produce 't31'.\n\nWait, let me see which terminals are present. Looking through the list:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT12 -> 't85'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n- NT25 -> 't28' (since NT25 -> NT28 NT7, but NT28 can produce 't20' or 't13', so maybe NT25 doesn't directly produce a terminal.\n- Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal symbols are:\n\n- t7, t8, t9, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, etc. Wait, let me look for a production that results in \"t8\".\n\nLooking through the grammar, the productions that result in terminals are:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74' (so generates 't74')\n- NT12 -> 't85'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT12 -> 't85'\n- NT86 -> 't55' (if that's a non-terminal)\n- Hmm, perhaps some non-terminals produce 't8'.\n\nWait, maybe looking deeper. For example, NT39 -> 't9', because I see NT39 -> NT8 NT25, and looking further, NT8 -> 't7' and NT25 -> 't28' which comes from NT28 -> 't20' and NT28 -> 't13', and so on. Wait, but none of these directly produce 't8'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces 't8'.\n\nLooking through all the terminal rules at the end of the grammar:\n\n- NT47 -> 't72'\n- NT12 -> 't85'\n- NT92 -> 't56'\n- NT85 -> 't38'\n- NT51 -> 't50'\nWait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me check line by line:\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT12 -> 't85'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT57 -> 't18'\n- NT53 -> 't45'\n- NT92 -> 't56'\n- NT70 -> 't82'\n- NT35 -> 't91'\n- NT0 -> 't29'\n- NT11 -> 't87'\n- NT66 -> 't92'\n\nHmm, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't8'. So if the string is \"t8\", there's no non-terminal that directly outputs 't8'. Therefore, the string \"t8\" can't be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-1","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t19\" is generated by this context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to have a mix of terminals (like t19, t74, etc.) and non-terminals (like S, NT44, etc.).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the start symbol and the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and looking at the productions from S, it seems S can produce two NTs followed by numbers. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So, each production starts with NT followed by another NT or a number, but wait, no. Looking closer, S's productions are:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Oh, no, actually, the productions from S are combinations of NTs and numbers. Wait, no, looking again, the productions from S are S \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, S \u2192 NT40 NT92. So each production is two NTs followed by numbers? Or is it that each production is a combination of NT and a number. Hmm, I think I got that wrong. Let me see:\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a non-terminal generating two non-terminals or a terminal. In this grammar, some of the productions have a mix of NTs and numbers, but actually, looking at the grammar, the numbers like 74, 44, etc., are terminals because they're mapped to t-something in the string. For example, NT74 \u2192 t73, NT49 \u2192 t6, etc.\n\nWait, no, actually, the grammar seems to have non-terminals like NT49, NT39, and terminals like t73, t6, etc. So each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal generating a terminal plus another non-terminal? Or, wait, no, wait. In the grammar, each production is of the form NTxy \u2192 NTA B, where NTA and B are either non-terminals or terminals. Because the right-hand side of each production seems to consist of two parts, which could be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFor example, S's production is S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So S is producing two non-terminals, NT74 and NT44. Each of those non-terminals then produce further. But I'm getting confused. Let me see the structure.\n\nSo the entire grammar is a collection of productions where each left-hand side is a non-terminal, and each production can be either two non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal. Wait, no, no, looking at the first production: NT74 is a non-terminal, and it's produced by NT74 \u2192 NT0 NT47, which is two non-terminals. Similarly, NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25, which is also two non-terminals. So in this grammar, all the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, the productions are supposed to be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So in this case, the grammar seems to have S as a start symbol, and each production from S is a combination of two non-terminals, like NT74, NT44 for the first one.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the grammar, all productions except the ones starting with NT... have a mix of NT and numbers. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So that's S producing two NTs. Then NT74 produces NT0 and NT47, which are non-terminals. Each of those produces more, perhaps.\n\nThe target string is \"t19\". So I need to see if there's a derivation from S that leads to \"t19\". Let's think about how that could happen.\n\nEach terminal in the grammar is mapped to a 't' with a number. For example, NT74 \u2192 t73, NT49 \u2192 t6, NT39 \u2192 t9, etc. So \"t19\" must come from a production of a non-terminal that eventually leads to that.\n\nSo first, let me trace back how 't19' is generated. Let's look at where 't19' appears in the grammar. Scanning through the productions, I see NT18 \u2192 t76 (nope), NT17 \u2192 t73, NT19 \u2192 t73, NT12 \u2192 t85, etc. Wait, looking through all the productions, I see that in the top of the thinking, the user listed the grammar's productions, but I need to find where the terminal 't19' is defined.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided a lot of productions, but I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't19' except maybe indirectly. Or perhaps I need to find a production chain starting from S that can derive 't19' using these rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't19' is a terminal, and I need to see if there's a way for the start symbol S to derive it through the productions.\n\nStarting from S, each production is S \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, S \u2192 NT40 NT92, etc. So each production of S is a combination of two NTs.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44.\n\nNow, each of those NTs can be expanded further. Let's take NT74: NT74 \u2192 NT0 NT47.\n\nSimilarly, NT44 might produce other NTs or terminals. Wait, looking for NT44 in the productions: I don't see NT44 directly. Let me check the list. Hmm, in the list provided, I see NT38, NT66, NT35, etc., but no NT44 except in the S's production as NT44.\n\nWait, no, check the productions:\n\nLooking for NT44 in the productions: S \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, S \u2192 NT40 NT92. Now, the non-terminals are those starting with NT, so NT74 is in the productions, as well as NT40, NT11, etc.\n\nWait, do any of these NTs produce t19? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57, and NT73 \u2192 't6', etc. Hmm, wait, I think I need to see if 't19' can be produced by any of the NTs. For that, I need to find a non-terminal NT where the production eventually leads to t19.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a single-step production from a non-terminal to t19. Let's check if any of the NTs directly produce t19.\n\nLooking through each NT production:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t76, t44, t25, t13\n- NT12 \u2192 t93, t70\n- NT39 \u2192 t8, t25, t90, t1\n- NT57 \u2192 t85, t56\n- NT40 \u2192 t16, t80\n- NT65 \u2192 t17, t19\nSo wait, NT65 \u2192 t17 and t19? Let me check: NT65 appears in productions like:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT55, and it's also in NT17 \u2192 t73, and perhaps other productions. Wait, wait, looking back, do any of the NTs directly produce t19? Yes, looking at the list, NT65 \u2192 t17, t19. So NT65 can produce t19.\n\nSo to get 't19', we need a derivation where a NT65 is expanded to t19.\n\nNow, can we get to NT65? Because S's productions are starting points.\n\nLooking at S's production S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Let's see what NT74 and NT44 expand to.\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT0 NT47. So NT74 is two NTs.\n\nNT74 expands to NT0 and NT47. Then NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34.\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85.\n\nNT92 \u2192 t52.\n\nNT85 \u2192 t64, t12.\n\nSo NT77 \u2192 t52 and t64, followed by t12.\n\nSo NT77 \u2192 t52 t64 t12.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a CFG in CNF looks like. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals. The start symbol is S, and each production has at most two non-terminals on the right side.

I need to find a way to derive the string \"t19 t1\" from S.\n\nLet me parse the string into tokens. \"t19\" and \"t1\" are separate tokens. So, I need to see if these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI'll start by checking the productions for the terminals t19 and t1 in the grammar. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT12 \u2192 t85, NT20 \u2192 t0, NT20 \u2192 t17, NT92 \u2192 t52, and others. But t19 and t1 are in the right-hand side of some NT rules. For example, NT18 \u2192 t14, NT19 \u2192 t73, etc. So, I can't directly get t19 from a single NT production, as most of them map to a single character and not a combined t19.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. The string is \"t19 t1\", which is a sequence of two tokens, t19 and t1. So, this means that both t19 and t1 need to be generated somehow.\n\nLet me list the productions that generate t19 and t1:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t14 \u2192 that's not t19.\n- NT19 \u2192 t73 \u2192 no.\n- NT22 \u2192 not present.\n- NT25 \u2192 depends on its production rules.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I see:\n- NT18 \u2192 t14\n- NT19 \u2192 t73\n- NT20 \u2192 t17 and t0\n- NT28 \u2192 t20\n- NT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25, but wait, the grammar has more detailed rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, I see:\n- NT18 \u2192 t7\n- NT19 \u2192 t5\n- NT20 \u2192 t0 and t1\n- NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\n- NT28 \u2192 NT59 NT69\nWait, maybe I need to backtrack further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the CYK algorithm or something similar to check if the string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nBut first, let me see if any of the NTs directly map to \"t19\" or \"t1\". It looks like:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t73\n- NT18 \u2192 t14\n- NT19 \u2192 t73 (again)\n- NT20 \u2192 t0, t17\n- NT28 \u2192 t20\n- NT7 \u2192 t74, t73\nWait, no, looking again.\n\nWait, looking through the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't0' and 't17'\nBut 't0' is a terminal, not 't1' or 't19'.\n\nThen where do I get 't19'? I don't see any NT that directly produces t19.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to break down t19 into smaller parts. But according to the grammar, t19 is a terminal on its own only if it's in the rules. Checking the first part of the grammar:\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, I don't see any NT rule that produces t19. Let me scan through the given rules.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nI see NT18 \u2192 t14, so that's t14, not t19.\n\nNT19 \u2192 (I don't see it in the initial list; checking the first part of the grammar again, I think I might have miscounted. Let me see: The first set of rule lines are S \u2192 NTx y. Then subsequent lines are for each NT, like NT49 \u2192 ... etc.\n\nWait, the full grammar is given as a long list. Let me scan it for t19 and t1.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't73'\n- NT18 \u2192 't7'\n- NT19 \u2192 't5'\n- NT20 \u2192 't0', 't17'\n- NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\n- NT28 \u2192 NT59 NT69\n\nAfter NT28, the production is NT59 \u2192 NT47 NT65.\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT66 NT1 (Wait, is that right? Let's check.)\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1\nSo, NT66's production is NT55 followed by NT1. So, if NT55 and NT1 can produce terminal symbols, perhaps that contributes to \"t1\".\n\nWait, but I'm trying to get 't19', which doesn't appear as a terminal from any NT. So perhaps 't19' can't be generated from any production in this grammar, which would imply that the string \"t19 t1\" cannot be generated.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Maybe I missed a production for 't19'. Let me check each NT rule more thoroughly.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 't52'\n- NT85 \u2192 't38'\n- NT90 \u2192 't22'\n- NT77 \u2192 't92'\n- NT89 \u2192 not present; in any case, perhaps other NTs.\n\nWait, I'm starting to think that 't19' isn't a terminal in any of the NT rules. So the string 't19' can't be derived from any NT rule. Therefore, the entire string \"t19 t1\" can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking again through the grammar, specifically for 't19' and 't1'.\n\n- NT19's production is given as 't5'; that's not 't19'.\n- Any other NTs?\n\nLooking more carefully, I find:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1\n- NT1 \u2192 't70'\n- NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65\n- NT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61?\n\nWait, no, wait. Looking in the grammar:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61.\n\nSo, NT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61, and NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65, and NT65 \u2192 NT66 NT1.\n\nSo this creates a loop, but I don't see that leading to t19.\n\nThen, where does 't1' come from?\n\nLooking at terminals:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't0' and 't17'\n- NT28 \u2192 't20'\n- NT69 \u2192 't68' and 't93'\nWait, wait, checking: NT69 \u2192 't68' and 't93'?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some terminals are used, but 't1' is a terminal that might be produced by an NT.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nThe grammar has rules like NT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25, then NT34 \u2192 NT56 NT93, NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40, and so on.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production that ends in 't1'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look at the last part of the grammar provided:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 NT66 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 't5' (no, that's in the NT5 rules)\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, looking at NT40 \u2192 't71', which could be 't7' and 't1'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the NT rules and the terminals. Wait, no. In the given grammar, the rules are either S \u2192 NTx y or NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is \"t19 t1\". Each part needs to be derived.\n\nBut I don't see any NT that can derive to 't19' or 't1'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't19' is a concatenation of multiple terminals. But that doesn't make sense because in CFG, each step is a single production.\n\nWait, maybe 't19' is the result of a two-step production.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it's `t56 t76`, which has two tokens. In the grammar, every production either has two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string has two terminals, it must result from a derivation that produces two non-terminals in the last step, each expanded into one token.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The start symbol is S. I'll need to see how S can derive into two non-terminals that become `t56` and `t76`.\n\nLooking at the productions for S:\n- S -> NT74 NT44\n- S -> NT11 NT24\n- S -> NT40 NT92\n\nI need to check if any of these can lead to `t56` and `t76`.\n\n2.

Let me see if there's a way for each of these non-terminals to reach the required t tokens.\n\nBut maybe I should look for NT that directly go to t tokens.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT56 -> NT92 NT40. But NT92 and NT40 might expand further. Not sure if this leads to t56.\nWait, looking at NT59: NT59 -> NT47 NT65. Hmm, NT47 -> NT55 NT61, and NT65 -> NT17 NT19.

So NT76 can derive t76)\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there's a NT76 production:\n\nNT76 -> 't76'\n\nYes, so S can produce NT76 (as S -> NT74 NT44, S -> NT11 NT24, S -> NT40 NT92; none produce t76).

Similarly, NT76 can be 't76'.\n\nWait, S cannot directly produce NT76 because looking at the S productions, none of them are NT76. So, S must produce two non-terminals that each derive into t56 and t76.\n\nSo, in the string `t56 t76`, the first non-terminal must be the one that produces t56, and the second must produce t76.\n\nLooking at S's productions, let's check each:\n\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n\n   Now, NT74 and NT44. We need NT74 to be the one that produces t56 and NT44 to produce t76. But does NT74 -> t56?\n\nLooking at NT74's productions:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99. Then NT39 -> NT8 NT25, and NT99 -> NT51 NT66. These are all non-terminals, so they don't directly produce terminals. Wait, but NT8 is a non-terminal: NT8 -> NT7 NT44.

{"custom_id":"request-32","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) and a string. I need to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. The grammar and the string are provided. \n\nFirst, let's break down what I know. The grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals) on the right. This form is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply certain algorithms, like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm not going to manually apply an algorithm, I'll try a more manual approach here.\n\nThe given string is `t98 t0 t82`. I need to check if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial productions from S are:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, S produces pairs of non-terminals. Each production is a combination of two non-terminals, and each non-terminal eventually leads to terminals or more non-terminals. The string has three tokens, so I need to see if I can derive a string of three tokens from these rules.\n\nWait, but the grammar's initial productions are each two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals can produce more, but since each step in replacement breaks down into two symbols, the total number of symbols should be 2^(n) where n is the number of steps. So, starting from S, the first step would give two symbols. For a string of three symbols, I don't think that's possible because after one step, it's two symbols; the next step would produce four, and so on. But wait, that would suggest that the length of the string should be a power of two. But here, the string has three symbols, which is not a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible for the grammar to generate a string of three symbols if it's in CNF because each application of a rule increases the number of non-terminals by one each time, leading to exponential growth in the number of symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I should think again. Chomsky normal form has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, starting from S, each application of a production increases the count of symbols by one (since two non-terminals become one terminal plus one non-terminal? Or wait, no: each production of A \u2192 BC takes two symbols (A and B) and produces two symbols (B and C), so the count remains the same. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C can be terminals or non-terminals. So, each production step can either replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, or with a terminal.\n\nSo, each time you replace a non-terminal, you can choose to produce either two non-terminals (increasing the length by one each time you replace them) or a terminal, which stops the chain for that particular path.\n\nSo, starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, the first step can produce two non-terminals. Then each of those can produce either two more or a terminal, etc.\n\nSo, the total length of the string can vary, but it's possible to get an arbitrary number of terminals, as long as the path from S to each terminal in the string allows it.\n\nWait, but in the initial productions from S, there are three options: each produces two non-terminals. So, each of those is a two-symbol string at first. Then each of those non-terminals can be replaced further.\n\nBut the string we're given has three symbols: t98, t0, t82. So, three terminals. So, how can we get from a starting symbol S that initially splits into two non-terminals, and after replacements, end up with three terminals?\n\nWait, but let's think in terms of how many symbols can be produced. Starting from S, each step can either produce two symbols (non-terminals) or, if a non-terminal leads directly to a terminal, just one symbol. Each production application replaces one symbol with others.\n\nBut to reach a string of three symbols, it would require an odd number of terminals. Let me see: starting with S, first split into two. One of those might produce a terminal, and the other might split into two more non-terminals. Then, one of those could produce another terminal, and so on. Let's count:\n\nIf S splits into A and B.\n\nSuppose A splits into AB, where A is a terminal, and B splits into C.\n\nThen B can split into CD, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit fuzzy. Maybe I should map out the possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the string and see if it can be decomposed according to the grammar.\n\nGiven the string is t98 t0 t82, which is three tokens. Let's look for any direct productions that could generate this.\n\nLooking at the rules, the possible direct terminal productions are in the NT rules. For example, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t74\nNT12 \u2192 t85\nNT16 \u2192 t71\nNT69 \u2192 t93\nNT18 \u2192 t19\nNT20 \u2192 t17\nNT20 \u2192 t0\nNT28 \u2192 t20\nNT66 \u2192 t26\nNT9 \u2192 t46\nNT90 \u2192 t22\nNT12 \u2192 t16\nNT39 \u2192 t9\nNT92 \u2192 t52\nNT1 \u2192 t70\nNT24 \u2192 t88\nNT28 \u2192 t26\nNT59 \u2192 t6\nNT47 \u2192 t72\nNT92 \u2192 t93\nNT8 \u2192 t7\nNT12 \u2192 t1\nNT50 \u2192 t59\nNT80 \u2192 t55\nNT33 \u2192 t8\nNT92 \u2192 t56\nNT53 \u2192 t43\nNT12 \u2192 t11\nNT66 \u2192 t46\nNT51 \u2192 t98\nNT44 \u2192 t56\nNT9 \u2192 t5\nNT13 \u2192 t31\nNT57 \u2192 t18\nNT53 \u2192 t45\nNT92 \u2192 t76\nNT70 \u2192 t82\nNT35 \u2192 t91\nNT0 \u2192 t29\nNT11 \u2192 t87\nNT66 \u2192 t92\n\nLooking through these, the terminals are 't74', 't85', 't71', 't93', 't19', 't17', 't0', 't20', 't26', 't46', 't22', 't16', 't9', 't52', 't70', 't88', 't1', 't59', 't55', 't8', 't7', 't1', 't59', 't56', 't43', 't11', 't46', 't98', 't56', 't45', 't76', 't82', 't91', 't29', 't87', 't92'.\n\nWait, so 't98' is produced by NT51, because NT51 \u2192 t98. The string has the first token as t98, so that's from NT51. Now, the next token is t0, which is produced by NT0 \u2192 t29 no, wait: from NT0, I see NT0 \u2192 t29. Wait, but t0 is a terminal generated by which NT?\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals for NT0 is 't29'. But nowhere do I see t0 as a production from any NT except in the initial and other rules. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the initial productions for S go to NT11 and NT24, etc. But also, in the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT87\nNT24 \u2192 t88\nNT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50\nWait, wait: looking through the NT rules, perhaps NT26 is a rule that goes somewhere else. But perhaps I'm not seeing it. Let me check NT51: NT51 \u2192 t98, so that gives 't98'.\n\nThen, the next token is t0. Looking for NTs that produce t0: looking through the rule list, I see that only some NTs go to terminals. Wait, in the list, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t29\nNT11 \u2192 t87\nNT24 \u2192 t88\nWait, but t0 is a terminal; perhaps it's produced by an NT. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nWait, the rule NT28 \u2192 t20, but t0 is 't0'\u2014looking through, do any NTs produce t0?\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT with a production that ends with t0, except maybe I missed one.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar rules provided. The grammar starts with S, which produces combinations of NT and numbers. The initial productions are:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo S is the start symbol and can be expanded into three different combinations. Each of these NT symbols can further be broken down according to the rules provided.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of four tokens: t22, t72, t87, t74. Each 't' followed by a number is likely a terminal symbol, and the numbers in the grammar rules are non-terminal symbols (NT).\n\nI think I should work backwards from the string, trying to find a sequence of productions that can generate it. Since CFGs can be parsed either left-to-right or right-to-left, maybe I can try to see which parts of the string correspond to the non-terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string: t22 t72 t87 t74. Maybe I can split this into parts that match the expansion rules.\n\nThe first symbol is t22. Looking at the terminal rules, t22 is a terminal.

Each T seems to have a specific production. For example, NT92 -> t52, NT91 -> t22, etc. So T22 would come from NT91, because I see NT91 -> t22 is a production.\n\nSo for the first part, t22 comes from NT91 -> t22. Therefore, the first symbol t22 is produced by NT91.\n\nNow moving to the second symbol, t72. Looking at the terminals, t72 comes from which NT? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, NT72-> t72?

The NT symbols are those that have 'NT' followed by some number, like NT49, NT39, etc. The others are terminals, which are 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT72. Maybe it's a terminal. Is there a production for NT72? Or is it a terminal symbol? Wait, looking through the grammar, do I see any rule that has NT72 on the left side? No, I don't think so. So maybe t72 is a terminal symbol, and there is a rule that directly produces t72.\n\nLooking through the list of terminal productions, yes, I see NT77 -> t26? Wait, no, let me check again. The list provided is extensive, but perhaps I need to scan for t72.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT7 -> t74\nNT66 -> t26\nNT9 -> t46\nNT90 -> t22\nNT12 -> t16\nNT39 -> t9\nNT92 -> t52\nNT1 -> t70\nNT24 -> t88\nNT28 -> t26\nNT59 -> t6\nNT47 -> t72\nWait, yes! I see NT47 -> t72. So t72 comes from NT47.\n\nSo the second symbol t72 comes from NT47 -> t72.\n\nNow the third symbol is t87. Again, check if it's a terminal or a non-terminal. Since it's a 't' followed by a number, it's a terminal. Looking at the terminal productions:\n\nI see NT11 -> t87. Because in the provided rules, NT11 is a non-terminal, and it produces t87. So t87 comes from NT11 -> t87.\n\nThe fourth symbol is t74, which is a terminal. Looking at the terminal productions, I see NT74 -> t74.\n\nSo the string breaks down as:\n\nt22 (NT91) -> t22\nt72 (NT47) -> t72\nt87 (NT11) -> t87\nt74 (NT74) -> t74\n\nNow, I need to see if there's a way the start symbol S can produce this sequence by expanding the NTs step by step.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the derivation.\n\nStarting from S, which can produce:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nLooking at the string, we have four terminals. So perhaps the derivation involves expanding S into two NTs, each of which expands into a terminal or further non-terminals, etc., until all are terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it has four terminals, so we'll need to expand S into two NTs, each of which then expand into two terminals, but wait, that would only give four terminals in total. Wait, no: S is the start and each rule produces two NTs, so each S expansion gives two NTs. So to get four terminals, each NT must expand into two terminals. So each of the two NTs from the initial S production must expand into two terminals, resulting in four.\n\nWait, but some NTs might need to expand further. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the string, it's t22 t72 t87 t74, which is four terminals. So each of the initial S's two NTs must produce two terminals each. So S -> NT1 NT2, where NT1 and NT2 each produce two terminals.\n\nLooking at the possible initial productions:\n\nIf S -> NT74 NT44, then each of NT74 and NT44 must produce two terminals.\n\nLooking at NT74's production: In the provided rules, NT74 -> NT39 NT99.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the grammar rules again:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99 (I see this rule)\nNT44 -> NT40 NT98 (I think I don't see NT44 in the list, but in the provided strings, there's S -> NT74 NT44, so perhaps NT44 exists, but it's not provided in the initial list. Wait, no, perhaps the initial list provided was the entire grammar? Or just part of it. Wait, the user provided a large chunk of the grammar, which includes all the production rules. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the user provided a block of grammar rules, and within that, for example, S is defined as S-> NT74 NT44, so that exists.\n\nLooking into the NT74 rules:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\n\nSo NT74 can expand into NT39 and NT99. Similarly, NT44: I don't see NT44's production in the provided list. Wait, maybe it's a terminal. Let me see if any NT44 exists. Looking through all the NT symbols, I don't see NT44; all are listed as NT followed by some number except the terminals. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the list provided, does NT44 exist? Let me go through the list:\n\nThe NT symbols are:\n\nNT49, NT39, NT77, NT57, NT51, NT74, NT40, NT65, NT85, NT55, NT76, NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I see that it's quite complex with a bunch of productions defined. The starting symbol is S, and it breaks down into combinations of NT symbols until they eventually resolve into literals (the 't's with numbers and such). My task is to see if the string in question can be derived from S through a series of these productions.\n\nThe given string is `t1 t82 t71 t92`. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nI should probably start by looking at how each 't' component is generated. Starting with `t1`, `t71`, `t82`, and `t92`.\n\nLet me check each 't' to see which rule produces them.\n\n- `t1`: Looking through the NT productions, I see that NT16 -> 't71', but that's not helpful. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the list again. Oh, under NT7: NT7 -> 't74', that's not it. Wait, maybe `t1` is generated directly from some production. Looking through the list, I see NT28 -> 't20' but that's 't20'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps I should look through all the end productions. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the end productions (the ones ending with quotes), I see:\n\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT17 -> 't73'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT66 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't46'\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT39 -> 't9'\n- NT92 -> 't52'\n- NT1 -> 't70'\n- NT24 -> 't88'\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- NT47 -> 't72'\n- NT8 -> 't7'\n- NT50 -> 't59'\n- NT80 -> 't55'\n- NT33 -> 't8'\n- NT92 -> 't56' (Wait, there are two rules for NT92 here: one says 't52' and another says 't56'. That must be a mistake because each symbol should have only one production, but perhaps it's redundant? Or maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh no, I think I saw that somewhere. Let's note that and proceed.)\n\nSo, trying to find where each 't' comes from:\n\n- `t1`: Hmm, I don't see an NT production that directly gives `t1`. Wait, looking through the end productions again. Do any of them end with `t1`? I don't see any NT production that resolves to `t1`. That's odd because `t1` isn't listed as an end production. Or wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the list carefully.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT17 -> 't73'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT66 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't46'\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT39 -> 't9'\n- NT92 -> 't52'\n- NT1 -> 't70'\n- NT24 -> 't88'\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- NT47 -> 't72'\n- NT8 -> 't7'\n- NT50 -> 't59'\n- NT80 -> 't55'\n- NT33 -> 't8'\n- NT92 -> 't56'\n\nWait, I'm not seeing a production that ends with `t1`. That's a problem because if `t1` isn't in the end productions, it can't be directly generated. So does that mean the string isn't possible? Or perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, in the grammar, there's another NT7, which also goes to 't74'. But no, that doesn't help with `t1`. \n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. If the string has `t1`, which isn't an end symbol, then it can't be generated by the grammar. Because all the end symbols are defined, and 't1' isn't one of them. Therefore, the string `t1 t82 t71 t92` can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing a production. Let me go back through the list again.\n\nLooking at NT -> literals:\n\nNo, I don't see 't1' anywhere. So, perhaps the answer is No because one of the literals isn't in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the NT productions. Let me check where each 't' comes from.\n\n- `t1` needs to come from some NT production, but in the list, there's no NT that resolves directly to `t1`. So, unless it's part of a chain, but without 't1' being present in the end symbols, there's no way.\n\nWait, but looking again, the initial productions start with S and NT, but none of the end symbols include `t1`, so the string has a `t1` that can't be generated.

Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to fit that structure because all the rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is `t17 t22 t71 t22 t93`. So, the terminals here are t17, t22, t71, etc., and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has productions like S \u2192 NT17 NT22, S \u2192 NT22 NT71, and another S \u2192 NT93 NT22, among others. Wait, let me check exactly how many productions S has. Oh, I see S has four possible productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n4. S \u2192 NT17 NT22\n\nWait, but looking closer, the fourth production seems different. Others look like multiple NTs and a terminal. Wait, no, let me check again. Oh, I think the initial S lines were more than four. Let me recount.\n\nWait, no, the user listed:\n\n```plaintext\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\nS -> NT17 NT22\n```\n\nNo, that's it. So from S, you can produce either four different combinations of non-terminals. But then, looking at the provided string, which is t17 t22 t71 t22 t93, which is a sequence starting with t17, t22, then t71, t22, t93.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first two symbols are t17 and t22.

{"custom_id":"request-59","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the string \"t18 t14 t76 t88 t11\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it simplifies some aspects, like each production being either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the string. It's a sequence of terminals: t18, t14, t76, t88, t11. Each of these seems to correspond to a right-hand side (RHS) of the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can approach this by trying to parse from the start symbol S step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has three productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these productions gives us the initial two symbols after S. Now, looking at the string, the first symbol is t18. I need to find which production could lead to t18 being the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n- NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT47\n- NT17 \u2192 t73\n- NT16 \u2192 t71\n- But none of them directly start with t18. Wait, is there a production for NT18? Let me check. Scanning through, I don't see NT18 as a left-hand side; however, terminal symbols like t14 are present.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The productions are for the non-terminals, so t's are terminals. So for example, NT70 \u2192 t70, NT18 \u2192 t18, etc.\n\nSo for the first symbol t18, I need a production that emits t18. Looking through the NT rules, I find NT18 is directly mapped to 't18'. So which production can expand to have NT18 as the first symbol?\n\nLooking at the start options, none of them have NT18 directly. Let me check each S production's RHS:\n1. NT74 NT44\n2. NT11 NT24\n3. NT40 NT92\n\nSince none of these are NT18, I need to see if any of the non-terminals NT74, NT44, or the others can expand to something that starts with t18. Wait, no, because S is the start symbol and it's directly expanding to these NT pairs.\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach. Maybe I should consider that NT18 is a non-terminal that can produce 't18'. So perhaps the entire string is built from S \u2192 ... \u2192 NT... which eventually produces the t symbols. \n\nBut wait, the string has t18 as the first symbol. So to get t18, the first production must start with NT18, which only happens if S expands to a production that eventually leads to NT18 in the first position. But looking at S's options, S's RHS are all pairs of NTs, none of which include NT18. So that suggests that t18 can't come directly from S.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t18. How can S produce that? Perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, I'm looking at the productions again. Let me check all NTs:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT18 is only mapped to 't18' as a production. But in the S productions, there's no NT18 mentioned. So S directly can't generate t18 because none of the RHS of S's production start with NT18. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to start with t18 if S is the top-level.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the parser works. Perhaps S can expand to NTs, and those NTs can further expand to sequences that start with t symbols. So, for example, NT74 could expand to something that starts with t74, which in the string isn't present. So the first symbol in the string is t18, which isn't covered by any of the S's direct productions. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way through the productions to get to t18. Let me trace through possible expansions.\n\nSince S produces two NTs, let's say S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Then, NT74 and NT44 would each expand into something. Let's see:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\nNT8 \u2192 't8'\nNT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\nNT28 \u2192 't20'\nNT7 \u2192 't74'\n\nSo NT74 expands as t8 t20 t74? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So for NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, that would require NT39 and NT99 to each expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead try to see if the entire string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string is \"t18 t14 t76 t88 t11\". Let's see if each t can be produced by its corresponding NT.\n\n- t18 is produced by NT18 \u2192 't18'\n- t14 is produced by NT14 \u2192 't14' (I don't see a production for NT14, so this might not be correct; wait, does any NT produce 't14'? Looking at the productions... Let me check. Yes, NT14 isn't a non-terminal, so maybe I made a mistake.)\n\nWait, I'm seeing that some t symbols are directly produced by NTs like NT18, NT14, etc. Let me check the list:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't18'\n- Is there an NT14? I don't see a production for NT14. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the list, I'm seeing entries like NT18, NT14 (no, I don't see a line with NT14 \u2192 t14). Wait, maybe another NT expands to 't14'? Or perhaps NT14 is an abbreviation. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't8', NT14 might not be a non-terminal. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT14. So perhaps the string has t14, but it's not being produced by any NT, which would mean that the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, let me verify each t symbol in the string:\n\n- t18: produced by NT18 \u2192 't18' (exists)\n- t14: Do any NT produce 't14'? Looking through the list, I see NT70 \u2192 't70', NT12 \u2192 't12', NT18 \u2192 't18', etc., but not NT14. So if the grammar doesn't have any production for 't14', then the string can't be generated because t14 isn't a terminal produced by any rule.\n\nLooking back, I think I might have missed it. Let me scan the list again. The last few lines:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't70',\nNT12 \u2192 't12',\nNT39 \u2192 't9',\nNT92 \u2192 't52',\nNT1 \u2192 't70',\nNT24 \u2192 't88',\nNT28 \u2192 't26',\nNT59 \u2192 't6',\nNT47 \u2192 't72',\nNT92 \u2192 't93',\nNT8 \u2192 't7',\nNT12 \u2192 't1',\nNT50 \u2192 't59',\nNT80 \u2192 't55',\nNT33 \u2192 't8',\nNT92 \u2192 't56',\nNT53 \u2192 't43',\nNT12 \u2192 't11',\nNT66 \u2192 't46',\nNT51 \u2192 't98',\nNT44 \u2192 't56',\nNT9 \u2192 't5',\nNT13 \u2192 't31',\nNT57 \u2192 't18',\nNT53 \u2192 't45',\nNT92 \u2192 't76',\nNT70 \u2192 't82',\nNT35 \u2192 't91',\nNT0 \u2192 't29',\nNT11 \u2192 't87',\nNT66 \u2192 't92',\n...\nI don't see any line that produces 't14'.

Hmm, that's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It seems like the grammar has a start symbol S that branches out into different non-terminals (NTx). Each rule seems to break down into two non-terminals, which fits Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The terminals here are all 't' followed by a number, like t52, t14, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t52 t14 t11 t59 t0 t52\". So I need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I know that the parsing can be done using a top-down approach, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm. But perhaps there's a simpler way since the string is relatively short.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar leads to two terminals or other non-terminals. So each production in the string can be broken down into two parts. The string has six tokens, so in terms of derivations, each step should produce two tokens at most, leading to the total number of tokens matching the number of leaves in the parse tree.\n\nWait, the string has six tokens, which is an even number. Each production increases the number of symbols by one, but since each step can only produce two symbols at a time, the total number of tokens should be equal to the number of steps plus one. Hmm, that might not be the right way to look at it. Maybe each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols, so the total number of symbols increases by one each time.\n\nStarting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, so the length of the string increases by one each step. Therefore, to reach six symbols, there must be five steps from S to the terminal string.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial S starts as one symbol. Each substitution replaces one non-terminal with two symbols. So the length after each substitution is:\n\n- After 1 substitution: 2 symbols (S expanded)\n- After 2 substitutions: 3 symbols\n- ...\n- After n substitutions: n+1 symbols.\n\nSo to get 6 symbols, n+1 =6 \u2192 n=5. So five substitution steps are needed.\n\nBut wait, each substitution replaces one non-terminal. So in each step, one non-terminal is replaced by two symbols. So each step increases the total number of symbols by 1. Therefore, starting from 1 (S), after 5 steps, it's 6 symbols.\n\nSo the string has 6 tokens, so it's possible to derive it with 5 production steps.\n\nNow, looking at the string: t52 t14 t11 t59 t0 t52.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the string starts with t52. Let me check if any non-terminal in the grammar produces t52.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, let's see the productions that have terminal symbols:\n\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85  \nNT57 -> NT85 NT56  \nNT51 -> NT19 NT18  \nNT74 -> NT39 NT99  \nNT40 -> NT16 NT80  \nNT65 -> NT17 NT19  \nNT85 -> NT64 NT12  \nNT99 -> NT51 NT66  \nNT55 -> NT47 NT65  \nNT76 -> NT2 NT68  \nNT57 -> NT19 NT99\nNT38 -> NT13 NT98  \nNT64 -> NT65 NT13  \nNT35 -> NT34 NT25  \nNT12 -> NT93 NT70  \nNT91 -> NT64 NT90  \nNT34 -> NT56 NT93  \nNT0 -> NT77 NT34  \nNT19 -> NT17 NT57  \nNT88 -> NT69 NT44  \nNT66 -> NT55 NT1  \nNT91 -> NT9 NT47  \nNT65 -> NT17 NT55  \nNT25 -> NT28 NT7  \nNT80 -> NT17 NT44  \nNT61 -> NT39 NT38  \nNT68 -> NT90 NT38  \nNT20 -> NT39 NT25  \nNT35 -> NT11 NT77  \nNT26 -> NT65 NT50  \nNT2 -> NT28 NT13  \nNT95 -> NT35 NT74  \nNT56 -> NT92 NT40  \nNT51 -> NT26 NT59  \nNT12 -> NT51 NT20  \nNT39 -> NT90 NT1  \nNT70 -> NT12 NT90  \nNT35 -> NT88 NT53  \nNT40 -> NT44 NT98  \nNT47 -> NT55 NT61  \nNT50 -> NT18 NT85  \nNT38 -> NT95 NT33  \nNT40 -> NT25 NT85  \nNT7 -> NT49 NT73  \nNT18 -> NT76 NT91  \nNT98 -> NT40 NT56  \nNT93 -> NT66 NT64  \nNT73 -> 't6'  \nNT12 -> 't85'  \nNT17 -> 't73'  \nNT16 -> 't71'  \nNT69 -> 't93'  \nNT18 -> 't14'  \nNT93 -> 't80'  \nNT18 -> 't19'  \nNT20 -> 't17'  \nNT20 -> 't0'  \nNT28 -> 't20'  \nNT69 -> 't93'  \nNT68 -> 't82'  \nNT7 -> 't74'  \nNT66 -> 't26'  \nNT9 -> 't46'  \nNT90 -> 't22'  \nNT12 -> 't16'  \nNT39 -> 't9'  \nNT92 -> 't52'  \nNT1 -> 't70'  \nNT24 -> 't88'  \nNT28 -> 't26'  \nNT59 -> 't6'  \nNT47 -> 't72'  \nNT92 -> 't93'  \nNT8 -> 't7'  \nNT12 -> 't1'  \nNT50 -> 't59'  \nNT80 -> 't55'  \nNT33 -> 't8'  \nNT92 -> 't56'  \nNT53 -> 't43'  \nNT12 -> 't11'  \nNT66 -> 't46'  \nNT51 -> 't98'  \nNT44 -> 't56'  \nNT9 -> 't5'  \nNT13 -> 't31'  \nNT57 -> 't18'  \nNT53 -> 't45'  \nNT92 -> 't76'  \nNT70 -> 't82'  \nNT35 -> 't91'  \nNT0 -> 't29'  \nNT11 -> 't87'  \nNT66 -> 't92'\n\nLooking at this, I can see that certain rules directly produce terminal symbols. For example, NT92 -> 't52' directly gives the first token in the string, t52.\n\nSo the first token is produced by NT92. Therefore, the derivation must start with NT92 \u2192 t52, generating t52 and whatever else.\n\nBut the next token is t14. So looking for rules that produce t14.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NT18 rule produces t14:\n\nNT18 -> t14\n\nBut wait, is NT18 present? Let's check.\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT18 appears here:\n\nNT18 -> t14\nNT18 -> t19\nNT20 \u2192 NT39 NT25 (no terminal here)\nSo, NT18 can produce t14 or t19.\n\nIn the string, after t52 comes t14, so we can use NT18 \u2192 t14.\n\nSo the first two tokens are t52 and t14, which are the results of NT92 \u2192 t52 and NT18 \u2192 t14.\n\nWait, but how? Because S \u2192 NT49 NT74 or similar. Wait, actually, S is the start symbol and is in the right-hand side of productions.\n\nWait, looking back, S can be NT49 NT74, NT49... So S itself is a combination of two non-terminals. Therefore, the string is built by substituting S into two parts, each of which can be further expanded.\n\nBut perhaps the string is a result of a leftmost derivation, starting from S,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-78","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the string `t70 t31 t5 t9 t93 t14` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S, and the terminal symbols are represented by lowercase letters, while uppercase letters (like NT*) seem to be non-terminals.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals: `t70 t31 t5 t9 t93 t14`. Each token (like t70, t31) corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nI'll begin by building the parse tree from the string upwards to see if it can derive from S.\n\nLet's break down each token:\n\n1. `t70` corresponds to the production NT70 \u2192 t70. Looking at the grammar, NT70 is an uppercase non-terminal that is defined as NT70 \u2192 t70. So, `t70` can be derived directly.\n\n2. `t31` corresponds to NT31. Checking the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT31. Hmm, maybe it's derived from a combination of non-terminals. Wait, but in the provided grammar, there's no rule for NT31. That might be an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan the grammar again for NT31. Scanning through, I don't see any rule for NT31. So, maybe the string can't be generated because `t31` isn't directly expressible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps `t31` is derived from a combination of other non-terminals. Let me check the productions for NT31. I don't see a rule where NT31 is a non-terminal on the left-hand side. So, if NT31 doesn't appear in any production, it's impossible for `t31` to be in the string. That would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to derive NT31 through other non-terminals. Let me think. Suppose NT31 is reachable through a chain of productions. Let me see if any production ends with NT31.\n\nLooking through the grammar, none of the left-hand sides are NT31. All the rules start with NT49, NT39, etc., but not NT31. So, NT31 doesn't appear in any of the productions. That suggests that `t31` cannot be part of any string derived from this grammar.\n\nTherefore, `t31` appearing in the string would make the string ungenerable by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any production rules. Let me scan the list again. At the end, I see rules like NT9 \u2192 t5, NT13 \u2192 t31, etc. So, yes, NT13 \u2192 t31 is present. So, `t31` can be derived directly from NT13 through the production NT13 \u2192 t31.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier. I thought there's no rule for NT31, but actually, NT13 \u2192 t31 exists. Wait, no, NT13 \u2192 t31? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar does have NT13 \u2192 t31? Let me check the rule listed. I see several rules:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t26\nNT59 \u2192 t6\nNT47 \u2192 t72\nNT92 \u2192 t56\nNT51 \u2192 t98\nNT44 \u2192 t56\nNT9 \u2192 t5\nNT13 \u2192 t31\n\nYes, there is a production NT13 \u2192 t31. So, `t31` can be derived from NT13. That means `t31` is allowed in the string if NT13 is part of the derivation. But wait, the question is the string starts with t70, which comes from NT70, and so on. But in the string, t31 is the third token, so that would require that in the parse tree, the NT corresponding to the parent productions derive to t70, t31, etc.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier because I thought `t31` comes from NT31, but actually `t31` comes from NT13. So, in the string, `t31` is present, meaning that in the parse tree, the non-terminal that produces it must be NT13.\n\nSo, let's see: The string is t70 t31 t5 t9 t93 t14.\n\nt70 comes from NT70 \u2192 t70.\n\nNow, the next token is t31, which is from NT13 \u2192 t31.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT13 is not a direct production in any of the rules except NT13 \u2192 t31. So, that would mean that NT13 must be a non-terminal that only produces t31. But wait, in CNF, the productions must consist of zero or two non-terminals. So, NT13 \u2192 t31 is a valid production in CNF if t31 is a terminal, which it is.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, there are other non-terminals, like NT70, NT39, etc., all of which eventually resolve to terminals. So, perhaps the entire string is a series of terminal productions.\n\nBut back to the string: t70 is from NT70, t31 from NT13, t5 from NT5, t9 from NT9, t93 from NT93, and t14 from NT14.\n\nWait, but looking back at the grammar, NT93 is present. For example, in the rules:\n\nNT93 \u2192 t80\nNT18 \u2192 t19\nNT93 \u2192 t64\n\nBut also, in the rules, we have NT93 \u2192 t80 and others. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT93 -> 't80'\nNT18 -> 't14'\nNT93 -> 't64'\n\nHmm, that can't be both. Wait, wait, maybe I translated it wrong. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under the Non-terminals, it seems that some rules produce terminals directly:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT70 -> t70\nNT13 -> t31\nNT35 -> t34\nNT47 -> t74\nNT77 -> t92\nNT67 -> t58 (Wait, no, perhaps I looked at the wrong part. Let me parse again.)\n\nWait, actually, looking at the list, I see:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT70 -> t70, so that's clear.\n\nNT13 -> t31, which is another terminal. So that's fine.\n\nBut looking further, I realize that some of the productions are rules that produce two non-terminals, so those are the structure-building rules.\n\nBut the string given is a sequence of terminals. So, in the parse tree, the string would correspond to a root symbol S, whose productions are all non-terminals, then those non-terminals expand into other non-terminals and terminals, etc., until we reach the root.\n\nWait, another approach: let's try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is t70 t31 t5 t9 t93 t14.\n\nSo, the entire string is a sequence of terminals. The first token is t70, which comes from NT70 \u2192 t70.\n\nSo, the first symbol is derived from NT70. So, the parse tree would have NT70 as the root, and the first production is to t70, so that's a leaf.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's a flat list of terminals, so to parse this, the root of the parse tree must be S, and the derivation must result in exactly the string.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string is considered as a single derivation starting from S. So, the string should be the result of expanding S through a series of productions, ending in terminal symbols only, in the given order.\n\nBut S can produce NT70, which then produces t70, etc. Wait, but perhaps other rules also lead to the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated by another non-terminal. Let's see.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t70, which comes from NT70 \u2192 t70, so the root of the parse tree must be NT70, expanding to t70. Then, the next token would be part of another expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each production must be a complete sub-tree.\n\nWait, maybe the string is a concatenation of several terminals, each of which is produced by some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet me try to write the string: `t70 t31 t5 t9 t93 t14"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to have several rules, each leading to terminals or other non-terminals. Some of these non-terminals directly map to terminal strings, like NT0 -> 't77', etc.\n\nThe string to check has six tokens: t20, t20, t1, t14, t82, t80, t82. Wait, that's seven tokens. Let me count again: t20, t20, t1, t14, t82, t80, t82. Yes, seven.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal in a production can only expand to two non-terminals or a single terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-95","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string to check is \"t9 t55 t20 t17 t92 t70 t1\". \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure can make it somewhat easier to analyze the grammar for string generation.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that it consists of several production rules. The starting symbol is S, and the string starts with t's, so I think t's are terminals while the rest seem to be non-terminals. \n\nThe given grammar has strings that break down into various non-terminals, each of which eventually produce a terminal string. My task is to see if \"t9 t55 t20 t17 t92 t70 t1\" can be derived from the grammar by tracing the possible productions.\n\nLet me list out the productions and see if I can map them to the given string.\n\nStarting from S, the first rule is S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So, S expands into NT74 followed by NT44. \n\nLooking at the productions for NT74: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. Then NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25, and NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66.\n\nWait, let me break it down step by step.\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99 (using the CT rule A\u2192BC)\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25 (another CT rule)\nNT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66 (another CT rule)\n\nNow, NT8's production: NT8 \u2192 't7' (terminal). So NT8 in the string would produce 't7'.\n\nThen, NT25: looking at the productions, NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7.\n\nSo far, S \u2192 NT74 NT44 \u2192 NT39 NT99 \u2192 [NT8 NT25] NT99.\n\nNT8 is 't7', and NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7. Now, NT28 is a terminal? Wait, let me check the productions. NT28's production isn't directly listed as a terminal, but wait: the production for NT28 is not present in the given data. Wait, I'm looking through the productions, and I see that NT28 \u2192 't20', right? Because the last line says NT28 \u2192 't20'. So NT28 is a terminal now.\n\nSo, NT28 \u2192 t20. So, NT25 \u2192 t20 NT7.\n\nNow, NT7: I don't see a production rule for NT7 in the given list. Hmm. Wait, the list does have NT73 \u2192 t6, but NT7 isn't listed. Maybe that's an issue. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, I'm looking through the provided grammar, and I notice that NT73 is there, but NT7 isn't. So maybe NT7 is a terminal itself or perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I should approach this from the other end. The string starts with t9, t55, etc. Let's see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nLooking for t9: It's listed under NT73 \u2192 t6, but that's 't6'. Hmm, I see 't9' is present in NT12 \u2192 't16' and other entries. Wait, actually, looking at the end of the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 't5', NT11 \u2192 't87', NT13 \u2192 't31', etc.\n\nWait, but the string has t9 as the first element. So, does any non-terminal produce t9? Let's check the production rules. I see a line: NT35 \u2192 't88'. Wait, but t9 isn't directly there. Wait, looking through the given data:\n\nWait, I see that NT9 \u2192 't5', which would produce 't5', but not 't9'. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the productions again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to try building the string step by step by backtracking through the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each t in the string back to the necessary non-terminals.\n\nThe string is: t9 t55 t20 t17 t92 t70 t1.\n\nLet's list them in order as t9, t55, t20, t17, t92, t70, t1.\n\nEach t corresponds to a production where the non-terminal eventually produces that t.\n\nSo, starting from the first t, t9: Does any non-terminal directly produce t9? Let me look through the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar list, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t9. So, perhaps t9 is produced by a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake because I might have overlooked a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any non-terminal that, when expanded, includes t9 in its derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps using the CYK algorithm, but that's more systematic. But maybe I can try a top-down approach.\n\nThe overall string is seven tokens long, so it must be that S expands into two non-terminals, which then expand further until all tokens are terminals.\n\nLet me see:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44. The string starts with t9, t55, etc., but let's see if t74 and t44 can produce the respective tokens.\n\nWait, t9 isn't generated by NT74. Looking at NT74's productions: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. Then, NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25, and NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the string is possible by seeing if each production can lead to the respective t token.\n\nWait, let me take each token and see which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nt9: Does any NT produce t9? Checking through the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't5' ( produces 't5' ). I don't see a direct production for t9. Hmm, maybe t9 isn't a terminal and I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, perhaps t9 is part of a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the string doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a way that each part of the string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nAlternative approach: Work backwards from the string.\n\nt1 is the last token. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t1.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice lines like NT18 \u2192 't14', NT17 \u2192 't73', NT16 \u2192 't71', etc. Wait, but where is t1 produced?\n\nLooking again, I don't see any production that directly goes to 't1'. So perhaps t1 is a non-terminal that produces some chain. Wait, perhaps I missed a production.\n\nLooking at the end of the provided grammar, the last line says NT92 \u2192 't52'. But t52 isn't in our string. Alternatively, perhaps 't1' is produced by a non-terminal. Wait, looking again, the grammar has NT70 \u2192 't74', but that's 't74', not 't1'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't1' is somewhere else. Maybe I should look for 't1' in the grammar. Looking through, I see NT20 \u2192 't17' and other similar productions. But t1 isn't directly produced anywhere. Hmm, that's a problem because the string ends with 't1', and if no non-terminal produces 't1', then the string is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the productions. Did I miss a production where a non-terminal produces 't1'? Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nLooking through the provided list, I don't see any production that produces 't1'. So, perhaps that token is impossible, meaning the entire string is invalid.\n\nBut wait, maybe the last token 't1' is an error. Alternatively, maybe the production NT17 \u2192 't73' and NT73 \u2192 't6'? But that's not 't1'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check if any non-terminal can produce 't1'.\n\nReviewing the grammar: I see NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50. NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT55. NT55 is a terminal? Wait, looking at the provided grammar, NT55 is present as NT55 \u2192 't5'? Because I see:\n\nWait, let me look again. For example, NT55 \u2192 NT17 NT55 seems repetitive, but wait, actually the productions for NT50 are: NT50 \u2192 NT18 NT85.

{"custom_id":"request-123","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether the string `t73 t16 t85 t74 t19 t1 t98 t9` is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It starts with S, which can be rewritten in multiple ways, like S -> NT74 NT44 and others. Each of these right-hand sides (RHS) consists of two non-terminals. So, the production rules seem to expand non-terminals into more non-terminals until we reach terminals, which are represented by the 't' followed by a number. The terminals include 't73', 't16', etc., and I notice that the string we're evaluating includes several of these.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t73 t16 t85 t74 t19 t1 t98 t9`. Let's split it into individual tokens: [\"t73\", \"t16\", \"t85\", \"t74\", \"t19\", \"t1\", \"t98\", \"t9\"]. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the RHS of S consists of combinations like NT74 and NT44. So, each S production leads to two NTs. I need to see how these NTs can be expanded to reach the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me consider the first production for S: S -> NT74 NT44. NT74 and NT44 are non-terminals, so each needs to expand into something. I'll check the productions for NT74 and NT44.\n\n- NT74 -> NT39 NT99\n- NT44 is not directly given, but looking at the list, I notice NT44 is used in S -> NT44, but I don't see a production for NT44 in the provided rules. Wait, that might be an issue. Oh, looking again, the initial S productions only have NT74, NT11, NT40, etc. I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the first production is S -> NT74 NT44. But in the list of NTs, I don't see a production for NT44. That means if S produces NT44, but NT44 doesn't expand further, which would make S produce a terminal, but in our string, we have t74 and t44 as parts. Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I missed that NT44 is actually a terminal.\n\nWait, no, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so all productions are from non-terminals to two non-terminals except for the terminals. So, each production in the grammar is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or two terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the given grammar, all the productions for NTs on the RHS are either two NTs or one NT and a terminal, right? Because they all end with a terminal at the end.\n\nWait, for example, S -> NT74 NT44: NT74 and NT44. Then, NT74 -> NT39 NT99, which leads to more NTs. Then, NT39 -> NT8 NT25, etc. But in the token list, we have 't73', 't16', etc. So perhaps somewhere in the expansion, an NT becomes a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the NT productions, each production either replaces an NT into two NTs or eventually ends in a terminal. Wait, but in the list provided, each production for an NT always has two NTs on the RHS or two terminals? Let me check.\n\nNo, actually, in the given rules, each production rule's RHS is either two NTs or one NT and a terminal? Or wait, do any produce a single terminal?\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems that all the production rules for NTs have two non-terminals on the RHS except for the ones that end in terminal strings. Wait, for example, NT73 -> 't6', so that's an NT producing a terminal. Similarly, NT17 -> 't73', etc. So, some of the NTs directly produce a terminal, while others produce two other NTs.\n\nSo, our string consists of eight terminal symbols: \"t73\" \"t16\" \"t85\" \"t74\" \"t19\" \"t1\" \"t98\" \"t9\". Each is a single token.\n\nNow, to generate this string, the derivation should start with S and, through a series of productions, expand into these terminals in sequence. So, I need to see if the string can be generated step by step from S.\n\nGiven that S generates two NTs, the string must be a sequence of derivations from each of those NTs.\n\nLet me map each terminal to their possible NT productions, i.e., find which NTs can produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- 't73' is produced by NT73.\n- 't16' is produced by NT16.\n- 't85' is produced by NT85.\n- 't74' is produced by NT74.\n- 't19' is produced by NT19.\n- 't1' is produced by NT1.\n- 't98' is produced by NT98.\n- 't9' is produced by NT9.\n\nWait, looking at the rules provided:\n\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT85 -> 't38'\n- NT74 -> 't73'\n- NT19 -> 't18'\n- NT1 -> 't70'\n- NT98 -> 't22'\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- Wait, actually, there seem to be multiple rules that produce the same terminal. For example, NT12 -> 't16' and NT16 -> 't71'; but in the given list, NT73 -> 't6', NT16 -> 't71', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map each terminal to possible NTs that can produce it.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to work backward from the given string and see if each terminal can be replaced by the corresponding NT, which in turn can be replaced by more NTs until we reach S.\n\nLet's consider the string: t73 t16 t85 t74 t19 t1 t98 t9.\n\nLet me list the order of terminals:\n\n1. t73\n2. t16\n3. t85\n4. t74\n5. t19\n6. t1\n7. t98\n8. t9\n\nSo the string is a sequence of these terminals, meaning that in the parse tree, it's a left-to-right derivation. Hmm, but in CFG, derivations can be leftmost, middle, rightmost, etc. But regardless, each terminal must correspond to an NT in the grammar.\n\nLet me map each terminal to their NTs:\n\n- t73: can come from NT73 or any NT that produces t73 as a terminal.\nLooking at the given rules:\nNT73 -> 't6'\nWait, no, 't73' is produced by NT73 directly. Wait, the given rules for NT73 is 't6', which means NT73 produces 't6', not 't73'. So for terminal 't73', which NT produces it? Looking through the provided rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't73'. Only NT73 -> 't6', so perhaps 't73' is not directly produced by a single NT.\n\nWait, that seems like a problem. Because in the string, we have 't73', which needs to be produced by some NT. Looking back at the provided rules, I don't see any NT that produces 't73'. The only NT that directly produces a terminal is NT1, for example, which is 't70'.\n\nWait, so perhaps 't73' is not present as a terminal in any NT production, which suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Because none of the NTs produce 't73' as a terminal.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT17 -> 't73'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- etc.\n\nAh, I see. NT17 -> 't73'. So, NT17 can produce 't73'.\n\nSo, 't73' is in the string, which comes from NT17. Similarly, let's map all the terminals:\n\n1. 't73' -> NT17\n2. 't16' -> NT16\n3. 't85' -> NT85\n4. 't74' -> NT74\n5.

I need to determine if the string \"t45 t18 t9 t43 t76 t91 t29 t73\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let me start by breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I'm not super familiar with all the Chomsky normal form rules, but I know that each production is either A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to be in CNF because each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal. That's a relief because it simplifies things a bit.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of terminals separated by spaces. So, it's \"t45 t18 t9 t43 t76 t91 t29 t73\". Each of these terms corresponds to a specific rule in the grammar. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me list out each term and the corresponding production in the grammar:\n\n1. t45: Looking at NT45 in the rules, I see that NT45 is derived from NT92 and NT48. Wait, no, looking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT45. Wait, no\u2014looking again, the given rules include:\n\nLooking at the NT53 production: NT53 \u2192 NT43 NT45. So, t43 is from NT43, which is a terminal, and t45 is from NT45?\n\nWait, no, the productions listed have NT43 as a terminal, because in the grammar, NT35 \u2192 NT11 NT77, and NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1, and some others. So for each terminal in the string, I need to find a production path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' represents a non-terminal that produces that terminal. Wait, no. Let me correct that: in the given grammar, each rule is of the form NTsomething \u2192 other NTs or a terminal. However, in the string, the t's seem to be terminals. But looking at the grammar, the terminals are represented by rules ending with 't...' for example, NT98 \u2192 t56, etc.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Actually, in the grammar, the terminals are the ones like 't45', 't18', etc. So in the string, those are the terminals we need to match.\n\nSo each 't45' in the string must match the '45' part of a production. But looking back, the rules are all in the form of NTx \u2192 ... So each NTx is a non-terminal, which when derived, gives a string of other non-terminals until it's converted into terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

First, I'm a bit new to parsing grammars, so I'll have to break it down step by step.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All the productions here look like they're transforming non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. The string has 9 tokens, so the derivation should generate exactly these tokens. Let's list them:\n\nt55, t45, t1, t26, t80, t31, t76, t43, t70\n\nEach token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Now, I need to see if each of these can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is CNF, the only way to derive terminals is through the bottom-up approach, starting from the top symbol S. Each step must produce two symbols on the left, leading to the string. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce different combinations based on the rules given. For example, S can become NT74 NT44. But looking through the productions, I don't see S directly leading to any terminal symbols. All S rules produce non-terminals. So, the first step is that S must be split into two non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me examine the string to see which parts might correspond to which rules. Let's split the string into pairs since each production splits into two symbols. For example, the first two symbols are t55 and t45, so perhaps they come from a production of some NT leading to t55 and t45. But looking at the grammar rules, I don't see any NT that directly goes to t55 and t45.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by looking for each terminal and seeing how they can be produced by non-terminals. For instance, looking for where each t is produced:\n\nt55 is only produced in the NT40 rule: NT40 \u2192 t71 t71? Wait, no, looking back, NT40 is not directly a terminal. Wait, let me go through the productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT16 \u2192 t71\n\nBut nowhere does NT40 produce a terminal. Hmm, looking at the end of the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't85'\n\nWait, no. Let's check each rule where non-terminals are expanded into terminals:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't74'\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, each rule is a production like NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, etc. So the strings are sequences of NT symbols until they eventually expand into terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if the given string can be decomposed into such a sequence.\n\nLet's look at the string: t55 t45 t1 t26 t80 t31 t76 t43 t70\n\nLet me split this into pairs, moving from the start to the end:\n\nt55 t45, t1 t26, t80 t31, t76 t43, t70\n\nWait, but that's five pairs, which doesn't make sense since originally S is a single symbol. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be split into a tree where each production leads to the next level of symbols.\n\nLet me try to model the derivation from S:\n\nS starts as S \u2192 NT74 NT44, or any other combination depending on which rule is used.\n\nBut none of the NT74 or NT44 produce terminals, so we need to see what they produce.\n\nLooking at NT74: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nThen NT39: NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\nNT8: Looking through the rules, NT8 isn't directly producing anything because I don't see any NT8 \u2192 a.

{"custom_id":"request-141","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string `t87 t76 t46 t93 t8 t98 t19 t80 t19` is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The structure looks a bit hierarchical, so maybe it's a binary tree.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has a bunch of NT productions, which are non-terminals. The NT rules seem to split into two NT parts, like S -> NT74 NT44, etc. Each NT eventually resolves into a string of terminals or further splits. Some of the NTs directly produce t followed by numbers, which are terminals. So each NT production either produces a terminal or a pair of NTs.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t87 t76 t46 t93 t8 t98 t19 t80 t19`. Let me count the tokens: 9 tokens. So it's a string of 9 tX terms.\n\nGiven that the CFG is in CNF, the parse tree should be a binary tree with 9 leaves. However, the number of leaves in a binary tree (which is what a CNF grammar generates) must be 2^n +1 for some n. Wait, maybe I should calculate. For a parse tree with 9 leaves, it would imply that the tree has a certain structure. Let me think: each production splits into two, so for n levels, the number of leaves is 2^n.\n\nWait, for example, if the start symbol S produces two NTs, which each produce two NTs, and so on, down to terminals. So each level increases the number of non-terminals. The number of terminals at the bottom would be 2^k for k levels. But in this case, 9 isn't a power of two. The closest power is 8 (2^3), but 9 is one more. That suggests that the string might not be possible because CNF grammars generate only strings with a length that's one less than a power of two.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, in CNF, each production is A -> BC or A -> a. So each step doubles the number of symbols. Starting from S, the initial symbol is one non-terminal. Each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So the length of the string generated is 2^k, where k is the number of times a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals. Wait, actually, the number of terminals is the number of leaves in the parse tree. Each non-terminal split adds another level, so the number of terminals is the number of leaves, which is 2^m where m is the number of splits.\n\nBut in our case, the string has 9 tokens. 9 isn't a power of two. Let me see: 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16. 9 is not a power of two. So that would imply that the string can't be generated by a CFG in CNF because the length isn't matching the required structure. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm mixing something up. I recall that the number of terminals in a derivation from a start symbol in CNF is 2^k for some k >= 0, but starting from S, which is one non-terminal. So the initial number is 1 symbol. If each production replaces a symbol with two, then after one step, 2 symbols. After two steps, 4, etc. But that's when all derivations are to terminals, right? Actually, in a parse tree, if every non-terminal is expanded into two non-terminals, then the number of leaves (terminals) is 2^m, where m is the height of the tree minus one.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the possible lengths. Let's see:\n\n- If the string is of length 1, it's possible only if S directly produces a terminal.\n\n- For length 2, it's S -> NT1 NT2, each NT1 and NT2 produce terminals.\n\n- Length 4: Each NT splits into two NTs, so S -> NT1 NT2, NT1 -> a b, NT2 -> c d. So the string is a b c d, four tokens.\n\n- Length 8: Each of those NTs can split again. So 8 tokens.\n\nWait, but the string given is 9 tokens. 9 isn't a power of two, so that would make it impossible. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each NT production is either a terminal or two NTs. So each production in the RHS contributes either a terminal or splits into two more symbols. Therefore, the number of terminals in the string must be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree. The number of leaves in a binary tree is 2^k for some k, where k is the number of splits. So starting from S, each split doubles the number of symbols.\n\nFor example, S splits into two NTs (level 2), each can split into two more NTs (level 3), etc. So the number of terminal symbols after full expansion would be 2^(number of splits). So, to get 9 leaves, there needs to be a parse tree where some branches stop earlier than others, but in CNF, each non-terminal must split into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, all non-terminals must split completely into terminals, meaning the parse tree must be a perfect binary tree, leading to a number of terminals equal to a power of two.\n\nWait, no, actually, in CFGs, you can have different depths for different branches. But in CNF, each split must produce exactly two symbols. So for the entire string, each NT must produce two NTs until you reach the terminals. Therefore, the total number of terminals is 2^n for some n. So 9 isn't a power of two, so the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to have some NTs stop earlier, but I don't think so because in CNF, each RHS is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So you can't have a single NT produce a terminal and another NT, for example, in one step. Because the production must be A -> BC or A -> a. So each NT must split into two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, the parse tree must be a full binary tree, leading to a number of terminals that's a power of two. So 9 is not a power of two, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar consists of several production rules, and the string uses terminals (like 't88', 't14') and non-terminals (like 'S', 'NTx', etc.). \n\nFirst, let's recap the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the productions are mainly from S to NT followed by another NT. Some of the NTs have further productions, either to two NTs or to a terminal. \n\nMy plan is to represent the string as a parse tree and see if I can derive it using the grammar. But since the string has 10 tokens, it's going to be a sequence of 10 terminals, which implies that the parse tree's leaves will correspond to these.\n\nI'll start by listing all the production rules and their terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, they have some terminals as follows:\n\n- NT27->'t6' \n- NT12->'t85' \n- NT17->'t73' \n- NT16->'t71' \n- NT69->'t38' \n- NT18->'t14' \n- NT93->'t80' \n- NT18->'t19' \n- NT20->'t17' \n- NT20->'t0' \n- NT28->'t20' \n- NT69->'t93' \n- NT68->'t82' \n- NT7->'t74' \n- NT66->'t26' \n- NT9->'t46' \n- NT90->'t22' \n- NT12->'t16' \n- NT39->'t9' \n- NT92->'t52' \n- NT1->'t70' \n- NT24->'t88' \n- NT28->'t26' \n- NT59->'t6' \n- NT47->'t72' \n- NT92->'t93' \n- ... etc. \n\nI notice that some non-terminals produce specific terminals. For example, NTx->'tY' where Y is a number.\n\nNow, looking at the string: `t88 t14 t1 t46 t88 t6 t14 t87 t20 t52`\n\nI can look for each terminal in the list above to see which non-terminals can produce them. \n\n- t88 comes from several NTs: NT24, NT54 (wait, actually in the grammar, there is NT54? Or does NT56 produce 't56'? Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check the grammar more carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some production rules have non-terminals on both sides. For example, NT74 -> NT39 NT99, which are non-terminals. But other productions include terminals.\n\nSo, I need to find all the NTs that can produce each terminal in the string.\n\nLet's go through each token:\n\n1. t88: From the grammar, looking at the productions, I see NT24->'t88' and NT56->'t56', but wait, 56 is a number and in the grammar, NT56 is a non-terminal. Looking through the list, I see NT56->'t56' is there. So t88 comes from NT24, right? Wait, in the grammar, NT24->'t88'. So t88 is from NT24.\n\n2. t14: From the grammar, looking for NTs that produce t14. I see NT18->'t14'. So 't14' comes from NT18.\n\n3. t1: Looking at the grammar, NT1->'t70'. Hmm, that's 't70'. Wait, maybe NT1 is 't70', but we have 't1' in the string. Maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Oh, wait, maybe it's NT1->'t70', but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe another non-terminal produces 't1'. Scanning through, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't1'. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I should note this down as a possible issue.\n\nWait, let me check the provided grammar again more carefully. Looking through all the rules:\n\n- I see NT27->'t6' but that's a different number. NT12->'t85', NT17->'t73', etc.\n\nWait, looking for a production where the terminal is 't1'. Hmm, maybe it's from NT1->'t70' but that's 70, not 1. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some NT that produces 't1'. Alternatively, maybe 't1' is a terminal that's not defined in the grammar. Oh no, that would make the string invalid. Because in the given grammar, many NTs map to terminals, but 't1' isn't produced by any NT except perhaps NT1, which produces 't70', which doesn't match 't1'. So that's a problem. \n\nBut let's see the rest first, maybe it can still form a parse tree.\n\n4. t46: Checking the grammar, I see NT9->'t46'. So t46 comes from NT9.\n\n5. t88: Again, from NT24.\n\n6. t6: From NT27->'t6'.\n\n7. t14: Again, from NT18.\n\n8. t87: Hmm, do any NTs produce 't87'? Let's check the grammar. I see NT19->'t76', NT20->'t17' and 't0', etc., but 't87' isn't listed directly. Wait, maybe NT87 exists but isn't defined here. Wait, but in the given grammar, all NTs are defined, right? Let me check if 't87' is produced by any NT. Hmm, looking through the list, I don't see a production where terminal is 't87'. So that's another problem. Without a production for t87, this string can't be derived.\n\n9. t20: From NT20->'t17' and 't0'. Wait, in the grammar, NT20 has two productions: NT20->'t17' and NT20->'t0'. So 't20' is not directly produced by any NT. Hmm, that's a problem again because 't20' isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n\n10. t52: From NT92->'t52' because NT92->'t52' is a terminal. Alternatively, NT92->'t52' is direct.\n\nWait, so far, for tokens 1,2,4,5,6,7,10, there are corresponding NT productions. But tokens 3,8,9, and maybe others are problematic.\n\nLet me list the issues I found:\n\n- 't1' is not produced by any NT in the grammar. Because looking at all the NT->tan_terminal rules, I don't see 't1' as a terminal.\n- 't87' is not produced by any NT.\n- 't20' is not produced by any NT.\n\nSo, if any of these tokens can't be matched to their respective NT productions, the entire string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No' because some terminals in the string don't correspond to any NT in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains terminals 't1', 't87', and 't20', which are not directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string is not generated by the given grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, let me remember that in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The provided grammar seems to fit that, except some of the rules have more than two non-terminals on the right side. Wait, checking that, no, all productions look like they have two non-terminals except for some that might be mixing terminals and non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. \n\nActually, looking closer, some right-hand sides have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, which might complicate things. But Chomsky normal form strictly requires that all productions are either A->BC or A->a. So if any production has more than two non-terminals or includes terminals in the middle, that's a problem. Let me check if any production here has more than two non-terminals. Looking through, I see that some rules have two non-terminals, like S-> NT74 NT44. Others have rules like NT77 -> NT92 NT85, which are two non-terminals. Wait, is any rule combining a mix of terminals and non-terminals? For example, does any production have a terminal in the middle of non-terminals, like A->aB? Let me scan a few: \n\nLooking at NT56 -> NT92 NT40. Both are non-terminals. Similarly, NT51 -> NT26 NT59. Okay, seems like all non-terminals on the right. Then I see NT53 -> NT45, which is two non-terminals. Wait, no, NT45 is a terminal? Or is NT45 a non-terminal? Hmm, in the end, we have a string of terminals and some non-terminals. So during parsing, the grammar would replace non-terminals with their productions until only terminals remain.\n\nBut to determine if the string is generated, maybe it's easier to see if the string can be parsed from the bottom up using the productions, starting from S. Since the string is t52 t46 t43 t7 t19 t93 t22 t55 t7 t85 t98, I should see if each terminal in the string can be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar. \n\nLet's list the terminals in the string: t52, t46, t43, t7, t19, t93, t22, t55, t7, t85, t98. \n\nEach of these terminals must correspond to a production in the grammar. For example, t52 comes from somewhere, like S -> NT74 NT44, and then NT74 has a production that ends with t52. Similarly, t46 must come from a rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I need to find which non-terminals produce each of these terminals. \n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT52 isn't a non-terminal; terminals are like t52, so NT52 isn't in the grammar. Instead, looking for rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I notice several that directly produce a single terminal. For example:\n\n- NT70 -> 't6'\n- NT12 -> 't85'\n- NT17 -> 't73'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT20 -> 't0'\n- NT28 -> 't20'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n- NT9 -> 't46'\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT50 -> 't59'\n- NT80 -> 't55'\n- NT33 -> 't8'\n- NT92 -> 't56'\n- NT53 -> 't43'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT66 -> 't46'\n- NT51 -> 't98'\n- NT44 -> 't56'\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT57 -> 't18'\n- NT53 -> 't45'\n- NT92 -> 't76'\n- NT70 -> 't82'\n- NT35 -> 't91'\n- NT0 -> 't29'\n- NT11 -> 't87'\n- NT66 -> 't92'\n\nFrom this, I can make a list of which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\n- NT70 -> t6\n- NT12 -> t85\n- NT17 -> t73\n- NT16 -> t71\n- NT69 -> t93 (twice)\n- NT68 -> t82\n- NT20 -> t17 (twice), t0\n- NT28 -> t20\n- NT9 -> t46 (twice)\n- NT50 -> t59\n- NT80 -> t55\n- NT33 -> t8\n- NT92 -> t56 (twice)\n- NT53 -> t43 (twice)\n- NT12 -> t11 (twice)\n- NT66 -> t46 (twice), t92\n- NT51 -> t98\n- NT44 -> t56\n- NT9 -> t5\n- NT13 -> t31\n- NT57 -> t18\n- NT53 -> t45\n- NT92 -> t76\n- NT70 -> t82 (twice)\n- NT35 -> t91\n- NT0 -> t29\n- NT11 -> t87\n- NT66 -> t92 (twice)\n\nHmm, so that's the mapping. Now, each terminal in the string must be the result of applying these directly or via other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t52, t46, t43, t7, t19, t93, t22, t55, t7, t85, t98. \n\nWait, t52 isn't directly in the list. So how can we get t52? The rule S -> NT74 NT44 produces t56. So NT74 -> ... let's see the rule for NT74: NT74 -> NT39 NT99. NT99 has rules: NT99 -> NT51 NT66. NT51 -> NT26 NT59, and so on. Maybe we can trace this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t52, which must come from a production of a non-terminal that terminates in t52. But looking through the rules, none of the non-terminals directly produce t52. So that's a problem. If the string starts with t52 and there's no NT rule that directly produces t52, then it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar. \n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the rules again. NT74 -> NT39 NT99; NT99 -> NT51 NT66; NT51 -> NT26 NT59; NT66 -> NT55 NT1; NT55 -> NT47 NT65; NT65 -> NT17 NT55; NT59 -> NT6 NT8; NT8 -> t7; NT47 -> t72; NT6 -> t26; NT72 -> t74. So NT72 -> t74. Wait, how does that help us?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Perhaps I should approach this differently. Since S starts the string, and the string is a series of t's, perhaps we can derive the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to perform a top-down parsing using the grammar to see if the string can be generated. However, given the complexity of the grammar, that might be time-consuming.\n\nBut the critical point is that t52 isn't produced by any rule in the grammar. Looking through each rule for non-terminals, I don't see any that produce t52. So if the string has t52 as the first symbol, it's impossible because there's no rule that can derive t52.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Do any non-terminals directly produce t52?

{"custom_id":"request-180","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t22 t7 t45 t82 t71 t5 t52 t55 t45 t18 t85`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars only have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, all non-terminals are in the start symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit because I see rules like S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which are two non-terminals on the right, and other rules where non-terminals produce either terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string we need to check consists of terminals: t22, t7, t45, etc. So each token in the string should correspond to a terminal symbol in one of the production rules.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which can produce two non-terminals: NT74 and NT44. So S \u2192 NT74 NT44. \n\nNow, let's break down each of these non-terminals.\n\nFirst, NT74. Looking at the production rules, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. That continues until NT74 can be broken down into terminals or more non-terminals. Wait, actually, looking further down, I see NT74 leads into NT99, which then goes to NT51 and NT66. NT51 goes to NT26 and NT59, and so on down to terminals. Specifically, I see a chain that eventually leads to terms like 't49' and so on. Let me try to follow a path:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\nNT8 \u2192 't7'\nNT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\nNT28 \u2192 NT26 NT50\nNT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50 (Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the production is NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50. Then NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT55, NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65. This seems recursive, but wait, looking back, I realize that some non-terminals eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the production for NT47: NT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61. NT61 \u2192 NT55 NT56. NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65. Oh, this is getting complicated, and I'm seeing cycles. But in the string, we have terminals like 't45' which is in the production NT53 \u2192 NT12 NT98, and NT98 \u2192 't40' and NT12 is a terminal 't11'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the entire string as a series of terminal symbols and see if the grammar can produce them in order.\n\nThe string is: t22, t7, t45, t82, t71, t5, t52, t55, t45, t18, t85.\n\nLet me list these terminals in order: t22, t7, t45, t82, t71, t5, t52, t55, t45, t18, t85.\n\nI need to see if these can be generated by the grammar, each step producing one terminal and the non-terminals breaking down into others.\n\nStarting from S, the first production is S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So we'll need to see if NT74 and NT44 can generate the first two terminals t22 and t7.\n\nWait, no, because the first step is S \u2192 NT74 NT44, so the entire string would have the symbols generated by NT74 followed by NT44. But the string starts with t22, which is a terminal. So either S would directly produce a single terminal, but S's productions are both two non-terminals. Therefore, t22 can't be generated directly by S, which suggests that the string might not start with a terminal, which would mean it's invalid. But that doesn't make sense because the string starts with a terminal, so perhaps the start symbol S can't directly produce it.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The grammar has S as the start symbol, and S's productions are all two non-terminals. So to get a string that starts with a terminal, we must have a production that eventually produces that terminal through a chain.\n\nSo for example, NT74 \u2192 ... \u2192 t22.\n\nBut in the first production, S splits into two non-terminals, so the string must be the concatenation of the strings derived by each of these two non-terminals. So the string is the concatenation of what NT74 produces and what NT44 produces.\n\nSo the given string is t22 t7 t45 t82 t71 t5 t52 t55 t45 t18 t85. Since it's a sequence of 11 terminals, the production chain would have to break into two parts, each part generating a portion of the string.\n\nWait, but S produces two non-terminals, so the string would be the concatenation of what NT74 produces and NT44 produces. So to get a single string, each of these two non-terminals would need to generate a substring, and their concatenation would form the entire string.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t22. So that must come from NT74's production chain, meaning that when NT74 expands, it ends up generating t22 as the first terminal. Then, the second part, t7, would come next, which would be the first terminal of NT44's expansion.\n\nBut let me check what NT74 expands into. From the grammar, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. Then NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25, and NT8 is 't7'. So that's promising because the first t is t7. Then, NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7, so after 't7', we get 't28' or something, but wait, actually, let me think step by step.\n\nWait, let's go through NT74's derivation:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\nNT39's expansion is NT8 (which is 't7') and NT25.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\n\nSo NT25 expands into NT28 and NT7, which are 't28' and 't7' respectively.\n\nBut in our string, after t7 (the first 't7' as the second token), the third token is t45. So let me see if that aligns.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's approach this more methodically.\n\nFirst, build the parse tree for the string. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, we can try to split it into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t22, t7, t45, t82, t71, t5, t52, t55, t45, t18, t85.\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT74 NT44.\n\nSo the string must be the expansion of NT74 followed by the expansion of NT44.\n\nThus, split the string into two parts: part1 from NT74 and part2 from NT44.\n\nBut the first symbol is t22, so t22 must come from NT74's expansion.\n\nSo let's look at what NT74 can expand into. From the grammar:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\nNT8 \u2192 't7'\n\nSo in the expansion, after 't7', we have what comes from NT25.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second symbol is 't7', so if we're using S \u2192 NT74 NT44, the first symbol of the string (t22) would have to come from NT74, but the second symbol (t7) would have to come from NT44. But in the grammar, S's productions produce two non-terminals, so the string would be the concatenation of the expansions of these two non-terminals. So the first non-terminal's expansion would produce a substring starting at index 0, and the second non-terminal would produce the rest starting from index 1.\n\nBut the string starts with t22, which doesn't match 't7' from NT8. Therefore, the second part, NT44, would have to start with t22. Let's check NT44's productions.\n\nLooking at NT44's rules: NT44 \u2192 NT92 NT85 or NT40 NT85.\n\nSo NT44 can produce either NT92 and NT85 or NT40 and NT85.\n\nBut we need to see if any of these paths can lead to 't22' as the first terminal.\n\nLooking at NT92's productions: NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The end symbols (the 't' in the string) are terminals, so I should check the productions to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the non-terminals that can produce terminals are the ones whose productions end with 't', like NT74, NT51, etc. Also, some NTs directly have 't' as their production.\n\nNow, the given string has a series of terminals: t16, t88, t45, t46, t7, t31, t31, t73, t98, t85, t38, t43.

Let me double-check. The grammar has NT16 \u2192 t71, so that's t71. So if t16 is in the string, that production can't be used.

So, for example, if NT19 can produce NT20, which in turn can produce t20 eventually. Wait, NT20 can produce t20, right? Let me check.\n\nYes, looking at the rules, I see NT20 \u2192 t20. So NT20 \u2192 t20. Therefore, to get t19, maybe we go through NT20, but actually, NT19 produces NT20 in one rule. Let me check: NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57 and NT19 \u2192 NT20 NT25. Wait, no, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me look again.\n\nActually, in the grammar, I see NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57 and NT19 \u2192 NT20 NT25. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check the grammar again carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT19, I see:\n\nNT19 -> NT17 NT57\n\nand\n\nNT19 -> NT20 NT25.\n\nWait, but looking back, maybe I made a mistake. The user provided a long list of grammar rules. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57\n- NT19 \u2192 NT20 NT25.\n\nHmm, that's not directly producing 't19', but leading to other non-terminals. Then, those non-terminals eventually produce t's.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. Let's try to see which NTs can produce the terminals in the string.\n\nThe string is: t71 t19 t16 t55 t93 t29 t26 t22 t76 t29 t55 t85.\n\nLet me list each terminal and see which NT could produce it, either directly or indirectly.\n\n1. t71: NT16 \u2192 t71\n2. t19: Looking for NTs that produce t19.\n3. t16: NT16 \u2192 t71 and also possibly other NTs.\n4. t55: Looking for NTs that produce t55.\n5. t93: Looking for NTs that produce t93.\n6. t29: NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66, but I don't see a direct t29. Wait, let me check. NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66; NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18, then NT18 might produce t18. Hmm, maybe it's involved indirectly.\n7. t26: Looking for NTs that produce t26.\n8. t22: Looking for NTs that produce t22.\n9. t76: Looking for NTs that produce t76.\n10. t29: Same as above.\n11. t55: Need to find NT that can produce t55.\n12. t85: Looking for NTs that produce t85.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to work from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has three production rules:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo initially, any derivation starts with one of these. Let's see which of these can lead to the string.\n\nLooking at the first symbol in the string: t71. So we need to see if any of the NTs derived from NT74, NT11, or NT40 can lead to t71.\n\nLooking at the grammar for the NT74 NT11, etc.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT74 NT44.\n\nNT74 has production NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, and NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25, etc.\n\nWait, let me see if any of these can produce t71 directly or indirectly.\n\nFrom NT74:\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99 \u2192 (NT8 NT25) (NT51 NT66) \u2192 (NT8 NT25) (NT19 NT18) \u2192 which might not lead to t71.\n\nAlternatively, if NT74 can produce t74 eventually, but looking at NT74's production: NT74 \u2192 t74. Wait, yes! Yes, in the grammar, I see NT74 \u2192 t74. So NT74 can produce t74. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 t77, and so on.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT74, I see:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nBut then, looking further down, under NT74: \n\nWait, let me check the user's grammar again.\n\nLooking back, under NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99 is one production, but I don't see a direct production for NT74 \u2192 t74. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking at the very bottom of the grammar list, I see:\n\nNT74 -> t74\n\nYes, so NT74 can produce t74. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 t77, etc.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT74 NT44, then NT74 can produce t74 and NT44 can produce t44 or other NTs.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t71, so perhaps S \u2192 NT16 NT71? Let's see. No, the productions for S are only the three given: S \u2192 NT74 NT44, etc. So starting with S, we have to use one of these three production rules.\n\nWait, but S is at the start, so any derivation starts with S, so the first step is an S \u2192 something, which is a pair of non-terminals. So the first two symbols in the string are t71 and t19.\n\nWait, that complicates things. Because the string starts with t71, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which are two non-terminals. So perhaps the string of terminals must be generated by a sequence of productions that eventually eliminate non-terminals.\n\nWait, in any context-free grammar, the derivation process involves replacing non-terminals with their productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo the string consists of a sequence of terminals. The key is to see if there's a way to derive this string from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t71 t19 t16 t55 t93 t29 t26 t22 t76 t29 t55 t85.\n\nThat's 12 symbols, so during the derivation, we'd have to split into a parse tree that ultimately results in this sequence.\n\nFirst, each step in the derivation"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-220","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm new to this, so I'll need to figure out how to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar and the string we're dealing with. The grammar has a start symbol S, and the string we're checking is a sequence of terminals (the 't' followed by numbers). Each production rule in the grammar is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the terminals are the 't's and numbers.\n\nThe string is: t45 t20 t59 t6 t70 t11 t59 t52 t72 t76 t22 t46 t71.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a production that goes directly to a terminal. That means each rule is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192t, where t is a terminal.\n\nThe approach here is to parse the string using the grammar, ensuring that every terminal in the string can be derived by the productions, and that the overall structure follows the rules set by the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string as a sequence: t45, t20, t59, t6, t70, t11, t59, t52, t72, t76, t22, t46, t71.\n\nI'll try to parse this string as if I'm a top-down parser, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar's S rules all start with NT:\nS \u2192 NT49 NT74 (which becomes t52)\nWait, looking at the productions, S can be NT49 NT74, and NT74 \u2192 ... Let's check.\n\nWait, actually, the provided grammar has S as:\nS \u2192 NT49 NT74\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo S branches into these three options. Each NT is a non-terminal that can produce two NTs or a terminal.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t45. So I need to see if t45 can be derived from S. Let's look at the rules where NT eventually leads to t45.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should start from the root S and see how the string can be generated.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 13 tokens. Let's count: 13 tokens. Since CNF requires each expansion to produce two symbols, the tree depth would be log2(13), but that's not straightforward, as 13 is not a power of 2.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me start by noting that each rule is of the form A \u2192 BT, where A is replaced by two non-terminals, or possibly a terminal.\n\nGiven the string, each token is a terminal. So, starting from the root S, which can produce three options. Each of these options is a pair of NTs that produce each a terminal or another pair.\n\nSo, the string is 13 tokens long. Let's see if it's possible for S to generate this.\n\nS is followed by a production generating NT49 NT74, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. Each of these would correspond to two NTs.\n\nBut the string is 13 tokens, so we need to see how that could split. 13 is an odd number, so perhaps each expansion doesn't just handle the entire string but builds a tree where each leaf is a token.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is to try to reconstruct the parse tree from the string, working from the leaves up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can work backwards by trying to match the string's tokens to the grammar.\n\nAnother idea is to check if the string is a leftmost derivation. Starting from S \u2192 NT1, NT2, and so on.\n\nWait, each non-terminal can be expanded into two non-terminals, except for those that directly produce a terminal. So, the string must be a sequence of such terminals arising from the initial S via such expansions.\n\nGiven that, let's try to approach each token and see if it can be matched.\n\nFirst, consider S \u2192 NT49 NT74.\n\nNow, let's look at NT49's production rules. From the provided grammar, NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47. So NT49 cannot produce t45 directly. Wait, no. NT49's productions are all in the grammar. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for NT49, the only production is NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47.\n\nSimilarly, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. So, NT74 can't produce t45.\n\nWait, maybe another path. Let's try S \u2192 NT11 NT24.\n\nThen NT11 \u2192 NT87 NT44, and NT24 \u2192 NT28 NT7 (t7). So, from NT11, the first expansion is producing a non-terminal, and NT24 can also expand into another pair or a terminal. \n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to see if each token in the string can be matched by some production.\n\nBut that might not guarantee the structure, as the order and grouping matter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to see if the string is a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me attempt to split the string into pairs of symbols that correspond to the grammar productions.\n\nWait, another approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing context-free grammars. The CYK algorithm builds a table where each cell corresponds to a substring, and determines the non-terminals that can generate that substring.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm can be applied efficiently.\n\nBut since I'm going through this manually, let's outline the CYK approach.\n\nFirst, the string has 13 tokens. Let's denote them as positions 0 to 12.\n\nWe can represent this as S(0,12) is true if S can produce the substring 0-12.\n\nFor CYK, we can initialize the table for each single token, then build up the table.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can check for possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: t45. Let's see if any rule produces t45.\n\nLooking into the grammar, do any NTs directly produce t45?\n\nLooking through the list of NTs, I see NT53 \u2192 t43, NT12 \u2192 t1, NT35 \u2192 t9, NT71 \u2192 t71. Wait, looking at the grammar output, NT53 produces t43, and I don't see any NT directly producing t45 in the terminal list provided.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the list includes NT53 \u2192 t43. But is there any NT that directly produces t45? It seems in the given grammar, there's no rule where an NT directly becomes t45.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me look again. The provided grammar's list of NT\u2192terminal includes:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 t43\n- NT92 \u2192 t56\n- NT93 \u2192 t80\n- NT66 \u2192 t26\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT90 \u2192 t22\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT12 \u2192 t1\n- NT50 \u2192 t59\n- NT80 \u2192 t55\n- NT33 \u2192 t8\n- NT92 \u2192 t76\n- NT51 \u2192 NT18 NT19\nWait, no, some entries are terminals, others are non-terminals.\n\nI need to list all the NTs that directly correspond to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, the NTs that produce a terminal are those that have a production ending with 't' followed by a number.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT12 \u2192 t1\n- NT24 \u2192 t88\n- NT44 \u2192 t56\n- NT56 \u2192 t26\n- NT66 \u2192 t46\n- NT70 \u2192 t70\n- NT92 \u2192 t56 (multiple rules)\n- NT53 \u2192 t43\n- NT18 \u2192 t14\n- NT19 \u2192 t9\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- NT28 \u2192 t20\n- NT38 \u2192 t95\n- NT40 \u2192 t44\n- NT47 \u2192 t72\n- NT57 \u2192 t18\n- NT55 \u2192 t61\n- NT65 \u2192 t17\n- NT68 \u2192 t82\n- NT71 \u2192 t71\n- NT74 \u2192 t74\n- NT85 \u2192 t64\n- NT88 \u2192 t69\n- NT91 \u2192 t90\n- NT93 \u2192 t66\n- NT73 \u2192 't6' (Wait, no, that's a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar provided is in CNF, which means each production rule has at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That should make parsing a bit more straightforward. The starting symbol is S, which expands into NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. Each of these non-terminals then breaks down further until we reach terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers and some single-character strings.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t11 t46 t7 t17 t5 t76 t59 t17 t52 t9 t6 t31 t26`. So there are 13 tokens here. I remember that each production step in a CNF grammar involves splitting the non-terminal into two parts, which then each resolve into more symbols until we hit the terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, it's a good candidate for a recursive descent parser or even a shift-reduce parser. But without getting into the parser implementation, maybe I can approach this by looking for possible derivations that lead to the given string.\n\nLet me consider the starting symbol S and its possible expansions:\n\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nI'll try to see which of these could generate the string step by step.\n\nStarting with option 2: S -> NT11 NT24. Let's see if NT11 and NT24 can derive the parts of the string.\n\nNT11 can derive 't87' according to the rules (looking at NT11 -> 't87'). Wait, in the given string, I see a token 't87' as the 7th element (assuming counting starts at 1), which is t17 t5 t76 t59 t17 t52 t9 t6 t31 t26. Wait, no, let me check the string again. The string is `t11 t46 t7 t17 t5 t76 t59 t17 t52 t9 t6 t31 t26`.\n\nWait, S -> NT11 NT24. So the first symbol would be NT11, which produces 't87', but the first token in the string is 't11', not 't87'. So maybe S isn't NT11, unless I'm mixing up the order.\n\nWait, actually, S is NT11 and NT24. So when we expand NT11 and NT24, each of them will produce a sequence of symbols. Each non-terminal will produce a certain number of tokens.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't11', so perhaps the starting symbol needs to derive 't11' as the first token. Alternatively, maybe the production is S -> something else. Let me check if any of the other productions for S could start with 't11'.\n\nLooking at the productions for S, the only one that has NT11 is S -> NT11 NT24. So if S expands to NT11 NT24, then the first symbol is NT11. But according to the given string, the first token is 't11', so maybe that's possible if NT11 produces 't11' somewhere.\n\nBut wait, NT11 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. So for NT11 to produce 't11', it must be that in its expansion, it directly goes to 't11' or is part of a production that eventually leads there.\n\nLooking at the productions above, in the given rule list, I don't see a direct production for NT11 leading to 't11' or 't87'. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at NT11: Does it have a production where NT11 -> 't11'? Looking through the list, I don't see that. The rule for NT11 is NT11 -> 't87'. So that suggests that NT11 directly produces 't87'. So if S starts with NT11, it produces 't87' as the first token, but the string's first token is 't11', not 't87'. So that means S can't start with NT11 in this case because that would produce 't87' instead of 't11'. So maybe the starting symbol isn't S -> NT11 NT24, or perhaps we need a different path.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to combine the productions so that the two NTs (NT11 and NT24) split into the necessary tokens. Let's look at the productions for NT24. In the given rules, I don't see NT24's production. Looking through the list, I see NT24 under NT13 -> 't31' and NT12 -> 't1', but not NT24. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me go through the rules again to see if NT24 has a production. Hmm, looking through the list, I don't see NT24 as a non-terminal on the left side of any rule. Instead, I see NT12 -> 't1' and others. So that would mean NT24 is somehow a terminal symbol, but in Chomsky normal form, only the start symbol can be a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, all non-terminals are on the left, and terminals are on the right, except terminals can also appear on the left as a single terminal. So perhaps S can directly produce terminals? Wait, no, S is a non-terminal, so it must produce other non-terminals first, then those can produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, all the rules either have two non-terminals on the right (Chomsky normal form) or perhaps a single non-terminal. Hmm, looking at the rules, I see some have two non-terminals, others have one non-terminal, like NT77 -> NT92 NT85, but then also NT74 -> NT39 NT99, and so on. Wait, actually, no, looking through, some rules have two non-terminals, but others seem to have one, like NT0 -> NT77 NT34, etc. Wait, no, it looks like all the rules have two non-terminals except for a few. For example, looking at the given rules, most have two non-terminals, but some have a single non-terminal, like NT7->'t74' and others. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the first rule is S -> NT74 NT44 (two non-terminals), next S->NT11 NT24 (two), then S->NT40 NT92 (two).\n\nThen NT74->NT39 NT99 (two), NT49->NT0 NT47 (two), and so on.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see any rules where a non-terminal is expanded into a single terminal. Each rule either has two non-terminals or, in the terminal case, it's a production like NT7->'t74', but wait, no: actually, looking at the rules, for example, NT7->'t74' would be a rule where NT7 produces a terminal. But in CNF, only the start symbol can produce a terminal (or perhaps not, but in CNF, each rule must have one or two non-terminals on the left). Wait, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or one non-terminal? No, Chomsky normal form requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Except for the case where the start symbol can produce a single terminal. Wait, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, Chomsky normal form requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So in CNF, a non-terminal can produce either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So in the given grammar, every production either has two non-terminals or one terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, for example, NT74->NT39 NT99 is two non-terminals, which fits. But then, is there any production where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal?\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see any rules like NT11 -> 't87'; no, that's a production. Wait, in the rules, I see some like NT7->'t74'\u2014is that a terminal? Or am I misunderstanding how the rules are written?\n\nWait, perhaps the rules are written in a different format. For example, a rule like NT74 -> 't74' would mean that NT74 produced a single terminal 't74'. Similarly, NT7->'t74' would mean NT7 can produce 't74'.

The string is \"t0 t26 t74 t11 t71 t16 t8 t5 t26 t22 t70 t74 t80 t5\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. It looks like all the non-terminals (like S, NT49, NT39, etc.) eventually resolve to terminal symbols represented by 't' followed by a number. Each production rule in the grammar takes a non-terminal and expands it into two terminals or another non-terminal. But since we only care about the terminals in the end, I can focus on how each non-terminal resolves down to a terminal.\n\nThe initial non-terminal is S, which can expand into combinations of NT pairs. Let me list the production rules for S:\n\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these involves two NT symbols. So, the string we're evaluating must be a sequence that can be broken down step by step using these rules.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt0 t26 t74 t11 t71 t16 t8 t5 t26 t22 t70 t74 t80 t5\n\nI notice it's a sequence of 14 tokens. Each production for S expands into two NT symbols, so each expansion step adds two tokens. To get 14 tokens, starting from S, we might have 7 steps, each expanding a non-terminal into two terminals. But since the string is built from the start symbol S, which is two NTs, perhaps the tree is a binary expansion, but I need to trace back the possible path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a leftmost derivation. Let's start by identifying which non-terminals resolve to which terminals.\n\nLet's list the production rules for each non-terminal to see how they expand:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT74 -> NT39 NT99\n- NT99 -> NT51 NT66\n- NT51 -> NT26 NT59\n- NT26 -> NT19 NT18\n- NT18 -> NT76 NT91\n- NT76 -> NT2 NT68\n- NT68 -> NT90 NT38\n- NT90 -> NT40 NT56\n- NT40 -> NT16 NT80\n- NT16 -> t71\n- NT80 -> t55\n- NT38 -> NT95 NT33\n- NT95 -> NT35 NT74\n- NT74 -> NT39 NT99 (and since we already resolved these, but wait, earlier steps already included this)\n- Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's make this clearer.\n\nEach NT symbol eventually resolves to a terminal string, so perhaps I should build a mapping from each NT to the string it represents.\n\nStarting from the bottom:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT70 -> 't82'\nNT73 -> 't6'\nNT12 -> 't1'\nNT24 -> 't88'\nNT28 -> 't26'\nNT59 -> 't6'\nNT47 -> 't72'\nNT92 -> 't52'\nNT1 -> 't70'\nNT24 -> 't88'\nNT26 -> 't65 NT50' but wait, NT26 is in another rule. Hmm, I'm getting lost here. Let me approach this differently.\n\nI think it's best to approach this by working backwards, looking at the string and seeing if each terminal corresponds to the output of a non-terminal.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nThe first token is t0. Let's see what NTs produce t0. Looking at the production rules:\n\n- The rule NT77 -> NT92 NT85: NT77 might produce a t. Let me check NT92 and NT85.\nWait, no, actually, the productions are all rules for non-terminals that split into two other non-terminals or terminals. So, some NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't28'\nWait, no, wait. The list given in the grammar is longer. Let me go through each line to see which NTs directly produce 't's.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT70 -> 't82'\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT12 -> 't1' or 't85' wait, no. Wait, the lines are:\nLooking at each production:\n\nLines 30-50:\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT70 -> 't82'\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT24 -> 't88'\n- NT28 -> 't26'\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- NT47 -> 't72'\n- NT92 -> 't52'\n- NT1 -> 't70'\n- NT24 -> 't88'\n- NT26 -> 't65' and then another rule: NT26 -> NT19 NT18.

{"custom_id":"request-242","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me see how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. The CNF for a grammar means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except for the start symbol which can directly produce terminal symbols. Looking at the given grammar, I see that each production either breaks down non-terminals into two other non-terminals (the 'B' and 'C' parts) or directly maps to a terminal symbol.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, which produces two options:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these leads further into the non-terminals which eventually break down into other non-terminals or terminals. Our goal is to see if the string `t85 t16 t38 t9 t31 t73 t17 t31 t72 t1 t85 t70 t1 t17` can be derived from this grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminal symbols. In CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. The process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo, to verify the string, I need to check if each segment of the string can be derived step by step from the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens for clarity: t85, t16, t38, t9, t31, t73, t17, t31, t72, t1, t85, t70, t1, t17.\n\nWait, that's 13 tokens. Since each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, the number of symbols in the final string should be 2^n +1 where n is the number of productions. But that's a bit abstract, let me see.\n\nWait, actually, in a CFG starting with S, each step doubles the number of symbols if all non-terminals are expanded. But the given string has 13 symbols, which is an odd number. Since each production step from a non-terminal introduces two symbols, the total number of terminals in the final string should be 2^k, where k is the number of splitting steps from the start symbol. Hmm, 13 is not a power of 2, so that might be a problem, but maybe some non-terminals in the string are not split further. Wait, no, actually, in the end, each non-terminal must eventually be replaced by a terminal, so the total count should be a multiple of the splitting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has some symbols that are not derived from the grammar, which would cause a contradiction.\n\nBut let's approach this more methodically. Each symbol in the string must be derived through the grammar. So let's see if each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, and if they can be traced back through the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly correspond to terminals. For example, NT70 \u2192 t70, NT17 \u2192 t73, etc. So each terminal symbol in the string should be present in the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n- t85: Is '85' in the grammar? Looking at the grammar, I see NT1 \u2192 't74', NT17 \u2192 't73', but where is 't85'? Wait, in the given grammar, I see NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40, but in the terminal mappings, I see NT56 might not be a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NT productions end up corresponding to terminals. For example, looking at the end mappings:\nNT70 \u2192 't70', NT17 \u2192 't73', NT16 \u2192 't71', NT69 \u2192 't93', NT68 \u2192 't82', NT7 \u2192 't74', NT12 \u2192 't85' (from the string part), etc.\n\nWait, looking at the given productions, many NT symbols (like NT70, NT17, NT16, etc.) map directly to 't' followed by a number.

Oh, but looking at the mappings, in the grammar, NT28 \u2192 't26', etc., but I need to list the terminals as per the given mappings.)\n\nWait, let me go through the given mappings:\n\nLooking at all entries where NT \u2192 tX:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t70\nNT17 \u2192 t73\nNT16 \u2192 t71\nNT69 \u2192 t93\nNT68 \u2192 t82\nNT7 \u2192 t74\nNT12 \u2192 t85\nNT18 \u2192 t14 (Wait, is this a terminal? Or is it a production? Because in the grammar, NT18 might go to t14 directly, as per the mappings.\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 t40 (no, wait, let me check: Looking back, under the productions, I see lines like:\n  NT98 \u2192 t40\n  NT35 \u2192 t91\n  NT66 \u2192 t26\n  NT9 \u2192 t46\n  NT90 \u2192 t22\n  NT12 \u2192 t1\n  NT39 \u2192 t9\n  NT92 \u2192 t56\n  NT53 \u2192 t43\n  etc.\n\nBut in the grammar's productions, some NTs directly go to 't' followed by a number, others produce two NTs.

Or a non-terminal?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT18 \u2192 t14? No, check:\n\nActually, looking at the given grammar, for example, I see:\n\nNT18 is defined in the rules as NT18 \u2192 t14. Wait, yes, one of the production rules is `NT18 -> t14`.\n\nWait, but in the mappings I see lines like:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t76\n- NT18 \u2192 t19\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- NT20 \u2192 t0\n\nWait, no, wait, in the actual grammar, I see rules like `NT18 -> t76`, `NT18 -> t19`. So NT18 is a non-terminal that has multiple productions. Not all of its productions lead to terminals. So if a production of NT18 leads to t14, I think that's a separate rule.\n\nWait, actually, I need to clarify this. In the grammar, the production rules for NT18 are:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 BT76\n- NT18 \u2192 BT19\n- NT20 \u2192 BT17\n- NT20 \u2192 BT0\n- NT28 \u2192 BT7\n- NT12 \u2192 BT85\n- NT35 \u2192 BT88\n- NT26 \u2192 BT50\n- NT17 \u2192 BT57\n- NT66 \u2192 BT64\n- NT51 \u2192 BT98\n- NT44 \u2192 BT98\n- NT7 \u2192 BT74\n- NT66 \u2192 BT26\n- NT9 \u2192 BT46\n- NT61 \u2192 BT38\n- NT33 \u2192 BT8\n- NT92 \u2192 BT56\n- NT68 \u2192 BT82\n- NT73 \u2192 't6'\n- NT12 \u2192 't85'\nWait, but I think I got confused earlier. Maybe I should list all production rules from the grammar and see which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to reorganize the grammar and see which NTs directly map to terminals.

Since all the given rules follow this structure, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals, each of which corresponds to a symbol in the grammar. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules.\n\nStarting with the grammar:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nFrom the start symbol S, we can take one of these three paths. Let's explore each possibility to see if the string can be generated.\n\nLooking at the first production: S -> NT74 NT44. So, after expanding S, the first two symbols must be NT74 and NT44. However, our string starts with \"t93\", which is the terminal symbol for NT73. Since the first production leads to NT74, which starts with \"t74\", not \"t93\", this path doesn't seem to match the string's beginning. Maybe we need to keep S and switch to another production.\n\nAlternatively, the string starts with \"t93\", which corresponds to NT93 -> 't93'. Let's look at the productions for NT93. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT93 -> 't80' and NT93 -> 't46' from the production NT92. Wait, no, looking again, there's no direct production for NT93 except possibly through other non-terminals. Wait, checking more carefully:\n\nFrom the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT73 -> 't6'\nNT70 -> 't73'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT24 -> 't88'\nNT28 -> 't26'\nNT59 -> 't6'\nNT47 -> 't72'\nNT92 -> 't93'\nNT8 -> 't7'\nNT12 -> 't1'\nNT50 -> 't59'\nNT80 -> 't55'\nNT33 -> 't8'\nNT92 -> 't56'\nNT53 -> 't43'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT66 -> 't46'\nNT51 -> 't98'\nNT44 -> 't56'\nNT9 -> 't5'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT57 -> 't18'\nNT53 -> 't45'\nNT92 -> 't76'\nNT70 -> 't82'\nNT35 -> 't91'\nNT0 -> 't29'\nNT11 -> 't87'\nNT66 -> 't92'\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Looking for \"t93\", which is NT92's production because NT92 -> 't93'. Wait, let me look at NT92's productions. Scanning the given rules, I see:\n\nNT73 -> 't6'\n\nNT12 -> 't16'\n\nNT24 -> 't88'\n\nNT28 -> 't26'\n\nNT59 -> 't6'\n\nNT47 -> 't72'\n\nNT92 -> 't93'\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the production NT92 -> \"t93\" is present. So NT92 can produce 't93', which is our first symbol. So if the first part of the string is t93, then the first symbol could be produced by NT92.\n\nBut how does NT92 get to 't93'? Let's see if NT92 can be derived. Wait, the grammar has S -> NT40 NT92, which is one of the productions. But that would make the first part NT40 and NT92, which would produce something like 't' followed by 't93'? Or wait, no\u2014let me think about it.\n\nWait, S can produce either NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. So the first token in the string is 't93'. So the first non-terminal must be NT92, because only NT92 -> 't93'. Let's see if S can go to NT92 via a production.\n\nLooking at S's productions, I see S -> NT40 NT92. So potentially, S can expand to NT40 and NT92. Then, NT40 can produce some symbols, and NT92 can produce 't93'.\n\nSo the first token 't93' would come from NT92. Now, looking at S -> NT40 NT92. That would make the first two non-terminals NT40 and NT92. NT40's productions would need to produce the subsequent symbols.\n\nWait, but the string is \"t93 t87 t92 t76 t43 t73 t87 t19 t85 t14 t52 t7 t74 t7 t98\". So after t93, the next is t87, so perhaps NT92 produces t93, and then the next symbol comes from the other non-terminal, which is NT40 in this case.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this using the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing strings in CNF grammars. CYK involves building a table to check whether the entire string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven that the string is of length 15 (assuming spaces are just separators and not part of the tokens), so the string is a sequence of 15 terminals: t93, t87, t92, t76, t43, t73, t87, t19, t85, t14, t52, t7, t74, t7, t98.\n\nIn CYK, we first represent the string as symbols, e.g., S = [t93, t87, t92, t76, t43, t73, t87, t19, t85, t14, t52, t7, t74, t7, t98].\n\nWe then create a table where rows represent positions in the string and columns represent the range of those positions. For each cell (i, j), we attempt to find a production rule that can generate the substring from i to j.\n\nSince the string starts with t93, which corresponds to NT92, I need to find a rule that produces t93. Looking at the grammar, NT92 is produced by NT52 (but I don't see that), wait no\u2014NT92's production is:\n\nLooking back at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT92 -> 't93'\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT92 -> 't56'\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. The provided grammar has:\n\nLine: NT92 -> 't93'\n\nAnd another line: NT51 -> NT52 t73\n\nWait, no, let me find it properly.\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I find:\n\nNT73 -> 't6'\n\nNT12 -> 't16'\n\nNT24 -> 't88'\n\nNT28 -> 't26'\n\nNT59 -> 't6'\n\nNT47 -> 't72'\n\nNT92 -> 't93'\n\nYes, I see that. So NT92 can produce 't93'. So in the first step, the first symbol t93 is produced by NT92.\n\nSo the first part of the string is handled by NT92, which is the first non-terminal. Now, S expands to NT40 and NT92, so the second non-terminal is NT40.\n\nNext, the second symbol is t87. So we need to see if NT40 can produce 't87' or if it can generate a sequence that includes 't87' as the next symbol.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT40. From the grammar:\n\nNT40 -> NT16 NT80\n\nSo NT40 must expand to NT16 and NT80. Then, looking at NT16 and NT80.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see NT40 directly; wait, actually, looking through, I see:\n\nNT40 is used in a production: S -> NT40 NT92.\n\nSo NT40 is a non-terminal. Looking at the rules for NT40, I don't see it directly; but perhaps through other rules. Alternatively, maybe NT40 is only on the left side, so its productions are inherited from wherever it appears."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-258","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, and the terminal symbols (like 't6', 't7', etc.) are represented as such.\n\nFirst, the string to evaluate is: `t87 t9 t45 t55 t87 t59 t91 t7 t73 t56 t11 t92 t55 t80 t11`.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, each terminal symbol is a two-digit number ending with 't', like 't87', 't9', etc. So each token in the string corresponds to a terminal, and possibly each corresponds to a single symbol in the grammar.\n\nNow, the initial symbol is S, which is defined as:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the start symbol S can be rewritten into two NT symbols, each of which is a non-terminal. Therefore, the parse tree will have S as the root, with two children which are each NT symbols, each of which then eventually derive into the terminals in the string.\n\nOur string has 15 tokens. Let me count: t87, t9, t45, t55, t87, t59, t91, t7, t73, t56, t11, t92, t55, t80, t11. That's 15 tokens. Each token is a single terminal, so each must be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nIn CNF, the rule for S can be applied once each derivation, but since we have 15 tokens, which is an odd number, that might be a problem because each application of S only adds two terminal steps, but maybe there's a way through the recursion.\n\nWait, no, actually, the total number of steps might not be directly tied to the number of tokens, but perhaps the tree depth could influence that.\n\nBut let's approach this step by step. First, for each terminal in the string, we can look up their productions to see which non-terminal they can come from. Alternatively, we can try to work backwards, starting from the string and matching it to the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t87. Let's see which NT symbols can produce t87. Looking through the grammar, under NT symbols:\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT19 NT99\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\nNT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12\nNT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\nNT76 \u2192 NT2 NT68\nNT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73\nNT18 \u2192 NT76 NT91\nNT93 \u2192 NT66 NT64\nNT73 \u2192 't6'\nOther NTs like NT12 are defined as 't85', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but each NT in the grammar can only derive one or two terminals depending on their productions. For example, NT73 is a terminal 't73', so that's a single terminal. Similarly, NT12 is 't85', which is also a single terminal.\n\nBut looking back, t87 is a terminal. Where can t87 come from? Let's check the NT productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nIs there any NT that directly produces 't87'? Let me check each production with a two-character terminal, like t87.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61\nNT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65\nNT61 \u2192 NT39 NT38\nWait, none of them produce 't87' directly.\n\nAlternatively, t87 could be derived from an NT that produces a string ending with 't87'. For example, perhaps NT99 can produce 't87' via some steps.\n\nWait, looking at NT99's production: NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66. Let's see, NT51 is another NT symbol, and NT66 is another NT symbol. NT66 can produce 't6' and 't46' according to the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps let me go to NT91: NT91 \u2192 NT64 NT90. Then NT64 is \u2192 NT65 NT13, and so on. This seems complex. Maybe a better approach is to try to find which NTs can directly produce each terminal in the string.\n\nLet's list all the terminals in the string again:\n\nt87, t9, t45, t55, t87, t59, t91, t7, t73, t56, t11, t92, t55, t80, t11.\n\nFor each of these, I need to find which NT can produce them directly. If an NT can produce that terminal, then I can see if the entire string can be derived from S.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's map each terminal to its possible NT source.\n\n- t87: Looking for NTs that can directly produce 't87'. Checking all NTs, I don't see any productions where an NT directly goes to 't87'. For example, NT73 is 't73', NT12 is 't85', etc. It seems that no NT directly produces 't87'. So if t87 is derived from an NT, the NT must produce a string that includes 't87', but since the grammar doesn't have any NT directly producing 't87', it's impossible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me double-check the grammar. Oh, wait: looking through the grammar, I see that NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT99. Neither of those produce 't87'. Similarly, NT59 is defined as NT26 NT59, which is a recursive production, but that doesn't produce 't87' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. In CNF, each production of a non-terminal is exactly two terminals. So, perhaps each symbol in the string must come directly either as a symbol from a production of a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, non-terminals can only produce exactly two other symbols: either two non-terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals, but since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the productions are each of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires that each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C can be non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So in CNF, it's possible for a non-terminal to produce a single terminal, which would be a production like A \u2192 a.\n\nBut looking back at the grammar provided, all the productions seem to be of the form where a non-terminal produces either two non-terminals or two symbols, some of which can be terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. Both NT39 and NT99 are non-terminals. So that's a two-step production, but no terminals involved yet.\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal directly produces a single terminal.

Each production seems to expand non-terminals (like S, NT..., and others) into other non-terminals or terminals ('t' followed by numbers). Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 b, where A, B, C are non-terminals and b is a terminal.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 't' terms followed by numbers, which are likely the terminals produced by the grammar. My goal is to trace back from the string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which can produce three options:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with two NTs. The given string starts with 't56', which suggests that one of the first NTs must produce 't56' as the first part, and the second NT would produce the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at the rules, let's check which NTs can produce 't56'. Scanning through the productions, I find:\n- NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40 (from NT56)\nBut wait, in the provided grammar, NT56 is defined as NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40, and the terminal 't56' corresponds to NT56. Hmm, but the rule for NT56 seems to produce non-terminals, not terminals. That's confusing because in Chomsky normal form, NT56 should be a non-terminal that can derive a terminal, but looking at the rules, it's not obvious.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules are written as non-terminals rewriting into a combination of non-terminals and terminals, which is possible in Chomsky normal form only for terminals. But actually, in this case, the NTs might be redefined to include terminals as well, but since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I notice that some NTs are defined with terminals, like NT77 -> NT92 NT85; that's not a terminal. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The rules are written as A \u2192 B C, and some of these B and C may produce terminals. For example, perhaps NT56 \u2192 t56. Yes, in the grammar, there's a rule NT92 \u2192 t52. Similarly, I should check for any NTs that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT62 \u2192 t20\n- Wait, no, actually, in the provided grammar, I see rules like:\nNT12 -> 't85', NT17 -> 't73', NT16 -> 't71', etc. So each of these NTs (like NT12, NT17, etc.) directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo, some NTs are terminals, while others produce a combination of NTs. The start symbol S can produce combinations of NTs, which in turn expand until we reach the terminals.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, so each 't' must correspond to a terminal derived from an NT.\n\nGiven that, let's try to break down the string into the possible NTs.\n\nStarting with the first 't56', which I need to find which NT corresponds to 't56'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT56 is defined as NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40. But NT56 is supposed to produce 't56', but the rule is two non-terminals, not a terminal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nWait, looking again, the rule for NT92 is: NT92 \u2192 NT85 NT66. But in another part, NT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12, which leads to NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13, and so on. But in the string, the first 't56' suggests that an NT directly produces 't56', but looking through, I don't see an immediate rule. Wait, perhaps I was wrong before. Let me check each NT's production.\n\nLooking for any rule where an NT directly results in a single 't'... For example, in the rules, I see:\n- NT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98\n- NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n- NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40\n- NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\n- NT95 \u2192 NT35 NT74\n- And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check which NTs have rules that include a terminal. But in the data provided, each rule is A \u2192 BC. The only way a terminal is produced is if one of the B or C is an NT that produces a terminal. So, for example, NT12 \u2192 't85' is a direct production. Therefore, to get 't85', we can have NT12 in the derivation.\n\nSo, to get 't56' as the first token, we need an NT that can derive 't56', but in the given rules, I don't see any NT with a direct terminal 't56'. So perhaps 't56' comes from a combination of NTs that expand into it.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, each NT's production is either two NTs or a terminal? No, looking at the provided grammar, it's all two NTs except for rules like NT12 \u2192 't85'. So every rule is A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C can be non-terminals or terminals only if they are defined as such.\n\nSo, for example, in the given grammar, NT12 \u2192 't85' is a direct production, but others like NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40 are two-step productions without terminals.\n\nBut in our string, we have 't56' as the first symbol, which would require that somewhere in the derivation, an NT that can produce 't56' must be used. Since in the grammar, no NT directly produces 't56', perhaps 't56' is derived from a combination of NTs. Let me check where 't56' could come from.\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps 't56' is a result of some non-terminal that eventually resolves to 't56'. For example, if NT56 produces two non-terminals, and those produce other non-terminals, until eventually, we get to 't56'. But that feels unlikely because in the provided string, 't56' is a direct token, which would require the NT to directly produce it, unless it's part of a larger chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this by looking at each production step by step and see if we can map the given string to the grammar.\n\nGiven the string: t56 t18 t80 t43 t74 t11 t98 t1 t52 t70 t46 t82 t55 t6 t98 t76.\n\nI'll try to parse this string from the start, seeing if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT74 NT44 (production 1) or S \u2192 NT11 NT24 (production 2) or S \u2192 NT40 NT92 (production 3). Let's pick one and see if it fits.\n\nLet's try S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So the first two symbols should be the results of NT74 and NT44.\n\nLooking at NT74: From the grammar, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. So the first symbol t56 can't be from NT74 because NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, which are non-terminals. So unless NT39 or NT99 produce a terminal, but in our case, the first symbol is 't56', which isn't directly produced by NT74.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check NT74's production: Yes, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. So t56 can't come directly from NT74, which means this production path might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if NT44 is involved in the first production. NT74 is the first NT in production 1, which we just saw doesn't produce a terminal. So option S \u2192 NT74 NT44 might not be helpful here.\n\nNext, try S \u2192 NT11 NT24. The first symbol is t56, so we'd need NT11 or NT24 to produce it.

{"custom_id":"request-280","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens: `t26 t92 t46 t11 t91 t88 t17 t71 t6 t85 t87 t87 t17 t87 t7 t20`. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. The grammar starts with the start symbol S, and the productions are all in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base cases where a non-terminal becomes a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that a lot of non-terminals lead directly to two terminals. For example, NT7->t74, which I assume is a base production. The string starts with `t26`, so I need to check if t26 can be derived from NT26. Indeed, looking at the productions, NT26 -> NT65 NT50. Wait, but NT65 -> NT17 NT19, and NT50 -> NT18 NT85. Hmm, this might get complicated, so maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step or see if each token in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nThe string given has 15 tokens. Since each production either produces a pair of terminals or splits into two non-terminals, the length of the string should correspond to a certain number of steps. For a CFG in CNF, the number of symbols in the derived string is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of productions. Wait, maybe that's not the right way to think about it. Alternatively, in CNF, each production step doubles the number of symbols. For example, starting from S, if S splits into two symbols, each of which may split into two more, and so on. So, the length of the string would be 2^n, where n is the number of splits. Since the given string has 15 symbols, which is 2^4 -1 (15 = 16-1), that suggests that n would be 4, but maybe that's not directly applicable because the exact tree structure matters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, seeing if each token can be matched starting from the start symbol.\n\nLet me try to start from the beginning. The string starts with t26, which is a terminal. So I need to find a production that starts with a non-terminal leading to t26. Looking at the productions, I see NT26 -> NT65 NT50. So NT26 produces two non-terminals. Next, the string has t92: so after NT26, the next two symbols should be NT65 and NT50. Let me check NT65. NT65-> NT17 NT19. So after t26 comes t92, which is produced by NT65. So the next symbol after t26 (t92) needs to be t92, meaning perhaps I'm following a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let me clarify: The string is t26 followed by t92. Since the production for NT26 yields NT65 and NT50, the next step would be to process each of those. So perhaps the structure is t26 (from NT26), then t92, then more symbols. But wait, the production is to split into two, so maybe the next tokens would be NT65 and NT50. But in the string, it's t26 followed by t92, which is t26 followed by t92, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the string is t26 t92 t46 t11 t91 t88 t17 t71 t6 t85 t87 t87 t17 t87 t7 t20. So the first symbol is t26. The production for t26 is NT26, which must be derived from a non-terminal that produces it. So perhaps I should look for the possible derivation starting from S.\n\nLet me think in terms of the parse tree. Starting from S, which branches into three possible productions: S->NT74 NT44, S-> NT11 NT24, S->NT40 NT92. Since the string starts with t26, which comes from NT26, we need to find a production path that can lead to t26 in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the first token t26 comes from a non-terminal that is part of the left-hand side of a production that gives t26 as one of the two terminals. Looking at the productions, I see NT26 is defined as NT65 NT50, which are both non-terminals, so t26 must be part of a derivation that starts higher up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S can produce something that leads to NT26 and another non-terminal. Let's explore this.\n\nLooking at the possible S productions:\n\nS->NT74 NT44: NT74 leads to t74, which is NT74->t74. Does t74 appear in the string? The string is t26 t92 t46 t11 t91 t88 t17 t71 t6 t85 t87 t87 t17 t87 t7 t20. So t74 is not in the string. So maybe this production isn't the one.\n\nNext, S->NT11 NT24: NT11 leads to t87 (since NT11->t87), and NT24 leads to t88 (since NT24->t88). The string has t92 early on, so I don't think this is the source as it would lead to t87 and t88, not t26.\n\nThird option, S->NT40 NT92: NT40 leads to various non-terminals, one of which is NT47 (since NT40->NT47 NT65), and NT92 leads to more non-terminals, one of which is NT64 and NT12. Let me check if any production from NT40 or NT92 can lead to t26.\n\nLooking at NT40, it transitions to NT47 and NT65. NT47 leads to NT55 and NT61, etc. Not sure. NT92 transitions to NT64 and NT12. Let's explore NT64.\n\nNT64->NT65 NT13. NT65 transitions to NT17 NT19. NT13->NT28 NT7. NT28 transitions to NT26. Ah, so from Nt64, NT64->NT65 NT13. NT13->NT28 and NT7. NT28->NT26 and NT7. Wait, in the string, the first token is t26, which is NT26->t26. So maybe there's a path:\n\nS->NT92->NT64 NT12.\n\nWait, no, NT92 transitions to various, like NT52, etc. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try to map all possible transitions that could lead to t26 in the string.\n\nLooking again at S->NT40 NT92. NT40 can lead to, for example, NT47 and NT65. Then NT47 can lead to NT55 and NT61. NT55 is from NT55->NT47 NT61. Wait, that doesn't help. Alternatively, NT40 could go to NT99, etc. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the first t26 comes from NT26->t26. So if S can produce a subtree that eventually leads to t26. So in the string, the first token is t26, then t92. So perhaps the parse tree has the first node as NT26, producing t26, and another non-terminal that produces the next symbols.\n\nWait, no, in the first step, S produces two non-terminals, so the string would have two symbols after S. So the string starts with t26, which would require that the first non-terminal in S's production is NT26, leading to t26, and the other non-terminal would produce the remaining parts of the string.\n\nSo perhaps S->NT26 NT92: wait, looking at the S productions, there isn't an S->NT26 NT92. Instead, the S productions are either NT74, NT11, or NT40 paired with another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that perhaps the S production is such that one of the options leads to NT26 and another part leads to the rest of the string. Let me see if any of the S production options have a non-terminal that leads to t26.\n\nLooking at each S production:\n\n1.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and one on the right, or a single terminal. The start symbol is S, and from the productions, I can see that S can be rewritten into combinations of NT49, NT11, NT40, etc. Each of these is a non-terminal that can further produce other NT symbols or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the right-hand sides of the non-terminals sometimes end up producing terminals, with entries like `NT7 -> 't6'`, which is a terminal symbol. Also, some non-terminals produce a mix of NT and terminals, like `NT9 -> 't5'` or `NT2 -> 't28 NT13'`, but wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are supposed to be two symbols on the right, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, no, CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals, so I might have to check if all productions are valid. Wait, looking again, for example, `S -> NT74 NT44` which is two NTs, so correct. But some of the NTs might produce a terminal and a NT, like `NT53 -> 't43'` \u2014 wait, that's a terminal and a terminal? Because 't43' is a terminal, but if it's a production, it can\u2019t be. Wait, no, the grammar is supposed to be in CNF, so every production must be of two non-terminals. Wait, that's not quite right\u2014CNF allows productions to have a single terminal and a non-terminal? Or wait, let me recall: in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal symbol. So a single terminal on the RHS is allowed, as long as B and C are non-terminals or terminals? Wait no, in CNF, terminals cannot appear on the left; all productions start with non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify. Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except possibly for the start symbol, which can produce a terminal directly. So in the given grammar, are any of the productions on the RHS a single terminal? Because in the provided grammar, I can see some lines like `NT9 -> 't5'`, which is a terminal, which would mean that it's allowed in CNF for the grammar to produce a terminal, so the start symbol S can eventually produce a terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, the initial S is a non-terminal, which then branches into other NTs or terminals. So given that, the grammar can derive strings with both non-terminals and terminals, with the terminals being at the leaves when derivation is complete.\n\nSo the string given is a sequence of 16 terminals. My task is to see whether this string can be derived by the grammar, starting from S, expanding all the NTs, until only terminals remain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree for the given string, trying to see if all steps align with the grammar rules.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, maybe breaking it down step by step would help. Let me first list out the tokens in the string:\nt59, t19, t55, t59, t38, t98, t1, t46, t56, t17, t46, t31, t38, t71, t92, t16, t45.\n\nWait, that's 16 tokens, which seems like a possible number of steps, but I'm not sure. Let me see.\n\nIn CNF, each production can be considered to expand a non-terminal into two symbols (non-terminals or terminals). So the parse tree would have the string as leaves, and the root would be S.\n\nBut since the string has 16 terminals, which is a power of 2 (2^4=16), it might have a parse tree of depth 4. So starting from S, each step can branch into two, leading to 16 leaves. But I'm not sure; perhaps I can try applying the grammar's productions from the top down.\n\nLet me consider starting with S. The initial productions for S are three options: NT49 NT92, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. So S can be split into two parts, each part is a non-terminal, which can then be further split.\n\nGiven the string is long, perhaps starting by finding possible branches that can cover large segments of the string.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the structure of the grammar and see if the string can be represented as a combination of the NTs.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, there are several non-terminals that directly expand into a single terminal, like NT9-> 't5', so these are leaf nodes. Likewise, some NTs produce two terminals, or sometimes two NTs.\n\nPerhaps I can look for segments in the string that match the rules.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be split into parts that align with the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t59 t19 t55 t59 t38 t98 t1 t46 t56 t17 t46 t31 t38 t71 t92 t16 t45.\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can find matches for any NT productions.\n\nLooking at NT19: from the grammar, NT19-> NT17 NT57.\n\nAnd NT57 can be either NT85 NT56 or NT19 NT99 or NT55 NT65.\n\nBut perhaps that's a detour.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backwards.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is 't45'. Do any NTs produce 't45'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT53-> 't43', NT71->'t46' (wait, no, looking for 't45'. Let me check the grammar rules: NT13-> 't31', NT57->'t72', NT77-> 't93', NT47->'t72', etc. Hmm, not seeing a production that directly produces 't45'. So perhaps 't45' is part of a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't45' is part of a bigger expansion. Maybe I should consider larger segments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the start symbol S and seeing if any of its productions can lead to this string.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see what strings are generated by the grammar. For example, all these NT transitions might correspond to certain arithmetic operations or some specific pattern. Alternatively, perhaps each NT corresponds to a state in a Pushdown Automaton.\n\nWait, since the grammar is in CNF, maybe using CYK algorithm would be appropriate to parse the string and determine if it is in the language. However, implementing CYK is time-consuming, but maybe a manual approach can work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps noting that in the grammar, some non-terminals produce only terminals, or specific sequences, which might impose certain constraints on the string.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to see if all the tokens are covered by the NTs' expansions.\n\nWait, the grammar's rules could represent a context-free grammar that represents a specific process, perhaps a binary tree traversal or some expression, but without the details, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for a way to split the string into the number of symbols equal to the number of nodes in a binary tree. If the string's length is 16, which is 2^4, maybe that can be parsed into 4 levels of binary splits.\n\nLet me try to see if any of the NTs directly correspond to the given string's tokens. For example, does NT19 produce some of the tokens?\n\nLooking up NT19's productions: NT19-> NT17 NT57.\n\nHmm. Maybe not immediately helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps certain sequences in the string align with NT productions.\n\nAnother approach: let's try to see if the string has any tokens that aren't present in the grammar's terminal productions. Wait, the grammar's terminal symbols are things like 't5', 't59', 't19', etc. So in our string, all the tokens do appear as terminals in the grammar, so that's possible.\n\nWait, wait, checking the grammar: NT7-> 't74', NT12-> 't85', etc. Wait, so the grammar has only a few terminals. Let's list all the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT7-> t74\nNT49-> t0\nWait, no: looking again, I see:\n\nAh, many NTs directly convert into a single terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-302","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're given a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and we need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string is: `t80 t22 t80 t17 t20 t71 t11 t92 t31 t71 t71 t73 t45 t16 t31 t17 t52`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Since it's in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals. However, looking at the given rules, I notice they have more complex right-hand sides, which is a bit unusual because CNF typically has exactly two non-terminals. This might be a mistake because, generally, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, not terminals or a mix. Alternatively, maybe this is just a misrepresentation, and the user has combined or misformatted some rules, but I'll proceed as per the given.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see terminals as strings that generate single symbols, like 't74', 't44', etc. So, the grammar consists of a set of non-terminals (NT) and terminals (t followed by a number). The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation process would involve substituting non-terminals according to the productions until we get all terminals. Each step would produce a tree of productions, leading to the final string.\n\nThe problem is that the number of rules is quite extensive, so manually tracking all possible derivations of such a string would be time-consuming. Instead, I can look for possible paths or rules that generate each part of the string step by step.\n\nLet's start by examining the string:\n\n`t80 t22 t80 t17 t20 t71 t11 t92 t31 t71 t71 t73 t45 t16 t31 t17 t52`\n\nI notice that each rule can produce at most a two-symbol string (since in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, so the number of symbols increases by one each time a production is applied). However, the string is quite long (18 symbols), so the derivation must involve a lot of steps.\n\nBut instead of expanding each symbol, perhaps I can look for the presence of the required terminals in the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nWait a second, in the given grammar, most of the rules are for non-terminals NT, and some of them produce another pair of non-terminals, with some replacing to terminals. Let's check which non-terminals derive to terminals and how many steps.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I can see:\n\n-_NT77 -> NT92 NT85\n- NT74 -> NT39 NT99\n- NT57 -> NT85 NT56\n... and so on.\n\nThen, certain non-terminals derive to terminals:\n\nLooking in the rules, for example:\n\n-NT10 -> 't74' but wait, most rules seem to have 't' followed by a number as their terminal, but I notice that in the rules, several have 't' followed by a number like \"t74\", but actually, each production either has non-terminals or a terminal. For instance:\n\nNT7 -> ... and finally \"\u2192 't74' NT73\"\n\nSo, the rules that have 't' followed by a number as part of the right-hand side must be the actual terminal symbols. So, each 't'... is a terminal. For instance, NT7 \u2192 ... 't74' ... means that NT7 can produce a 't74' followed by whatever NT73 produces.\n\nWait, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify: Each production in the grammar either expands a non-terminal to another non-terminal, or to a terminal followed by another non-terminal? Or perhaps each production may have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but since it's in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals except for the leaves, which are terminals.\n\nBut looking at the given grammar, most rules are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTyz. Some are of the form NTxy \u2192 't'number NTz, meaning the last symbol is a terminal. For example, NT7 \u2192 ... 't74' ... So, NT7's production includes a terminal and another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. CNF requires that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. But in some of the rules, like NT74 -> NT39 NT99, those are correct, but some rules like NT57 -> ... may have a terminal followed by a non-terminal, which would not fit CNF. Or perhaps, it's a mistake, and those rules should be the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is not in CNF as defined, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps each production is not necessarily in CNF, but the question states it is in Chomsky Normal Form, so I need to stick to that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is written incorrectly. For example, if a rule is NT74 -> NT39 NT99, that's a valid CNF production. Similarly, other rules are similar.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some seem to be:\n\nFor example, NT74 -> NT39 NT99\n\nNT40 -> NT16 NT80\n\nNT51 -> NT19 NT18\n\nThen, we see many rules that generate terminals. For instance, NT97 -> ... or perhaps looking for rules that produce terminals.\n\nWait, let's clarify the structure. Each rule is like NTxy \u2192 NT... something, until in some cases, a rule might have a terminal followed by a non-terminal.\n\nFor example, let's look for a rule like NT80 -> 't22' NT something.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I find:\n\nNT80 -> NT17 NT44\n\nAnother rule is NT85 -> NT64 NT12\n\nAnother is NT20 -> NT39 NT25\n\nAnother is NT50 -> NT18 NT85\n\nWait, but some rules are:\n\nNT70 -> 't73' NT73 ?\n\nNo, looking back, the rules are extensive. Let me scan for any production that includes a terminal as part of the RHS.\n\nI see:\n\nNT12 -> 't85'\n\nAh, here we have a production where NT12 can be simplified to just 't85', which is a terminal. Similarly, looking for other non-terminals that produce a single terminal.\n\nLooking for other productions:\n\nLooking for any production in the grammar where a non-terminal is directly producing a single terminal, like 't74' or 't22', etc.\n\nLet me scan the rules:\n\nLooking for any 'NTx' -> 't'number. \n\nI find:\n\nNT12 -> 't85'\n\nNT20 -> 't17'\n\nNT28 -> 't26'\n\nNT35 -> 't88'\n\nNT40 -> 't71'\n\nNT47 -> 't72'\n\nNT58 -> ... Not sure. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, not all rules have a terminal; some might continue to have non-terminals. For example, looking for NT rules that have either one or two terminals. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production's RHS must be two non-terminals or one terminal, because CNF allows for unit productions (B -> a) in addition to the two non-terminals, but that's only when we are considering extended CNF. Wait, actually, no. Chomsky Normal Form for CFGs requires that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, in our case, the given grammar is in CNF, which can have unit productions (terminals) as well as productions with two non-terminals.\n\nSo, in the given rules, some NTxy may produce a single terminal, which is allowed.\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\nNT12 is defined as several productions, but one of them is NT12 -> 't85', which is a terminal. Similarly, looking elsewhere, like NT0 -> ... but one of the rules is NT0 -> 't29'.\n\nSo, yes, some non-terminals have direct productions to terminals.\n\nSo, our approach can be as follows:\n\n- For each symbol in the input string, determine which rule would allow that terminal to be generated by a non-terminal.\n\n- Then, recursively check if the preceding symbols (left side) can be generated by the appropriate non-terminals.\n\nSo, let's attempt to break down the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with `t80 t22`.\n\nSo, the first two symbols are both terminals.\n\nWe need to find non-terminals NT such that they can derive these two terminals and nothing else.

First, I'll try to understand the grammar and break it down.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S, which can produce different combinations of NT symbols. Each production rule in the grammar seems to split into two non-terminal symbols, leading to a recursive structure. My goal is to see if each 't' in the string is derived from one of these non-terminals, following the production rules.\n\nThe string has 17 tokens, each starting with 't' followed by some number. I'll list them to see their structure:\n\nt20, t72, t1, t7, t0, t18, t85, t72, t87, t9, t88, t19, t0, t29, t18, t14, t20, t5.\n\nI need to map each of these to their respective NT productions. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that several NT symbols end with 't' followed by numbers or other symbols, so I'll look for the corresponding rules.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. t20: Looking at the grammar, NT20 has a production -> NT39 NT25. Then, I need to check what NT39 and NT25 produce.\n\n2. t72: From the grammar, NT72 -> 't74'. Wait, wait\u2014NT72 is actually defined as -> 't74' NT99. But wait, no, looking back, the grammar entry for NT72 isn't directly present. Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, actually, the grammar seems to switch between NT and 't' symbols, but it's a bit confusing. Wait, in the grammar, when an NT symbol is written with '-> nt X Y', it's producing X and Y, which are other NT symbols or terminal 't' symbols.\n\nWait, I think I need to parse each production correctly.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to create a mapping of NT symbols to their productions. Let me list out all NT symbols and their rules:\n\nFrom the grammar rules:\n\n- S -> NT74 NT44\n- S -> NT11 NT24\n- S -> NT40 NT92\n\nThen NT49 -> NT0 NT47\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\nNT57 -> NT85 NT56\nNT51 -> NT19 NT18\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\nNT40 -> NT16 NT80\nNT65 -> NT17 NT19\nNT85 -> NT64 NT12\nNT99 -> NT51 NT66\nNT55 -> NT47 NT65\nNT76 -> NT2 NT68\nNT57 -> NT19 NT99\nWait, wait, that seems to be duplicated. Maybe a typo. Let me check again. Wait, no, perhaps there are multiple entries. I'll proceed carefully.\n\nI think the best approach is to build a tree from the string, checking each symbol step by step.\n\nLet me see the structure of the string. It starts with t20, which is derived from NT20, as per the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT20 has a production rule: NT20 -> NT39 NT25.\n\nSo, the first two steps are NT39 and NT25.\n\nNow, NT39's production is: NT39 -> NT8 NT25.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar rules provided:\n\nWait, looking at the lines:\n\n- NT35 -> NT34 NT25\n- NT12 -> NT93 NT70\n- NT91 -> NT64 NT90\n- NT34 -> NT56 NT93\n- NT0 -> NT77 NT34\n- NT19 -> NT17 NT57\n- NT88 -> NT69 NT44\n- NT66 -> NT55 NT1\n- NT9 -> 't46'\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT39 -> NT8 NT25\nWait, no, actually, in the grammar provided, it seems that some NT symbols are expanded into 't's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build a list of all NT symbols and their rules.\n\nLet me list the NT symbols and their productions:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- S (which is a terminal, perhaps, but in the initial rule lines):\n\nWait, maybe the grammar is built with NT followed by numbers, each defined as going to two other symbols. The initial lines are for S:\n\n- S -> NT74 NT44\n- S -> NT11 NT24\n- S -> NT40 NT92\n\nThen, for NT74: NT74 -> NT39 NT99.\nNT44 -> NT34 NT93?

Wait, no, according to the grammar, the terminals are when they produce 't' followed by a number, e.g., NT12 -> 't16'.\n\nWait, for example, NT12 is defined as -> 't16'. So, when NT12 is expanded, it becomes t16.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 -> NT28 NT7. But looking back, no, let me check.\n\nWait, actually, each NT rule is either another pair of NTs or a terminal followed by a number. Wait, no, the grammar's structure is in Chomsky normal form, which is S \u2192 AB, A \u2192 BC, B \u2192 CD, etc., with all productions being two non-terminals on the right.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, some rules have NT followed by numbers, which seem to be terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't85'?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some lines like 'NT12 -> 't85'' seems to indicate that NT12 is a terminal, producing the string 't85'. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because NT12 is a non-terminal, right? Or perhaps, it's just written as a terminal symbol, which is 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is structured such that each NT production either splits into two NTs or into a terminal symbol 'tX', which represents a terminal string of 't' followed by X.\n\nSo, for example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44. NT74 can produce NT39 NT99, while NT44 produces NT34 NT93, and so on.\n\nSo, each time a non-terminal is replaced by two other symbols or a terminal symbol.\n\nBut to make this clear, perhaps I should list each NT and its possible productions:\n\nLet me go through each rule and list the NT's production.\n\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nFor NT74:\n4. NT74 -> NT39 NT99\n5. NT74 also has other rules? Wait, checking the provided grammar: the line 'NT74 -> NT39 NT99' is the only one for NT74.\n\nWait, no, looking again: in the provided grammar, after S's rules, NT74 is only in one line: NT74 -> NT39 NT99.\n\nSimilarly, NT44 has lines: Wait, line 10 is NT35 -> NT34 NT25, line 11: NT12 -> NT93 NT70.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.

Each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol S, which can produce two non-terminals as well. However, some non-terminals seem to produce terminal strings, ending with 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string starts with `t93`, which suggests that the initial production must lead to a path that produces `t93`. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminal NT73 is defined as `t6`. So, maybe we need a production involving NT73 or other related non-terminals that can produce `t93`.\n\nLooking at the productions, `NT92` can produce `t52`, and `NT72` is defined as `NT1 NT60 -> but wait, NT72 doesn't exist in the given rules.

Let me see:\n\nWait, looking at the ' productions, for example:\n\n- NT7 -> t74\n- NT12 -> t85, t16\n- NT27 -> t20\nWait, no, I see that some non-terminals end up being terminals after expansion. For example, NT7 (which is part of NT77) leads to t74, which then becomes a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT73 is t6. Similarly, NT92 is t52.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t93. So I need to see if the grammar can produce t93 as the start.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT93: the rule `NT93 -> NT66 NT64` and `NT66 -> t26`, `NT64 -> NT65 NT13`. Hmm, this might not directly lead to t93. Alternatively, perhaps t93 is derived from NT91?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT91 can produce t22 via `NT91 -> NT64 NT90`, and then NT64 is `t26`, NT90 is t22. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, NT91 can be produced by NT91 -> NT64 NT90, and NT64 -> t26, NT90 -> t22. So NT91 would produce t26 t22, which is \"t26t22\". But the string has t93, so maybe t93 comes from a different non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, the second token is t0. So somewhere, the production must generate t0.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT0 produces t29. So maybe the string starts with some non-terminal that produces t93.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, NT93 is \"NT66 NT64\". NT66 -> t26, and NT64 can produce t26 or ... Wait, from the given rules:\n\nNT66: `NT66 -> NT55 NT1`, which can further break down to NT55 producing t47 and NT1 producing t70. So NT66 would produce t47 t70, but in the string, it's t93. So perhaps there's a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to break the string into parts. Let's look at the whole string:\n\nt93 t0 t31 t72 t92 t29 t92 t98 t19 t93 t91 t46 t52 t92 t22 t16 t29 t1\n\nThis is 18 tokens. Let's see if I can break this into the structure of the grammar.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t93, which suggests the first production is something that ends with t93. Looking for a production that directly leads to t93, but in the given rules, it's produced via a two-step process.\n\nWait, looking at NT53: `NT53 -> t45` and other related productions. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this as a parsing problem. Let me see if the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStart with S: S -> NT49 NT74 or similar.\n\nWait, looking at the string, it starts with t93 t0... which is quite specific. Maybe the start symbol S is producing two non-terminals, each of which eventually becomes a terminal sequence.\n\nLet me try to split the string into possible productions.\n\nLooking at t93, which is part of NT91 -> t22 or NT77 -> t92, NT85.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the entire string is a result of a series of rules that build up from the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reverse the process, starting from the root and expanding. Let's try that.\n\nThe string is: t93 t0 t31 t72 t92 t29 t92 t98 t19 t93 t91 t46 t52 t92 t22 t16 t29 t1\n\nLet me try to split this into the possible leftmost derivations.\n\nThe first token is t93, which likely comes from NT93.\n\nLooking at NT93: `NT93 -> NT66 NT64`\n\nSo, NT66 and NT64 should each generate the next part. Let's see:\n\n- NT66 -> t26 (from `NT66 -> NT55 NT1` and then NT55 -> t47, NT1 -> t70, so t47 t70, but that's two terminals. Wait, that would make NT66->t47 t70, which is \"t47t70\". Hmm, but in the string after t93, it's t0, so maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT93 can't be directly producing t93. Let me check all productions for NT93.\n\nLooking for NT93: The only production is `NT93 -> NT66 NT64`. So it doesn't produce t93 directly. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps some other non-terminal produces t93. Alternatively, maybe the string starts with a non-terminal that eventually leads to t93 through a chain.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the string, the last token is t1. So let's see how t1 is generated.\n\nLooking for productions that end with t1. In the rules, NT18 -> t19, NT19 -> t14, etc. Wait, perhaps NT1 produces t74, but that doesn't help. Let's check all terminals.\n\nWait, I see that NT17 -> t73, NT66 -> t26, NT26 -> t20, etc. Perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to see the path step by step.\n\nLet me consider the entire string as a series of concatenated terminals and see if they can be broken into the grammatical rules.\n\nThe string is: t93 t0 t31 t72 t92 t29 t92 t98 t19 t93 t91 t46 t52 t92 t22 t16 t29 t1\n\nI notice that t93 appears at the beginning and again at position 10. Let's see if the first t93 can come from NT93, which is `NT93 -> NT66 NT64`. Then, NT66 and NT64 need to produce the next parts.\n\nBut if NT66 produces something, looking at its rules: NT66 -> NT55 NT1. Then, NT55 -> NT47 NT65, which becomes t47 and then NT65 can be NT65 -> NT17 NT19, which are t73 and t8, so \"t73t8\". Hmm, but this doesn't seem to align with the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is not NT93 but something else.\n\nWait, another starting point: looking for NT1, which is `t74`.

The string provided ends with `t71`, and looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce these ts, like NT73 -> 't6', but wait, no, actually, some of the nt's connect to 't's directly.\n\nWait, looking closer, the non-terminals like NT77 have productions that eventually lead to 't's. For example, NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and from the list, NT92 -> 't52' and NT85 -> 't64'. So, NT92 produces 't52' and NT85 produces 't64'. So, NT77 becomes 't52 t64'.\n\nHmm, let me think step by step. Maybe I should parse the string back through the grammar. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form.\n\nLet me list the ts in the string: t29, t93, t26, t73, t11, t5, t11, t0, t45, t38, t14, t7, t31, t29, t29, t11, t80, t85, t71.\n\nThe string has 19 tokens. Let me consider that the start symbol is S, which produces pairs of non-terminals. For example, S -> NTa NTb, so each S produces two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start S, it produces NT49 NT74, NT49 again, NT40 NT92, etc. So, maybe the string corresponds to S by using one of these productions.\n\nLet me consider possible pairs from the non-terminals. For example, the first token is t29. Looking for which non-terminals produce t29.\n\nIn the grammar, NT0 -> t29. So, NT0 is one possibility.\n\nLooking at the other options, I see:\n\n- NT77 can produce 't52 t64' since NT92 is t52 and NT85 is t64.\n- NT35 produces t91 and t43.\n- NT53 can produce t45 and t43.\n- NT26 can produce t26, which is 't26' (as per NT26 itself?), wait no, looking back, the grammar has NT26 -> NT65 NT50, but also in the last section, NT26 seems to be 't26'.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT26 -> NT65 NT50\n\nAnd also:\n\nNT65 -> NT17 NT55\n\nWait, but another line says NT26 -> 't26'. Oh no, wait, looking again, in the end, under NT26, it's written as NT26 -> 't26'. So, actually, NT26 is directly producing 't26'.\n\nSimilarly, NT66 -> 't26'. Let me check: looking through the grammar, yes, in one line it says NT66 -> 't26'.\n\nWait, no, let me re-express the entire grammar to ensure I'm not making a mistake. For example, under the section titled NT26, it's written that NT26-> 't26'. Similarly, NT66-> 't26', NT0-> t29, etc.\n\nBut that might not be correct because I think each NT production starts as a non-terminal and then has other productions, including ones that terminate on 't's.\n\nSo, for example, looking at the section under NT26:\n\nNT26 -> NT65 NT50\n...\nand under NT26, it's written that there's a production NT26 -> 't26'. So, that suggests NT26 can be either NT65 NT50 or 't26'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar provided, it seems that some non-terminals have direct productions ending in 't's, like NT2 -> 't13', etc.\n\nSo, for each of these, NT0 -> t29, NT26 -> t26, etc.\n\nSo, let me try to parse the given string backtracking from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string has 19 tokens. So, perhaps it requires (19-1)\/2 = 9 steps from S, but that's just a rough idea.\n\nWait, for a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, the leftmost derivation of a string of length n will take n-1 steps, where each step adds one terminal. Wait, no, actually, each production adds non-terminals, and the process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut the CYK algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach to handle this.\n\nLet me consider the string as a sequence of symbols: t29, t93, t26, t73, t11, t5, t11, t0, t45, t38, t14, t7, t31, t29, t29, t11, t80, t85, t71.\n\nThat's 19 symbols. The first thing I notice is that t71 is the last symbol. Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce t71? Yes, because one of the productions is NT16 -> t71. So, NT16 can produce 't71'.\n\nSimilarly, t71 would appear under NT16.\n\nSo, perhaps the last part of the string is t71, which comes from NT16.\n\nLooking back, the string is t29 t93 t26 t73 t11 t5 t11 t0 t45 t38 t14 t7 t31 t29 t29 t11 t80 t85 t71.\n\nLooking at the initial symbols: t29, t93, etc.\n\nLet's see t29. It comes from NT0, which can produce t29. So, the first two symbols would be from NT0.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal. So, the string starts with t29 t93. Wait, but according to the given grammar, S can produce, for example, NT49 NT74. So, each application of a production rule replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (since the grammar is in CNF). So, starting from S, each step doubles the number of symbols until we can't split anymore, and the process continues.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string length is 19, which suggests that the derivation took 18 steps (each step adding a symbol from S). But maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find where possible pairs in the string can come from the grammar.\n\nStarting from the end, the last token is t71, which has to come from a non-terminal that directly produces t71. Looking at the grammar, NT16 -> t71. So, the last part of the string could be part of a production that ends with t71.\n\nLooking at the part t85 t71. So, in the string, the 18th and 19th tokens are t85 t71. So, is there a non-terminal that produces t85 followed by t71? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and NT92 -> 't52' and NT85 -> 't64', so NT77 would produce 't52 t64', not involving t71. Alternatively, is there any NT that produces 't85 t71'? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through each production, I see NT85 -> 't64', but that doesn't produce t71. Wait, perhaps a higher-level production? Maybe NT44 -> 't56', but again, not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for a production where the first part is t85 followed by something. Alternatively, maybe the production is NT53 -> 't45 t43' but that doesn't lead to t71.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the last part of the string: t85 t71. Is there any production where a non-terminal A can be split into B t71, or t85 followed by t71? For example, let's see if NT77 can produce t85 followed by something else.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-340","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string given is `t74 t98 t87 t87 t11 t31 t1 t45 t70 t82 t7 t8 t73 t17 t46 t73 t43 t45 t70`. \n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) works. CNF grammars have rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two terminals or another non-terminal. The start symbol is on the left, and all rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S. The initial productions for S are all the possible starting points:\n\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, to derive the string, the first step would be to choose one of these. Let me list which non-terminals can produce which 't' tokens because each 't' is a terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar rules, each rule that starts with a non-terminal has a 't' as the right-hand side. For example, NT74 \u2192 't74', NT98 \u2192 't98', etc. So, each rule that leads to a terminal is of the form NTxxx \u2192 'txxx'.\n\nThe string starts with 't74', so I need to see if there's a path that starts with NT74. The first rule S \u2192 NT74 NT44 would be a good starting point. So the S would produce NT74 and NT44, then each of those can produce their respective terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the first step in the derivation would be S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Then, both NT74 and NT44 must be replaced by their respective production rules. Let me check NT74's productions:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nSo NT74 is replaced by NT39 and NT99. Now, I need to keep track of the stack-like process of derivations, but since it's a string, we'll just chain them together.\n\nSo the string starts with 't74', which comes from NT74. Then, what comes after? The next token is 't98'. Looking through the grammar, NT98 \u2192 't98', so after NT74, the next part is NT98. So from S \u2192 NT74 NT44, we need to produce 't74' followed by 't98'...\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT74 NT44 would produce the combination NT74 and NT44. Then, each of these can be replaced. So NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, which then needs to be replaced. Similarly, NT44 \u2192 NT35 NT93.\n\nWait, the initial step is S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which will produce two non-terminals. Then each of those will be replaced step by step until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, let's try to build the string step by step:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44 \u2192 (replace NT74 and NT44)\n2. NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99 \u2192 (replace NT39 and NT99)\n3. NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25 \u2192 (replace NT8 and NT25)\n4. NT8 \u2192 't7' \u2192 (if this is a terminal, we can't replace further)\n5. NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7 \u2192 (replace)\n6. NT28 \u2192 't20' \u2192 terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals NT28 have productions leading to t20 or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me see: each non-terminal must be replaced until only terminals are left.\n\nThe initial string is `t74 t98 t87 t87 t11 t31 t1 t45 t70 t82 t7 t8 t73 t17 t46 t73 t43 t45 t70`.\n\nLooking at the first token 't74', which comes from NT74. Then, the next is 't98', which must come from NT98. Let's check how the S can produce both.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Then NT74 produces 't74', and NT44 must produce 't98' somewhere down the line.\n\nBut looking at NT44's productions:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT35 NT93\n\nSo NT44 becomes NT35 and NT93. Then, NT35 can be further replaced.\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT56 NT93\n\nNow, that's a bit complicated. Let me see if I can map this step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT74 NT44.\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99.\n\nThen, NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't7'.\n\nThen, back to NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66.\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50.\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT55.\n\nNT17 \u2192 't73'.\n\nSo that would give us a 't7' and then 't73', but in the string, after 't74', the next is 't98', not 't73'. Hmm, this might mean that the initial S choice might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Perhaps the string starts with 't74', which comes from NT74, but then the next token is 't98', so perhaps another step is needed after NT74 is replaced.\n\nWait, maybe after S \u2192 NT74 NT44, both NT74 and NT44 are non-terminals. So we need to replace each of them until all are terminals.\n\nLet me retrace:\n\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44 \u2192 't74' is from NT74, but we still have NT44 to replace.\n\nSo for NT44:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT35 NT93.\n\nThen NT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25 \u2192 NT( )?\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT56 NT93 \u2192 which would lead to 't56' and NT93 \u2192 't93'? So that would be 't56', then 't93' perhaps.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string must be built by expanding S in a certain way.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt74, t98, t87, t87, t11, t31, t1, t45, t70, t82, t7, t8, t73, t17, t46, t73, t43, t45, t70.\n\nSo the string is 19 tokens. Let's see if we can parse this into the correct non-terminals.\n\nEach step in the derivation must split into two parts, so the number of symbols doubles each time until we reach terminals. Since we have 19 symbols, perhaps it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long or has inconsistencies.\n\nAnother approach is to try to find a leftmost derivation sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for possible transitions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t74. So the first step is S \u2192 NT74 NT44.\n\nThen, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99.\n\nSo after replacing NT74, we have NT39 and NT99.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't7'.\n\nThen NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66.\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50.\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT55.\n\nNT17 \u2192 't73'.\n\nThen, what about NT55?

{"custom_id":"request-358","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar given. It consists of a bunch of productions starting from S. Each production seems to split into two non-terminals (NT) or a terminal ('t' followed by a number). Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t22 t20 t59 t56 t73 t0 t70 t9 t6 t31 t92 t18 t74 t73 t87 t74 t55 t91 t56 t43`.\n\nI notice that some of these are terminals like 't22', 't20', etc., while others are non-terminals like NT77, NT49, etc. But in the final string, all are terminals except for the identifiers like NT... but in the string, all are lowercase t followed by numbers. Wait, maybe the NTs in the grammar get resolved to terminals? Let's check.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some NTs resolve to terminals. For example, NT73 \u2192 't6', NT12 \u2192 't85', NT16 \u2192 't71', etc. So, every NT eventually resolves to a terminal, so the generated string should consist solely of terminals.\n\nBut in the given string, all elements are 'tX' where X is a number. So that's consistent. Now, I need to check if this string can be derived starting from S by applying productions step by step.\n\nGiven the string length is 20, and each step of the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or two terminals. Starting with S, which is a single non-terminal, each application of a rule increases the number of symbols by one. So, the number of symbols in the string is equal to the length of the derivation. So for length 20, the number of steps is 19. But maybe it's easier to build the string from the leaves upwards, starting from the terminals and seeing if they match any production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to perform a top-down or bottom-up parsing. Since the string is all terminals, bottom-up might be feasible.\n\nLet's list all the symbols in the string:\n\nt22, t20, t59, t56, t73, t0, t70, t9, t6, t31, t92, t18, t74, t73, t87, t74, t55, t91, t56, t43.\n\nI need to see if this string can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nIn bottom-up parsing, I can start by looking for any substring that can be a single production. Let's look for the rightmost symbols and see if they can be replaced.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: t43. Let me check if t43 is a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, is t43 a production? Looking at the grammar rules, I don't see a production where NT... \u2192 't43'. Wait, t43 isn't a terminal, so I must have made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT53 \u2192 't43'. So t43 comes from NT53. So t43 is generated by NT53. So 't43' must be the result of NT53.\n\nSo let's think. The string ends with t43, which comes from NT53. So before that, in the string, there's t56. Let's see if t56 can be a production.\n\nWait, t56 can be 't56' or could it come from a non-terminal? Let me check. Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT56 \u2192 NT53, not a terminal. So t56 in the string must be generated by NT56. But in our string, it's 't56' at position 18 (0-based index 17) followed by 't43'. So after parsing, the last two tokens would have to be the results of NT56 and NT53 producing t56 and t43 respectively.\n\nWait, but in this grammar, each production is applied to replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or two terminals. So for 't56' \u2192 't56' as a terminal would require that NT56 \u2192 't56' is a production. Checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40 (line 24), NT53 \u2192 't43' (line 33). Wait, no, NT53 \u2192 't43'. So 't43' is NT53. Similarly, NT56 is in line 24: NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40. So NT56 doesn't produce a terminal; instead, it's two non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-express the grammar correctly.

{"custom_id":"request-363","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Alright, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. It's a CNF grammar, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side. CNF is particularly useful for parsing algorithms because it simplifies the process, but for this problem, I just need to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol here is S. The initial productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, from S, any of these three can be chosen. That means the string we're checking must start with two NTs according to these options. Looking at the string provided: `t38 t59 t59 t45 t59 t8 t45 t38 t1 t16 t71 t71 t7 t73 t71 t43 t18 t9 t31 t70`.\n\nWait, the string starts with t38, which is a terminal symbol. That suggests that the first production might involve t38, but looking at the grammar, the terminals seem to be mapped from specific NTs. So, for example, NT38 \u2192 t13, but I'm not sure. Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT38 maps to t13, but in the string, it's given as t38, which is different. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me see the mappings again.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, some NTs are mapped directly to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT12 \u2192 t85\n- NT16 \u2192 t71\n- NT69 \u2192 t93\n- NT18 \u2192 t14\n- NT93 \u2192 t80\n- NT18 \u2192 t19\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- NT20 \u2192 t0\n- NT28 \u2192 t20\n- NT69 \u2192 t93\n- NT68 \u2192 t82\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT66 \u2192 t26\n- NT9 \u2192 t46\n- NT90 \u2192 t22\n- NT12 \u2192 t16\n- NT39 \u2192 t9\n- NT92 \u2192 t52\n- NT1 \u2192 t70\n- NT24 \u2192 t88\n- NT28 \u2192 t26\n- NT59 \u2192 t6\n- NT47 \u2192 t72\n- NT92 \u2192 t93\n- NT8 \u2192 t7\n- NT12 \u2192 t1\n- NT50 \u2192 t59\n- NT80 \u2192 t55\n- NT33 \u2192 t8\n- NT92 \u2192 t56\n- NT53 \u2192 t43\n- NT12 \u2192 t11\n- NT66 \u2192 t46\n- NT51 \u2192 t98\n- NT44 \u2192 t56\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t31\n- NT57 \u2192 t18\n- NT53 \u2192 t45\n- NT92 \u2192 t76\n- NT70 \u2192 t82\n- NT35 \u2192 t91\n- NT0 \u2192 t29\n- NT11 \u2192 t87\n- NT66 \u2192 t92\n\nSo, the string given is `t38 t59 t59 t45 t59 t8 t45 t38 t1 t16 t71 t71 t7 t73 t71 t43 t18 t9 t31 t70`.\n\nWait, the string has t38, t59, t59, t45, etc. But in the grammar, looking for NTs that produce these terminals.\n\nFirst, t38: I don't see any NT in the grammar that directly produces t38. Let me check all the mappings. Hmm, looking through the rules, I don't see a rule that produces t38. For example, NT38 is not present, and I don't see any rule that maps to t38. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the NTs that produce t38 are not listed. That suggests that t38 cannot be directly produced from any NT in the grammar, meaning the string starts with t38, but there's no production for that. So, that would immediately make the string invalid because the first symbol can't be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the grammar. Scanning through all the rules, I don't see any NT that maps to t38. So yes, that's an issue. Therefore, the first token in the string is t38, which cannot be generated by the grammar, so the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any NTs that generate t38. Let me list all the mappings again:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT12 \u2192 t85\n- NT16 \u2192 t71\n- NT69 \u2192 t93\n- NT18 \u2192 t14\n- NT93 \u2192 t80\n- NT18 \u2192 t19\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- NT20 \u2192 t0\n- NT28 \u2192 t20\n- NT69 \u2192 t93\n- NT68 \u2192 t82\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT66 \u2192 t26\n- NT9 \u2192 t46\n- NT90 \u2192 t22\n- NT12 \u2192 t16\n- NT39 \u2192 t9\n- NT92 \u2192 t52\n- NT1 \u2192 t70\n- NT24 \u2192 t88\n- NT28 \u2192 t26\n- NT59 \u2192 t6\n- NT47 \u2192 t72\n- NT92 \u2192 t93\n- NT8 \u2192 t7\n- NT12 \u2192 t1\n- NT50 \u2192 t59\n- NT80 \u2192 t55\n- NT33 \u2192 t8\n- NT92 \u2192 t56\n- NT53 \u2192 t43\n- NT12 \u2192 t11\n- NT66 \u2192 t46\n- NT51 \u2192 t98\n- NT44 \u2192 t56\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t31\n- NT57 \u2192 t18\n- NT53 \u2192 t45\n- NT92 \u2192 t76\n- NT70 \u2192 t82\n- NT35 \u2192 t91\n- NT0 \u2192 t29\n- NT11 \u2192 t87\n- NT66 \u2192 t92\n\nNone of these mappings produce t38. So that means the first symbol in the string, t38, can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the string is not in the language.\n\nBut perhaps I'm wrong, maybe there's a derivation that somehow leads to t38, but in the grammar, all NTs are non-terminals, and they can only produce combinations of other NTs. Since none of the production rules for NTs generate t38, the first symbol t38 can't be produced.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nWait, but I should also consider the possibility of leftmost derivations. Starting with S, which must produce two NTs, like NT74 NT44, and so on. Let me think about the string. The first symbol is t38, but maybe it's generated from a longer chain. However, in the grammar, all NTs either produce two NTs or a terminal. So, for the first symbol t38, it's a terminal, which must be directly produced by some NT.

The given grammar has all productions except S in CNF, and S can expand into two NT symbols. \n\nLooking at the string, each `t` followed by a number is likely a terminal symbol, and the numbers seem to correspond to NT non-terminals. So the string is a sequence like S -> NT... -> t... each time.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation produces exactly one terminal. Wait, no\u2014CNF allows each production to generate exactly one terminal, but since the grammar here seems to have multiple possible productions, each production can only replace one non-terminal with two others, and those others will be terminals.\n\nWait, maybe more accurately, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, which eventually become terminals. So a valid string generated by the grammar must be a result of multiple replacements where each replacement step replaces one non-terminal with two, until the entire string consists only of terminals.\n\nThe string has 21 terms, so the derivation sequence would result in 20 splits (since each split increases the number of symbols by one: 1\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925...\u219221). \n\nLet me map each t to the corresponding NT. So let's look up the NTs:\n\nt73 corresponds to NT73 -> 't73', so that's the terminal '73'.\n\nt38: Looking at the NTs, t38 is from NT80: NT80 -> 't71' Wait, no. Wait, what's the mapping? Let me list the transitions.\n\nWait, from the NT definitions:\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT12 -> 't85' etc.\n\nWait, more accurately, each NT has a production that ends with a 't' and another number.

Wait, let me make a list:\n\nLooking through the NT definitions, each NT eventually, after replacing, becomes a 't' followed by a number.\n\nFor example, NT77 -> NT92 NT85. Then NT92 -> 't56' and NT85 -> 't64'. So NT77 would produce t56 t64, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map each NT to its corresponding terminal. Let me list:\n\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85: NT92-> 't56', NT85->'t64' \u21d2 't56' 't64'\n\nWait, but that would be wrong because NT92 itself is also a non-terminal, so we need to replace until we reach terminals only.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find all NTs in the string and see if their replacements can form the string.\n\nThe given string is:\nt73 t38 t71 t6 t45 t70 t26 t46 t88 t98 t31 t56 t55 t5 t45 t11 t72 t22 t17 t55 t6\n\nSo each t<something> corresponds to an NT:\n\n- t73: NT73\n- t38: NT38\n- t71: NT71\n- t6: NT6\n- t45: NT45\n- t70: NT70\n- t26: NT26\n- t46: NT46\n- t88: NT88\n- t98: NT98\n- t31: NT31\n- t56: NT56\n- t55: NT55\n- t5: NT5\n- t45: same as before: NT45\n- t11: NT11\n- t72: NT72\n- t22: NT22\n- t17: NT17\n- t55: same as before: NT55\n- t6: same as before: NT6\n\nNow, I need to see if there's a derivation starting from S that can produce this string by expanding each non-terminal step by step, replacing each with two non-terminals, until all are terminals and in the given order.\n\nGiven that it's a CNF grammar, each step from S adds a new symbol, starting with two non-terminals and splitting into more as needed.\n\nLet me try to see if each production starting from S can lead to the string.\n\nS can produce three options:\n\n1. S -> NT49 NT74\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-378","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine if the given string can be generated by the provided grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules and see if I can understand how they build the string. The grammar starts with S, which can generate various combinations. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the production rules for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nI need to generate the string `t74 t70 t55 t88 t20 t26 t7 t46 t80 t1 t18 t92 t1 t1 t17 t87 t8 t46 t55 t56 t11`.\n\nEach NT in the grammar eventually produces a terminal symbol (a 't' followed by another 't', like 't74', 't70', etc.) or another non-terminal. \n\nI notice that the string starts with 't74', which must come from a non-terminal that expands to 't74'. Looking at the grammar, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. But NT39 and NT99 each produce further tokens. For example, NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25, and NT8 \u2192 't7', NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7. NT28 \u2192 't20', and NT7 \u2192 't74'. So NT74 \u2192 't74' via a chain: NT74 \u2192 NT39 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 t7, then NT25 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 t20, and then NT7 again which is t74.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. Then NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25. So from NT39, we get t8 and t25. But NT25 is NT28 NT7, which would be t20 and t7. So overall, NT74 would generate t74 as a non-terminal chain: t7, t20, t7. Because NT74 is NT49 (wait, no, NT74 is a separate symbol). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, NT74 is one of the non-terminals. NT74's rule is NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. So when we expand NT74, we have to expand both NT39 and NT99. \n\nLooking at NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25. NT8 \u2192 't7' (from NT8 \u2192 t7), and NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7 (from the rule NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7). NT28 \u2192 't20', and NT7 \u2192 't74'. So expanding NT39: NT8 expands to t7, NT25 expands to t20 (via NT28) and t7 (via NT7). So combining NT39, it's t7, t20, t7. So when NT74 expands, it's t7, t20, t7, t74? Wait, no, NT74 is NT39 NT99, and each of those produces their own strings, but how do they combine?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe it's better to use the top-down parsing method, starting from S and seeing if we can derive the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t74 t70 t55 t88 ... Let's see how it can be built.\n\nBut maybe parsing the string in reverse could help. Let's see. The last token is 't11', which comes from NT11 \u2192 't11' (from the rule S \u2192 NT11 NT24, and NT11 \u2192 't11'). So that's manageable.\n\nBefore that, the string ends with ... t56 t11. So before 't11', it's 't56'. So let me check where 't56' comes from. 't56' is a terminal, so it must come from NT56. Looking at the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40. So NT56 would expand into two non-terminals, which then need to produce the appropriate terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, before the 't11' is 't56', which is the terminal symbol. So NT56 must expand into 't56' as a result of expanding both NT92 and NT40. But looking at the rules for NT40, NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80. Then NT16 is 't71', and NT80 \u2192 't55'. So NT40 would produce 't71 t55'. Similarly, NT92 has several rules, but looking at the production for NT92 \u2192 NT64 NT61. NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13, which goes to NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19, and so on. Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe NT92 \u2192 NT52 (from NT92 \u2192 t52). Hmm, no, looking back, looking at the grammar rules, NT92's productions are:\n\nNT92 \u2192 NT93 NT70 (from earlier rules?)\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar, under the NT production rules, I see:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\nNT92 \u2192 NT93 NT70\nAnd so on. Let me check all the NT92 productions. Oh, actually, the given grammar has:\n\nLooking at the beginning, it's clear that NT92 is on the left, so I should look for all NT92 \u2192 ... rules.\n\nFrom the provided grammar, I don't see an explicit rule for NT92 beyond the initial NT92 \u2192 NT93 NT70? Wait, looking through all the rules again:\n\nAh, I don't see any rule for NT92 beyond the initial S \u2192 NT40 NT92. So maybe I need to check all the NT92 entries.\n\nWait, looking carefully at the given NT rules, I see:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\nNT92 \u2192 NT93 NT70\nAnd so more. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, looking through all the NT rules given:\n\nWait, in the list, under the NT production rules, I see multiple entries, but perhaps it's easier to note that NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40. So 't56' comes from NT56, which is NT92 NT40.\n\nWait, no, wait: in the given grammar:\n\nLooking through all the entries, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40.\n\nYes, here: The line is \"NT56 -> NT92 NT40\".\n\nSo when NT56 is expanded, it produces NT92 and NT40. Now, if in the string we have 't56', then NT56 must expand to 't56', so one of the NT92 or NT40 must directly produce a 't' symbol. Let me check where NT92 and NT40 can generate terminals.\n\nLooking at NT92, do any of its productions result in a terminal?\n\nLooking through the NT92 productions:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I only see NT92's on the left in S \u2192 NT40 NT92, but that's not an expansion.

{"custom_id":"request-398","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar. CNF means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A can be a terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, the productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, I see that many productions are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTyz, which seems a bit different. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or a mistake in how it's written, but I'll proceed assuming that each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see that some non-terminals end with arrows pointing to either another non-terminal or a terminal. For example, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and more often, it seems some production rules have single terminals on the right, like NT7 \u2192 't6', which I believe means that NT7 can produce the terminal 't6' directly.\n\nThe string given is `t45 t6 t59 t85 t9 t87 t56 t0 t87 t56 t74 t55 t93 t1 t19 t6 t8 t46 t29 t6 t73 t8`. So, it's a sequence of terminal symbols that we need to check whether it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nTo proceed, I think I should build the parse tree step by step or perhaps find a way to represent the string in terms of the grammar's structure.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. The grammar has three productions for S:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, S can generate strings that start with two non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals or terminals. The string begins with 't45', which is a terminal. So, I need to see if any of the production rules for NT's can lead to 't45' as the first step.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the NT production rules. For example, NT53 \u2192 t43, NT55 \u2192 t59, NT57 \u2192 t72, etc. Oh, wait, some NT symbols have production rules leading to single terminals.\n\nFor instance, NT7 \u2192 't74', which means that NT7 can produce 't74'. Similarly, NT11 \u2192 't87', NT12 \u2192 't85' and 't1', NT13 \u2192 't31', and so on.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is 't45'. So I need to find if any of the NT's can produce 't45'. Looking through the list, I see NT35 \u2192 't34', which is NT34 \u2192 't38' and NT38 \u2192 't95', etc. Hmm, looking for 't45' directly: I see in the production rules, NT53 \u2192 't43', NT55 \u2192 't59', NT92 \u2192 't52', NT57 \u2192 't72', etc. Wait, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't45'. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the production list:\n- NT45 isn't present, but some other NTs do have single terminals. For example, NT47 \u2192 't72', which is 't72' instead of 't45'. Hmm, is there any NT that produces 't45'? Let me check again. Wait, looking at the list, I don't see any NT directly producing 't45'. Did I miss it?\n\nWait, let me search the list again. Here's the production for NT53: \u2192 't43', which is a single terminal. Similarly, NT55 \u2192 't59'. NT92 \u2192 't52', NT57 \u2192 't72', etc. I don't see any NT that produces 't45'. That's a problem because the string starts with 't45', which would require that the first production in the string is a terminal, meaning a non-terminal that can directly produce it.\n\nSince none of the NTs directly produce 't45', the string can't be derived from the grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss any NT that produces 't45'. Looking through the list again: NT45 \u2192 't54'? No, NT54 isn't in the list. Hmm, okay, I'm confident that there's no NT that produces 't45'. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nSo, after this analysis, I conclude that the string is not generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-395","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The string is `t19 t55 t46 t85 t45 t74 t93 t72 t1 t14 t56 t9 t46 t72 t20 t1 t45 t5 t6 t52 t20 t18`. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal produces two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which has several productions:\n- S can go to NT44 NT74, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92.\n\nSo, the string starts with S, which must split into two parts. The first symbol in the string is t19, so let's see how t19 is generated. Looking at the rules, NT19 produces t76 and t91. So, to have t19, I guess there must be a production that includes NT19. Wait, actually, in the given string, the first t76 is followed by t82. Looking at the rules, NT76 produces t2 and t68. Hmm, that doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The string is a sequence of t symbols. Each non-terminal production can be thought of as a two-step process, either generating two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to get the string, we can break it down into parts.\n\nLet's parse the string step by step. Each non-terminal must expand into two parts. Let's see:\n\n- The string starts with t19, but looking at the rules, NT19 produces t76 and t91. So, for the first part, we'd have t76 and t91. But the string is t19 t55 t46... Wait, t19 can't be a terminal because the grammar only has terminals as single-letter 't's. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some non-terminals have expansions ending in 't' followed by a number, like NT7 -> t74. Or wait, looking at the grammar, there are cases like NT7 -> t74, and others like NT2 -> t28. So, 't' symbols are terminals, and the numbers are non-terminals. So, the string `t19 t55 t46...` is a series of terminals, each represented as 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, the given string is a sequence of terminal symbols t19, t55, t46, etc. \n\nNow, to see if the grammar can generate this, we can try to parse it from the start symbol S, applying the productions step by step, ensuring that eventually we end up with the given string.\n\nLet's start. The start symbol is S, which can split into S \u2192 NT44 NT74, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, or S \u2192 NT40 NT92.\n\nLet's pick the first split: S = NT44 NT74. Then each of these non-terminals must generate parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t19 and t55. So, starting with NT44 and NT74. Let's see the expansion rules for NT44 and NT74.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT44's production is: NT44 \u2192 NT56 NT36, but I don't see NT36 in the rules. Wait, looking again, it says:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT56 -> NT92 NT40,\n\nand others. Wait, does NT44 have any production? Yes, looking for NT44 in the rules:\n\nSearching through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT44, I see:\n\nNT44 is generated by:\nNT44 -> NT56 NT36, but that might not be correct. Wait, maybe I need to scan through all the rules to find NT44.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the string starts with t19, which comes from NT19, which is a non-terminal. So perhaps NT19 is part of the expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about how the string can be split into parts corresponding to each production step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to reverse-engineer the string. Let's try to see if the entire string can be obtained by expanding the start symbols.\n\nThe string has 21 symbols (from t19 to t18 at the end). Each production step expands two non-terminals into two parts, so each step increases the number of symbols until we reach the terminal symbols.\n\nBut to manage this, perhaps I should use a parsing approach.\n\nLet's try a recursive descent approach. Starting with S, which must split into NT44 and NT74. Or another possibility. Let me check which one fits the starting symbols.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t19 t55 t46...\n\nIf S splits into NT44 and NT74, then each of these non-terminals would need to expand into a sequence that starts with t19, t55, etc.\n\nLooking at NT44's productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar, I can see that NT44 is not explicitly listed, but looking through all the rules, I see NT56 and others, but no NT44 production in the initial part. Wait, maybe I should look again.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nWait, looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT56 -> NT92 NT40,\n\nbut perhaps NT44 might have another production? Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I don't immediately see NT44. The rules for NT44 are not listed. Hmm, perhaps NT44 is only a leaf node, but according to the problem statement, the grammar is in Chomsky CNF, so each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the given grammar again. Looking through all the lines, I don't see NT44. So perhaps the first production for S is not NT44 but one of the others. Maybe I should check.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS can be NT44 NT74, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92.\n\nI need to choose which one could lead to the given string.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT11 NT24, then the first two symbols would come from NT11 and NT24.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two are t19 t55. Let's see if NT11 and NT24 can generate these.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT11's production is:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT90 NT1.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT11's production is NT90 and NT1.\n\nSo NT11 expands to two non-terminals. Then each of these would expand further.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 in the grammar is: looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for NT24, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT24 -> NT85 NT9.\n\nSo NT24 expands to NT85 and NT9.\n\nSo the initial split of S \u2192 NT11 NT24 would lead to four non-terminals: NT90, NT1, NT85, NT9.\n\nThen each of these would expand, possibly further.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first two are t19 and t55. So let's see if any of the initial splits can generate t19 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, each non-terminal's production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to get t19, a non-terminal must produce t19 as a terminal in one of its productions.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see NT19 has a production:\n\nNT19 \u2192 t76 t91.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the rules, it's:\nNT19-> t76 t91? No, actually, no. Let me scan:\n\nLooking at the production lines, I don't see NT19 as a terminal. Wait, checking the lines:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT7 -> t74.\n\nSo, perhaps other numbers are terminals. Wait, no, perhaps it's the case that some numbers correspond to terminals as t followed by a number.\n\nWait, no. The grammar is written in a way where certain non-terminals produce terminals, each represented as tX, where X is a number.\n\nSo, from the grammar, for example:\n\nNT7 -> t74: so NT7 can produce the terminal t74.\n\nSimilarly, NT19 is a non-terminal that produces... Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT19 as a production in the non-terminals with a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at:\n\nNT19's productions: Let me scan all the rules to see if NT19 has a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for NT19:\n\nThe rules include things like NT75\u2192t2..., etc., but I don't see NT19 having"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string provided is a sequence of tokens that I assume correspond to the terminals in the grammar. My goal is to figure out whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form looks like. Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production body can have at most two symbols. Looking at the given grammar, most of the productions are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ or NTX \u2192 'tN', which fits CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t88 t38 t11 t74 t80 t17 t85 t70 t56 t71 t29 t59 t56 t80 t18 t82 t6 t92 t43 t71 t11 t74 t85.\n\nI notice each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol.

Some of these non-terminals produce two non-terminals, others produce terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by a number, so each terminal in the string must match a production that directly outputs it, or be part of a production that eventually derives it.\n\nThe first step is to look at the start symbol S. In the given grammar, S has three productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these produces two non-terminals, so the string must start with the concatenation of the results of these productions.\n\nLooking at the input string, the first part is t88 t38 t11 t74... Let's see. The string starts with several terminals, but the start symbol S can only produce two non-terminals. So the string must be longer than what can be derived from S in a single step, so we'll need multiple steps.\n\nBut perhaps the string can be broken down step by step. Let's try to parse it.\n\nGiven that, I think the approach is to perform a recursive descent or a top-down parsing attempt using the grammar. If at any point we cannot find a matching production, the answer is No. Otherwise, if we successfully parse the entire string, it's Yes.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible parsing tree.\n\nThe string starts with t88, so I need to see which productions produce t88. Looking through the grammar, I find:\n\nNT56 \u2192 t92 (wait, no). Wait, looking for 't88' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT69 NT44. That's a production that produces two non-terminals, NT69 and NT44. NT69 is not a terminal. Then, looking for NT69's productions, NT69 \u2192 t38 (from the given grammar). So NT69 can produce t38 directly. So t88 is derived via NT88 \u2192 t38 NT44, but wait, wait. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking for terminal 't88' in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT69 NT44. That's a production that outputs two non-terminals, but it's followed by other productions. However, I don't see any production directly producing 't88' as a terminal, only as part of a multi-symbol production. So perhaps I need to see how 't88' can be derived.\n\nWait, looking again: the given grammar has:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nBut 't88' is not directly a terminal.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a set of production rules, all of which are in CNF. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side or a terminal symbol for the base case. This is important because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain algorithms like CYK, but since I'm not using those, I'll approach it manually.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which can produce combinations of NT (non-terminals) and numbers ending with '74', '44', '11', '24', '92'. Then there's a long list of other non-terminals (NT) that each produce a combination of terminals and other NTs. Some of these NTs eventually produce a single terminal symbol, identified by a 't' followed by a number, like 't6', 't85', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t85 t22 t6 t85 t16 t74 t55 t85 t43 t17 t6 t22 t17 t14 t9 t16 t92 t98 t70 t17 t17 t56 t8`\n\nI notice that each part of the string is separated by spaces, so it's a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions in the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the parsing process would involve replacing non-terminals with their productions until only terminals are left.\n\nGiven that, I'll need to construct a parse tree or at least see if the string can be broken down into the non-terminals and their respective productions.\n\nBut doing this manually for a long string might be time-consuming. I'll start by looking at the structure of the string and see if the non-terminals can break it down correctly.\n\nLet me list the productions again for clarity:\n\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the string starts with a series of terminals. Since S can produce NT74 and NT44, or others, I'll check which of these non-terminals can lead to the start of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first terminal is 't85'. I need to see if either NT74 or NT44 can produce 't85'.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT77 is defined as NT92 NT85. But wait, does any NT produce 't85' directly? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the NTs, some produce terminals. For example, NT5 is 't74' (wait, no, looking more carefully):\n\nWait, the list provided includes:\n\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT18 -> 't14'\n- NT93 -> 't80'\n- NT18 -> 't19'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT20 -> 't0'\n- NT28 -> 't20'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n- NT9 -> 't46'\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT39 -> 't9'\n- NT92 -> 't52'\n- NT1 -> 't70'\n- NT24 -> 't88'\n- NT28 -> 't26'\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- NT47 -> 't72'\n- NT92 -> 't93' [Wait, two entries for NT92?

Let's check each starting point.\n\nThe first symbol is 't85'. Let's see which NTs produce it.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT17 -> 't73' \u2192 no\n- NT16 -> 't71' \u2192 no\n- NT77 -> 't92' \u2192 no\n- NT57 -> 't18' \u2192 no\n- NT74 -> 't73' \u2192 no\n- NT40 -> 't44' \u2192 no, but does it produce 't85'? Let's see.\n\nWait, NT40 is defined as NT16 NT80. NT16 is 't71', NT80 is 't55', so NT40 doesn't produce 't85'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me be precise.\n\nEach NT production may have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. I need to find which NTs can produce 't85' directly or through productions.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT85 -> NT64 NT12\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT64 -> NT65 NT13\n- NT65 -> NT17 NT19\n- NT17 is 't73', NT19 is 't99' (from NT51->... wait, no. Wait, NT19 is defined as NT17 NT57, right? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nNT57 is defined as NT53 NT61, and NT53 is NT45, etc. But I think I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with 't85'. So, which NT can derive 't85'? Let's check each NT's production.\n\nLooking for any NT production that includes 't85' on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT85 is produced by NT64 and NT12.\n- But NT12 is a terminal 't1', not 't85'.\n- So NT85 can only be derived from NT64 and NT12, which doesn't help with 't85'.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps there's another NT that directly produces 't85'.\n\nLooking through the list again, I don't see any NT directly producing 't85' except maybe NT92 in one of its productions, but I don't think NT92 does that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's look again.\n\nIn the list, NT92 appears multiple times. For example:\n\n- NT92 -> NT64 NT12\n- NT92 -> NT77 NT85\n- NT92 -> NT56 NT40\n- etc.\n\nWait, that's strange. So, I think there might be a mistake, as NT92 is listed more than once. But assuming it's correct, each occurrence defines a different production.\n\nSo, for example, one production of NT92 is NT77 NT85, another is NT56 NT40, etc.\n\nLooking at that, if NT92 can be derived from NT56 and NT40, and so on. But none of those directly lead to 't85' unless through other productions.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to get 't85' as the first symbol, the first two non-terminals in S's production must eventually produce 't85' and something else.\n\nWait, but S can produce NT74 NT44, or others.

{"custom_id":"request-437","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t45 t74 t18 t5 t80 t82 t52 t9 t73 t8 t82 t26 t88 t46 t20 t76 t11 t76 t45 t74 t74 t8 t55 t46`.\n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in CNF has each production rule as either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I notice that some rules have two non-terminals on the right side, like S \u2192 NT74 NT44, while others mix non-terminals and terminals, which doesn't fit CNF. Wait, but wait\u2014Chomsky Normal Form specifically requires productions only of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So if any production has more than two non-terminals, it's not in CNF. Let me check the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules such as NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, which are in CNF. But there are also rules like NT33 \u2192 NT8 NT25, which is also CNF. Wait, so maybe all the productions are in CNF because they're either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal? No, actually, in the given grammar, I notice that some rules have a mix, like NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59 and others are pure two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding because some terminals are present. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, with no B followed by C if A is on the left. So the grammar provided seems to consist of all productions with exactly two non-terminals on the right side, while terminals would only appear on the right as a single terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, for example, NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT90: that's two non-terminals, which is fine. Also, S \u2192 NT74 NT44 is a production of a non-terminal leading to two non-terminals, which is allowed in CNF.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires that each production be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so all non-terminals on the right. So in the given grammar, each production has two non-terminals, so I think all are in CNF.\n\nNow, the string given is t45 t74 t18 t5 t80 t82 t52 t9 t73 t8 t82 t26 t88 t46 t20 t76 t11 t76 t45 t74 t74 t8 t55 t46. So all the terminal symbols are letters followed by numbers, like t45, t74, etc. The first step is to parse this string using the grammar.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, I'll need to construct a parse tree or use a top-down or bottom-up parsing approach. Alternatively, I can use the fact that in top-down parsing, especially with CNF, the length of the string relates to the depth of the parse tree. If the string has n terminals, then the maximum height required is log2(n+1), which in this case, n is 27, so log2(28) is around 5, meaning we can have a parse tree of depth 5.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, each production in the grammar seems to have a maximum of two symbols on the right-hand side. So the maximum expansion would be limited in depth, but I'm not sure exactly. Maybe I can approach this by trying to trace the string step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a recursive descent parser, where each rule can be associated with a function that recognizes a substring starting with a specific terminal. Since S starts the derivation, I'll look for S productions. The start symbol is S, so the entire string must be derived from S.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. The grammar has three productions for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44\n\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\n\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo the starting symbol S can only be broken down into two non-terminals. So the string must start with the first terminal of either NT74, NT11, or NT40.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t45, which is a terminal. So we need to see which production of S can lead to t45 as the first terminal.\n\nLooking at the production NT74: in the given grammar, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, but NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66. Then NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59. Hmm, I see that NT74 eventually leads to terminals by further expansions.\n\nWait, but the first token in the string is t45. Let's see what NT74 expands to. Let me trace the productions.\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\nSo NT39 can produce NT8 or NT25, depending on the production.\n\nIf NT74 first goes to NT39, which then splits into NT8 (which is a terminal t8) or NT25.\n\nWait, no, wait\u2014NT8 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. The string starts with t45, which is a terminal, so we need a production that starts with a non-terminal whose expansion includes t45 as the first terminal.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that can directly produce t45.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, I see NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66, and NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59, and so on. Where does t45 come from? Wait, I should check all the productions to see if any non-terminal directly produces t45.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any non-terminals have a production directly to t45? Let me see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, for example:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 t43\n\nWait, I'm scanning through the rules, and I notice that some produce a single terminal. For instance:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal with a production of the form A \u2192 t45.\n\nI'm scanning, and here's one:\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59\n\nBut that's two non-terminals, so not matching.\n\nWait, another example:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t45. Let me make sure I check all of them.\n\nWait, here are some rules:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59\n\n- NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT90\n\n- NT33 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT19 NT99\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT with a production that ends with t45. Looking through all NTs:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t29\n\n- NT11 \u2192 t87\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t1, t85\n\n- NT16 \u2192 t71\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t7, t14, t19, t20, t0, t28\n\n- NT20 \u2192 t39, t25, t38, t76, t11, t35\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t28, t7\n\n- NT35 \u2192 t34, t25\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t13, t98\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t16, t80\n\n- NT47 \u2192 t55, t61, t99\n\n- NT51 \u2192 t26, t59\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t9\n\nWait, looking carefully, it's likely that none of the non-terminals directly produce t45. Because I don't see a rule where A \u2192 t45.\n\nTherefore, perhaps t45 is a result of a non-terminal that is further expanded. Let's find which non-terminals can derive t45.\n\nLooking for sequences that lead to t45.\n\nLet me consider the path that leads to t45. Since all the productions are in CNF, each non-terminal expansion is into two non-terminals, leading to terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the last token is t45. So what's the non-terminal that can expand into t45? Possibly a non-terminal that can go to t45 as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look backwards. Let me consider the tokens:\n\nThe string ends with ... t8 t55 t46.\n\nWait, that can't be.

The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The string to evaluate is `t0 t59 t55 t56 t91 t20 t52 t85 t11 t91 t80 t87 t26 t7 t19 t76 t59 t74 t29 t52 t9 t71 t72 t56`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the grammar. The top-level rules are all under S, which transforms into combinations of NT and numbers. Each NT eventually leads to a terminal or another non-terminal. Since it's Chomsky Normal Form, the derivation tree will have height based on the string length. \n\nThe string has 23 symbols, which suggests that the parse tree will have a depth of about 23 steps, but in practice, for a CFG in CNF, the derivation length is linear in the string length, so the depth is logarithmic. \n\nI should check if each 't' is generated by the appropriate productions. Each 't' corresponds to a terminal character that comes from a specific production. For example, t0 comes from NT0 -> t29, t1 comes from NT1 -> t70, etc.\n\nI'll list each terminal in the string and see if there's a production that generates it:\n\n1. t0 \u2192 NT0 -> NT77 NT34\n2. t59 \u2192 NT59 -> NT51 NT65 (Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, NT59 is actually produced by NT55 NT65? Let me check the initial rules. Wait, in the grammar provided, the rules are a bit messy. Let me parse each production properly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is:\n\n- S -> NT74 NT44\n- S -> NT11 NT24\n- S -> NT40 NT92\n\nThen the NTs have more rules, each producing other NTs or terminals. Each NT can be expanded until it becomes a terminal. So I need to see, for each 't' in the string, what NT is it coming from, and then see if that NT can derive to that 't'.\n\nFor example, t0 is generated by NT0 -> NT77 NT34.

Looking at the grammar, perhaps NT59 doesn't exist because NT59 isn't a production. Wait, no, in the grammar, I see rules like NT51 -> NT26 NT59, so NT59 must be in another rule. Alternatively, maybe I'm misreading. Wait, the grammar list includes:\n\nNT51 -> NT26 NT59.\n\nWait, that can't be right because NT51 is a non-terminal, so it can't produce t59 if it's not another rule.

{"custom_id":"request-455","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except that B and C can't be start symbols. Also, an alternative is that the start symbol can produce the empty string \u03b5. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, most of the productions seem to follow the CNF structure. Each left-hand side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Each of these non-terminals must eventually resolve to strings of terminals or other non-terminals that can produce terminals. \n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, some of the productions have terminals as part of the right-hand side, like NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. But then other productions have both, like NT92 \u2192 NT85 NT85 or something? No, looking closer:\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, I see that most of the productions are of two non-terminals, but some of them might actually contain terminal symbols. For example, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80, etc. But there are also rules where the right-hand side seems to include 't' followed by a number or sometimes just 't' without a number, like NT18 \u2192 't14' or 't19' or 't0' and so on.\n\nWait, hold on. I think I need to parse the grammar correctly, especially focusing on the right-hand sides. Let me list out the productions more clearly.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the given string starts with t6, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the initial productions from S are:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these produce two non-terminals, which will need to resolve further until they produce terminals. The string given is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this sequence by expanding the non-terminals step by step, eventually leading to all terminals.\n\nLet me list the string for better clarity:\n\nt6 t46 t43 t85 t19 t16 t59 t91 t91 t7 t71 t92 t43 t80 t71 t76 t38 t74 t0 t5 t92 t8 t11 t56 t31\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with t6. Looking at the grammar, which rules produce 't6'? Looking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n- NT17 \u2192 't73'\n- NT16 \u2192 't71'\n- NT69 \u2192 't93'\n- NT68 \u2192 't82'\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n- NT66 \u2192 't26'\n- NT9 \u2192 't46'\n- NT90 \u2192 't22'\n- NT12 \u2192 't16' (but wait, 12 is a number; but in the string, it's t16, which is a terminal 't' followed by '16'. Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me look again at the productions where non-terminals end with 't'.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n- NT17 \u2192 't73'\n- NT16 \u2192 't71'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT18 \u2192 't76'\nWait, no. Let me check each non-terminal to see what it produces:\n\nLooking through the provided list:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't74'\nNT17 \u2192 't73'\nNT16 \u2192 't71'\nNT2 \u2192 't28' (Wait, but NT2's right-hand side isn't directly 't28' \u2014 wait, looking again, it's S -> other things. Hmm.)\n\nWait, perhaps the 't's in the string must come from the terminal productions directly. So each terminal is the result of a production like NT7 \u2192 't74', meaning that NT7 can produce the string 't74'.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first element is t6. Wait, but none of the non-terminals I see produce 't6' except NT6. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see any rule for NT6. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the productions, the non-terminals and their productions, I don't see any rule where NT6 is on the left-hand side, so it's probably not in the grammar. But the string starts with t6, so that suggests that there's a non-terminal that produces 't6' which isn't present. That might mean the string isn't derivable from the given grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check. All the terminal productions (those with 't' on the left side) are as follows:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n- NT17 \u2192 't73'\n- NT16 \u2192 't71'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT18 \u2192 't76'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT69 \u2192 't6'\nWait, hold on! NT69 \u2192 't6'? Let me look at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't38' No, wait, no. Looking at each production:\n\nWait, let's list all the NT productions and their output (the part after the arrow, left side):\n\nWait, in the given list, after each NT, the right-hand side is either another NT or a string starting with 't' followed by a number or sometimes just 't' without a number. But I notice that for some rules, the right-hand side isn't just two NTs. For example, looking at NT66:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't26'\n\nYes, so NT66 can produce the terminal string 't26'. Similarly, other NT's have terminal productions.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S, and all S productions lead to two NTs. So the entire string must be derived by expanding S, then each of those NTs, etc., until we reach terminals.\n\nSo for the string to be generated, each symbol (like t6, t46, etc.) must come from a chain of productions leading from S down to those terminals.\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is t6. So we need an NT that directly produces 't6'. Looking at the provided grammar, I can't see any such rule. The closest is NT66 \u2192 't26', NT90 \u2192 't22', but nothing about 't6'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar. Maybe I missed a rule where NT6 \u2192 't6' or something similar.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n- NT17 \u2192 't73'\n- NT16 \u2192 't71'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT18 \u2192 't76'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT69 \u2192 't38'\n- NT68 \u2192 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the NT productions:\n\nLooking through the entire set:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't74' \u2705\nNT39 \u2192 't9' (Wait, NT39's right-hand side is 't9', not an NT. So NT39 can produce 't9'.)\n\nWait, wait, some NTs have terminal productions, like:\n\nNT39 \u2192 't9'\nNT28 \u2192 't20' \u2705\nNT65 \u2192 't17' \u2705\nNT88 \u2192 't69' \u2705\nNT53 \u2192 't45' \u2705\nNT66 \u2192 't26' \u2705\nNT72 \u2192 't76' \u2705\nNT0 \u2192 't29' \u2705\nNT11 \u2192 't87' \u2705\nNT44 \u2192 't56' \u2705\nNT92 \u2192 't52' \u2705\nNT40 \u2192 't44' \u2705\nNT59 \u2192 't6' \u2705\nWait, I think I found one! NT59 \u2192 't6'.\n\nLet me check:\n\nLooking through all NTs and their right-hand sides.\n\nNT59 \u2192 't6' \u2705\n\nYes! So NT59 can produce 't6' which is the first symbol in the string.\n\nSo the string starts with t6, which would come from NT59.

The start symbol S can produce two terminals directly. So, the grammar starts with S and applies these productions step by step, expanding non-terminals into other non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nThe string given consists of a series of t-words, which I assume are the terminals generated by the non-terminals in the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My goal is to see if this string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that S has productions:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, S can generate pairs of non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals then needs to produce the corresponding t-terms in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't74'. I check which non-terminal can produce 't74'. From the rules, I see:\n- NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n- NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n- NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nAlso, there's a production for NT51 \u2192 NT98, which isn't directly helpful here. But wait, in the string, the first t is 't74', so I need a production where a NT ends in t74.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40, which produces t92 and t40. But we need something that directly gives t74. Hmm, maybe I should look for an NT that directly has a rule ending with t74. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing t74 except perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, let's check the production for NT77: NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85. But NT77 isn't directly producing t74. Let me scan all the rules. It seems like NT77 is producing 't93' and 't80' as per another rule: NT77 \u2192 't93' 't80'. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nNo, wait, some of these non-terminals have rules where the right-hand side is terminals. For example, NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47, but some of these non-terminals produce terminals directly. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n- NT12 \u2192 't85'\n- NT17 \u2192 't73'\n- NT16 \u2192 't71'\n- NT69 \u2192 't93'\n- NT68 \u2192 't82'\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n- NT9 \u2192 't46'\n- NT90 \u2192 't22'\n- NT12 \u2192 't16'\n- NT39 \u2192 't9'\n- NT92 \u2192 't52'\n- NT1 \u2192 't70'\n- NT24 \u2192 't88'\n- NT28 \u2192 't26'\n- NT59 \u2192 't6'\n- NT47 \u2192 't72'\n- NT51 \u2192 't98'\n- NT44 \u2192 't56'\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'\n- NT13 \u2192 't31'\n- NT57 \u2192 't18'\n- NT53 \u2192 't45'\n- NT70 \u2192 't82'\n- NT35 \u2192 't91'\n- NT0 \u2192 't29'\n- NT11 \u2192 't87'\n- NT66 \u2192 't46'\n- NT51 \u2192 't98'\n- NT44 \u2192 't56'\n\nSo, many of these non-terminals produce single terminals.\n\nNow, to generate the string, each of these terminals in the string must be the result of terminal productions. So, starting from S, each step would replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we reach only terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't74 t19 t88 t92 t20 t22 t72 t88 t52 t8 t16 t87 t6 t0 t56 t9 t11 t76 t55 t7 t9 t19 t5 t18 t9'.\n\nLet's see if this string can be built by the non-terminals.\n\nFirst, the first token is 't74'. Looking at the rules, which non-terminal can produce 't74' on the right side of a production? Hmm, I see:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40\n- NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n- NT74 is not a terminal but a non-terminal. Wait, maybe through a chain. Let me see if any non-terminals directly produce 't74'.\n\nFrom the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't74' as a terminal except perhaps through multiple steps. Let's search through the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't74' (so NT7 can produce t74)\n- NT73 \u2192 't6'\n- NT12 \u2192 't85'\n- etc.\n\nSo, NT7 can produce 't74' as a rule. So, to get 't74', we can have S \u2192 NT74 S', and then NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, which would need to then become 't74'. But wait, that doesn't seem right because NT74 isn't directly a terminal, but in the rules, NT7 can produce 't74'.\n\nWait, no, wait. The first production under NT is:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't6', not 't74'. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT7 \u2192 't74' is present. So NT7 can be replaced by 't74'. So, if the first token is 't74', the first non-terminal must be NT7, which directly produces 't74'.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT7. Then, after that, the next token is 't19'. So, the second part should be a production that starts with NT19 or a non-terminal that can produce 't19'.\n\nWait, but in the next step, after 't74', the next token is 't19'. So the next part of the string after 't74' would have to be generated by the next non-terminals.\n\nBut each step of the grammar produces two non-terminals at a time. So, after S, which expands into two non-terminals, each of those non-terminals then expands further until all are terminals.\n\nBut the string is a flat list of terminals. So I need to see if the expansion of S can generate exactly this sequence.\n\nI think a better way is to perform a parsing strategy, perhaps using a recursive descent parser or CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to break it down.\n\nLet me write down the string: t74 t19 t88 t92 t20 t22 t72 t88 t52 t8 t16 t87 t6 t0 t56 t9 t11 t76 t55 t7 t9 t19 t5 t18 t9.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, so each step replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals until all are terminals. The entire string must be a leftmost derivation from S.\n\nWait, but in CNF, the leftmost derivation would replace the leftmost non-terminal each step. So the expansion would follow the string order.\n\nBut the string is a list of terminals, and each production step adds two non-terminals, replacing one. So, if the string is correctly derived, the number of symbols generated should be correct.\n\nIn CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two others, so starting with one symbol (S), each step increases the number of symbols by one (since two replace one).

{"custom_id":"request-475","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to decide whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of CFGs where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is particularly useful for parsing algorithms because it simplifies the structure, making it easier to analyze.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that all the production rules are in CNF. Each production starts with a non-terminal on the left and is followed by either two non-terminals or a terminal. No production has more than two symbols on the right side.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t0 t70 t70 t20 t0 t14 t20 t14 t88 t80 t91 t80 t70 t26 t8 t26 t52 t11 t85 t1 t7 t45 t5 t14 t29 t82`. \n\nMy task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of applications of the grammar rules.\n\nFirst step: Identify the start symbol of the grammar. The start symbol is usually the left-hand side of the first production, but in this case, all productions start with S. So S is our starting point.\n\nThe first production from S is:\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44\nAlso, wait, looking back, the grammar has several options for S. Let me list all the S productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo S can produce three different combinations of non-terminals. Therefore, the first two tokens of the string will be crucial in determining which production to use.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t0. Wait, no: the string starts with t0. So the first three tokens are:\n\nt0, t70, t70, t20, t0, t14, t20, t14, t88, t80, t91, t80, t70, t26, t8, t26, t52, t11, t85, t1, t7, t45, t5, t14, t29, t82.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me count the tokens properly:\n\nThe string is: `t0 t70 t70 t20 t0 t14 t20 t14 t88 t80 t91 t80 t70 t26 t8 t26 t52 t11 t85 t1 t7 t45 t5 t14 t29 t82`.\n\nSo, token 1: t0\nToken 2: t70\nToken 3: t70\nToken 4: t20\n...\nUp to 28 tokens.\n\nWait, I think I may have miscounted. Let me count again: no, the string is actually 28 tokens: each part is separated by a space.\n\nNow, the first token is t0. To produce t0, we need to look at the productions for NT0 because looking at the grammar, the only way t0 appears is through NT0. Let me check the productions for NT0:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34\n\nSo to derive t0, we must have a production that ends up producing t0. Looking at the production NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34. Then, I need to see what's happening with NT77 and NT34.\n\nBut wait, actually, t0 appears only once in the grammar as an end symbol. Let me check the productions again. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for any production that has 't0' as a result. The only one I see is in NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34. So, t0 is derived from NT0, which is further divided into NT77 and NT34.\n\nWait, but NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34, and looking at NT77 and NT34, we have:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n\nSo NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85.\n\nNT92 \u2192 NT52 NT44, according to production: NT92 \u2192 NT52 NT44 is in the grammar? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nLooking for NT92: There is a production NT92 \u2192 NT64 NT12.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nYes, under NT92: NT92 \u2192 NT64 NT12 is a production.\n\nWait, so NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and NT92 \u2192 NT64 NT12.\n\nSo the path would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44, or S \u2192 NT11 NT24, or S \u2192 NT40 NT92.\n\nBut in the string, the first tokens include t0. So let's see:\n\nWhich S production could lead to t0 being the first token.\n\nLooking at the S productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these produces two non-terminals. So the first token must come from one of these two non-terminals expanded.\n\nLooking at NT74: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25.\n\nNT39 has an expansion that can lead to terminal symbols. Similarly, NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t0, so we must find a way to get t0 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34.\n\nBut to have t0 as the first token, the symbol being generated must be t0. So let's see if any production directly produces t0, but from the grammar, the only way is NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34.\n\nWait, that suggests that t0 can only be derived as part of a larger structure. Let me check all NT symbols to see if any produce t0.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT except NT0 that produce a terminal of 't0'. So the only way to get t0 is if NT0 is expanded to t0 through some chain.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34.\n\nSo for t0 to appear as the first token, the initial NT symbol must be NT0, and the first part of its expansion must generate t0.\n\nTherefore, the S production that leads to NT0 is... Let me check the S productions.\n\nWait, no: the grammar only has S \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, and S \u2192 NT40 NT92. So for S to produce something that starts with t0, it must be produced via one of these.\n\nBut none of these are NT0. NT74, NT44, etc., as per the left-hand side of the productions, are all non-terminals that do not have an expansion that directly leads to t0.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44: So the first two non-terminals are NT74 and NT44. Now, I need to see what NT74 and NT44 produce.\n\nLooking at NT74: It can produce NT39 NT99 or, wait, the grammar has NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, which is correct.\n\nSo NT74 can expand into NT39 and NT99. So when S is producing S \u2192 NT74 NT44, the first token would be the first symbol from NT74's expansion.\n\nBut what does NT74 produce? It produces NT39 NT99, so the first expansion from NT74 is NT39, which is a non-terminal. So the first symbol would be NT39's output, not a terminal.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t0, which is a terminal. So unless NT39 can produce t0, S cannot produce the string starting with t0 via this route.\n\nWait, but looking at NT39, does it ever produce a terminal? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT39 production rules:\n\n- NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n- NT39 \u2192 NT90 NT1 (from the rule: NT12 \u2192 NT90 NT1? Wait, no, let me check: There is a production NT12 \u2192 NT90 NT1. Wait, so NT90 is another NT symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the NT symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-478","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar looks a bit complex with all these S and NT rules. I notice that S is the start symbol, and it's broken down into combinations of NTs (which I think are non-terminal symbols) and terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t91 t92 t18 t29 t31 t91 t98 t92 t26 t6 t52 t55 t22 t38 t18 t71 t20 t43 t9 t6 t98 t52 t22 t92 t6 t43`.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be derived from the given grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a), the parse should be straightforward.\n\nLet me list all the terminals and non-terminals. Terminals are 't' plus numbers, like t91, t26, etc. Non-terminals are all the NTs, like S, NT49, NT11, etc. So the terminals in the string are t91, t92, t18, t29, t31, t98, t52, t55, t22, t38, t43, t9, t6.\n\nNow, I'll try to see if the string can be broken down using the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string structure:\n\nt91 t92 t18 t29 t31 t91 t98 t92 t26 t6 t52 t55 t22 t38 t18 t71 t20 t43 t9 t6 t98 t52 t22 t92 t6 t43.\n\nI think each part should correspond to a production rule where a NT expands into two other NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo starting from S, which is at the top level, I need to get the entire string.\n\nOne way to approach this is to work through the string step by step, trying to match each part.\n\nThe grammar's S rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT49 NT74,\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24,\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92.\n\nSo S can expand into any of these. Looking at the string, it starts with t91 t92. So maybe the first part is NT92 since looking at the grammar, NT92 has a rule NT92 \u2192 NT64 NT12, and NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13, NT65 \u2192 NT9 NT47, etc. Alternatively, maybe it's another NT.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see if the first tokens can align with any production.\n\nLooking at the first token, t91. Let's check which NTs have a rule that ends with t91. From the given rules, NT91 has two rules: NT91 \u2192 NT64 NT90, and also NT91 \u2192 't73'. So perhaps the first token might be from NT91 \u2192 t73? But wait, the string starts with t91, not t73. So maybe NT91's other rule could produce t91 elsewhere.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again. The production NT91 \u2192 't73' is there, but that's a single terminal. Since in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, the string starts with t91, which is a terminal. So the NT that directly produces t91 must be a terminal in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there an NT that directly produces t91? Let me check. Yes, NT91 can produce 't73', but that's not t91. Wait, no other NTs have t91 in their terminals. Wait, I think I got confused.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The terminals in the string are things like t91, which are single symbols. The grammar's non-terminals have some productions that directly produce terminals. So, for example, NT73 \u2192 't6', which is a terminal. Similarly, other NTs have terminals as their results.\n\nSo if the string starts with t91, then the first part of the derivation must come from an NT that directly produces t91. But looking at all the non-terminals, I don't see any rules where an NT directly gives t91. Wait, that can't be right because then how is t91 appearing in the string? Or maybe I misread.\n\nWait, no, perhaps NT91 \u2192 't73' is one of them, and there might be another rule for NT91 that produces t91. Let me look through the rules again. I don't see any NT91 production that's just 't91'. So that's a problem. How can the string have t91 if the grammar doesn't have an NT that produces it as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I missed looking. Let me go through all the NTs to see which can produce t91.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\nNT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\nNT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\nNT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12\nNT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\nNT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65\nNT76 \u2192 NT2 NT68\nNT57 \u2192 NT19 NT99\nNT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98\nNT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13\nNT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25\nNT12 \u2192 NT93 NT70\nNT91 \u2192 NT64 NT90\nNT91 \u2192 't73' (Wait, that's one rule)\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT55\nNT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\nNT80 \u2192 NT17 NT44\nNT61 \u2192 NT39 NT38\nNT68 \u2192 NT90 NT38\nNT18 \u2192 NT76 NT91\nNT93 \u2192 NT66 NT64\nNT69 \u2192 NT53 NT7\nNT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1\nNT9 \u2192 't5'\n... and so on.\n\nI don't see any NT that can produce 't91' as a terminal directly. Then how come the string starts with t91? This suggests that either the string isn't generated by the grammar or I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I've misunderstood something. Let me check again if there's a production where an NT directly generates t91. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t91 is derived from a chain of non-terminals that eventually produce t91 as a terminal. Wait, but the grammar only allows binary expansions, so each step should replace a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nSo if the string starts with t91, the entire derivation must start with a production that somehow starts with t91. But the only way to have a terminal at the start is if some NT directly produces that terminal.\n\nLooking again: Is there any NT that directly produces t91? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't6'\nNT12 \u2192 't85'\nNT16 \u2192 't71'\nNT69 \u2192 't93'\nNT18 \u2192 't7'\nNT93 \u2192 't80'\nNT12 \u2192 't1' (Wait, no, in the given rules, I think NT12 has rules, let me see:\n\nWait the rules for NT12: `NT12 -> NT93 NT70` and also `NT12 -> 't85'`. Oh, no, in the given rules, line: NT12 -> 't85'. So NT12 directly produces t85, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t91, which isn't among the terminals directly produced by any single NT. So perhaps the string can't be generated because the start symbol S can't start with t91, as S's productions only generate combinations that may start with other terminals.\n\nWait no, S is NT49 NT74, etc., so the first production of S is something like non-terminal NT followed by another non-terminal. Which would expand into terminals and non-terminals further down.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a path where the entire string can be broken down into a series of NT productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

{"custom_id":"request-495","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out whether the given string `t7 t9 t6 t74 t92 t22 t82 t76 t38 t55 t73 t43 t38 t18 t6 t98 t16 t88 t11 t73 t52 t43 t91 t56 t11 t85 t71` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that there are multiple production rules for different non-terminals ending up in terminal symbols like 't7', 't9', etc. Each non-terminal eventually leads down to a terminal symbol through a series of rules. For example, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and then each of those NTs eventually have productions leading to terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals. To check if it's generated by the grammar, I think about how these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT74 NT44, or alternatives like NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47, etc. So the initial productions for S involve two non-terminals. The string starts with t7 followed by t9, t6, etc. I think I need to see if each 't' in the string can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree for the string would help. Each node in the parse tree would be a non-terminal production, and the leaves would be the terminals. Let me try to map the string to the grammar step by step.\n\nLet's list the string: t7, t9, t6, t74, t92, t22, t82, t76, t38, t55, t73, t43, t38, t18, t6, t98, t16, t88, t11, t73, t52, t43, t91, t56, t11, t85, t71.\n\nWait, that's 27 terminals. Let me start from S and see possible sequences.\n\nSince S can be NT74 NT44 or other options, let's consider S \u2192 NT74 NT44 first.\n\nLooking at NT74: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99.\n\nThen, NT39 can be NT8 NT25, and NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after NT74 is t74. So I'm trying to see if NT74 can derive to t74.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, which then go to t52 and t56 respectively. But wait, I think I'm not looking in the right place.\n\nWait, I need to see which non-terminal leads to t74. Let's check the productions.\n\nLooking for NT that could produce t74. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, but that doesn't help. Wait, is there a production for NT74 \u2192 t74? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see a few NTs that end with t's, like NT7 \u2192 t74, NT17 \u2192 t73, NT28 \u2192 t20, etc.\n\nWait, does any NT produce t74? Let me see: Yes! There's NT73 \u2192 't74'. So, if NT73 is in the tree, it produces t74. So perhaps the initial S branches into a path that includes NT73.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT74 NT44? How does that lead to t7? Wait, no. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the first production is S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So to get t7 as the first symbol, perhaps NT74 is involved somewhere down the line.\n\nWait, let me think again. The string starts with t7, then t9, then t6, then t74, etc. Maybe the first two non-terminals in S's production derive to t7 and t9 respectively.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So we have NT74 and NT44.\n\nIf NT74 produces t7, which I think is achieved by some chain. Let me see: NT7 \u2192 t74 (since NT7 is defined as \u2192 t74). Wait, no, looking back, I see NT7 is defined as \u2192 t74, not the other way.\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nThere's NT7 \u2192 't74'\u2014yes, that's a terminal.\n\nWait, so if a non-terminal NT7 is in the tree, it can produce t74. Similarly, looking at the production list:\n\nNT7's production: NT7 \u2192 t74.\n\nSo, if in S's production, say, S \u2192 NT74 NT44, and NT74 somehow leads to t74, and NT44 leads to t79 or something\u2014wait, no, the string starts with t7, t9, t6.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. In the productions, the left-hand side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is a set of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44: S is rewritten as NT74 and NT44. So, if we can derive t7 from NT74, t9 from NT44, etc., that could work.\n\nBut wait, in the string, it's t7 t9 t6 t74 t92... So, the first two terminals are t7 and t9. If S is rewritten as NT74 and NT44, then each of those would produce a string. Let's consider that.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t7, which would require NT74 \u2192 t7 on the first step. But looking at the productions, does NT74 have a production to t7? No. Because all productions start with NT74 \u2192 NT... etc. So NT74 would have to produce two non-terminals which then eventually derive to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see how the initial S can chain to generate the given t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parse tree would have S on top, with two children NT74 and NT44. Then I need to see if the concatenation of these two non-terminals can produce the string.\n\nWait, I think I need to map the string t7 t9 t6 t74 t92... into a series of rules. Let's see:\n\n- t7: must come from some NT's rule, like NT74 \u2192 t74, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe a deeper chain.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this systematically. Each non-terminal in the string must have a production rule leading to that terminal.\n\nSo starting from the left:\n\nt7 \u2192 which NT can produce t7? Looking through the productions, I see that NT7 \u2192 t74, but not t7. Wait, maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, let's list all the NTs and their terminal productions.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT17 \u2192 t73\n- NT69 \u2192 t73\n- NT66 \u2192 t26\n- NT61 \u2192 t39\n- NT57 \u2192 t72\n- NT92 \u2192 t56\n- NT53 \u2192 t43\n- NT77 \u2192 t92 and t85\nWait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking back, for example, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85. Then NT92 can derive to t56 (since NT92 \u2192 NT52 \u2192 ... \u2192 t56), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT has specific terminals they can produce. For example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT17 \u2192 t73\n- NT66 \u2192 t26\n- NT61 \u2192 t39\n- NT77 \u2192 t92, t85\nWait, no: NT77 is a non-terminal, and its production is into two other NTs, which then need to derive to terminals.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, each segment must correspond to a production chain from the grammar.\n\nStarting with t7, which could come from NT74. Wait, how? NT74 is produced by S first. So S \u2192 NT74 NT44.\n\nSo for S's first children, NT74 and NT44, let's see what can be their productions.\n\nNT74 is defined as \u2192 NT39 NT99.\n\nThen, each of these NT39 and NT99 can further produce ... and so on until they become terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals or terminals. Wait, no, actually in CNF, all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.

I think I should first note down all the production rules and the terminal symbols. Maybe I'll list them out. Oh wait, the grammar includes a bunch of NT followed by symbols, and then some are mapped to terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, S \u2192 NT40 NT92.\n\nThen a bunch of NT productions, like NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47, etc., and many of these lead to terminals or other NTs. At the end, some NTs are expanded into 't' followed by numbers, like NT7 \u2192 't74', and others into a single 't'.\n\nSo for example, NT73 \u2192 't6', NT92 \u2192 't52', etc.\n\nThe string starts with t29, so I need to see if there's a production that starts with t29. Looking at the end productions, I see NT12 \u2192 't16', NT39 \u2192 't9', NT92 \u2192 't52', NT1 \u2192 't70', etc.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals seem to be in the right-hand side of the rules, like 't6', 't18', 't85', etc. There's a rule like NT73 \u2192 't6', so 't6' is a terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with t29. Do I have any NT that expands to t29? Let me check the production rules. Scanning through, I see NT29 isn't listed as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each rule.\n\nLooking line by line, the last line is NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65, but I'm checking for terminals. I see rules like NT7 \u2192 't74', so that's a terminal. But I don't see any NT that directly maps to t29. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the string. Let me parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t29 t1 t16 t8 t91 t59 t59 t29 t8 t20 t55 t85 t26 t16 t87 t19 t14 t1 t18 t38 t8 t18 t5 t8 t9 t14 t55.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t29, but in the grammar, there's no production that directly ends with t29. Let me look again through the productions to see if any NT ends with t29.\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides of all NT productions:\n\nFor example, NT69 \u2192 't93', which would produce t93, which isn't our token. NT7 \u2192 't74', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Did any of the productions result in t29? Let me go through each of the NT productions:\n\nLooking through each production, for example:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34. Then NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85. I don't see a t29 anywhere immediately, but maybe this is part of a longer derivation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the string can be represented as a sequence of non-terminals that can be expanded to the terminals. Since the grammar isn't that big, but it's a bit complex, maybe I can think of the string as a sequence of terminal symbols and see if each corresponds to an NT rule.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the non-terminal that starts the derivation. Since the start is S, but S branches into NT74 NT44, etc. Let's see.\n\nThe first part of the string is t29. Let's see what produces t29.\n\nLooking through the end rules:\n\nLooking for an NT where the right-hand side leads to a terminal. Let's see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34. Then NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85. NT92 \u2192 't52', NT85 \u2192 't64'. So NT0 \u2192 't52' 't64', which is t52 and t64, not t29.\n\nWait, another NT: looking for NT that directly maps to t29. For example, NT29 is a non-terminal? Wait no, in the given rules, I don't see any rules starting with NT29.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT with t. Maybe NTs could expand into other NTs, and eventually into terminals. So perhaps the first step is to see if the first symbol in the string is generated by an NT.\n\nSo, t29 must come from some NT production.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules for terminals:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't29'? Checking: NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34. Then NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, which becomes 't52' and 't64' (since NT92 \u2192 't52', NT85 \u2192 't64'). So NT0 \u2192 't52' 't64' \u2192 that would be t52 and t64, not t29.\n\nWait, maybe another path. Let me see which NTs could produce t29.\n\nLooking for NT rules where a terminal appears as the end.\n\nFor example, NT92 \u2192 't52', NT59 \u2192 't6'? Wait, no, looking through each production:\n\nWait, here's a production: NT59 -> NT6 NT93, which isn't a terminal yet. But later, NT93 \u2192 't80' and others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently.\n\nThe start is S \u2192 NT74 NT44, or others.\n\nLet me see what NT74 produces. Looking at the rules: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99.\n\nThen NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25. NT8 is 't7' (from the rule NT8 \u2192 't7'), and NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7.\n\nNT28 \u2192 't26' (from NT28 \u2192 't26'), and NT7? Are there any productions for NT7?

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be NT7 \u2192 't74'? Wait no, that's in NT73 \u2192 't6', which isn't the same.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me make a list of all terminals:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT74 \u2192 't74'? Wait, looking back, the rule is NT73 \u2192 't6', NT74 is on the left of a production.

{"custom_id":"request-521","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to understand what's given and how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol S. Looking at the grammar, S is the start symbol, and it directly produces combinations of NT's. For example, S can become NT49 NT74, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. Each NT can then produce other combinations of NTs, eventually leading to terminals represented by 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t16 t6 t6 t91 t43 t59 t26 t59 t9 t91 t93 t76 t31 t71 t88 t80 t55 t88 t73 t9 t91 t16 t43 t22 t55 t45 t11 t52.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step adds exactly one terminal or non-terminal at a time, and each step can be represented as a derivation where each symbol is expanded into two others, except when it's a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, except the start symbol. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. But terminals are leaves in the parse tree. The total number of steps needed to generate a string of length n is n-1, as each production adds one non-terminal, and the starting symbol S is the root of the parse tree.\n\nBut in this case, the string has 30 tokens, which are all terminals. That means the parse tree must have exactly 30 leaves. Since S is the start symbol, which is a single non-terminal, each step of production increases the number of symbols by one, so starting from S, which is 1 symbol, each production adds one until you get to the number of tokens. So for 30 tokens, that would require 29 productions, which is possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that reasoning is correct. Let me think again. Each time you apply a production rule, you replace one non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the number of symbols increases by one each time. Starting from S (1 symbol), each production increases by 1. So to get n symbols, you need n-1 productions. So for 30 symbols, 29 productions. That makes sense.\n\nBut the issue is mapping this to the given grammar. Each production has to connect the NTs to the terminals, but the NTs themselves have their own productions, which further split into more NTs until they eventually reach terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, each 't' represents a terminal derived from a production. The number after 't' corresponds to the terminal, which is tied to a specific production in the grammar.\n\nLet me try to map this: each 't' is a terminal derived from a specific NT. So, for example, 't16' must come from some NT that eventually produces it. Looking at the grammar, 't16' is produced by NT16, right? Because in the grammar, NT16 \u2192 't71', but wait, no, the grammar only has NT16 \u2192 't71', and then looking elsewhere, I see NT16 \u2192 't71' and possibly other productions if I check. Wait, I need to see the full grammar to know which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT16 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT69 \u2192 't38'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT93 \u2192 't80'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't19'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Each NT in the grammar can produce other NTs and terminals. So for example, NT70 \u2192 't74', which is another NT, and so on. So to get a terminal, the NT must have a production that goes to that terminal.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to start from the given string and try to parse it using the grammar. So the string is a sequence of terminals, which must be matched in order by the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can see if the string can be built by applying the productions in steps, starting from S and ensuring that each step follows the rules.\n\nBut since the string is 30 tokens long, and each step can split a non-terminal into two others, it's going to be a very deep parse tree, but let's try to see if it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to model the possible derivations.\n\nFirst, looking at the string: t16 t6 t6 t91 t43 t59 t26 t59 t9 t91 t93 t76 t31 t71 t88 t80 t55 t88 t73 t9 t91 t16 t43 t22 t55 t45 t11 t52.\n\nLet me note the numbers:\n\nt16, t6, t6, t91, t43, t59, t26, t59, t9, t91, t93, t76, t31, t71, t88, t80, t55, t88, t73, t9, t91, t16, t43, t22, t55, t45, t11, t52.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a terminal derived from an NT. So I need to see if each of these 'tN's exists in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each NT can sometimes produce a terminal. For example:\n\nNT66 \u2192 't26'.\n\nNT56 \u2192 't45'.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, there are a few NTs that produce terminals:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT12 NT90\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT64 NT90\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT93 NT70\n\nWait, I see that NT76 \u2192 't82', but wait, no, looking more carefully, NT76 is:\n\nNT76 \u2192 NT2 NT68.\n\nHmm, none of the NTs directly produce 't6'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 't29', NT12 \u2192 't85', NT11 \u2192 't87', NT16 \u2192 't71', NT20 \u2192 't17' or 't0', NT28 \u2192 't20', NT33 \u2192 't8', etc.\n\nWait, NT49 \u2192 't47'?, no: NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: for each 't' in the string, I need to check if there's a production from some NT that can reach that terminal. For example, t16 comes from NT16 \u2192 't71', but no NT16 directly produces a terminal. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT16 \u2192 't71'.\n\nIs that correct? Let me check the grammar provided. Yes, under NT16: NT16 \u2192 't71'. Similarly, other NTs may produce terminals.\n\nSo, 't16' comes from NT16. Then, 't6' comes from NT6. Wait, is there an NT6 in the grammar? Looking through, I don't see an NT6 in the provided grammar. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT49 NT74, and the NTs listed go from NT0 to NT99, but I don't see NT6 in the list. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the grammar provided has NTs listed, but perhaps I'm overlooking some. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the grammar productions, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34\n\nWait, but the grammar also has:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\n\nSo, yes, NT16 is present, and it produces 't71'. So 't16' is from NT16, but does NT6 exist? Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT6 in the list. So perhaps 't6' is a terminal that's allowed, but in the grammar provided, if NT6 isn't present,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-519","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar. The response should be either \"Yes\" or \"No.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the problem. CNF implies that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, which makes parsing easier, usually done with the CYK algorithm. However, since the string might be long, I'll need to parse it step by step, breaking it down from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions from S are:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo the first step in generating any string from S is to choose one of these three options and then continue expanding the non-terminals in each part (NT74, NT44, etc.) until all are terminals.\n\nThe given string is: `t17 t38 t38 t70 t45 t6 t55 t29 t74 t29 t73 t80 t14 t55 t22 t70 t46 t56 t87 t80 t76 t22 t0 t82 t11 t80 t73 t45`\n\nI notice that the string consists of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' must correspond to a terminal rule in the grammar, so the first thing is to check if each of these terminal symbols has a corresponding production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal eventually points to a terminal via productions like NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and then these non-terminals eventually resolve to 't's. For example, NT70 \u2192 't73', NT73 \u2192 't74', etc.\n\nSo, my approach should be to parse the string from the start symbol S, ensuring that each non-terminal expansion eventually leads to the corresponding 't's.\n\nSince the string is quite long, I'll need to see if it can be broken down into components that match the grammar. Each part must be split according to the production rules. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm, which constructs a table to check if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by considering the string length and filling a table where each cell (i,j) represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j. For each position, we determine which non-terminals can generate the substring starting at position i and ending at position j.\n\nGiven that this is a detailed process and the string is quite long, I should try to find a way to break it down manually. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation will only replace a single non-terminal with two others, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nBut considering the string is 31 tokens long, parsing it manually could be time-consuming. I might need to look for patterns or see if the string can be split into the productions given.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse the process: start from the given string and see if it can be reduced back to S using the productions. This might be easier since each production is a replacement, and working backward might help identify the reduction path.\n\nLooking at the first token, t17. From the grammar, NT17 can produce 't73'. So maybe the first part of the string could be derived from NT17.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\nNT17 \u2192 't73'\n\nSo, if the first token is 't17', does that correspond to a production? Wait, in the grammar, do we have NT17 producing a terminal? Looking back, the provided grammar has:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't73'\n\nYes, okay. So, 't17' could correspond to the production NT17 \u2192 t73.\n\nNext, the second token is t38. Checking the grammar, perhaps NT38 \u2192 t95 and NT95 \u2192 other things. Wait, in the rules:\n\nLooking for NT38:\nNT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98\n\nHmm, so to get t38, it would have to be part of a production, like NT38 producing t95, but looking at the rules, there's:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98\n\nAnd NT98 \u2192 t38\n\nBut wait, NT13 might produce another non-terminal, perhaps leading to t98. Wait, let me check NT38's rules again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there's a rule at the end: NT38 \u2192 t8. Hmm, that's not matching. Let me scan the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT38:\n\nYes, towards the end, near the bottom, I see:\nNT38 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, yes, looking back:\n\nHere's a part of the grammar:\nNT85 \u2192 't38'\nWait no, checking:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT11 NT77\nNT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50\nNT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73\n...\nNT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98\nNT38 \u2192 't8' (wait, that line is: NT38 \u2192 't8' is that a rule?)\n\nWait no, looking back, the actual grammar provided has:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't31'\nNT38 \u2192 't8'\nWait, no. Let me recheck the provided grammar again.\n\nHere's the detailed list:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98\nNT38 \u2192 't8' (Wait, is there a rule with NT38 \u2192 't8'? Looking at the given lines:\n\nYes, I see NT38 \u2192 't8'. But wait, let me go through the grammar again:\n\nLooking for NT38:\n\nYes, in the grammar, under NT35: NT35 \u2192 NT11 NT77\nThen later, under NT38: NT38 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, so actually, NT38 is a non-terminal that can only produce t8. But in the string, the second token is t38, which would mean that the first part of the string starts with t38. So if the first token is t17, then the next part is t38. But t38 can only come from NT38, which only produces t8. That doesn't make sense because t8 is a different token.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mislooking. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nFor NT38, the rules are:\nNT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98\nand later on, towards the end:\nNT38 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, so that's two rules for NT38: one to a combination of non-terminals and another to a terminal. How is that possible? Because in CNF, each rule is supposed to produce two non-terminals, so I might be missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar properly.\n\nLooking again through the grammar:\n\nI see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't31'\nNT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98 | 't8'\n\nWait, is that correct? Because in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right. So having a rule like NT38 \u2192 t8 would be a production of a non-terminal to a terminal, which contradicts CNF.\n\nBut the user provided the grammar as CNF, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread. Let me scan carefully.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLine by line, the provided grammar is quite long.

So perhaps it's a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the grammar is defined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't8' is a result of another expansion, but it's appearing directly in a production. That complicates things because that would mean some nodes are terminals, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all rules must have two non-terminals on the right. So the presence of a production that produces a terminal directly would violate CNF.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in parsing the grammar.\n\nLet me recount the rules:\n\nLooking for NT38:\n\nYes, I see NT38 \u2192 t8, which is a terminal. So that would mean that NT38 can produce 't8' directly, but in CNF, all non-terminals must produce two non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-535","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t82 t88 t82 t71 t19 t16 t1 t76 t1 t72 t11 t16 t8 t52 t0 t31 t26 t70 t5 t45 t82 t1 t16 t26 t7 t87`. Hmm, that's a lot of t's and numbers. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right. The start symbol is S, which is defined as S -> NT74 NT44, S -> NT11 NT24, or S -> NT40 NT92. So any valid string must start with one of these three combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is t82. That suggests the first part of the string comes from a production that eventually leads to t82. So I need to see which non-terminals can expand into t82. Let's look through the productions for NT that can produce t82.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT77 -> NT92 NT85. From NT77, it goes to NT92 and NT85. Then NT92 seems to have multiple productions: NT92 -> NT64 NT12, among others. Wait, but in the string, t82 is there. Hmm, maybe I need to see if any NT can directly go to t82.\n\nWait, looking at the list, I see NT76 -> NT2 NT68, and NT68 -> NT82 NT38. Oh, so NT68 can produce t82 and t38. So if I have a NT68, it can expand into t82 t38, or further into other symbols depending on NT2 and NT68.\n\nBut the string starts with t82, so maybe the start production starts with S -> NT74 NT44. Let me check what NT74 expands into. NT74 -> NT39 NT99. Then NT39 can go to NT8 NT25. NT25 -> NT28 NT7, and NT7 is NT74 NT73. Wait, this seems like a loop, as NT7 points back to NT74.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Perhaps I should work backward from the terminals in the string to see if they can trace back to the start symbol S.\n\nEach t in the string is a terminal, so each t must be produced by some NT. So the string is a sequence of terminals, so each step in the derivation must involve replacing non-terminals with terminals or more non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so the derivation tree would likely be a binary tree.\n\nLet me list the t's in the string:\n\nt82, t88, t82, t71, t19, t16, t1, t76, t1, t72, t11, t16, t8, t52, t0, t31, t26, t70, t5, t45, t82, t1, t16, t26, t7, t87.\n\nWait, that's quite a long list. Let me try to see if the first few t's can come from the initial productions.\n\nThe first t82: according to the grammar, which NTs can directly produce t82?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT66 -> NT55 NT1, and NT55 -> NT47 NT61. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, looking for t82 in the productions.\n\nWait, looking back: the grammar has NT53 -> NT45, but that leads to a t45, not t82. Hmm. Wait, I'm looking for terminals in the productions. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see that NT68 -> NT82 NT38. So that suggests that NT68 can directly produce t82 and t38. So if somewhere in the derivation there's an NT68 that expands to t82 and then further expands, that would give t82.\n\nSo, if the start symbol S is expanded into something that includes NT68, which then expands to t82 and t38, that could explain the first t82. But then t38 would need to come from somewhere else. Wait, but in the string, after t82 comes t88, so perhaps the NT68 is followed by another NT that produces t88.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial NT could be something else. Let me see the initial productions again.\n\nS can be NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92.\n\nLet me check what NT74 expands into: NT74 -> NT39 NT99.\n\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25.\n\nNT25 -> NT28 NT7.\n\nNT7 is NT74 NT73.\n\nHmm, this seems like a loop because NT74 is involved again. That could cause infinite loops unless something breaks it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first step is S -> NT40 NT92. So NT40 and NT92.\n\nNT40 expands to NT16 NT80.\n\nNT16 -> NT71. So NT16 would be t71.\n\nNT80 -> NT17 NT44. NT17 -> NT12 NT90.\n\nWait, NT12 can be either 't16' or 't25'. So from S -> NT40 NT92, we have NT40 -> t71 and NT92.\n\nWhat's NT92's production? Let's check: NT92 -> NT64 NT12, NT35 NT77, and other possibilities.\n\nWait, if NT92 is part of the initial expansion, let's see what it can produce. For example, NT92 can produce NT35 NT77, which would then expand further.\n\nAlternatively, looking back, if the first step is S -> NT40 NT92, and NT40 becomes t71, then NT92 would need to produce the remaining string starting with t82.\n\nBut that might not be the case because the string starts with t82, not t71. So maybe S is using a different initial production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S -> NT74 NT44 leads to t82. Let's check NT74.\n\nNT74 expands to NT39 NT99.\n\nNT39 to NT8 NT25.\n\nNT25 to NT28 NT7.\n\nNT7 is NT74 NT73, which points to NT74 again. That seems problematic because NT74 leads to NT39 again, creating a loop.\n\nWait, that could be a way to derive more t's, but I'm not sure. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string from right to left, using the CYK algorithm. Since it's in CNF, the CYK method should work. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to see if the string can be segmented into non-terminals.\n\nBut given the string length, that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can see if any part of the string can be matched by known terminal sequences.\n\nWait, I notice that in the string, there's a t82 followed by t88. Let me check if there's any production that can connect t82 and t88.\n\nLooking at NT66 -> NT55 NT1, and NT55 -> NT47 NT61. Hmm, not directly. Alternatively, NT68 -> NT82 NT38. So if I have NT68 -> t82 and t38, and somewhere else NT68 has another production leading to t88. But that seems unlikely because NT68 only has two productions: NT2 and NT68.\n\nWait, NT68 -> NT2 NT68. Oh, no, let me check again. No, NT68 expands to NT2 and NT68? No, looking at the grammar, NT68 is defined as NT2, NT68, right?\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nHmm, no, I don't see that. Let me look for it. Wait, the grammar provided lists:\n\nNT76 -> NT2 NT68\n\nNT68 -> NT82 NT38\n\nSo NT68 expands to t82 and t38, or to NT2 and NT68.\n\nWait, that last one says NT68 -> NT2 NT68. That's unusual because it's a recursive rule, which could lead to very long strings. This suggests that from NT68, you could generate an infinite number of something. But in reality, the CYK algorithm would take care of that by breaking it into smaller parts.\n\nSo, if in the string, we have"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-540","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. That's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a single terminal. Each production is either a single non-terminal -> another non-terminal, or two non-terminals on both sides, or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, etc. Wait, no, in CNF, it's usually each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see rules like S -> NT74 NT44, which is two non-terminals on the right, so that's allowed. Other rules like NT49 -> NT0 NT47 are also two non-terminals. Then there are rules like NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and eventually some rules that directly produce terminals, like NT7 -> 't6', NT18 -> 't14', etc. So that seems consistent with CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t17 t71 t6 t82 t1 t73 t8 t52 t7 t38 t76 t71 t19 t52 t14 t6 t87 t1 t31 t0 t20 t82 t98 t82 t31 t91 t43 t19 t76`.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. Each symbol seems to correspond to a non-terminal in the grammar. So the task is to find a derivation path from S down to this string by expanding the non-terminals appropriately.\n\nLet's count the number of symbols in the string: 36 tokens. So, for a leftmost derivation, starting from S, we need a parse tree that results in this sequence. Alternatively, we can check if the string can be generated by seeing if we can break it down according to the grammar's productions.\n\nGiven that the starting symbol is S, the first production is S -> NT74 NT44. So the first two symbols should come from NT74 and NT44.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: the first symbol is t17, which is a terminal. So which non-terminals produce t17?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT17 -> 't73'.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. Wait, the grammar has:\n\nNT17 -> 't73'\n\nSo NT17 can produce 't73', not t17. Hmm, that's confusing. Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the productions that result in terminals and see what's available.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the productions that produce terminals are:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT18 -> 't14'\nNT12 -> 't85'\nNT16 -> 't71'\nNT69 -> 't93'\nNT18 -> 't19'\nNT20 -> 't17'\nNT20 -> 't0'\nNT28 -> 't20'\nNT69 -> 't93'\nNT68 -> 't82'\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT66 -> 't26'\nNT9 -> 't46'\nNT90 -> 't22'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT39 -> 't9'\nNT92 -> 't52'\nNT1 -> 't70'\nNT24 -> 't88'\nNT28 -> 't26'\nNT59 -> 't6'\nNT47 -> 't72'\nNT92 -> 't93'\nNT8 -> 't7'\nNT12 -> 't1'\nNT50 -> 't59'\nNT80 -> 't55'\nNT33 -> 't8'\nNT92 -> 't56'\nNT53 -> 't43'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT66 -> 't46'\nNT51 -> 't98'\nNT44 -> 't56'\nNT9 -> 't5'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT57 -> 't18'\nNT53 -> 't45'\nNT92 -> 't76'\nNT70 -> 't82'\nNT35 -> 't91'\nNT0 -> 't29'\nNT11 -> 't87'\nNT66 -> 't92'\n\nWait, but in the provided string, I notice some symbols like t17, t71, etc. So let's check which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nFrom the list, I see:\n\n- NT70 -> 't70' (but t70 isn't in the string)\n- NT12 -> 't85' and 't16' (but in the string, I have t17, which isn't produced by any of these)\n- Looking for t17: There's NT16 -> 't71', but 't17' is a terminal. Wait, looking through all the productions, I see NT17 -> 't73'. So no NT produces t17 directly. Hmm, that's a problem because if the string starts with t17, but there's no production for that, then the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The string starts with t17, but in the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT17 produces t17. The only production for NT17 is NT17 -> 't73'. So unless I'm missing a production, that would mean that t17 is not a terminal generated by this grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because it contains t17, which is not produced by any rule.\n\nWait, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the productions. Is there any non-terminal that directly produces 't17'? I don't see it in the provided rules. So yes, that implies the string cannot be generated because it contains t17, which isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar uses left and right contexts that could produce t17 through other rules, but given that in CNF, each production only directly expands one symbol, unless through multiple steps. But since t17 isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, the string must contain a symbol that isn't allowed, meaning the string isn't in the language.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a terminal symbol (t17) that is not directly produced by any non-terminal in the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-559","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t5 t91 t91 t59 t59 t98 t73 t6 t70 t71 t59 t74 t92 t9 t22 t76 t29 t38 t8 t0 t29 t85 t71 t11`. Hmm, that's a bit long but manageable. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This is useful because the parse trees will have height proportional to the logarithm of the string length, which can help in devising a parsing strategy.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's a set of productions. I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, which are the 't's and numbers here. For example, NT7 -> 't6', NT12 -> 't85', etc. So, the string we're testing consists of a series of terminals, each of which must be matched by some production rule in the grammar.\n\nThe goal is to check if there's a derivation from the start symbol S that results in the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string's length must be a power of 2 for it to be derivable. Let me count the number of symbols in the string. The string has:\n\nt5, t91, t59, t71, t93, t52, t1, t82, t92, t55, t59, t98, t73, t6, t70, t71, t59, t74, t92, t9, t22, t76, t29, t38, t8, t0, t29, t85, t71, t11.\n\nCounting these: 1,2,...,31 symbols. Wait, that's 31 symbols. Now, in CNF, the number of symbols in the derived string must be 2^n where n is the number of steps. Wait, actually, each production step expands a non-terminal into two symbols (terminals or non-terminals). So starting from S, each step potentially increases the string length by one (if the non-terminal produces two non-terminals, which then go through further steps). So the length of the string after k steps would be 2^k. Therefore, for the string to be derivable, its length must be a power of two.\n\nBut 31 is not a power of two. The closest powers of two are 16 (2^4) and 32 (2^5). So 31 isn't 16 or 32. Therefore, the string length is 31, which is not a power of two. Does that mean it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar? Because CNF grammars can only generate strings of length that are powers of two.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The starting symbol S in CNF can generate strings of length 2^n for some n. For example, if the start symbol produces two terminals directly, the string length is 2. For an expansion of two non-terminals, each can produce two more, leading to 4, then 8, 16, 32, etc. So any string generated must have a length that is a power of two. Since 31 is not a power of two, the string cannot be derived from S.\n\nAlternatively, even if there were other production rules, the length must still fit the criteria. Since 31 is not a power of two, regardless of how the string is formed, it can't be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given CFG.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has a length of 31, which is not a power of two.

That's a lot of tokens, so I'll need to parse them and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the productions, the only terminal symbols I see are the 't' followed by numbers, like t7, t8, etc. So, the string is made up of these 't' terms. I'll need to see if these can be generated by the non-terminals through the given rules.\n\nThe string starts with t88. Let me check if any rule produces t88. Scanning the productions, I see that NT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12. And in the terminating rules, NT64 is t65, which is 't66', wait no, let me check again. Wait, in the terminating rules, I see NT65 \u2192 't17' and NT55 \u2192 't9'... Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the terminating rules, some of the non-terminals map to 't's, like NT7 \u2192 't74', NT12 \u2192 't85', etc. So, each rule's right-hand side can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI think the best way is to see if the string can be split into a sequence of productions that lead to these 't's. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each step in the derivation will split a non-terminal into two other symbols, either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut with a long string, this might be complex. Maybe I can look for the structure of the string and see if it can be built from the grammar's structure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the grammar is small and see if the string can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nLet me list the 't' parts in order:\n\nt88, t43, t17, t8, t18, t1, t93, t1, t80, t8, t52, t71, t20, t76, t20, t20, t92, t52, t55, t8, t45, t93, t5, t80, t59, t5, t19, t82, t31, t80.\n\nNow, t88 appears first. In the terminating rules, looking for t88. Scanning the terminating rules, I see NT47 \u2192 't72', NT53 \u2192 't45', NT92 \u2192 't56', etc. Wait, is there a rule that produces t88? Looking through the terminating rules, I don't see a direct production for t88 except in NT92 \u2192 t93, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the terminating rules:\n\nLooking at NT88: Not a non-terminal; perhaps it's a terminal? Wait, the terminals are only the 't' terms, so NT88 might not be a terminal. Wait, in the production rules, NT85 is followed elsewhere, but I need to check if any non-terminal directly maps to t88.\n\nLooking at the terminating rules, I see: NT47 \u2192 't72', NT53 \u2192 't45', NT92 \u2192 't56', etc. Hmm, perhaps I missed it. Wait, maybe no direct rule for t88. So, perhaps t88 comes from an NT that can produce t88 as part of a production.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, is there any NT that can directly produce t88? Let me see the production rules. Wait, I don't see an NT rule that produces t88 directly, except maybe through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to trace back. For example, NT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12, but if any of these can produce t88. Wait, NT65 \u2192 't17', NT55 \u2192 't9', etc. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe I should look for any NT that can derive t88 as a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps t88 is derived through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach: seeing if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. The string is quite long: 31 tokens. Each step in the derivation can split one non-terminal into two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the length of the derived string (in terms of symbols) will be 2^n, where n is the number of splits. But our string has 31 symbols, which is not a power of two plus one, so maybe it's invalid. Wait, wait, no. Each production rule is A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals. So, each step increases the number of symbols by 1.\n\nWait, starting from S, which is a single non-terminal. Each production splits one non-terminal into two symbols. So, the number of symbols after k steps is k+1.\n\nBut in our case, the string has 31 symbols, so it would require 30 production steps, each time increasing the symbol count by 1. Wait, that's impossible because each step can only split one non-terminal into two symbols, so the number of symbols can only increase by one per step. So, starting from one symbol, after 30 steps, we have 31 symbols, which matches. So that's possible.\n\nNow, let's see if the sequence of NTs can be built according to the rules.\n\nThe first token is t88. So, we need to have a production that eventually derives t88. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce t88. Looking through all NTs, perhaps NT85 can't. Wait, looking back at the terminating rules, I see NT45 \u2192 't45', and others, but nothing directly linking to t88.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again. Looking at the NTs, maybe NT88 is a terminal? But in the grammar provided, NT88 is not a starting point, so maybe it's derived from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking through all the NTs, I don't see a production for t88, which suggests that either t88 is a terminal that cannot be derived, making the entire string invalid, or perhaps I made a mistake in processing.\n\nWait, let me scan the grammar again. Perhaps I overlooked a rule. Looking through all the NTs, I don't see an NT that directly produces t88. So, for the first token t88 to appear, there must be a non-terminal NT that can derive t88. But I don't see any in the given grammar. So that would imply that the string is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NTs can produce t88 through a chain of productions. For example, NT88 might be derived from another NT.\n\nWait, looking again, do any rules have NT88 on the left side? No, the leftmost symbols are all S, S, etc. So no NT rule starts with NT88.\n\nTherefore, I think it's impossible for the grammar to generate the string because it doesn't have any rule that directly or indirectly produces t88 as a terminal.

So the overall string length should be a power of two based on the number of splits from the starting symbol S.\n\nLet me see: Starting with S, each production from S creates two parts, which can each be terminals or require further splits. So the total number of terminal symbols should be 2^n. Let's check 2^n closest to 31. 2^5 =32 and 31 is one less. So 31 isn't a power of two, so perhaps the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe not all non-terminals in S's production split all the way. For example, if S \u2192 NT74 NT44, and NT74 splits into t74 (so two terminals), and NT44 splits into t74 again? Wait, no, because NT44 in the grammar is a non-terminal. Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT74 can produce NT39 NT99, which then further split until they reach terminals. Let's take each path.\n\nBut regardless of the specific paths, each non-terminal expansion adds to the total length by a factor of 2. So if S starts with a production that requires splits, the total number of terminals must be a power of two. Since 31 isn't, that suggests the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the string. Let me recount the tokens:\n\nLooking at the string again: separated by spaces, so each part is a token. Let me list them:\n\n1: t9\n2: t88\n3: t87\n4: t55\n5: t74\n6: t74\n7: t93\n8: t73\n9: t16\n10: t0\n11: t82\n12: t26\n13: t1\n14: t29\n15: t88\n16: t56\n17: t73\n18: t52\n19: t19\n20: t9\n21: t38\n22: t17\n23: t92\n24: t98\n25: t29\n26: t45\n27: t85\n28: t14\n29: t31\n30: t22\n31: t73\n\nYes, 31 tokens.\n\nSo 31 is not a power of 2 (since 2^5=32). Therefore, the string can't be generated because the number of terminals would have to be 2,4,8,16,32,... Since 31 isn't there, 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if any of the non-terminals in S's production can lead to fewer splits. For example, if S\u2192NT74 NT44, and NT74 splits into t74 (thus terminal), and NT44 also splits into t74. But then the total would be 2, but in the given string, S would have two t74s. Wait, but in this case, the string is longer, so perhaps it's not possible because each split increases the number by 2, leading to a binary length.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the production rules for the NTs have non-terminals that, when fully expanded, produce different lengths. But since in CNF, each non-terminal production is two non-terminals or a terminal, the maximum possible length after full expansion would be a power of two.\n\nWait, but perhaps some NTs have one production that is a terminal, which could affect the length. For example, if a single NT is a terminal, then it doesn't increase the count. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT73 \u2192 't6'\n- NT12 \u2192 't85', 't16', 't0', etc. So some NTs produce a single t. So maybe different NTs can contribute different numbers of terminals.\n\nBut regardless, the maximum possible number is still a power of two, but if some NTs produce 1 terminal (i.e., don't split further), then the total number of terminals could be something like 2^k -1, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nWait, actually, no. For example, each NT either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So each NT contributes 1 if it's a terminal, or adds 2 if it's split. If some paths terminate early (i.e., produce terminals), then the total number for a particular derivation might not be a power of two, but the key is whether the given string's length can be formed by any combination of splits and terminals in the grammar.\n\nBut without knowing the exact derivation, it's tough. However, the length of the string is 31, which is not a power of two. So it's highly likely that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think differently. Suppose each production contributes a factor based on how many times they split. For example, S can lead to two NTs, each of which could generate multiple t's. So the total could be a product of the splits in each path.\n\nBut the problem is that in CNF, each step splits exactly two nodes, each into two, leading to a multiplicative effect, so the total length is 2^k for some k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the string's length is 31, which isn't a power of two, it's impossible for the string to be generated by a CNF grammar, which requires lengths to be powers of two.\n\nSo, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: `t55 t85 t7 t8 t43 t80 t22 t82 t52 t7 t6 t6 t43 t45 t20 t88 t72 t20 t80 t43 t76 t20 t52 t6 t45 t22 t80 t8 t0 t74 t85`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that in a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided here seems to consist of such rules, except for the fact that some non-terminals have multiple productions. \n\nThe task is to check if each terminal symbol in the string can be derived from the non-terminals according to the grammar. This typically involves working backwards from the string, replacing terminal symbols with the non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nI'll start by listing all the terminal symbols in the string: t55, t85, t7, t8, t43, t80, t22, t82, t52, t7, t6, t6, t43, t45, t20, t88, t72, t20, t80, t43, t76, t20, t52, t6, t45, t22, t80, t8, t0, t74, t85.\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these terminals can be generated by some non-terminal. Let's go through each terminal and find its corresponding production.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal that ends with a number (like NTx) has productions that lead to other NTx non-terminals, except the ones that directly go to a terminal symbol. For example:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65 (but wait, looking at the grammar, the NT55 rule is actually: NT55 -> NT47 NT65. Hmm, no, that's NT55. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see that:\n\nWait, I need to list all the production rules correctly.\n\nThe grammar is given as a series of lines like:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nand so on.\n\nThen, lower-case letters appear in the grammar, such as NT74, etc. Each line has a production, and they can be either non-terminal leading to other non-terminals or non-terminals leading to terminals.\n\nFor example, looking for the production rules that produce t symbols.\n\nI see lines like:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t74\nNT12 \u2192 t85\nNT17 \u2192 t73\nNT16 \u2192 t71\nNT69 \u2192 t93\nNT68 \u2192 t82\nNT7 \u2192 t74\nNT66 \u2192 t26\nNT9 \u2192 t46\nNT90 \u2192 t22\nNT12 \u2192 t1\nNT50 \u2192 t59\nNT80 \u2192 t55\nNT33 \u2192 t8\nNT92 \u2192 t56\nNT53 \u2192 t43\nNT92 \u2192 t76\nNT70 \u2192 t82\nNT35 \u2192 t91\nNT0 \u2192 t29\nNT11 \u2192 t87\nNT66 \u2192 t92\nNT53 \u2192 t45\nNT92 \u2192 t76\nNT70 \u2192 t82\nNT35 \u2192 t91\nNT0 \u2192 t29\nNT11 \u2192 t87\nNT66 \u2192 t92\n\nWait, some of these might be more relevant.\n\nI think I can create a mapping of non-terminals to their terminals.\n\nBut wait, the non-terminals that directly map to terminals are those with productions that have an 'a' on the right-hand side, such as NT7 \u2192 t74. So, for example, NT7 produces the terminal t74.\n\nSo, given that, for each terminal in the string, I need to find a production for the corresponding non-terminals leading up to that.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to work top-down or bottom-up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each terminal can be traced back to the initial symbol S.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to recognize that this grammar is actually defining all possible combinations of terminals, but given the structure, it's a linear grammar.\n\nAlternatively, it might help to parse the string from the given production rules.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each one must be produced by a non-terminal. Therefore, for each tX in the string, there must be a production for the non-terminal X that directly produces tX.\n\nSo, for example, for 't55', the non-terminal must be NT55, which has a production to t55. Looking at the grammar, I don't see an NT55 production that directly maps to t55. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT80 \u2192 t55.\n\nYes, looking at the production rules, under NT80:\n\nNT80 \u2192 NT17 NT44.\n\nWait, but then looking further down the list, I see:\n\nNT80 \u2192 t55.\n\nYes, so NT80 can produce t55. So the first symbol 't55' is derived from NT80.\n\nNext is 't85', which is NT12.\n\nLooking at NT12, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 \u2192 t85.\n\nYes, so that's straightforward.\n\nThen 't7', which is NT7.\n\nLooking for NT7 in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t74.\n\nYes, so NT7 can produce t7.\n\nNext, 't8' which would correspond to NT8, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT8 rule. Wait, does any NT8 non-terminal exist? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see any NT8 entries. So that's a problem because 't8' cannot be generated from any non-terminal. Unless, maybe, I made a mistake in mapping.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. The NT productions are in the form of NT followed by numbers, and each of these has productions that are either other NT rules or a terminal.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The NT entries and their productions:\n\nFor example, NT74 is defined as NT39 NT99, as per the production:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\n\nSimilarly, NT39:\n\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25\n\nAnd so on until NT80, which has a production:\n\nNT80 -> t55\n\nSo, this means that NT80 can produce the terminal t55.\n\nBut for 't8', I don't see any NTn rule that directly produces t8. Let me check through all the grammar rules to see if any NTn has a production that produces t8.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI see:\n\nNT35 -> NT34 NT25\n\nNT53 -> t43\n\nNT92 -> t56\n\nNT57 -> t18\n\nNT70 -> t82\n\nNT72 -> t72\n\nNT20 -> t17\n\nNT20 -> t0\n\nNT70 -> t82\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed one.

{"custom_id":"request-597","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is quite large with a bunch of productions, and the string to check is a sequence of symbols ending with 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The provided grammar has a lot of such productions, which makes it a bit complex. The string given is `t55 t17 t16 t6 t19 t46 t5 t18 t55 t80 t14 t6 t87 t9 t8 t85 t5 t17 t92 t38 t9 t26 t8 t22 t20 t29 t14 t88 t43 t26 t19 t93`. \n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string from left to right using the grammar, building a derivation tree or at least a parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to manually apply the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of 't' followed by numbers, which suggests that the non-terminals (like NT) are expanded into terminals (t followed by digits) through the productions. So each terminal in the string corresponds to a production that replaces a non-terminal.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation would involve expanding the start symbol S into two non-terminals, and then recursively expanding those non-terminals until terminals are reached. Each step of the derivation corresponds to a parse step, so the length of the string gives me an idea of how deep the derivation is.\n\nThe string has 31 symbols, meaning it's 31-1=30 steps deep since each expansion adds one symbol to the string. Wait, no, actually, the number of steps in the derivation corresponds to the number of symbols in the string minus one because each production either keeps the length the same or increases it by one. But in CNF, all productions produce two symbols if they're non-terminals. Hmm, I might be getting that wrong. Wait, in CNF, each production is A -> BC or A -> a, where BC are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So each step expands one non-terminal into two symbols. So for a string of length n, the derivation tree would have a height of n-1, which for 31 symbols would mean 30 levels. That seems a bit too deep, but maybe the grammar can handle that. Alternatively, perhaps the number of symbols is 30, but I'm not sure; maybe I should focus on the structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has several productions. Each production of S starts with S -> NT followed by another NT. For example:\n\nS -> NT44 NT74\nWait, that production is S -> NT44 NT74. So each production of S is two non-terminals. When S is derived, it'll be replaced by two non-terminals, then each of those can be further expanded. \n\nThe string starts with t55, which suggests that the first production is t55, which is a terminal. In the grammar, looking for 't55' in the productions: \n\nLooking through the given productions, I see that NT53 -> 't43', NT50 -> 't59', etc. Wait, no, some rules replace non-terminals with 't' followed by a number. Let's see:\n\nIn the given grammar, after NT92 etc., I see entries like NT90 -> 't22', which is a terminal. So, each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a specific production rule. \n\nTo start, let me try to parse the string step by step. Maybe I'll use a recursive descent approach, expanding non-terminals as I go. \n\nFirst, the entire string starts with 't55'. So, what's the rule that produces 't55'? Looking through the grammar, I remember there is a production NT9 -> 't46' and NT5 -> 't5'. Wait, does any rule have 't55'? Hmm, looking through the rules, for example, NT76 -> 't63'? No. Wait, in the given rules, I see NT59 -> 't6', and NT26 -> 't19', etc., but no 't55' immediately. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me check again. \n\nWait, in the rules provided, I see NT40 -> NT16 NT80, but also, looking for 't' followed by numbers, perhaps 't55' comes from a specific production. Hmm, perhaps NT40? Wait, NT40 production is NT40 -> NT16 NT80, but I also saw NT59 -> 't6' and other rules. Alternatively, perhaps the 't55' is produced by a rule like NT93 -> 't55'?\n\nWait, no, looking again, there's NT35 -> 't88', and NT12 -> 't1', etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look carefully. I see:\n\nLooking through the last part of the grammar:\n\nNT56 -> NT92 NT40\n\nNT57 -> NT55 NT61\n\nNT58 -> ... ? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Alternatively, perhaps 't55' is produced by NT9 in this grammar. Wait, looking for any production where nt[?]-> t55. Maybe the rule is NT59->t6 is at the end, but I don't see that. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, I might be overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. Let me list all the productions where a non-terminal is converted into a terminal (i.e., where the right-hand side is a single 't' followed by a number). Because each such production is a terminal symbol, and in the grammar, those will be the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n\n- NT50 -> 't59'\n\n- NT77 -> NT92 NT85\n\n- NT12 -> 't85' ?\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, for example, NT12 is defined twice: once as NT12 -> 't85' and once as NT12 -> NT93 NT70. So, that might be conflicting. Similarly, other non-terminals can have both terminals and non-terminals in their rules. \n\nBut for the 't' symbols, the rules that produce them are:\n\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n\n- NT50 -> 't59'\n\n- NT76 -> 't6'\n\nWait, let me list all such cases:\n\nLooking through the given grammar, each production that directly relates to a 't' symbol:\n\nLooking for NTxxxx -> 'txxx' in the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-604","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF is where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side, right? Let me check the grammar provided to make sure it's in CNF. \n\nLooking at the rules like S -> NT74 NT44, that's two symbols, so that's fine. All the rules seem to fit the CNF structure because each has exactly two non-terminals except for the terminals. Wait, actually, in some cases, are terminals allowed on the right-hand side in CNF? I think in CNF, the right side can have terminals, but in standard CNF as per the pumping lemma, it's usually productions of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals. But I recall that sometimes there's a variant where productions can have a single terminal. Or maybe the grammar here is being presented in a more restricted form where all productions are two non-terminals. Let me double-check all the productions. \n\nLooking through, I see rules like NT74->NT39 NT99, which are two non-terminals. S->NT74 NT44 is also two. NT28->'t20' NT13, wait, now that's an issue. Here we have NT28 \u2192 't20' NT13, which is a terminal and a non-terminal. So that's a problem because in CNF, each production can only have non-terminals. So maybe this is not in standard CNF. But the user said it's in Chomsky Normal Form, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the symbols. Maybe NT28 can produce a terminal, which would be allowed in some variations of CNF, or perhaps 't20' represents a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the grammar provided seems to mix these\u2014some productions have two non-terminals, others have a single terminal. For example, NT28 \u2192 't20' NT13 is a mix; so that might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the 't' symbols are part of the non-terminals, but that's not typical. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is presented in a way that all non-terminals can produce terminals, so it's still CNF. But in standard CNF, only the start symbol can produce terminals in the form A \u2192 a, but others have to have two non-terminals. So this might not be a strict CNF, but perhaps the user considered that the grammar is in CNF, so maybe I should proceed under that assumption.\n\nMoving on, the string to evaluate is: `t52 t88 t72 t98 t92 t56 t20 t70 t72 t38 t26 t70 t8 t19 t5 t16 t38 t29 t5 t7 t46 t5 t7 t29 t93 t88 t8 t31 t38 t92 t43 t5`.\n\nSo, each token in the string is separated by a space, and each token seems to be either a string starting with 't' followed by a number, or maybe some other symbols? Looking at the grammar, the productions for some terminals are given. For example, some NT symbols are transformed into t followed by numbers. For instance, NT70 -> 't74' NT73, so NT70 produces t74 followed by NT73. Similarly, others like NT12 -> 't16' or NT12->'t85'. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because I thought all in CNF can only have terminals and non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps the 't' symbols are part of the non-terminals, so in the production, they are considered non-terminals that produce a terminal symbol.\n\nGiven the confusion about the grammar, perhaps I should instead treat the problem as a parsing problem using the given CFG. Since the CFG is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But CYK can be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to see if each token can be generated by following the productions step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, each token starts with 't', except possibly the last few. Wait, looking again, the string is: t52, t88, t72, t98, t92, t56, t20, t70, t72, etc. All tokens seem to be of the form 't' followed by a number except the last few, but let me check. For example, t29, t46, t5. Hmm, all tokens are 't' followed by numbers, with one exception possibly t5 at the end. But wait, in the grammar, some non-terminal symbols produce 't' followed by numbers, like NT59 -> 't6', so 't6' is generated from NT59.\n\nWait, but in the string, the last token is t5. So perhaps t5 is a terminal, but in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't5'. Or maybe in the grammar, I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is designed such that certain non-terminals can only produce these 't' terms, and the rest are built up from them.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each token in the string is a terminal that is produced by at least one rule in the grammar. Let me list out all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals used are:\n\nt5, t7, t8, t16, t19, t20, t25, t26, t28, t29, t31, t33, t35, t38, t40, t43, t44, t45, t46, t47, t50, t53, t55, t56, t57, t58, t59, t60, t61, t62, t63, t64, t65, t66, t67, t68, t69, t70, t71, t72, t73, t74, t75, t80, t81, t82, t83, t84, t85, t86, t87, t88, t89, t90, t91, t92, t93, t94, t95, t96, t97, t98.\n\nWait, but the string given is: t52, t88, t72, t98, t92, t56, t20, t70, t72, t38, t26, t70, t8, t19, t5, t16, t38, t29, t5, t7, t46, t5, t7, t29, t93, t88, t8, t31, t38, t92, t43, t5.\n\nSo in the string, we have 't5', which is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, NT19 -> 't14'? Wait, no. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see things like NT66 -> 't6', NT59 -> 't6', and others. Wait, where does 't5' come from? Let's check the production rules. Scanning through, I notice NT13 -> 't31', NT31 -> 't31' (producing itself, but probably that's a typo or something). But I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't5' directly. Looking through all the productions, the only place where 't5' appears is in the middle of a production, perhaps. Wait, in the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't5'? For example, I see NT18 -> 't14', but not 't5'. Wait, does NT9 produce 't5'? Let me check: looking at the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't5'. So, maybe this is part of a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terminal 't5' can be derived from some non-terminals. Wait, let me recheck the grammar rules carefully:\n\nLooking for any production that yields 't5'. The given rules do not have any right-hand side that starts with 't5'. So if 't5' is in the string, but the grammar doesn't have a production for it, that would mean that the string cannot be generated, so the answer would be 'No'. \n\nBut let me double-check: does any production produce 't5'? I see NT9 -> 't5' in one"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-618","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it might make parsing easier, but I'll need to think about how to approach this.\n\nThe grammar starts with S and has several productions, like S \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, and S \u2192 NT40 NT92. These are all starting points, so the first symbols of the string should match one of these when considering the top-down approach.\n\nThe string is: t72 t31 t56 t59 t11 t88 t59 t46 t93 t74 t17 t18 t5 t70 t26 t26 t87 t22 t17 t46 t93 t38 t91 t80 t31 t7 t71 t46 t72 t17 t29 t11 t45.\n\nWait, that's 33 tokens. Let me check if all are terminals or non-terminals. The string has a mix of t followed by numbers and some NT terms like NT74, NT44, etc. Wait no, looking again, all the entries in the string start with 't', except for some that might be in the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a 't' and a number, like NT74 \u2192 t74, NT44 \u2192 t44, etc. So the productions for NTs sometimes expand into a terminal followed by a number or another non-terminal.\n\nSo the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, each of which will expand into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals until they reach the base cases where they produce a terminal like t72, t31, etc.\n\nThe string begins with t72, t31, t56, etc. Let me see if these match any of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT72 is a non-terminal that produces t72. Similarly, NT31 produces t31. So for the string to start with t72, the first NT in the starting production must be NT72.\n\nWait, looking at the starting productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo the first non-terminals are NT74, NT11, or NT40.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t72. So that would require that one of the non-terminals in the starting production is NT72. However, the starting productions don't have NT74, NT11, or NT40 as NT72. So that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the NT labels. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT74 is a non-terminal that produces t74, and similarly, NT31 is a non-terminal that produces t31. So in the first step, S can expand to NT74 NT44, which would produce t74 t44, but the string starts with t72. So that's a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, if the string starts with t72, that would come from NT72, but the starting production S doesn't have NT72. So maybe this string isn't generated by the grammar. But I should check further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there are other productions that can lead to t72. For example, looking at other non-terminals, I see NT73 \u2192 t74, and NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, etc., but I don't see NT72 as a starting point in S. The starting productions are S \u2192 NT74 NT44, etc., so perhaps the grammar doesn't produce t72 at all. Let me check that.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see an NT that starts with 72 except for NT72, which is directly producing t72. But since S doesn't have NT72 as a starting point, it can't reach t72. Therefore, the string starts with t72, which isn't produced by any production starting from S. So the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me make sure.\n\nIn the grammar, the S options are NT74, NT11, NT40. Each of these, in their productions, eventually must expand to terminals. If S can't produce t72 because the starting point can't reach NT72, then t72 can't be generated by S. Therefore, the string starting with t72 can't be part of any derivation from S, so the string isn't in the language.\n\nYes, I think that's the case.

{"custom_id":"request-621","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the rules, the start symbol is S, and it produces combinations like NT49 NT99 or NT0 NT47. From S, all the other symbols are non-terminals (NT) except for some that end with 't', which are terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t52 t0 t26 t18 t17 t6 t0 t71 t82 t16 t91 t76 t29 t88 t74 t43 t29 t11 t76 t16 t31 t72 t0 t43 t16 t71 t16 t9 t80 t98 t16 t45 t16.\n\nSince each non-terminal in the grammar produces two other non-terminals except when it becomes a terminal, the string must parse into a tree of productions starting from S.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with t52. Looking at the grammar, t52 is generated by NT51 (since NT51 \u2192 NT98 and then NT98 \u2192 t52). So, NT51 must be the root of the parse tree, which is S's production. So, S produces NT51 NT98. Wait, no, looking at the productions, S can produce NT51 NT12, not NT51 NT98. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar has S \u2192 NT51 NT12. But NT51's production is NT55 NT19, which goes to t98, so the first symbol t52 is from NT51 \u2192 NT98 \u2192 t52. So, this suggests that the start of the string is coming from NT51 producing a terminal t52, which would mean that S must have a production that eventually leads to NT51.\n\nLooking at the productions, S can produce NT51 via which path? Wait, looking back, S can produce NT51 NT38, but I don't see S directly producing NT51. Wait, S's productions are the initial ones: S \u2192 NT49 NT74, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, etc. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the S productions:\n- S \u2192 NT49 NT74\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\nNone of these seem to directly lead to NT51. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check all the S productions:\n\n1. S -> NT49 NT74\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nNo, none of them directly produce NT51. Wait, that can't be right because in the string, the first symbol is t52, which comes from NT51. So, how can S reach NT51? That would mean the grammar might not generate this string, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. Maybe I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the string is broken down into a sequence of terminal symbols, each of which corresponds to a step in the grammar's derivations. Since each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals, the entire string length should be 2^n - 1 for some n, where n is the number of productions. But the string has 35 tokens. Let's compute 2^35, which is way larger than 35, so maybe that approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a leftmost derivation, the number of symbols in the string would correspond to the number of steps. But each step adds one symbol. Wait, actually, in CNF, a derivation of a string of length k takes k-1 steps. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nLet me try to parse the string backward, starting from the start symbol S. Each terminal in the string must be the result of the last production, which produces a terminal. So, the last symbol in the string is t45. Looking at the grammar, t45 is generated by NT16 (since NT16 \u2192 t70), but wait, no\u2014looking through the rules, I don't see a terminal 't45'. Wait, wait, let's go through each production that ends in 't'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\n- t52 (from NT51)\n- t74 (from NT14)\n- t6 (from NT7)\n- t85 (from NT75)\n- t1 (from NT47)\n- t71 (from NT16)\n- t31 (from NT35)\n- t80 (from NT4)\n- t98 (from NT22)\n- t9 (from NT90)\n- t5 (from NT9)\n- t43 (from NT84)\n- etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the production rules and find which ones have terminals at the end.\n\nFrom the given production rules, many end in terminals as the last step:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT98 (and NT98 is t52)\n- NT51 \u2192 NT56 (which leads to t43, but that's another path)\n- NT47 \u2192 NT61, which then leads to t72, etc.\n\nWait, let me start from the end of the string. The last token is t16. Let's trace back where t16 comes from.\n\nLooking through the rules, 't16' is produced by NT16 (since NT16 \u2192 t71 is not correct; wait, let me check the rules:\n\nThe rules for 't16' are not directly given, but in the production rules, there's NT16 \u2192 t71, so t71 is produced by NT16.\n\nWait, looking at the rules provided, I have:\n\n- NT16 \u2192 t71 (is this correct? Let me check: Looking at the given rules, the rule is NT16 \u2192 t71. So NT16 terminates at t71.\n\nWait, but in the string, there's t71, t31, t72, etc. So let me try to see each step.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me start with the string:\n\nt52 t0 t26 t18 t17 t6 t0 t71 t82 t16 t91 t76 t29 t88 t74 t43 t29 t11 t76 t16 t31 t72 t0 t43 t16 t71 t16 t9 t80 t98 t16 t45 t16\n\nI'll reverse the string since parsing is usually easier from the end.\n\nReversed string: t16 t45 t98 t90 t80 t... up to t52.\n\nStarting with t16, which is from NT16 (since NT16 \u2192 t71? Wait, no\u2014let me check the rules. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t7\n- NT17 \u2192 t73\n- NT16 \u2192 t71 (is this correct? Wait, looking at the rules, I think I missed this earlier. Let me check all the NT productions for terminals:\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, the ones that end in a terminal seem to be:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t49\n- NT17 \u2192 t73\n- NT16 \u2192 t71\n- NT18 \u2192 t14\n- Wait, perhaps I should list all NT productions and note which end in terminals.\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47\n- NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n- NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n- NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n- NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n- NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n- NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\n- NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\n- NT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12\n- NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\n- NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65\n- NT76 \u2192 NT2 NT68\n- NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT99\n- NT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98\n- NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13\n- NT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25\n- NT12 \u2192 NT93 NT70\n- NT91 \u2192 NT64 NT90\n- NT34 \u2192 NT56 NT93\n- NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34\n- NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. I notice that the starting symbol is S, and the initial productions from S are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the string must start with whatever the right-hand side of these productions can generate. Also, some NT symbols are defined to produce other NT symbols, and some are defined to produce terminal characters like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at the string: `t59 t59 t91 t74 t52 t88 t56 t14 t87 t1 t5 t17 t52 t5 t6 t52 t82 t6 t59 t31 t74 t9 t70 t16 t26 t14 t43 t80 t92 t5 t82 t76 t19 t31`.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of tokens. It seems quite long, but I'll process it step by step.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So, the string must start with NT74 followed by NT44. Looking at the string, the first token is t59, which doesn't match NT74 or NT44. Hmm, that's odd. So maybe the grammar has another starting production. Wait, no\u2014the initial productions I wrote are the three for S. But I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar more carefully. The grammar has S \u2192 NT74 NT44, and in the NT rules, NT74 is defined as NT39 NT99. So the only way to get 't59' is through some NT rule that eventually produces 't59'. Wait, but wait, the string starts with t59, which suggests that maybe the starting point is another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The strings like NT74 are terminals or non-terminals? No, in the grammar, NT symbols are non-terminals because they are expanded into other symbols. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t59.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, which is another non-terminal. But in the string, the first token is t59, so perhaps the expansion starts with a production that leads directly to a terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, some NT symbols produce terminals. For example, NT92 \u2192 t52, NT44 \u2192 t56, etc. So, to get a 't' token, the NT must produce it directly.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t59, which must come from some production rule where NT59 \u2192 t59. Let me check the grammar: I don't see a rule NT59 \u2192 t59, but wait, perhaps via reduction.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Are there any NT rules that directly produce t59? Let me scan through the grammar:\n\nLooking through the '\u2192' rules, I see:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 t38\n- NT18 \u2192 t76\n- NT28 \u2192 t20\n- NT93 \u2192 t80\n- NT1 \u2192 t70\n- NT24 \u2192 t88\n- NT28 \u2192 t26\n- NT59 \u2192 t6\nWait, that's it. Oh, wait, in the grammar, NT59 is defined as \u2192 t6. So NT59 directly produces 't6'. Hmm, so 't59' is not a terminal, but a non-terminal NT59 that produces 't6'.\n\nWait, but in that case, the string cannot have 't59' as a terminal; it should be part of an NT that eventually leads to 't59'. Wait, maybe I misread the string.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. Are there any rules that produce 't59'? Looking at the rules, I see that NT59 \u2192 t6. So NT59 produces 't6', meaning that whenever we have NT59 in the derivation, it's replaced by 't6'. So the string should not contain 't59' as a terminal because the only way to get 't59' is if it's a terminal in the grammar, but I don't see any NT59 \u2192 t59. Instead, it's 't6'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me list the rules again:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 t52 (so t52 is produced)\n- NT44 \u2192 t56\n- S's productions are all into NT..., so S must generate sequences of NT symbols.\n\nTherefore, any 't' in the string must be the result of an NT directly producing a terminal, using their definitions.\n\nNow, the first token in the string is 't59'. But according to the grammar, there's no production leading NT59 to t59; instead, NT59 \u2192 t6. So that would mean 't59' is never a terminal. Therefore, if the string starts with 't59', that would mean that NT59 must immediately produce 't59', but according to the grammar, that's not the case. Therefore, the string is invalid because the first token is not a terminal but a non-terminal NT that can only produce 't6'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe 't59' is an NT that somehow can be broken down, but according to the given rules, every NT leads to more non-terminals or to a 't'.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar was presented with the rules as lines, and some NT symbols are non-terminals that produce a single 't' followed by a number. So for example, the rule NT59 \u2192 t6 means that NT59 can be replaced by the string 't6'. But in the provided string, the first token is t59, which suggests that NT59 is being replaced by 't59'. But according to the grammar, NT59 can only produce 't6', not 't59'. Therefore, the first token should be 't6', not 't59'.\n\nWait, that's the crux. If the grammar doesn't have a rule that allows NT59 to produce 't59', then the string containing 't59' is invalid. Unless there's a chain of rules that somehow leads to 't59', but from the given rules, I don't see that happening.\n\nWait, but let me check all the productions to make sure I didn't miss any rule that could produce 't59'. Going through the rules list again, I don't see any NT rule that produces 't59'. The closest is NT59 \u2192 t6. So 't59' can't be generated by any production. Therefore, the string cannot have 't59' as a terminal because there's no rule to produce it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me make sure all rules are written correctly. The grammar might have a production for NT59, but looking through the list again, I don't see that. So 't59' as a terminal is impossible. Therefore, the string starts with 't59', which can't be generated by any rule in the grammar. So the string can't be in the language, and the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's confusion between NT59 and t59. Because in the grammar, all non-terminals are represented as NT followed by a number, and terminals start with 't' and have numbers as well. So, in the string, the first token is 't59', which must come from some NT rule. But according to the grammar, the only rule involving 't' is NT59 \u2192 t6. That means the only terminal in the grammar is 't6', so any 't' token in the string must be 't6'.\n\nSo, the string starting with 't59' is impossible because there's no rule that leads to 't59'; the only terminal is 't6'.

{"custom_id":"request-642","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll take a closer look at the grammar provided. CNF is characterized by production rules where the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols, except for the start symbol which can have a single terminal. All productions are of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the productions are indeed in CNF, with two non-terminals on the RHS, except for some that have terminals. For example, S -> NT74 NT44 is in CNF, but when I see the terminals like 't6', 't74', etc., I realize those are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is `t0 t70 t70 t0 t1 t80 t1 t85 t59 t85 t16 t71 t8 t9 t59 t87 t70 t46 t72 t92 t82 t72 t56 t19 t18 t8 t16 t55 t52 t46 t98 t38 t22 t72`. It seems like it's a sequence of terminals, each possibly representing a node in the parse tree.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production step introduces two non-terminals. So, the parsing process should involve generating the string by expanding non-terminals into pairs until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nTo approach this problem, I think I should try to construct a parse tree for the given string. Each step should expand a non-terminal into two others (or a terminal if it's a leaf), working from the start symbol S down to the leaves matching the string.\n\nStarting with S, which is non-terminal. Let's see the productions for S:\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the first step is to choose one of these to expand. Let's pick the first one: S -> NT74 NT44. Now, we need to see if the given string starts with the terminals that NT74 and NT44 produce.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t0. So, let's check NT74 production. From the grammar, NT74 -> NT39 NT99. Then, NT39 -> NT8 NT25, and so on. This seems a bit complex, so perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their producing rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent parser would be more straightforward, but given that I have to do this manually, I'll try to track possible expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for the start symbol's productions and see which one starts the string. Since the string starts with t0, t70, etc., I can check if any of the S productions lead to a sequence that starts with these.\n\nAnother approach is to notice that each production in CNF introduces exactly two non-terminals at each step. So, the string's length must be a power of 2 minus some offset. The initial string has 33 tokens. Let's see if that's valid. If S expands into two non-terminals, each of those would expand into two, making 4, then 8, then 16, 32, etc. 33 is one more than 32, which is 2^5, so maybe it's possible but perhaps not.\n\nWait, 32 is 2^5, which would mean a valid expansion with 5 levels. But 33 is odd, so perhaps it's invalid. Wait, no, because the initial S would be replaced by two symbols, which would be replaced each by two, resulting in 2^1 = 2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, etc. So a string of 33 is not a power of 2, which might make it invalid. That could already be a hint that it's not generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just think about the grammar's terminals. Each terminal corresponds to a specific production of a non-terminal. For example, NT74 -> NT39 NT99, but perhaps somewhere along the way, these non-terminals produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT74 -> 't74' somewhere, but no, in the grammar provided, I don't see NT74 producing a terminal. Wait, does any NT have a production that results in a terminal? Let me scan the productions again.\n\nLooking through each line, for example, NT74 -> NT99 NT28. Hmm, but that's not a terminal. Wait, let me see: some non-terminals do have terminal productions. For example, I see NT7 -> 't74', and NT16 -> 't71', etc. So, yes, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. So, when those are encountered, they produce just that single terminal.\n\nSo, in the parse tree, any occurrence of these non-terminals would result in a single terminal in the string.\n\nGiven that, the given string has a length of 33. Each step in the parsing process can only add one non-terminal, splitting into two. So, the length of the string must be 2^k - 1, where k is the depth. For example, 1 (k=1), 3 (k=2), 7 (k=3), 15 (k=4), 31 (k=5), 63 (k=6), etc.\n\n33 is between 15 and 31, more precisely, 31 + 2 more letters. Wait, no, 33 isn't 31. Alternatively, maybe the initial expansion is S, which is two, then each expansion doubles. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\n- S (non-terminal) is two symbols when expanded (e.g., NT74 NT44). Then each of those, if they are non-terminals, would each split into two, leading to 4, and so on.\n\nSo the total number of terminals in the string must be a power of 2. But 33 isn't a power of 2. 2^5=32, 2^6=64. So 33 is not a power of 2. Therefore, the string can't be generated by a grammar in CNF because the length isn't compatible.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The initial string has 33 terminals. Starting from S, each expansion step doubles the number of non-terminals. When all non-terminals are exhausted, the total number of terminals should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps we took to expand all.\n\nBut 33 is not a power of two. So for example, 16 is 2^4, 32 is 2^5, which is close. 33 isn't a power of two. So that's a red flag. That suggests that the string is invalid. So the answer might be 'No'.\n\nBut to make sure, let me try to see if 33 can be formed by some expansion. Let's say we start with S, which becomes NT74 NT44. Each of these could be further expanded into two non-terminals. The process continues until all non-terminals are leaves, resulting in a string of length 2^k where k is the number of times we applied production rules.\n\nWait, each time you fully expand all non-terminals once, the length increases from 2 to 4, 4 to 8, etc. So the total number of terminals must be a power of two. 32 terminal symbols would correspond to 2^5, but our string has 33, which is one more than 32. Hence, impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to determine if the string `t55 t31 t73 t11 t98 t31 t7 t52 t20 t56 t14 t14 t46 t46 t18 t70 t59 t70 t7 t91 t74 t74 t18 t11 t46 t76 t91 t9 t6 t29 t31 t31 t52 t87 t80` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. The grammar has non-terminals such as S, NT49, NT39, and so on, and terminals which are strings of the form 'tN' where N is a number. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are all in Chomsky normal form, meaning each rule produces two non-terminals except for the ones where a terminal appears.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- S -> NT74 NT44\n- S can also produce other combinations like NT49 NT0, etc.\n\nThe string starts with t55, which must come from a terminal. Let's look at the terminal rules to see how 't55' can be formed. From the grammar, I see that 't55' is produced by NT55 -> 't55'. So, in the string, the first part should come from NT55. \n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t55, t31, t73, t11, t98, t31... Each of these must be terminals derived from their respective non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider how each of these might be formed. For example, 't55' is directly a terminal from NT55.\n\nNext, 't31' must come from a production that generates 't31'. From the rules, I see NT53 -> t45... Wait, that's 't45'. Another rule for NT53 is NT53 -> t45? No, let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT53 -> t45? Wait, no, let's check each production rule that has 't'...\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT55 -> 't55'\n\nNT47 -> 't72'\n\nNT53 -> t45\n\nNT12 -> 't1'\n\nNT69 -> 't93'\n\nNT68 -> 't82'\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT18 -> 't14'\n\nNT93 -> 't80'\n\nNT18 -> 't19'\n\nNT20 -> 't17'\n\nNT20 -> 't0'\n\nNT28 -> 't20'\n\nNT69 -> 't93'\n\nNT68 -> 't82'\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT66 -> 't26'\n\nNT9 -> 't46'\n\nNT90 -> 't22'\n\nNT12 -> 't1'\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in my approach. To find if the string is generated, I need to see if each terminal can be a result of a production step. Since all productions are in CNF, it means each non-terminal expands to two non-terminals, or terminals.\n\nEach production in CNF has either two non-terminals or a terminal. But wait, no: in Chomsky Normal Form, productions can be A->BC or A->a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, some rules have two non-terminals, others have a terminal and a non-terminal? Or wait, looking back, maybe not. Wait, the given grammar has all rules as A->BC, because for example:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44: two non-terminals.\n\nBut in the rules, there are cases like:\n\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\n\nNT57 -> NT85 NT56\n\nWait, no, all the listed rules are of the form NTxxx -> NTxx NTyy, except for the terminals like 't55', 't31', etc. So actually, the terminals only appear as single symbols on the RHS, not paired with non-terminals. Therefore, each production rule either produces a terminal symbol or two non-terminals.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nNT55 -> t55: this is a production where a non-terminal NT55 produces a terminal 't55'.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 might produce 't45' or something else, but in the given rules, let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n\n- NT18 -> 't14'\n\n- NT93 -> 't80'\n\n- NT18 -> 't19'\n\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n\n- NT20 -> 't0'\n\n- NT28 -> 't20'\n\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n\n- NT9 -> 't46'\n\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n\n- NT39 -> 't9'\n\n- NT92 -> 't52'\n\n- NT70 -> 't82'\n\n- NT35 -> 't91'\n\n- NT0 -> 't29'\n\n- NT11 -> 't87'\n\n- NT66 -> 't46'\n\n- NT51 -> 't98'\n\n- NT44 -> 't56'\n\n- NT53 -> 't45'\n\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n\nSo, the terminals are directly produced by certain non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, each 'tX' is produced by a specific NT non-terminal.\n\nNow, the string to parse is:\n\nt55 t31 t73 t11 t98 t31 t7 t52 t20 t56 t14 t14 t46 t46 t18 t70 t59 t70 t7 t91 t74 t74 t18 t11 t46 t76 t91 t9 t6 t29 t31 t31 t52 t87 t80\n\nSo each token in the string must be a terminal derived from some NT, and the entire string must be derived by applying the productions correctly.\n\nGiven that, I need to see if this string is a valid sequence of terminal expansions according to the grammar.\n\nThe first token is t55, which comes from NT55 -> t55.\n\nThe second is t31, which is produced by NT53 -> t45... Wait, no, according to the rules, does any non-terminal produce 't31'? Looking back, I don't see a rule where NT something produces 't31'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I see:\n\nNT53 -> t45\n\nBut where does 't31' come from? Hmm, maybe I need to check all the rules again.\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see any production that results in 't31'. So perhaps 't31' cannot be derived from the grammar, meaning the entire string can't be generated. Wait, that can't be the case because the question expects me to give a 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nLooking again, I see that NT53 can produce 't45'. Wait, so maybe 't45' comes from NT53, and other NT's produce 't's.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule that produces 't31'. Let me go through the list carefully.\n\nI see NT12 -> 't1', NT39 -> 't9', NT53 -> 't45', NT18 -> 't14', 't19', etc. Hmm, I don't see any 't31' being produced.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the rules. Let me re-express the rules as a list and check again.\n\nThe production rules are as follows (abbreviated):\n\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\n\nNT57 -> NT85 NT56\n\nNT57 -> NT19 NT99\n\nNT38 -> NT13 NT98\n\n... and so on.\n\nLooking for any NT that expands to 't31':\n\nI don't see any. So, for example, the string starts with t31, but since there's no NT that produces 't31', it's impossible for 't31' to be in the language generated by this grammar. Therefore, the entire string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but the second token is t31, which would require the first NT to produce 't31', but as per the rules, it's not possible.

The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, and I need to parse it using the rules provided.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. The top-level symbols are S, and according to the rules, S can produce combinations like NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, and others. Each NT production is broken down further until it eventually produces 't' followed by a number. \n\nThe string given is:\n\nt11 t73 t76 t56 t98 t73 t71 t6 t11 t85 t52 t74 t7 t11 t43 t38 t80 t5 t85 t38 t6 t88 t52 t52 t11 t93 t8 t8 t56 t29 t76 t29 t1 t19 t93.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the NTs are non-terminals that need to be expanded according to the production rules.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, which can be expanded into NT74 NT44, etc. Each of these NTs is part of a production that may split into other NTs or terminals. The string seems quite long, but maybe I can look for a parsing strategy.\n\nI'll attempt a leftmost derivation approach. Starting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44. But looking at the string, it starts with t11, so maybe S also has other production rules that can start with NT11 or similar.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar's S productions are:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo the initial symbols can be any of these three combinations. The string starts with t11, which suggests that the first production might come from NT11 NT24, since NT24 might produce something ending with t24 or leading to t24, but I need to check.\n\nWait, looking at the NT24 rule in the grammar: NT24 -> t88 t52. So if there's a production rule that leads to NT24, then the terminal sequence could end with 't52'. But the string starts with t11, which suggests that the initial part of the string comes from S's production NT11 NT24.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the grammar to see if any S's production leads to the starting t11.\n\nWait, the S productions don't directly produce t11. Instead, the NTs are the building blocks. So, for instance, NT11 is a non-terminal that can be expanded into 't'11? Or wait, no, looking at the grammar rules, I don't see NT11 being defined. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar rules, I don't see any production for NT11. Hmm, perhaps I need to check all the NTs to see how they end up in the string.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, let's list all the NTs and their possible expansions to see which can lead to terminals like t11, t73, t76, etc.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT49 -> NT0 NT47\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\nNT57 -> NT85 NT56\nNT51 -> NT19 NT18\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\nNT40 -> NT16 NT80\nNT65 -> NT17 NT19\nNT85 -> NT64 NT12\nNT99 -> NT51 NT66\nNT55 -> NT47 NT65\nNT76 -> NT2 NT68\nNT57 -> NT19 NT99\nNT38 -> NT13 NT98\nNT64 -> NT65 NT13\nNT35 -> NT34 NT25\nNT12 -> NT93 NT70\nNT91 -> NT64 NT90\nNT34 -> NT56 NT93\nNT0 -> NT77 NT34\nNT19 -> NT17 NT57\nNT88 -> NT69 NT44\nNT66 -> NT55 NT1\nNT91 -> NT9 NT47\nNT65 -> NT17 NT55\nNT25 -> NT28 NT7\nNT80 -> NT17 NT44\nNT61 -> NT39 NT38\nNT68 -> NT90 NT38\nNT20 -> NT39 NT25\nNT35 -> NT11 NT77\nNT26 -> NT65 NT50\nNT2 -> NT28 NT13\nNT95 -> NT35 NT74\nNT56 -> NT92 NT40\nNT51 -> NT26 NT59\nNT12 -> NT51 NT20\nNT39 -> NT90 NT1\nNT70 -> NT12 NT90\nNT35 -> NT88 NT53\nNT40 -> NT44 NT98\nNT47 -> NT55 NT61\nNT50 -> NT18 NT85\nNT38 -> NT95 NT33\nNT40 -> NT25 NT85\nNT7 -> NT49 NT73\nNT18 -> NT76 NT91\nNT98 -> NT40 NT56\nNT93 -> NT66 NT64\nNT73 -> 't6'\nNT12 -> 't85'\nNT17 -> 't73'\nNT16 -> 't71'\nNT69 -> 't93'\nNT18 -> 't14'\nNT93 -> 't80'\nNT18 -> 't19'\nNT20 -> 't17'\nNT20 -> 't0'\nNT28 -> 't20'\nNT69 -> 't93'\nNT68 -> 't82'\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT66 -> 't26'\nNT9 -> 't46'\nNT90 -> 't22'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT39 -> 't9'\nNT92 -> 't52'\nNT1 -> 't70'\nNT24 -> 't88'\nNT28 -> 't26'\nNT59 -> 't6'\nNT47 -> 't72'\nNT92 -> 't93'\nNT8 -> 't7'\nNT12 -> 't1'\nNT50 -> 't59'\nNT80 -> 't55'\nNT33 -> 't8'\nNT92 -> 't56'\nNT53 -> 't43'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT66 -> 't46'\nNT51 -> 't98'\nNT44 -> 't56'\n\nWait a minute, the string starts with t11, and looking at the grammar, there's an NT12 production that eventually leads to t11.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part.\n\nLooking back, there's a production NT35 -> NT34 NT25. Then, NT34 -> NT56 NT93, and NT56 -> NT92 NT40, and NT92 -> t52. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing that.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

Specifically, the rule NT12 -> 't11' is given.\n\nSo, the first step is S -> NT12 NT24. Then, NT12 -> t11, and NT24 -> t88 t52. So from the first two steps, we get t11 t88 t52.

{"custom_id":"request-676","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string can be produced by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I remember that CNF grammars have rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the non-terminals start with 'S' and other uppercase letters like NT49, NT39, etc., and eventually some symbols like 't74', 't28', etc., which are likely terminals. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals, ending with 't20', but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the given string. The string is: `t59 t85 t20 t87 t20 t76 t38 t76 t71 t88 t98 t11 t5 t74 t19 t87 t19 t93 t73 t18 t9 t82 t46 t76 t20 t55 t20 t82 t9 t7 t76 t93 t0 t7 t16 t92`.\n\nWait, the string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, each representing a terminal symbol. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the given CFG.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces a pair of non-terminals or a single terminal. So, to generate the string, each terminal must correspond to a production that expands into that terminal directly, or through a series of such expansions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many of the NT rules produce two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which means S can expand to NT74 and NT44. Each of these NT rules continues to break down into more non-terminals until eventually, some of them produce terminals.\n\nTo parse the string, perhaps a top-down parsing approach is suitable, starting from S and trying to decompose the string step by step. Alternatively, I could use the CYK algorithm, but that's more efficient and probably not necessary here since the string isn't very long.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the string starts with 't59', which is one of the terminals. Looking at the grammar, I see the rule NT59 \u2192 't6'. So 't59' can only come from NT59 producing 't6'. Then, looking at the context, where does NT59 appear in the grammar? The string of NT rules is given, and I can see:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I notice NT59 is defined as NT91 \u2192 NT91 -> 't93' (from the given list, e.g., NT91 \u2192 NT93, etc.?). Wait, no, wait. Let me check the provided NT rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't59' is not listed. Wait, let me check each line carefully. The user provided a list where each line seems to define a rule. For example, the first line is 'S -> NT74 NT44'; the next is S -> NT11 NT24; then S -> NT40 NT92.\n\nThen, the NT rules start with NT49 -> NT0 NT47, NT39 -> NT8 NT25, etc.\n\nGoing through the NT rules in the list provided:\n\nI need to find 't59' in the terminals. Scanning through the list, I see entries like 't74', 't19', 't88', etc. Looking for 't59', I see this line: NT51 \u2192 NT11 NT77.

The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is `t72 t74 t0 t14 t52 t8 t1 t45 t73 t1 t29 t7 t73 t20 t87 t20 t14 t46 t18 t14 t6 t43 t46 t17 t26 t70 t93 t82 t93 t43 t0 t8 t26 t76 t59 t92`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. From the given grammar, I can see that most of the rules are non-terminals producing two other non-terminals, except some which directly produce terminals. For example, `NT7 -> 't74'` and `NT73 -> 't6'`.\n\nGiven the string, I notice it's a sequence of terminal symbols (like t72, t74, etc.) separated by spaces. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nStarting with the grammar, I see that S can be transformed into NT44 NT49 or other combinations. Each of these NTs can further split into other NTs or terminals.\n\nTo approach this, perhaps I should try to find a derivation step by step. However, with a string of 37 terminals, that might get quite complicated. Maybe I can work backwards, checking if each terminal in the string can be matched by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t72. In the grammar, I don't immediately see a production rule that directly produces t72, except perhaps in some NTe rules. Let me check. Hmm, looking at the list, I see NT73 -> 't6', NT70 -> 't82', NT93 -> 't80', and others. There's also NT18 -> 't14', which is in the string. But I don't see t72 as a direct terminal in the rules. Wait, maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I see NT73 -> 't6', NT46 -> 't26', NT17 -> 't73', etc. It seems t72 isn't a direct terminal. That's a problem because if the first symbol is t72 and there's no production rule that produces it directly, that suggests the grammar might not generate this string. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t72 is part of a longer derivation. For example, maybe a non-terminal NT71 produces t72 or something. Wait, looking again, I see NT71 isn't among the given NT rules. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I need to check if any production rules can lead to t72.\n\nWait, looking through the NTe symbols, I see NT79 isn't there, but perhaps I can find a way. Another approach is to think about the possible non-terminals that might lead to t72. Maybe a series of productions starting from S.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the given string can be broken down using the grammar. Since the string is quite long, it's going to take a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to represent the string in terms of the grammar's production rules.\n\nWait, another thought: in CNF, each production results in exactly two symbols (terminals or non-terminals) except for the ones that produce terminals. Since the string seems to start with a terminal followed by others, let me see if each of these can be matched by the grammar's rules.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t72. I need to see if any non-terminal rule produces t72. Looking through the given rules, I don't see any NT \u2192 t72 directly. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and t72 can't be derived directly. That would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in checking the rules. Let me go through again:\n\nNT73 -> 't6'\n\nNT70 -> 't82'\n\nNT93 -> 't80'\n\nNT73 -> 't6'\n\nNT18 -> 't14'\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces t72 as a terminal. Thus, the first symbol t72 can't be generated by any of the production rules provided.

{"custom_id":"request-696","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that B or C can also be terminals. But wait, looking at the grammar, many of the rules have non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44. NT74 is a non-terminal because it's uppercase, right? So all the uppercase symbols are non-terminals, and the lowercase letters are terminals. So the terminals in this grammar are the 't' followed by numbers, like t6, t7, etc.\n\nThe string we're given is a sequence of terminals: t18 t31 t74 t71 t71 t92 t38 t8 t91 t45 t6 t80 t98 t5 t11 t5 t14 t52 t29 t16 t82 t18 t9 t70 t46 t16 t22 t22 t98 t8 t0 t11 t59 t43 t80 t87 t7. So that's a lot of terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the maximum length of any derivation path for a string of length n is 2n-1. So, for example, a string of length 3 would require a derivation of at most 5 steps. But our string has 34 terminals, which would require up to 67 steps. But to find if the string can be derived, I need to check if each step in the string can be broken down based on the grammar rules.\n\nLet me see if I can parse the string step by step by looking for chunks that match the grammar rules. Maybe a top-down approach would help, but that might be complicated for a long string. Alternatively, I can look for the longest possible substrings that can be generated by the smallest number of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first tokens are t18, t31, t74, t71, t71, t92. Let's see if I can split these into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT31 is not directly a terminal, but in the provided grammar, I see NT31 is produced by some rule? Wait, actually, the grammar only lists specific productions. Let me check the provided grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking at the RHS of the productions, I don't see an NT31 rule, but maybe there are rules that lead to it eventually. Wait, in the grammar provided, for example, NT31 would need to be derived from other non-terminals. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see that NT31 isn't listed as a starting point, but perhaps it's part of a production like NT31 -> something. But in the given rules, I don't see any NT31. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the initial grammar lines start with S and NT49, NT39, etc. So I need to see if the string can be formed by breaking it down into parts that match the productions given.\n\nLet me start at the beginning of the string:\n\n1. t18 t31 t74 t71 t71 t92\n\nI need to see if these can be formed by a single production. Alternatively, perhaps it's split into multiple non-terminals.\n\nLooking for possible splits:\n\n- t18 t31 t74 could be NT18 producing three terminals? But looking at the grammar, NT18 has productions:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT76 NT91 (from line: NT18 -> NT76 NT91)\n\nThen, looking at the lower part of the provided grammar, I don't see NT18 producing t something. Wait, let me check. The lines:\n\nFrom the grammar provided:\n\nLooking for NT18:\nNT18 -> NT76 NT91\nBut that's a production leading to two non-terminals. \n\nWait, looking through the grammar lines, I see:\n\nNT18 -> NT70 NT46 (from line: NT18 -> NT70 NT46)\nWait, no, let me check. Looking for NT18:\n\nLooking through the provided lines, I see:\n\nLooking for NT18: \nLine 18: NT18 -> NT76 NT91\nWait, but also:\n\nLine: NT18 -> NT20 NT17 (the line is \"NT18 -> NT20 NT17\")\nWait, wait, let me reread. The provided grammar is a list, each line starts with NT followed by digits.\n\nScanning through all the NT productions:\n\nLooking for NT18: I see\n- NT18 -> NT76 NT91 (line: \"NT18 -> NT76 NT91\")\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT17 (line: \"NT18 -> NT20 NT17\")\nWait, but that would mean NT18 can produce two possible two-symbol strings of non-terminals, which don't directly produce terminals. But in the given grammar, for example, NT70 is \"NT70 -> t82\" as per line: NT70 -> t82.\n\nWait, let's check all the NT productions to see if any have a terminal as the RHS.\n\nLooking through all the productions, many have two non-terminals on the RHS, but some have terminator-like strings. For example, NT70 -> t82, which is a terminal followed by a number. Similarly, other NT productions end with terminals and numbers. So, for example, NT12 -> t85 (from line NT12 -> 't85' in the provided list).\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT production rules can have a mix of terminal and non-terminal symbols on the RHS? Or are all RHSs strictly non-terminals? Because in CNF, RHSs should be non-terminals, but perhaps the given grammar is a mix, which might complicate things.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, the first line is S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which is two non-terminals. Then NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47, again two non-terminals. Then later, for example, NT70 \u2192 t82. So that's a mixture, meaning this grammar isn't properly in CNF because CNF requires RHSs to have two non-terminals, but some have terminals. So perhaps the grammar is ambiguous or incorrectly formatted. But maybe that's intentional, and the grammar allows for a mix.\n\nHmm, this might make the problem a bit trickier. Because if a production has a terminal on the RHS, then that's a leaf in the parse tree, which means the parser can consume that terminal early. So to process the given string, I might need to consider the rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's find all the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t82\n- NT12 \u2192 t85\n- NT91 \u2192 t93\n- NT93 \u2192 t9 (from line: NT93 -> t80)\nWait, no, let me check line by line.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have multiple entries, each line is something like NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47 or NT70 -> t82.\n\nSo, for example, looking through all lines:\n\nNT70 -> t82 (from line: NT70 -> t82)\nNT12 -> t85 (line: NT12 -> 't85')\nNT91 -> t93 (line: NT91 -> t93)\nWait, no, looking at the lines:\n\nFrom the provided grammar, the line for NT91 is \"NT91 -> t93\", but I think it's actually written as NT91 -> t93). Similarly:\n\nAlso, looking at NT92: NT92 -> t56 and NT92 -> t93 (I might be confusing, need to check each line accurately.)\n\nWait, perhaps better to make a list of NT productions that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the entire provided grammar:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-695","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can be a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It has several productions starting with NT and S. For example, S is the start symbol and can produce NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, and others. Then there are a bunch of productions for NT with two non-terminals on the right side. The rest of the productions seem to break down these NTs until eventually, some of them resolve to terminals like 't74', 't28', etc. \n\nThen, looking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of terminals, all lowercase letters with numbers. My job is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nI'll start by writing out the string:\n\nt72 t0 t18 t87 t72 t72 t5 t43 t45 t56 t73 t88 t18 t46 t98 t9 t46 t0 t46 t85 t91 t18 t91 t56 t6 t71 t43 t14 t22 t38 t71 t17 t22 t70 t7 t1 t92.\n\nI notice that the string is quite long, with each 't' followed by a number. My goal is to see if there's a way to parse this string according to the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll check if every symbol in the string is present in the grammar as either a terminal or non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the 't's with numbers like t72, t0, etc., are terminals, so they don't need to be broken down further, but each must correspond to a production rule in the grammar.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the grammar, I see that some NTs produce a terminal. For example, NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and then NT92 -> t56. So, 't56' is produced by NT92. Similarly, NT92 appears in some productions, like NT57 -> NT19 NT99, which then leads further down to t18 or other combinations.\n\nSo, the strategy is to see if the string can be derived by starting from S and applying a series of productions to expand it into the given string.\n\nSince the string is long, it's helpful to build a parse tree from the bottom up or top down. But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to see if the terminal sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if every symbol in the string can be matched to a production. Since the grammar is CNF, every production is two non-terminals, except for the start symbol S. But S is followed by two NTs.\n\nWait, in the string, each 't' is a terminal. So, each 't' must correspond to a production that ends in that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I might want to see if each 't' in the string is a terminal that can be produced by some NT.\n\nLet's list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt72, t0, t18, t87, t72, t72, t5, t43, t45, t56, t73, t88, t18, t46, t98, t9, t46, t0, t46, t85, t91, t18, t91, t56, t6, t71, t43, t14, t22, t38, t71, t17, t22, t70, t7, t1, t92.\n\nNow, I'll check if each of these terminals appears in the grammar on the right-hand side of any production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here's a list of terminals I see:\n\nFrom the production rules, some NTs lead to specific terminals. For example:\n- NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and NT92 might produce t56. Wait, let me check if any NT produces to these t's.\n\nWait, the grammar doesn't have all possible t's, so maybe some of these t's are not produced by any NT, making the string invalid.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT92 -> t56, and NT57 -> NT72 and NT19, but NT19's production chain needs to be checked.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to see if the string can be generated at all. If any of the t's in the string can't be derived from any NT, then the string isn't in the language.\n\nSo, let me go through each 't' in the string and see if it's present in the grammar as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see the following NTs that produce terminals:\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85, but NT92 -> t56 (from some other production), and NT85 -> t26 (from NT66 -> NT55 NT13, which isn't a terminal, but looking deeper, perhaps NT66 leads to t26. Let me check: NT26 -> NT65 NT50, but then NT50 -> ... Hmm, this might not be the right path.\n\nWait, let me check each terminal in the string:\n\n1. t72: I look through the grammar and see if any NT directly leads to t72. From the production NT92 -> t56, so maybe NT92 can produce t56. But t72 comes from NT72 somewhere? Wait, looking at the rules, there's NT18 -> 't76' and 't91', wait:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, there are rules that have 't's on the right-hand side:\n\nFor example:\n- NT9 -> 't74' (from the rule NT9 -> 't74' NT73)\n- NT70 -> 't82' (from NT70 -> 't82' NT7)\n- NT69 -> 't93' (from NT12 -> 't16'?) Wait, the grammar in the prompt is a bit messy; perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the possible 't's that the grammar can produce.\n\nLooking through each production in the grammar, some NTs have terminals on the right-hand side:\n\n- NT77 -> NT92 NT85 (and NT92 may produce t56)\n- NT26 -> NT65 NT50 (but if any NT in their productions produce a t)\n- NT57 -> NT72 NT19 (and NT72 may produce t72)\n- NT66 -> NT55 NT13 (but NT13 -> t31? Wait, no, in the NT productions, I don't see t31)\nWait, perhaps I need to build a tree for each t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to start from the given string and see if we can apply reverse of the grammar.\n\nEach production in CNF either breaks down two non-terminals into two other symbols. So for a terminal in the string, it must match the terminal in some production's RHS.\n\nFor example, if we have a string that includes 't72', maybe 't72' is produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT55 -> NT47 NT61\n- NT47 -> NT55 NT61\nWait, this is circular, but I'm looking for 't72' itself.\n\nLooking for 't72' in the production rules, I see that NT92 -> t56, as per the production NT92 -> t56. So t56 is produced by NT92.\n\nWait, but where does 't72' come from? Let me try to trace. The production NT77 -> NT92 NT85, so if NT92 is t56 and NT85 is t26 (from NT66), then NT77 would produce t56 t26. But I need to see if t72 is produced by any NT.\n\nAlternatively, looking through the production rules, I see NT77 -> NT92 NT85, but NT77 itself isn't a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules again, perhaps I'm missing the point. Maybe 't72' comes from NT92. Let's see: if any production for NT92 leads to t72, then 't72' is produced. But from the given grammar, I only see NT92 -> t56, not t72.\n\nWait, then 't72' must come from another NT, perhaps NT72. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that starts with NT72. The rules start with NT77, NT57, etc. So perhaps 't72' is not present in the grammar as a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the initial productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. But wait, in the string, it starts with t93. Hmm, but the grammar doesn't have 't' as the terminal except for specific NTs like NT7 \u2192 t74, and others like NT70 \u2192 t70, etc.\n\nWait, the NTs resolve to 't...' so each NT production results in a terminal symbol. So, for instance, NT74 produces t73, because looking at the rules, NT73 -> 't6'? Wait no, wait the NTs are the non-terminals. Each rule for NTs leads to a terminal.\n\nLet me look at the production rules. For example, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. Then NT39 is further broken down, and so on, until it resolves to a terminal.\n\nGiven that, each NT in the string must produce a terminal. So the entire string is a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to an NT.\n\nSo the string is: t93 t16 t8 t29 t74 t18 t70 t22 t74 t71 t7 t92 t19 t74 t20 t17 t73 t88 t18 t19 t38 t92 t92 t71 t91 t1 t52 t92 t73 t14 t11 t88 t59 t98 t11 t0 t98 t9.\n\nThat's a long string. The problem is to see if this string can be derived by the grammar starting from S.\n\nGiven the structure of the grammar, it's a binary tree structure, with each non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals until leaves which are terminals.\n\nThe initial productions are S \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, S \u2192 NT40 NT92.\n\nSo the string must be the result of expanding one of these into terminals, or through intermediate non-terminals.\n\nBut since the string is a sequence of terminals, we need to find if each production can lead to that sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into the parts corresponding to the initial S productions.\n\nLet me think: the initial string starts with t93. So, where does t93 come from?\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's find which NT rule produces t93.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT70 \u2192 t70, NT98 \u2192 t18, NT93 \u2192 t80? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, each NT has a production to a terminal. So, for example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t74, NT70 \u2192 t70, NT73 \u2192 t6, etc.\n\nWait, more specifically, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT93 \u2192 't80', because one of the rules is NT93 -> 't91'? Wait, no, let me check the provided grammar.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT93 appears in this rule: NT93 -> 't80'\n\nSo NT93 produces 't80'.\n\nSimilarly, NT12 \u2192 't1', NT9 -> 't5', etc.\n\nSo, the string starts with t93. So t93 is from NT93.\n\nSo the first step would be to see if the overall structure can be built from the initial S.\n\nBut given the length of the string, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps we can work backwards, trying to parse the string.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces two terminals, except for the initial steps which might produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, the grammar is in CNF, which allows each rule to expand into two non-terminals. So the initial S is non-terminal and can split into NT74 NT44, each of which can further split into other NTs until terminals are reached.\n\nGiven that, each split in the parse tree would generate two non-terminals on each level until we reach terminals.\n\nBut the string has 40 symbols, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be broken down into the structure allowed by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the initial S productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n   So, this would produce two sequences, each starting with NT74 and NT44.\n\nSo, the entire string must be a concatenation of the two sequences from NT74 and NT44.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with a part that comes from NT74 and another part from NT44.\n\nAlternatively, S can split into other initial productions.\n\nBut the first symbol is t93, which is from NT93, and the first production is from S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which would start with two NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT74 NT44, so the first step in the derivation from S is to produce the two NTs NT74 and NT44, each of which can then produce sequences ending in terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the entire string is a single sequence of terminals, so S must derive into just one terminal string. Since S \u2192 NT74 NT44, that would produce two sequences, but the entire string is a single sequence, so that can't be. So perhaps the other production for S should be considered.\n\nWait, the string starts with t93. Let me check if this production can be traced in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for the possible sequences starting from S, which would be either NT74 followed by NT44, NT11 followed by NT24, or NT40 followed by NT92.\n\nEach of these produces two non-terminals, which then must derive into the rest of the string.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string can be split into two parts, each part generated by one of NT74 or NT44, or other S productions.\n\nBut 40 symbols is a lot. Let me check the grammar to see if any of the NTs can produce sequences that would start with t93.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t93, so perhaps t93 is produced by some NT.

{"custom_id":"request-721","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have a programming problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. It's given in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and the right side, except for the starting symbol S, which has two non-terminals. The grammar starts with S and the rules seem to connect NT nodes, which eventually lead to terminals like 'tX' where X is a number.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, S can produce three different pairs of NT's. From there, the NT rules connect other NTs, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nNow, the provided string is:\nt16 t7 t31 t16 t70 t0 t45 t70 t31 t55 t8 t52 t11 t80 t1 t31 t72 t88 t52 t93 t17 t43 t20 t0 t38 t98 t82 t72 t0 t73 t45 t20 t93 t18 t72 t16 t7 t72.\n\nI notice the string is 42 tokens long, all being 't' followed by numbers. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nIn CNF, the way to derive strings is by breaking down the starting symbol S into non-terminals, then each non-terminal into other non-terminals until we reach terminals, which are the 't's here.\n\nEach production is binary, so each step increases the length of the string by one. Starting from S, each step after that will have one more symbol. Since S is at step 0, the maximum possible length after n steps is 2^n. But I have 42 symbols, which would imply n=6 steps because 2^6=64. But maybe the string isn't fully expanded yet, as not all S's might be expanded.\n\nBut 42 is within 64, so it's possible. Alternatively, it's possible the string is shorter than this because some non-terminals might be expanded multiple times before the end.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that approach. Maybe I should look for a way to parse the string using the grammar. Alternatively, I can simulate the parsing by checking whether each 't' can be matched by a terminal production.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, each NT eventually must expand into some 't' symbols. So, each 't' corresponds to a terminal in some production of an NT.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reconstruct the parse tree from the string and see if it's valid.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can look for patterns or use memoization. Alternatively, since the grammar is a tree, I can represent each possible step.\n\nAnother idea is to reverse the process: instead of expanding S, try to reduce the string back to S using reverse productions. Each 't' must match a terminal in some production of an NT. So, each 't' in the string must correspond to a terminal that is the result of some NT production.\n\nSo, first, I need to check what NTs produce each 't' token. Let's list each 'tX' and find the corresponding NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the NTs produce 't' terminals in the productions. For example:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and looking for NT77's production that has a terminal that matches. Wait, actually, the rules provided for NT77, NT57, etc., go down until they end with a 't' and a number.\n\nWait, for example, the rule NT77 -> NT92 NT85, but I don't see it ending with a terminal yet. Let me look for the rules where an NT directly produces a 't'.\n\nLooking carefully, for example:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'? Hmm, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25\nAnd so on. It continues until it gets to a rule where an NT directly ends with a 't', like:\n\nLooking for 't' in the productions. For example, in the rules:\n\nI see NT77 -> NT92 NT85, NT92 -> 't6', NT52 -> 't26', etc.\n\nWait, some NTs directly produce a 't' with a number. For example:\n\nLooking for lines where an NT is on the left and ends with -> 'tX'. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'? No. Let me check all the production rules.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, some lines are like:\n\nNT70 -> NT64 NT90\nNT64 -> NT65 NT13\n...\nNT9 -> 't46'\nWait, I'm looking for any production rule where NTx -> 'tY'. Let's find those:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT70 -> 't82' (line: NT70 -> NT12 NT90, and NT12 -> 't16' etc., wait no.)\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm missing. Wait, let's go line by line:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74' (no, that's not a terminal; 't' followed by number. Wait, no, in the provided rules, 't6' is present.)\n\nWait, no. Let me scan the rules:\n\nLooking for rules like NT... -> 'tX'. For example:\n\n- Line: NT92 -> 't56'\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT88 -> 't55'\n- NT33 -> 't8'\n- NT11 -> 't87'\n- NT56 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT57 -> 't18'\n- NT49 -> 't73'\n- NT18 -> 't14'\n- NT52 -> 't26'\n- NT39 -> 't9'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT17 -> 't73'\n- NT74 -> 't56'\n- etc.\n\nWait, let me go through each possible NT:\n\n- NT77 -> NT92 NT85 \u2192 No terminals yet.\n- NT97 -> 't43'? No.\n- NT28 -> NT26 \u2192 No.\n- Wait, actually, looking for any NT rule that directly produces a terminal.\n\nHmm, perhaps none of the NTs directly produce a terminal except the ones that eventually go down to 't's. For example, NT73 -> 't6' directly. Similarly, other NTs end up via multiple steps into 'tX's.\n\nSo, each 'tX' must be the result of a derivation from a terminal NT.\n\nTherefore, each 'tX' corresponds to a path from the starting symbol through multiple non-terminals down to the NT that produces 'tX'.\n\nSo, to process the string, each 'tX' must match one of the terminals allowed by some NT. But since the grammar is in CNF, each NT is exactly leading to two other NTs, and so on.\n\nBut this approach is complicated. Maybe a better way is to use the fact that the grammar is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and model the possible derivations.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, maybe I can look for a logical approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trace the string step by step, breaking it down from the end.\n\nFor example, the last token is 't72'. Let's see which NTs produce 't72'. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT73 -> 't6' \u2192 Not relevant.\n- NT72: Do any NTs produce 't72'?\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT76 -> NT2 NT68\n- NT76 ultimately ends at ... I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't72'.\nWait, looking through all the rules, I don't immediately see an NT that produces 't72'. Hmm, did I miss it?\n\nWait, perhaps I'll list all NTs that directly produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, the ones that end with 't' are:\n\n- NT77 -> ... \u2192 No 't'.\n- NT73 -> 't6' (Yes)\n- NT92 -> NT50 NT40 \u2192 Wait, no, that's production NT50 -> 't59'.\nWait, let me re-examine the rules:\n\nList of rules leading to terminals:\n\n- NT73 -> 't6' (Yes)\n- NT38 -> 't95' \u2192 Wait, no, NT38 has a rule \u2192 NT13 NT98, etc.\nWait, maybe some other NTs:\n\n- NT74 -> 't54'?

{"custom_id":"request-741","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I'll take a closer look at the grammar. It's presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, and it has several productions:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with one of the pairs NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. Each of these leads to a chain of productions until we reach terminals.\n\nNext, I'll examine the string provided:\nt72 t31 t93 t76 t17 t72 t76 t22 t38 t8 t31 t9 t91 t76 t1 t74 t72 t88 t72 t46 t93 t38 t72 t45 t92 t18 t88 t55 t55 t8 t38 t9 t1 t43 t72 t19 t26 t59 t19\n\nEach of these is a terminal symbol, mostly numbers except for 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, the only terminals are the 't' strings like t72, t31, t93, etc. So the first step is to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar productions, every production either goes to a terminal or another non-terminal pair. For example, NT74 can produce t74, NT77 can go to NT92 NT85, which eventually leads to t92 or t85, etc.\n\nI'll try to build the string step by step. Starting from S, let's pick the first production that matches the first part of the string. The string starts with t72, so I need to find which NT production leads to t72.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT72 is not directly a production, but checking each NT:\n\nLooking at the top-level productions, S can go to NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. The string starts with t72, so let's see which of these can lead to t72.\n\nLooking at NT74 \u2192 t74, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT76 \u2192 t76, which is also a terminal. Wait, but our string starts with t72, which isn't directly a terminal for NT74 or NT76. So perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT74 NT44. \n\nWait, NT74 can produce t74, and NT44 can produce which terminal? Looking at the grammar, NT44 is one of the non-terminals. What does NT44 produce? Checking the grammar: I don't see NT44 in the productions listed. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80, and so on. It seems like NT44 isn't listed, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, the user-provided grammar seems a bit extensive, but let me check if NT44 is a terminal or a non-terminal. From the list, NT44 isn't listed as a production leading to a terminal. Instead, it's a non-terminal because other productions mention it, like S \u2192 NT40 NT92 (I think the user might have listed S as being NT40 multiple times). Wait, no, looking back, I see S has several productions, including NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80, so NT40 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is flawed. Let me instead check which NTs can produce t72. Looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT72 in any production. Wait, in the top-level productions, S can produce NT74 NT44, which may produce t74, but that doesn't help with t72. Alternatively, perhaps NT74 leads to other non-terminals, which in turn lead to t72.\n\nFor example, NT74 \u2192 t74 (from the production NT74 \u2192 t74). But in the string, the first is t72, not t74. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see which NTs produce t72. Scanning through the productions, I notice that NT92 \u2192 t92, and other NTs, but I'm not seeing t72 directly.

{"custom_id":"request-736","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That might help because it simplifies parsing a bit, but since I'm trying to generate the string, I need to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t20 t45 t5 t80 t45 t45 t1 t45 t8 t87 t17 t88 t11 t71 t26 t16 t98 t29 t80 t71 t16 t74 t26 t0 t38 t17 t85 t55 t0 t38 t9 t7 t59 t70 t73 t70 t82 t56`.\n\nWait, I notice that a lot of the string consists of 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, many non-terminals expand into these terminals. For example, NT49 -> NT0 NT47, and then NT0 -> NT77 NT34, and so on until it resolves to a 't' symbol.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so each step of derivation will replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals until we reach the terminals, which are the 't' symbols.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string backwards, starting from the end, using a method like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm not familiar with that, maybe I can construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me look at the string structure:\n\nThe string starts with t0 and ends with t56. The middle part has various 't's with numbers attached. \n\nStarting from the beginning: t0. Looking at the grammar, NT0 expands into NT77 NT34. Then NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and NT92 is t52, NT85 is t61. Wait, but the string has t0 coming directly after the first S. Let me check.\n\nWait, the S starts with S \u2192 NT49 NT74 or S \u2192 NT11 NT24, etc. Let's check each production of S.\n\nS can be:\n- NT49 NT74\n- NT11 NT24\n- NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the string starts with t0, which is likely from NT0. Let's see how NT0 is derived. From the grammar:\nNT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\nNT92 \u2192 t52 (from production NT92 -> t52)\nNT85 \u2192 t61\nWait, but in the string, the first part is t0, which would come from NT0 \u2192 t77 t85, which then both resolve to 't' symbols. So t0 t20... Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider building the parse tree from the top. Starting with S \u2192 NT49 NT74, which then would need to derive the entire string. Let me see if the first two tokens can be matched by NT49 and NT74.\n\nLooking at NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47. So, t0 and then t47. But the first token is t0, then the next part of the string is t20 t45 t5... Let me see, after t0, the next is t20, but NT47 produces 't' symbols as well. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try matching the entire string step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to convert the grammar into a parse table, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, let's see if the string can be split into the right components.\n\nLooking at the string, it has a lot of 't's. Each 't' is a terminal symbol. Each terminal in the grammar is directly derived, so the number of 't's should correspond to the number of production steps.\n\nWait, the string has 41 't's. Let's count: each production of S gives two non-terminals, and each of those could produce more, so the total number of 't's (terminals) must be equal to the number of symbols in the derivation, minus 2 (since each production adds one symbol, starting from S which is a single symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the number of symbols. Let me count the tokens in the string:\n\nt0 t20 t45 t5 t80 t45 t45 t1 t45 t8 t87 t17 t88 t11 t71 t26 t16 t98 t29 t80 t71 t16 t74 t26 t0 t38 t17 t85 t55 t0 t38 t9 t7 t59 t70 t73 t70 t82 t56.\n\nLet's count these:\n\n1. t0\n2. t20\n3. t45\n4. t5\n5. t80\n6. t45\n7. t45\n8. t1\n9. t45\n10. t8\n11. t87\n12. t17\n13. t88\n14. t11\n15. t71\n16. t26\n17. t16\n18. t98\n19. t29\n20. t80\n21. t71\n22. t16\n23. t74\n24. t26\n25. t0\n26. t38\n27. t17\n28. t85\n29. t55\n30. t0\n31. t38\n32. t9\n33. t7\n34. t59\n35. t70\n36. t73\n37. t70\n38. t82\n39. t56\n\nSo, 39 tokens. The number of symbols must be a power of 2? Let's see: 39 is not a power of 2. Hmm, that's a problem. Because each production step increases the number of symbols by 1. Starting from 1 (S), each step adds 1. So the total number of symbols after n steps is 1 + n. So the number of symbols in the string (39) would imply 39 = 1 + n, so n=38. 38 is not a power of 2-1. So it can't be derived in the grammar, because the length of the string must be 2^k, where k is the number of productions.\n\nWait, wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Each application of a production rule takes one symbol and replaces it with two, increasing the number by one. So starting from 1 (S), after each step, the number of symbols increases by 1. So the total number of symbols after m steps is 1 + m.\n\nBut in a context-free grammar, each string's length must be 2^k, I thought, because each step adds one non-terminal, leading to a binary expansion. Wait, no. The grammar can produce strings of varying lengths, not necessarily powers of two. Because the process isn't necessarily a perfectly balanced tree. For example, a leftmost derivation could produce a string of 3 tokens if S \u2192 A B, and A \u2192 a, B \u2192 b. Or 3 steps: S (1) \u2192 AB (2) \u2192 aB (3) \u2192 ab (4). Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the number of non-terminals plus the number of terminals equals the length of the string. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals. So, the number of symbols in a derivation is 2 + k, where k is the number of productions. Wait, no. Let me think: starting from S, which is one symbol. After one production (m=1), you have two symbols. After another (m=2), you could have three, but that's not possible because each production replaces one non-terminal with two, so it adds one. Wait, wait: starting with 1 symbol (S). After first production: 2 (two non-terminals). Then each new production takes one non-terminal and replaces it with two, so the total increases by 1 each time. So after m productions, the total symbols is 1 + m.\n\nWait, that would mean the string's length is 1 + m, which is 39 here, so m=38. So that's acceptable because the grammar can handle any such length. So the length isn't a problem. So perhaps it can be generated.\n\nBut let's check for other possible conflicts.

{"custom_id":"request-762","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if this string is generated by the given CFG. Let me start by looking at the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. Every production starts with a non-terminal (like S, NT49, etc.). The start symbol is S.\n\nGiven the string: `t17 t46 t1 t0 t14 t7 t1 t52 t55 t70 t7 t56 t52 t17 t70 t14 t26 t1 t31 t72 t31 t71 t17 t22 t20 t72 t55 t85 t7 t17 t93 t17 t45 t22 t71 t43 t22 t0 t87 t7`.\n\nFirst, I notice that it's a sequence of t terms, each with numbers. Each t... is probably a production rule that terminates with that t. For example, in the grammar, NT7 -> 't74', so NT7 is a non-terminal that can produce t74. Similarly, NT12 can produce 't85', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, each part of the string like 't17' corresponds to a production that ends with that t. To verify the string, I need to see if each t... corresponds to a production rule in the grammar, and if combining these productions can form the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, I can process it step by step. Each t... is a production that may require certain non-terminals before them. Let's break down the string into components:\n\nt17, t46, t1, t0, t14, t7, t1, t52, t55, t70, t7, t56, t52, t17, t70, t14, t26, t1, t31, t72, t31, t71, t17, t22, t20, t72, t55, t85, t7, t17, t93, t17, t45, t22, t71, t43, t22, t0, t87, t7.\n\nEach of these is a single t... production. For example, t17 corresponds to the production NT17 -> 't73'. Wait no, looking at the grammar:\n\nFrom the provided grammar rules, I see NT17 -> 't73'. So the string has t73.\n\nSimilarly, t46: looking through the rules, I don't see any NT production that ends with t46. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me scan the list:\n\nLooking for any rule where the production ends with a terminal like t46. Scanning through all the rules:\n\nI don't see any 't46' explicitly. But in the grammar, some rules may be combined. Wait, perhaps a longer production could result in multiple t...s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to parse the string by trying to build it from the top down, starting from S.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can try to check each step of the string against the grammar.\n\nLet's start from the first t17. So the first part is t17, which comes from NT17 -> 't73', but wait, t17 isn't in the results. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for where NT17 produces a terminal. I see:\n\nNT17 -> 't73'\n\nSo 't17' isn't directly a terminal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there's:\n\nNT17 -> 't73'\n\nSo, the production for NT17 is 't73', meaning that when you expand NT17, it becomes t73.

{"custom_id":"request-764","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens, each of which must be produced by the grammar. \n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which has three productions:\n\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the string starts with either NT74 and NT44, NT11 and NT24, or NT40 and NT92. Each of these non-terminals will expand further according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet's break down the string into parts. The string is: \n\nt56 t5 t87 t29 t87 t80 t18 t88 t8 t80 t76 t92 t91 t88 t6 t98 t72 t6 t29 t87 t56 t92 t18 t91 t20 t59 t73 t6 t56 t87 t18 t45 t43 t93 t70 t82 t20 t93 t16 t18.\n\nLet's split it into components based on NT productions:\n\nEach \"txxx\" is likely a terminal output from a non-terminal expansion. For example, NT0 -> t29, so when NT0 is expanded, it produces 't29'.\n\nThe first two symbols are 't56' and 't5'. Looking at the grammar, I need to see which NT productions produce 't5' and 't56'. \n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't56'\n\nSo, the first two non-terminals must be NT5 and NT56. Wait, but according to the grammar, the start symbol S's first production is NT74 NT44, which starts with NT74 and NT44, not NT5 and NT56. So, this doesn't fit the first production. Alternatively, maybe the NTs are split differently.\n\nWait, let's think again. The string starts with t56, which comes from NT56 -> t56, but the grammar's first S production is NT74 NT44, which would start with NT74. So, unless there's another way, maybe NT74 produces t56 somehow, but looking at the grammar, NT74 is a non-terminal that can be expanded into NT39 NT99, which then can be further expanded. Let's see if NT74 can ever produce t56.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only 't's are in rules where specific NTs produce them. For example, NT40 -> t71 may be incorrect, but looking further, I see NT40 -> NT16 NT80. Hmm, perhaps I need to see if any of the NTs can eventually produce 't56'.\n\nLooking at NT74: NT74 -> NT39 NT99.\n\nNT39: NT39 -> NT8 NT25.\n\nNT8 is a terminal in the grammar: NT8 -> 't7'.\n\nSo, NT39 -> t7 NT25.\n\nNT25: NT25 -> NT28 NT7. NT7 -> 't49'? Wait, no, let's check the rules. I think I misread earlier. Wait, looking back, NT7 -> 't49' as per the rules:\n\nNT7 -> 't49'\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, I have to check each rule. Let me list some key rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT33 -> 't8'\n\nNT35 -> 't91'\n\nNT34 -> 't56'\n\nWait, looking at NT34: NT34 -> NT56 NT93.\n\nAnd NT56: NT56 -> 't56'.\n\nSo, NT34 can produce t56. How can that be connected to the start symbol?\n\nBut S's initial productions are NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, NT40 NT92.\n\nSo, for the string to start with 't56', perhaps the first two NTs after expansion are NT34 and NT93, which would produce 't56' and 't6'. But that would mean the string starts with t56 tsomething, but in the string, the first two are t56 t5. Wait, no, the string starts with t56 t5, so that would mean the first two are NT34 -> t56 and NT something else that produces 't5'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NT produces 't5'? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't5' (Yes, according to the grammar rules: NT9 -> 't5').\n- NT5 -> 't5' as well?\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I can see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't5' (Yes, line: NT9 -> 't5')\n- NT5 -> 't5' as well.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me check:\n\nThe rules provided are:\n\nNT9 -> 't5'\nNT5 -> 't5'\n\nSo, NT9 and NT5 both produce 't5'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first two symbols are t56 t5. So, the first NT is t56, which comes from NT34 -> t56. So, the first NT is NT34. Now, the second symbol is 't5', which could be from NT9 or NT5.\n\nBut S isn't directly producing NT34. S's first three productions are NT74, NT44; NT11, NT24; and NT40, NT92.\n\nSo, unless one of those NTs can produce the sequence t56 and t5, that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string needs to be broken down into a series of NT productions leading to the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first NT is NT74, which expands to NT39 NT99.\n\nNT39: NT39 -> NT8 NT25.\n\nNT8: NT8 -> 't7'.\n\nNT25: NT25 -> NT28 NT7. NT7 -> 't49'.\n\nSo, NT25 -> 't49' and NT7 comes from 't49' which is production NT7 -> 't49'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT7 is a non-terminal with rule: NT7 -> 't49'. Similarly, NT99 is another NT that can be expanded.\n\nWait, let's see, maybe I'm getting lost. Maybe it's better to approach this as a parsing problem, trying to split the string into a sequence that fits the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm, but given the complexity, it might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be generated step by step from S.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string token by token.\n\nThe string is: t56 t5 t87 t29 t87 t80 t18 t88 t8 t80 t76 t92 t91 t88 t6 t98 t72 t6 t29 t87 t56 t92 t18 t91 t20 t59 t73 t6 t56 t87 t18 t45 t43 t93 t70 t82 t20 t93 t16 t18.\n\nLet me see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, S must expand into two NTs. Let's assume the first production is S -> NT74 NT44.\n\nThen we need to see if NT74 and NT44 can produce the string.\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99.\n\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25.\n\nNT8 -> 't7'.\n\nNT25 -> NT28 NT7. NT7 -> 't49'.\n\nSo, NT39 would produce 't7' and 't49' as terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT99 must produce some terminals.\n\nLooking at NT99: NT99 -> NT51 NT66.\n\nNT51 -> NT19 NT18.\n\nLet's see:\n\nNT51 -> NT19 NT18.\n\nNT19 -> NT17 NT57.\n\nNT17 -> NT22? Wait, NT17: NT17 -> 't71'.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nNT17: NT17 -> 't71'.\n\nSimilarly, NT57: NT57 -> 't55' and 't61' perhaps?

{"custom_id":"request-777","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string. My task is to determine whether the string can be generated by the given grammar. \n\nFirst, let me parse the grammar to understand its structure. CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is important because it allows for efficient parsing and can be handled by algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that many non-terminals on the left-hand side (LHS) of the productions lead to other non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS). For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which means S is replaced by the concatenation of NT74 and NT44. Similarly, NT49 is replaced by two other non-terminals, and so on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t72 t73 t14 t22 t7 t0 t18 t93 t92 t52 t93 t31 t93 t52 t52 t18 t19 t9 t46 t71 t26 t92 t16 t74 t85 t8 t22 t7 t91 t20 t80 t91 t7 t88 t11 t7 t45 t16 t43 t55 t92.\n\nMy goal is to see if each token in this string can be derived from the grammar's non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each string should be derived through a series of productions where each production reduces the number of non-terminals step by step.\n\nI'll start by identifying which non-terminals have productions that correspond to the terminals in the string. Let's look through the grammar to find non-terminals that produce specific terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, on the LHS, I see NT72, which seems to produce 't72' because one of the rules is NT72 \u2192 't72'. Similarly, NT73 \u2192 't73', which appears in the string. Then, t14 is in the string, and I check if there's a non-terminal producing it. Yes, NT91 \u2192 't14'. Next, t22, and looking at the grammar, NT73 also has a production for 't73', but in this case, we have 't22' which I believe is from NT73 because in the grammar, NT73 is 't73', but wait, let me check again. Alternatively, looking at the grammar, is there a non-terminal that produces t14? Yes, NT91 \u2192 t14. So t14 comes from NT91.\n\nSo far, the start symbol S must derive into sequences of these non-terminals that eventually produce the string. Each step must correspond to the productions.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the beginning. Let's check if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t72. Since NT72 directly produces t72, that part is okay. Next is t73. NT73 \u2192 t73, so that part is okay. So the first part S \u2192 NT74 NT44 probably isn't involved here because NT74 would produce parts like t53, t71, etc. Wait, actually, looking back at the grammar: S can produce NT74 NT44. Let me check what NT74 and NT44 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT74 \u2192 NT99 NT99 (Wait, no, looking again, it's written as NT74 -> NT39 NT99)\nWait, no, looking through the grammar, I have:\n\nLooking line by line, each production is like NTxxx -> NT... So let me list them properly.\n\nLooking through each NT production:\n\nNT72 \u2192 't72'\nNT73 \u2192 't73'\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\nNT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\nNT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's t72 t73 t14 t22... So t72 and t73 are the first two tokens. Since S \u2192 NT74 NT44, but the first two tokens are from S, then perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which would generate parts of the string.\n\nBut Wait, no. Actually, in the string, the tokens start with t72, t73, etc., which are terminals. So the approach is to see if the entire string can be generated through a series of productions starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can treat each token as being generated by a non-terminal, and I can move upwards from the string to see if the entire structure is derivable.\n\nBut perhaps a better method is to see if each token in the string is covered by the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, each terminal in the string must be directly derived from a non-terminal that has a production to that terminal.\n\nSo first, let's list the terminals in the string:\n\nt72, t73, t14, t22, t7, t0, t18, t93, t92, t52, t93, t31, t93, t52, t52, t18, t19, t9, t46, t71, t26, t92, t16, t74, t85, t8, t22, t7, t91, t20, t80, t91, t7, t88, t11, t7, t45, t16, t43, t55, t92.\n\nNow, I'll go through each terminal and see if it is the direct produce of any non-terminal.\n\nCheck each one:\n\n1. t72: NT72 \u2192 t72. So that's covered by NT72.\n\n2. t73: NT73 \u2192 t73.\n\n3. t14: NT91 \u2192 t14.\n\n4. t22: From the grammar, I can check NT91 \u2192 t14, which is accounted for, but t22 isn't directly produced. Wait, is there a NT73 (since NT73 \u2192 t73), but that's another one. Alternatively, is there another non-terminal that produces t22?\n\nLooking through the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't22'? Looking through each rule, I don't see any NT followed by 't22'. All the rules that result in 't' tokens are for NT72, NT73, NT91, NT92, etc. So 't22' isn't directly produced by any of the non-terminals. That's a problem.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. If the string contains t22, which isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, then the entire string can't be generated. So that would mean the answer is No.\n\nWait, let me double-check if I missed any NT production that produces t22. Let me go through each NT production.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NTxxx \u2192 't22'?\n\nLooking through each production line, I see a few NT92's, but they produce other non-terminals. NT92 is mentioned as producing 't52' among others. But 't22' isn't in any NT production. Hmm. So that's a problem.\n\nSo if 't22' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal, the string can't be derived from the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but let's make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the NT production leads to 't22' via a chain of productions, but in CNF, each production is only two non-terminals. Wait, no. CNF requires each production to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. So in two steps, you could get more symbols, but in this case, since the string contains 't22', which isn't directly produced, the string can't be generated.\n\nI think I've made a mistake in my initial analysis. Let me check all the NT productions to see if any produce 't22'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\nNT72 \u2192 t72\n\nNT73 \u2192 t73\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT93 NT70\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT64 NT90\n\nWait, no,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-781","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine whether the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form looks like. It has rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT73, etc.) expands into exactly two non-terminals. Terminals are the leaf nodes, which in this case are the 't' followed by numbers. The string ends with many 't' terms, some with numbers. So, each terminal in the string must be matched by one of the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several rules that directly produce terminals. For example, NT73 -> 't6', NT12 -> 't85', NT17 -> 't73', and so on. Each of these terminals has their own production.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of these terminals. So, the approach is to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules, ensuring that each part of the string corresponds to a production rule.\n\nThe string starts with t73, which corresponds to NT73. That means we can reduce NT73 to t73. Then, the next term is t52. Looking at the grammar, 't52' is produced by NT92. But in our first step, we have NT73 and need to see what it can produce next. Wait, each rule produces two non-terminals.\n\nWait, the initial rule S can produce NT74 and NT94, etc. So, the starting point is S. Since S can go to NT74 and NT44, any string generated must start with two non-terminals. So, the first part of the string must be something that can be derived from the initial S -> NT74 NT44.\n\nBut in the given string, the first two terms are t73 and t52. Hmm, t73 is from NT73, but the initial rule for S gives either NT74 or NT40, etc. So, unless there's a production for NT74 leading to T73 and another term, which I don't see directly, maybe this isn't possible.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar rules. Is there any rule where NT74 is on the left? Looking back, yes: NT74-> NT99 NT99 and some other rules. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT74 -> NT39 NT99. Wait, that's not directly a terminal. So, maybe the initial steps would involve replacing S with NT74 and NT44, each of which would then expand further.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Perhaps it's easier to use a parsing strategy. Let me list all the possible ways to break down the string into non-terminals and terminals.\n\nEach terminal in the string corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar. So, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, and each NT is a non-terminal.\n\nSo, the string has the following sequence of terminals: t73, t52, t46, t93, t92, t87, t55, t29, t80, t52, t74, t72, t14, t31, t5, t11, t0, t71, t26, t18, t52, t5, t88, t87, t38, t1, t85, t52, t17, t59, t88, t70, t16, t93, t80, t59, t29, t93, t52, t29, t71.\n\nThat's 39 terms. Hmm, that's quite long. Let me see how that can come from the initial rule S -> NT74 NT44.\n\nStarting with S: NT74 and NT44. Each of these would need to be expanded into sequences of terminals.\n\nSo, the string must be a concatenation of expansions of NT74 and NT44.\n\nNow, let's look at the first part: t73. That's from NT73. But in the initial rule, S is NT74 and NT44. So, how can we get t73 from NT74?\n\nLooking at the grammar: NT74 has a production NT39 NT99. So, NT74 cannot directly produce t73. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each NT to see if they can produce t's.\n\nLooking at all the NTs:\n\nNT73: 1 production \u2192 t6 (terminal)\nNT12 \u2192 t85\nNT77 \u2192 ... Wait, most of the Nts only produce other Nts, except for a few like NT73 and NT12 which produce terminals.\n\nSo, to get a t6, for example, we would use NT73.\n\nBut in the initial rule, S produces NT74 and NT44. So, unless some of these Nts produce t terms, it's impossible for the string to start with t73.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT44 has several productions. For example, NT44 can produce NT25 NT40, but those are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if the entire string can be broken down into a series of these Nts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows the entire string to be broken down into a series of these Nts, each of which can produce a chain of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is such that the length is even, but the first two terminals can't be obtained from any of the rules.\n\nWait, the string starts with t73 and t52. So, t73 is NT73, which is produced by NT73\u2192t6. But how do I get from S to NT73. Since S\u2192NT74 and NT44, and NT74 doesn't produce t73, that seems impossible. Therefore, the first step would be to note that the initial expansion from S can't produce t73 and t52 because NT74 can't produce t73. So, the string can't start with t73, meaning the entire string is invalid.\n\nWait, but that's a possible angle. Let me think again.\n\nWait, looking through all the NTs:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t77 (But t77 is a terminal? No, NT77 is a non-terminal. Wait, Nts are all written as NT followed by a number. The terminals are only the 't' followed by numbers, i.e., t73, t52, etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, for example, NT73\u2192 't6', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT12\u2192 't85', a terminal. So, each Nt can be a terminal if their production ends in a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is built by a series of Nts where each Nt is a terminal.\n\nIn that case, each Nt in the string must be either a terminal or derived into terminals.\n\nSo, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, each of which corresponds to a valid production from an Nt.\n\nSo, the string could be a series of Nts, each of which can be reduced to a terminal, according to the grammar.\n\nLet me check each terminal in the string:\n\nt73: NT73 can produce t6, not t73. Wait, no: looking back, in the grammar, NT73 is written as:\n\nNT73 -> 't6'. Ah, so that's NT73\u2192 t6. So, how to get t73?\n\nWait, is there any Nt in the grammar that produces t73?\n\nLooking through all the Nts:\n\nNT73 is a terminal, not a non-terminal? No, that can't be. Because in the grammar, the initial rules are S-> NT74 NT44, etc. Then, inside, Nts can be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rules have Nts as non-terminals except when they directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT73 is a non-terminal, but its production is NT73 -> 't6', which is a terminal. So, NT73 is a non-terminal that produces t6.\n\nSimilarly, NT12 \u2192 't85'.\n\nWait, so NT73 can't produce t73. Because NT73's production is \u2192 t6. So, where does t73 come from?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in how the grammar is written. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nFor example, NT73 \u2192 't6' is one rule. So, NT73 can produce t6 only.\n\nSimilarly, NT12 \u2192 't85'.\n\nBut wait, in the string, we have t73. So, where does that come from? Because none of the Nts produce t73 directly.\n\nUnless I'm miscounting the numbers. Wait, maybe it's a typo.

{"custom_id":"request-804","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) is defined by a start symbol and production rules. Here, the grammar starts with S, and all the rules seem to be in CNF because each production is of the form A -> BC, except maybe some are more than two symbols on the right, but no, wait, looking closely, each production only has two symbols on the right-hand side. Wait, actually, some seem to have three, like S -> NT74 NT44, but wait, in the given rules, each production only has two parts, maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, let me check: For example, S -> NT74 NT44, that's two symbols. Similarly, NT77 -> NT92 NT85, two symbols. Okay, so yes, this is CNF.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of tokens ending with 't59 t43 ... etc.' I think each 't' token is a terminal symbol, and the other parts like NT77, etc., are non-terminals. So, to check if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if the derivation of the start symbol S can lead to this string through some sequence of productions.\n\nFirst, looking at the string, the first token is 't59'. So perhaps the start symbol S can produce a part that starts with t59. Looking at the rules, we see that S has three productions:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nNone of these directly produce a terminal. Let me see the non-terminals that can produce t59.\n\nLooking through the rules, I can see several NT productions that result in 't' tokens. For example, NT59 -> t6. Wait, but in the rules, I see NT59 -> t6? Let me check the given rules.\n\nWait, looking through the non-term rules:\n\nNT92 -> t56\nNT0 -> t29\nNT11 -> t87\nNT66 -> t46\nNT51 -> t98\nNT44 -> t56\nNT9 -> t5\nNT13 -> t31\nNT57 -> t18\nNT53 -> t45\nNT92 -> t76\nNT70 -> t82\nNT35 -> t91\nNT0 -> t29\nNT11 -> t87\nNT66 -> t92\n\nWait, I think the part where it says \"NT7 -> t74\" etc., but more importantly, I'm looking for a path where a non-terminal can produce 't59'. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t59.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list all NT productions ending in 't' tokens:\n\n- NT77 -> t93\n- NT55 -> t47? Wait, no, let me see the specific rules:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see:\n\nNT56 -> t92\nNT47 -> t55\nNT51 -> t98\nNT12 -> t1?\nWait, maybe I should list each NT and check if it produces a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT59 appears in NT92 -> t56... no, that's NT92, not NT59. Hmm. Looking through all the NT rules:\n\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\n...\nWait, perhaps I need to look for any NT that directly maps to a 't' token.\n\nWait, for example, in the rules, I see NT20 -> t17, NT12 -> t16, NT50 -> t59? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, under NT50: NT50 -> t59? Let me see, the given rules:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see NT50 -> t59. Yes! Yes, here: NT50 -> t59.\n\nSo, NT50 can produce 't59'. Great. So, the start symbol S may need to have a production that includes NT50 as one of its non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions for S, none directly produce NT50. But perhaps NT50 can be derived from the other S productions.\n\nWait, but how? Because to get to NT50, the S production would have to somehow derive into that.\n\nLet me think: S can produce NT74 and NT44. Then, perhaps NT74 or NT44 can produce further non-terminals that eventually lead to NT50. Alternatively, maybe another S production that can reach NT50 via other steps.\n\nWait, but S only has three productions, all starting with NT followed by another NT. So, to get to NT50, one of those NTs in S's production must eventually derive to NT50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for a path from S through some sequence of productions to derive the given string.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t59, I think that perhaps the start S must first produce something that leads to t59. Let's see.\n\nLooking at S's options:\n\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the first step from S is to expand into two non-terminals. Then, each of those must expand further until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol, so the first production would be, for example, S -> NT74 NT44, and then each NT74 and NT44 must be expanded further until we reach the terminals.\n\nWait, but for the first token in the string to be t59, I think that the expansion from S must somehow lead to a production that results in t59. Since none of the immediate productions from S produce a terminal, but perhaps via further expansion, one of the NTs can produce t59.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step is to get to an NT that can produce t59 via production chains.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT50 -> t59. So, to get to NT50.\n\nSo, perhaps S can first produce NT50 and another NT, but looking at S's productions, I don't see any that include NT50. S's first production is NT74 NT44, second NT11 NT24, third NT40 NT92. So, none of these immediately produce 50.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, maybe the first NT in S's production is NT74, and that NT74 is then expanded to something that eventually can reach NT50.\n\nWait, I think I should try to construct the derivation. Let's attempt step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t59. So, somewhere in the derivation, an NT must produce t59. Looking for all NS (non-terminals) that can produce t59. From the rules, only NT50 does that, as NT50 -> t59.\n\nSo, one of the NTs in the intermediate steps must be NT50.\n\nNow, which S production does NT50 appear in?\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS has three options, none of which directly. However, perhaps NT50 appears as a result of expanding one of these. For example, maybe NT74 or NT44 can produce something that includes NT50.\n\nWait, I think I need to see how NT74 and NT44 expand.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT74 can be derived from NT39 and NT99: NT74 -> NT39 NT99.\n\nNT99 is then produced by NT51 and NT66: NT99 -> NT51 NT66.\n\nThen NT51 can be produced by NT19 and NT99: NT51 -> NT19 NT99.\n\nHmm, this seems to be a loop. NT99 -> NT51 NT66, and NT51 -> NT19 NT99, so it's leading to more NTs. Not sure if this path leads to NT50.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT44: NT44 -> NT39 NT98.\n\nThen NT39 can be produced by NT8 and NT25: NT39 -> NT8 NT25.\n\nThen NT8 -> NT7 and NT6: NT8 -> NT7 NT6, but looking at the rules, I don't see that. Wait, what's NT8's production? Looking at the rules, in NT39 -> NT8 NT25, NT8 is produced? Or is NT8 a terminal?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT8 seems to be a terminal in some rules. Wait, no, the rules for NT8 are not provided, but perhaps it's a terminal? Wait, the given rules list all NT productions, so any letter without -> is a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see things like 'NT77->NT92 NT85', which"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-798","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. That should make it easier to parse the string, maybe using the CYK algorithm or something similar.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string and the grammar rules. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. The terminal symbols look like 't0', 't1', etc., up to 't98'. From the grammar, I see that many of these terminals are generated by the non-terminals. For example, NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and so on.\n\nWait, I notice that some of the non-terminals seem to produce multiple terminals. So perhaps I should start by breaking down the string into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S. The grammar has three productions for S: S -> NT74 NT44, S -> NT11 NT24, or S -> NT40 NT92. So the string must start with either NT74 and NT44, NT11 and NT24, or NT40 and NT92.\n\nLet me split the given string into two parts, since S always produces two non-terminals followed by something else, I think. Wait, no, S is the start symbol, so the entire string is generated by S. So I need to see if the whole string can be derived from S.\n\nAlternatively, since S is a start symbol and it's supposed to generate the entire string, the string should be completely derived from S, possibly through multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the CYK algorithm approach. The CYK algorithm efficiently checks whether a string is in the language generated by a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. I should try to apply it.\n\nTo apply CYK, I'll need to create a table where each cell corresponds to a substring of the input string. For each cell, I'll check which non-terminals can derive that substring by looking at the grammar rules.\n\nThe input string is long, so I'll need to plan this carefully.\n\nLet me write down the string for clarity:\n\nt6 t19 t14 t82 t45 t85 t8 t85 t5 t0 t18 t72 t20 t9 t71 t11 t87 t74 t87 t71 t43 t17 t11 t17 t73 t74 t55 t29 t14 t45 t16 t16 t31 t5 t52 t71 t88 t98 t1 t7 t43 t29\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Hmm, maybe I can process this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll index the tokens:\n\n0: t6\n\n1: t19\n\n2: t14\n\n3: t82\n\n4: t45\n\n5: t85\n\n6: t8\n\n7: t85\n\n8: t5\n\n9: t0\n\n10: t18\n\n11: t72\n\n12: t20\n\n13: t9\n\n14: t71\n\n15: t11\n\n16: t87\n\n17: t74\n\n18: t87\n\n19: t71\n\n20: t43\n\n21: t17\n\n22: t11\n\n23: t17\n\n24: t73\n\n25: t74\n\n26: t55\n\n27: t29\n\n28: t14\n\n29: t45\n\n30: t16\n\n31: t16\n\n32: t31\n\n33: t5\n\n34: t52\n\n35: t71\n\n36: t88\n\n37: t98\n\n38: t1\n\n39: t7\n\n40: t43\n\n41: t29\n\nWait, that's 42 tokens? Or maybe some count mistake. Anyway, the idea is to process each token as we go.\n\nThe CYK algorithm steps:\n\n1. Initialize a table where each cell (i,j) corresponds to the substring starting at position i and ending at position j (exclusive), i.e., length j - i.\n\n2. For each cell (i,j), check all possible k where i \u2264 k < j. For each k, check if all symbols in (i,k) and (k,j) can be derived from the same non-terminal N.\n\nBut wait, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nAlternatively, the key is that for a substring to be derived from a non-terminal A, there must exist a production A \u2192 BC, such that the left part (i,k) can be derived from B, and the right part (k,j) can be derived from C.\n\nBut since it's the entire string, we can approach it incrementally.\n\nAnother approach: Since the start symbol is S, and S can produce different combinations, perhaps I can break the string into two parts and see if each part can be derived from the possible S productions.\n\nLet me look at the possible S productions:\n\nS can produce NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92.\n\nSo, the entire string must be a production of one of these three.\n\nWait, but the string is quite long, so it's more than two symbols. So perhaps S expands into more non-terminals, until we reach the terminal string.\n\nAlternatively, the start symbol is S, and the string must be part of the expansion of S. So perhaps the string can be broken down into a series of rules starting from S.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe trying to find a way to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nAnother idea: Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 B C, with A, B, C being non-terminals except for the base cases where a non-terminal ends in a single terminal.\n\nSo let's list all the productions and see which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals have productions that convert into two terminals. For example, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and both NT92 and NT85 have productions that terminate with 't' symbols.\n\nWait, let's look for those non-terminals that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT73 t49 (Wait, no, in the grammar, NT74 appears in NT77 \u2192 NT74 NT99)\n\nWait, actually, looking at the full grammar, I see that many non-terminals have a mix of terminal and non-terminal productions.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to build a map of non-terminals that can produce each terminal.\n\nLet me look for any non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't6'\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't85'\n\nWait, actually, scanning through all the NT productions, I can find which NTs produce terminals.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't85'\n\nBut also, looking at other NTs:\n\nFrom the given productions, for example:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT99 NT39\n\nBut I don't see that producing a terminal.

Wait, no. Let me scan through each rule.\n\nWait, some NTs are at the end like NT0 \u2192 't29', NT9 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't29'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nWait, no, let me go through each production line and note when a NT produces a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT74 NT44\n\nLine 2: S -> NT11 NT24\n\nLine 3: S -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo S directly has two NTs.\n\nThen, NT74: check line 4: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nSo NT74 produces two other NTs, nothing terminal.\n\nNT49: line 5: NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47\n\nStill no terminal.\n\nNT39: line 6: NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\nNo terminal.\n\nNT77: line 7: NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n\nNo terminal.\n\nNT57: line 8: NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n\nNo terminal.\n\nNT51: line9: NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n\nNo terminal.\n\nNT74 line10: same as before.\n\nNT40 line11: NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\n\nLine12: NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-815","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is: `t52 t55 t93 t29 t5 t11 t6 t8 t14 t1 t74 t16 t16 t73 t9 t9 t20 t73 t6 t9 t5 t9 t5 t88 t71 t31 t85 t82 t87 t1 t71 t80 t52 t8 t7 t59 t45 t9 t85 t52 t31 t85 t93`.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single symbol (a terminal or non-terminal) on the left and two symbols on the right, or a terminal on the left and a single symbol on the right (but for the start symbol, which I believe is S here). Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see that S starts with two non-terminals, so it's S \u2192 NT\u2026NT\u2026 which means each production after S might have two non-terminals on the right.\n\nBut since this grammar has all productions in CNF with either one or two non-terminals on the right, but in the given case, I see S \u2192 NT...NT... which is two non-terminals each time, so I'll assume all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but in this case, the grammar seems to have S and NT productions which are combinations.\n\nThe task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nBut processing such a long string directly seems tedious. Maybe I can find a strategy to break down the string or identify parts that can be matched through the grammar.\n\nLet me see the string split into tokens: it's a series of 't' followed by numbers, so all tokens are terminals, perhaps representing the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string has 45 tokens. Since each production (except for S) produces two non-terminals, and each non-terminal eventually becomes terminals, the length of the string should be 2^n - 1 if the grammar is a binary tree, but perhaps it's more complex because some non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nWait, but the string given is a sequence of terminals, so each production used must ultimately generate these terminals. Each step in the derivation would replace non-terminals with sequences of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nAn alternative approach is to try to find a parse tree that generates this string using the given grammar.\n\nBut perhaps stepping through the string step by step would help. Let's consider the structure of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t52, t55, t93, t29, etc. So maybe I can find how these relate to the productions.\n\nI notice that the last part of the string ends with t93, which in the grammar has a production NT73 \u2192 't6' and NT12 \u2192 't85', etc. Wait, maybe looking for the end symbols to backtrack.\n\nI can try to identify the last part of the string and see if it can be derived from a production.\n\nLooking at the end: ...t93, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't6'\n- NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n- NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\n- NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n- NT18 \u2192 't14'\nWait, maybe I can find how a production can generate a sequence ending with t93.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the longest possible matches from the end of the string.\n\nThe last part is ...t52 t8 t7 t59 t45 t9 t85 t52 t31 t85 t93.\n\nHmm, t93 is produced by NT73 \u2192 't6' and also by NT73 \u2192 other paths?

Each rule is of the form NT... -> either two NTs or one terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99 (two NTs)\n\nNT40 -> NT16 NT80 (two NTs)\n\nNT11 -> NT87 (one NT? Wait, NT11 is in the start rule, but in the grammar, NT11 \u2192 NT87 (so one non-terminal on the right, which is a chain).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if each NT production has either one terminal or two NTs on the right.\n\nBut in the given grammar, S is the start symbol, which is in two non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-819","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) is defined by a set of production rules. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. Wait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I see some productions like S -> NT74 NT44, which are two non-terminals. Other productions, like some ending with 't', which are terminals, would be the direct productions in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t1 t80 t70 t52 t70 t29 t29 t74 t85 t11 t22 t22 t6 t14 t92 t5 t20 t59 t92 t98 t92 t31 t45 t7 t82 t70 t22 t93 t22 t70 t52 t38 t70 t18 t92 t71 t1 t70 t16 t87 t9 t56 t43`\n\nSo the string consists of a sequence of terminals, all lowercase letters, but some are numbers, like t1, t80, etc.\n\nNow, the approach is to parse this string using the given CFG. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, I can try using a top-down parsing method like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent. Alternatively, maybe a simple leftmost derivation could work, but given the complexity of the grammar, a parsing table might be better. However, given that I don't have a parser, maybe I can derive the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for a CFG in CNF, the string's length must be a power of 2, but that's if all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, which they aren't in this case, because some rules produce a single terminal. That rule would cause the length to not necessarily be a binary power.\n\nLet's check the length of the given string. The string has 42 terminals. Since some productions produce single terminals, the length of the derivation tree can vary. So that doesn't immediately rule it out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a context-free grammar and see if each token in the string can be derived correctly.\n\nSince manually parsing this might be time-consuming, perhaps I can approach it by trying to reduce the string from left to right, matching the beginning of the string with the start symbol.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. Looking at the grammar, S can produce NT74 NT44. So the first two symbols in the string should be t74 followed by t44. But the first token is t1, which is different. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT49 -> NT0 NT47. So NT49 can produce t0 followed by t47, but that's under NT0, which eventually produces t29. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the production rules that end with a terminal. It might help to see possible direct derivations.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nI see NT7 -> t74, NT12 -> t85, NT17 -> t73, etc. Some non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can list all the non-terminals that produce terminals directly, and try to build a structure.\n\nFor example, NT17 -> t73, so whenever we see t73 in the string, it can be matched by NT17.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 -> t74, so t74 comes from NT7.\n\nBut in the string, the first few terms are t1, t80, t70, etc. Let's see if these terminals have any corresponding production rules.\n\nLooking at the production rules, for example:\n\n- nt70: looking through, I see NT70 -> NT18 NT92.\n\nWait, or is it NT70 -> NT18 NT92? Let me check:\n\nYes, I see NT70 -> NT18 NT92.\n\nSo NT70 can produce NT18 followed by NT92. Now, see if the string starts with t70, which would require NT70 to be the first step. But in the given string, the first symbol is t1, which doesn't correspond to NT70.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT7 -> 't74' which is a production. So NT7 can produce the terminal 't74'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT12 -> 't85'\n\nNT17 -> 't73'\n\nNT16 -> 't71'\n\nNT69 -> 't93'\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, some NT non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> t74\n\n- NT12 -> t85\n\n- NT17 -> t73\n\n- NT16 -> t71\n\n- NT69 -> t93\n\n- NT18 -> t76 (Wait, looking back at the productions, I see NT18: Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT18: NT18 -> 't14', 't19', 't20', 't0'.\n\nWait no, let me list them properly:\n\nLooking through each production, we have:\n\n- NT7 -> t74\n\n- NT0 -> t29\n\n- NT19 -> t17, t99, t22, etc.\n\nWait, actually, I might be getting this wrong.

{"custom_id":"request-844","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar provided. Each production starts with a capital letter and expands into other symbols. The base case are the terminals, which are 't' followed by a number, like 't46', 't7', etc. So, the string I'm evaluating consists of a bunch of these terminals: 't46', 't14', 't29', 't0', and so on.\n\nThe goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol, which is 'S'. The grammar has S producing various combinations of non-terminals, and those non-terminals expand further until we reach the terminals.\n\nI remember that for a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, each production indeed fits this form: each non-terminal on the left expands into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, the process to see if the string is generated by this grammar would involve using a parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, which is used for CNF grammars. If I recall correctly, the CYK algorithm can determine if a string is in the language by checking possible ways to split the string into non-terminals that can produce it.\n\nBut since I might not be familiar with implementing CYK, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider how the string could be built up.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so each of these must come from the productions in the grammar. Each production can generate at most two symbols, so the string must be constructed by combining these two-symbol expansions step by step.\n\nLet's look at the string: 't46 t14 t29 t0 t5 t87 t80 t92 t0 t80 t31 t93 t74 t26 t31 t0 t45 t93 t93 t59 t80 t87 t5 t92 t72 t1 t46 t6 t6 t19 t56 t38 t87 t74 t82 t29 t52 t92 t1 t76 t98 t74 t11 t93'\n\nThat's 47 tokens. Since each production in CNF can produce at most two symbols, the length of the string is related to the number of productions needed. The start symbol S, which is a single non-terminal, can generate a string of length n only if there are enough productions to combine the symbols into the full string.\n\nGiven that the string is relatively long, it's possible, but I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to trace back from the terminals and see if they can be connected via the productions. Since the grammar is given, maybe I can check if all the terminals appear in the right places.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal has specific rules. For example, 'S' can expand into two non-terminals, each of which can further expand. The terminals are all 't' followed by a number, and each terminal is defined through some sequence of non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some terminals are defined directly, like 'S -> NT74 NT44', which then eventually leads to 't56' for NT44, as per 'NT44 -> t56'. Similarly, other non-terminals expand into terminals.\n\nI need to map each terminal in the string to its production in the grammar. Let's see:\n\nt46: I see that in the grammar, looking through the rules, maybe N -> something that leads to t46. Hold on, check the list.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, some of them expand into terminals.\n\nFor example, NT9 -> t5, NT57 -> t72, NT51 -> t98, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I can make a reverse mapping. Let me jot down a few of the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\n- NT77 -> t85 (from NT77 -> NT92 NT85; and NT85 -> t64, but wait, in the given grammar, NT85 -> NT64 NT12, and NT12 -> t16. Hmm, maybe I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of trying to reverse-engineer, I can see if each terminal is present in the grammar as a terminal production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal productions are all lines ending with -> t<number>. For example, NT9 -> t5, NT70 -> t74, etc. So, each line like NT70 -> t82 is a terminal.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, I can list all the terminals, each as a production.\n\nLet me list them all:\n\nt5: NT9 \u2192 t5\n\nt74: NT70 \u2192 t74\n\nt71: NT16 \u2192 t71\n\nt38: NT69 \u2192 t38\n\nt73: NT73 \u2192 t73\n\nt49: NT57 \u2192 t49\n\nWait, no, the way it's written, lines like NT73 \u2192 't74' mean that NT73 expands to the terminal 't74'.\n\nSo, all the terminals are on the right side of the \u2192.\n\nSo, looking through the grammar, each terminal is part of a production.\n\nBut in the given string, some terminals are not present in the direct terminal productions; for example, 't46' is in the string but maybe it's derived through a non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, the string includes 't46', which isn't directly a terminal in the grammar, unless I'm missing it. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT9 \u2192 t5, but where does t46 come from?\n\nWait, checking the productions, the left-hand side (LHS) can be a non-terminal, the RHS can have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. So a non-terminal might expand into a terminal and another non-terminal, which might then expand into another terminal.\n\nSo, to get 't46', maybe there's a non-terminal that can expand into 't46' eventually.\n\nWait, but let me check the grammar: do any of the non-terminals directly expand into 't46'? Looking through the LHS's, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't46', except possibly if one of the RHS's eventually leads to it.\n\nAlternatively, 't46' is part of a longer chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminal NT74 can expand into 't74' and other things. Or maybe other non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the list of productions, for example, N70 \u2192 t82; that might not be directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if all the terminals in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSo, for example, 't46' is in the string. Do any non-terminals produce 't46'?\n\nLooking through, is there a production where a non-terminal expands into 't46' directly or through another production?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI see that NT0 \u2192 t29, but no NT directly produces 't46'. Wait, perhaps another NT can produce 't46' through a chain.\n\nWait, let me think. The string has several 't's with numbers, so I need to ensure that each token corresponds to a path through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each token in the string is a terminal that should be present as a terminal in the grammar, or it should be possible to derive it through the rules.\n\nBut the string includes 't46', which isn't listed as a direct terminal expansion. Hmm, that's a problem because if 't46' isn't directly present, we need to see if it can be derived from combinations of other productions.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I missed a terminal production. Let me go line by line through the grammar to spot all the terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44 \u2192 so S expands into two NTs.\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n\nWait, looking through, I see lines like NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and NT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12.\n\nBut looking through the entire grammar, I see the terminals are ones that end with 't' followed by a number. So, looking through each production:\n\n- NT90 \u2192 t46\n\nAh, here's one: NT90 \u2192 t46. So that means that NT90 can produce 't46'.\n\nSo, the string has 't46', so this must come from NT90 \u2192 t46.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals need to come from their respective productions"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-843","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal followed by a non-terminal (I think that's right, but I might be mixing up the exact form). Wait, no, Chomsky normal form typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the rules are like S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which seems to be two non-terminals. Then there are rules like NT73 \u2192 't6', which are terminals. So this grammar is indeed in Chomsky normal form because all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but wait, Chomsky normal form requires all productions to have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. Hmm, no, actually, in CNF, it's either A\u2192BC (two non-terminals) or A\u2192a (a terminal).\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, I see some like NT97 \u2192 NT93 NT98, which are two non-terminals, and others like NT73 \u2192 't6', which is a single terminal. So actually, the grammar is in CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal, which matches the definition. So that's good because we can use the properties of CNF for parsing or generating strings.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t85 t5 t26 t14 t29 t19 t0 t71 t87 t45 t14 t19 t18 t88 t6 t5 t46 t8 t87 t1 t29 t8 t73 t88 t16 t18 t9 t11 t7 t8 t9 t1 t20 t38 t70 t5 t22 t8 t56 t59 t70 t20 t70 t7.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is a context-free grammar in CNF, we can try to parse the string using a CYK algorithm or by checking if each terminal can be derived from the start symbol step by step.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to break down the string into components that match the grammar's productions. Let's look at the structure of the grammar. We have S \u2192 NT49 NT99, but looking at the rules, the provided S productions are S \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, and S \u2192 NT40 NT92. So the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals each time.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar eventually expands into a terminal or a combination of non-terminals. The non-terminals correspond to numbers like NT0, NT1, etc., which expand into specific terminal strings as seen in the rules. The terminals are like t5, t7, t38, etc.\n\nSince this is a top-down approach, we'd start by matching the entire string to S. The string starts with t85. Let me look at which non-terminal produces t85.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT91 \u2192 NT64 NT90, and NT92 \u2192 t52. Wait, I'm looking for a rule where NTXXX produces t85.

{"custom_id":"request-864","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule either has two non-terminal symbols on the right side or a single terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, I see a bunch of S and NT rules. S seems to be the start symbol, and all other symbols are non-terminals (like NT49, NT39, etc.), except for the 't' symbols, which look like terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which seems to correspond to the terminals in the grammar. Each 't' is followed by a number, so the string is a series of tokens like t73, t80, etc. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe approach I can take is to parse the string using the grammar, checking if each 't' can be generated by some rule. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will help. Each production either breaks down into smaller parts or outputs a symbol. So, if I can replace each 't' with the corresponding non-terminal using the production rules, I should be able to determine if the string is valid.\n\nLet's list the 't' symbols and their corresponding non-terminals:\n- t73 corresponds to NT73\n- t80 corresponds to NT80\n- t31 corresponds to NT31\n- t43 corresponds to NT43\n- t19 corresponds to NT19\n- t7 corresponds to NT7\n- t45 corresponds to NT45\n- t1 corresponds to NT1\n- t22 corresponds to NT22\n- t85 corresponds to NT85\n- t9 corresponds to NT9\n- t52 corresponds to NT52\n- t76 corresponds to NT76\n- t29 corresponds to NT29\n- t26 corresponds to NT26\n\nNow, I'll go through the string step by step. The entire string is a sequence of these 't' symbols. Each 'tX' must be part of a production rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals have productions to a single 't' symbol. For example:\n- NT7 -> t74\n- NT49 -> t6 (But wait, in the provided grammar, I see NT7 -> t73. Hmm, I think I miscounted. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar includes several rules like NT7 -> t73, NT80 -> t80, but I see some are missing. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, the rules are listed, but I need to see which rule produces which 'tX'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconstruct the production rules from the grammar. Let me list all the 't' rules to map them:\n\nFrom the grammar, I should look for any rule where the right side is just a terminal. For example, looking through the list:\n\n- NT7 -> t73\n- NT17 -> t73\n- NT16 -> t71\n- NT69 -> t93\n- NT18 -> t14\n- NT20 -> t17\n- NT20 -> t0\n- NT28 -> t20\n- NT12 -> t16\n- NT39 -> t9\n- NT92 -> t52\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT24 -> t88\n- NT28 -> t26\n- NT59 -> t6\n- NT19 -> t57\n- NT44 -> t56\n- NT9 -> t46\n- NT90 -> t22\n- NT12 -> t1\n- NT85 -> t85\n- NT70 -> t82\n- NT35 -> t35 -> t91\n- Wait, no, NT35 -> NT34 NT25, but NT34 and NT25 have their own rules. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note which non-terminals directly produce a terminal. Let's list any production rule where the right-hand side is a single terminal:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT7 -> t73\nNT17 -> t73 --> Wait, but NT17 is present? Yes, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 -> t73\n\nSimilarly, NT20 -> t17 and NT20 -> t0.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT20 -> t17\nNT20 -> t0\n\nSo, NT20 can produce t17 or t0.\n\nSimilarly, NT18 has rules:\n\nNT18 -> t14, and another NT18 -> t19.\n\nSo, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. Others, like NT7 -> t73, NT80 -> t80, etc.\n\nNow, the string given is:\n\nt73 t80 t31 t43 t19 t31 t73 t29 t7 t45 t1 t22 t85 t22 t9 t52 t82 t76 t6 t45 t93 t17 t0 t5 t8 t19 t20 t85 t7 t19 t38 t7 t52 t70 t59 t55 t17 t88 t93 t72 t6 t55 t76 t29 t26\n\nWait, let me check if each 'tX' in the string is present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the 't' rules:\n\n- NT7 -> t73\n- NT80 -> t80\n- NT31: Hmm, do any non-terminals produce t31? Let me look through the rules provided.\n\nWait, the list of 't' symbols is a bit complicated. Let me go through the grammar and see which non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar, some of the rules are:\n\nNT7 -> t73\nNT80 -> t80\n\nWhat about NT31? Looking through the given rules, I don't see any direct rule for NT31. Wait, the string has t31, but in the grammar, I don't see any production rule that defines NT31. Without such a rule, NT31 would not produce anything, and thus t31 cannot be in the language. That would immediately mean the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but the string includes t31, but looking through the provided grammar, I don't see any NT rule that produces t31. So, for example, I see NT35 -> NT34 NT25, but no rule for NT34 or NT25 to produce t31. Therefore, NT31 is not defined in the grammar. So, t31 cannot appear in the language, which is the string we're evaluating.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Did I miss any rule where any NT leads to t31?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT40 -> NT39 NT98, but no t31.\nNT12 -> t93, t16, etc. Doesn't produce t31.\nNT92 -> t52, t26, etc.\nNT77 -> t79 and t85? Wait, the grammar doesn't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the non-terminals. Wait, in the given grammar, do we have any NT with a rule that ends in t31?\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I only see NT7 -> t73, NT80 -> t80, T20 -> t17 and t0, etc. I don't see any rules for NT31 or any non-terminals that directly produce t31. That would mean the string has t31, which the grammar cannot generate because no rule for NT31 leads to t31.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look through the list again. Let me see the entire grammar as given:\n\nThe grammar is as follows (condensed for clarity):\nS -> NT74 NT74 | NT11 NT24 | NT40 NT92\nNT49 -> NT0 NT47\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\nNT57 -> NT85 NT56\nNT51 -> NT19 NT18\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\nNT40 -> NT16 NT80\nNT65 -> NT17 NT19\nNT85 -> NT64 NT12\nNT99 -> NT51 NT66\nNT55 -> NT47 NT65\nNT76 -> NT2 NT68\nNT57 -> NT19 NT99\nNT38 -> NT13 NT98\nNT64 -> NT65 NT13\nNT35 -> NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-860","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t98 t85 t45 t19 t0 t76 t98 t9 t46 t46 t88 t88 t8 t70 t5 t29 t80 t88 t55 t22 t31 t55 t9 t43 t98 t11 t55 t85 t46 t26 t22 t87 t93 t22 t46 t22 t0 t88 t22 t8 t85 t9 t22 t91 t87`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's given in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, there are several productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach production breaks down into other non-terminals, which in turn are replaced by other non-terminals or terminals. The recursion continues until the smallest non-terminals are replaced by terminals, represented by 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe grammar seems to have a lot of non-terminals that eventually expand to terms. For instance, NT92 \u2192 NT52, which then seems to expand further, but sometimes directly to 't52'. Similarly, other non-terminals expand into terms or more non-terminals.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string can be generated by following these productions.\n\nI'll start by looking at the string and see if each token can be matched by a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's list the terminals in the string: Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So the sequence is a series of these terminal symbols.\n\nI'll go through the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't98'. Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT92 \u2192 NT62. Wait, that's not exactly, let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT92 \u2192 NT56. Hmm, looking at the rules:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40, and NT92 \u2192 NT56, but wait, that's a cycle between NT92 and NT56. But there's a production NT92 \u2192 t56 from somewhere?\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40.\n\nAnd NT40 \u2192 NT44 nt98 (Wait, looking again, I think I need to parse the grammar carefully.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar is written in a way where each production is two non-terminals on the right side, but the actual terminals are given in certain productions.\n\nFor example, looking at NT92:\n\nNT92 \u2192 t52 (Is that a production? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT92 \u2192 t52 is not present. Wait, let me check all the rules.\n\nLooking for 't' in the grammar:\n\nLooking at all rules where a non-terminal is replaced by 't' plus a number:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t5\n\nNT70 \u2192 t74\n\nNT90 \u2192 t22\n\nNT12 \u2192 t16, t85, t1 (from NT12 \u2192 t1), t1 (from NT12 \u2192 nt28)\n\nNT18 \u2192 t76, t91, t14, t19, t20, t0, t70, t28\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\n\nNT95 \u2192 t35\n\nNT41 doesn't exist, but looking for all, perhaps miss several.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. It might be better to scan all the productions and see which ones directly produce t symbols.\n\nLooking at the entire grammar:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t5\n\nNT70 \u2192 t74\n\nNT90 \u2192 t22\n\nNT12 \u2192 t16, t85, t1, t1\n\nNT18 \u2192 t76, t91, t14, t19, t20, t0, t70, t28\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\n\nNT16 \u2192 t71\n\nNT88 \u2192 t69? Or is that NT69 \u2192 t66?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting lost here. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. Each 't' followed by a number must be matched exactly by a production. So each token in the string must be the result of a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't98'. I need to see if 't98' is a production in the grammar. Scanning through the grammar rules, I see that 't98' is a result of NT98: wait, is there such a rule?\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT26 \u2192 NT22 t20, but 't20' is a production only for certain non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking for 't95 \u2192 t35', 't66 \u2192 t64', etc. I might be overcomplicating this.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to model the grammar as a tree, starting from S, and see if the input string could be derived.\n\nStarting from S, the possible initial productions are S \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, or S \u2192 NT40 NT92.\n\nEach of these branches will eventually terminate when only terminals are left.\n\nLet's pick one path and see if any of them could generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree for the string could help, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each token in the string corresponds to a single symbol in the grammar, i.e., is each 't' followed by a number a terminal in the grammar?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t5\n\nNT70 \u2192 t74\n\nNT90 \u2192 t22\n\nNT12 \u2192 several 't's, like t16, t85, t1, etc.\n\nNT18 \u2192 t76, t91, etc.\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\n\nNT16 \u2192 t71\n\nNT88 \u2192 t69 (Wait, is that in the grammar? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list again, I see NT56 \u2192 t92. Wait, no, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps 't88' is a terminal. Let me see: in the production list, do we have any NT88? I don't see NT88 directly producing a 't' value. Similarly, for other 't' tokens like t98, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' number is an explicit terminal in the grammar. If the grammar doesn't have such a production, then those 't' tokens would not be part of any legitimate string generated by the grammar, and thus the answer would be 'No'.\n\nAssuming all 't' tokens in the string have corresponding grammar rules, then each 't' can be generated. But if any 't' token is not present, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nThe tokens are: t98, t85, t45, t19, t0, t76, t98, t9, t46, t46, t88, d88, etc.\n\nWait, for 't45', is there a production for NT45? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT45, NT53, etc., being directly assigned to a 't' token. For example, NT53 \u2192 t43? Looking through the production list:\n\nLooking for 't45', 't43' etc., perhaps in the rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT44 t98\n\nWait, that's not exactly a terminal, but perhaps a production for NT40 is NT44 t98. Wait, but that would mean NT40 is replaced by NT44 followed by t98, but how does that work? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation.\n\nWait, let me clarify: In the provided grammar, each rule is written as something like NT49 -> NT0 NT47, meaning NT49 is replaced by two non-terminals: NT0 and NT47. Similarly, when a rule ends with a number, like NT57 -> t18, that would be a terminal (since t is a terminal).\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, it's more like each production has a list of symbols on the right-hand side, some of which are NTs and others are t's with numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps each line is of the form NTx \u2192 (some T or NTs).\n\nFor example:\n\nNT49 -> NT0 NT47.\n\nThat means NT49 is replaced by NT0 and NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, NT76 \u2192 t76? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given productions, the NT76 is a non-terminal with production NT76 \u2192 NT28 NT66. But in the grammar, does NT76 produce a terminal? Let me scan through:\n\nLooking at each production line:\n\nNT76 \u2192 NT28 NT68 is one of them. So NT76 produces two NTs, so it's not a terminal. Therefore, perhaps I need to list all possible A \u2192 a where A is a non-terminal that directly produces a terminal.\n\nFrom the given list, let me check each production to see if it produces a terminal:\n\n- S \u2192 NT49 NT74: two non-terminals.\n- S \u2192 NT39 NT24: same.\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92: same.\n\nMoving through the grammar:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47: non-terminals.\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25: non-terminals.\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85: non-terminals.\n\nContinuing through the list, I notice a few NTs that produce terminals:\n\nWait, no, because looking through the list, the only productions that end with a terminal are in the cases where the right-hand side is a single terminal, but in this grammar, all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or sequences like NTx NTy, where x and y are non-terminals. There are no productions like NTx \u2192 a, just NTx \u2192 NTy NTz. So, does this mean that all the non-terminals are two-symbol? Or perhaps I've miscounted.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: the productions in the grammar have either the right-hand side as two non-terminals or maybe a terminal? Let me take one line:\n\nLooking at line: NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85: two non-terminals, so NT77 is not a terminal.\n\nAnother line: NT70 \u2192 NT74 NT73: two non-terminals.\n\nAnother line: NT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61: non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I find lines like:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\n\nSo NT25 expands to two non-terminals.\n\nBut then, looking at:\n\nWait, is there any production that directly has a terminal on the RHS? Looking through, I see:\n\nLine: NT53 \u2192 NT43 (so NT53 \u2192 t43?), and similarly:\n\nWait, let me parse it carefully:\n\nEach line is of the form:\n\n[NTname] \u2192 [RHS], where RHS can be either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking for any production where RHS is a single terminal. For example, looking for a line like NTx \u2192 'a'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nFind the line NT53 \u2192 NT43. So that's a production where RHS is NT43, but no terminal. Next line: NT53 \u2192 t43? Wait, does that exist?\n\nWait, the given list of productions goes up to:\n\n...\nNT53 \u2192 t43\n...\nSo that's a production where NT53 \u2192 t43, a single terminal.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and the productions seem to involve a lot of non-terminals. Each production starts with S and produces combinations of NTs (non-terminals) and some terminal letters.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. The string is quite long, so I'll need to parse it carefully.\n\nMy approach will be to look for a derivation where each step follows the productions, starting from S and applying rules until I reach the string.\n\nLet me start by listing out the productions to see the possible transitions:\n\n- S can produce NT11 NT24, NT40 NT92, or NT49 NT74.\n- There are many NT productions leading down to terminals with 't' and numbers.\n\nThe string starts with 't76', which I'll need to trace back through the productions.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string to evaluate is: \n\n`t31 t92 t55 t7 t0 t59 t70 t1 t55 t59 t87 t43 t1 t85 t45 t92 t17 t31 t71 t56 t85 t73 t14 t93 t92 t29 t76 t55 t74 t6 t22 t0 t19 t17 t56 t91 t76 t9 t45 t56 t43 t43 t46 t26 t72 t80 t71`.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar's structure. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left, except for the start symbol, which can go directly to terminals. But looking at the rules, it seems that all productions either produce two non-terminals or a non-terminal paired with another non-terminal that eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BB, right? Because in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, and the start symbol S is at the top-level. So each production either yields two non-terminals or a non-terminal that in turn yields two non-terminals. This structure suggests that each step doubles the number of symbols, so the total length of the string should be a power of two times the length of the initial string. The initial string is S \u2192 NT X, so if each non-terminal expands into two symbols, each step doubles the number of symbols.\n\nBut looking at the input string, it has 71 tokens. Let me check: 71 is an odd number. Since each step doubles the number, the length should be a power of 2. 2^6 is 64, 2^7 is 128. 71 isn't a multiple of 2, so the string length is not possible under this grammar. That would immediately mean the string can't be generated, right?\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial string after expansion could have multiple symbols before terminals start. Let me think: the start symbol S expands to NT and another NT. Each NT can further expand into other NTs or NTs that eventually produce terminals. So at each expansion, the number of NTs doubles. So the total number of NT symbols at any point is a power of 2 multiplied by some other factors. However, terminals can come from expansions, so the total number of terminals could be different.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is that the number of terminals produced by S should be a product of expansions that start as 2 and each step doubles. Wait no, because each NT can produce either two NTs or two terminals?\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, so each NT expands into two NTs, which each can expand further. The process continues until all NTs are replaced by terminals. So the total number of terminals should be a power of two, because each expansion step doubles the number of symbols.\n\nWait, but maybe not, because some NTs might directly expand into two terminals, so the process can stop earlier for some paths. But ultimately, the total number of terminals would still be a sum that's a power of two, because at each branching step, each NT splits into two, and the total is multiplied by two each time.\n\nBut in our case, the string has 71 tokens, which is 71 terminals. 71 is not a power of two, so that would imply that the string is not possible. Because each time you can only double the number of symbols, the total number of terminals must be a power of two.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm wrong here. Let me think again. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT1 X1, then each NT can expand into two NTs or a terminal and another non-terminal, but no, in CNF, all productions are of the form NT \u2192 NT NT. So every time you expand an NT, you get two NTs. So starting from S, you get 2 NTs. Each NT can either expand further or, wait, no, in CNF, you can only go to two non-terminals, so every NT must keep expanding until they can't anymore, meaning they have to produce terminals. Wait, but in this grammar, I don't see any NTs that produce a single terminal. Instead, all the NTs eventually have production rules that either go to two terminals or maybe one terminal and non-terminal? Wait, looking at the provided rules, it seems that all NTs expand to two NTs, right? For example, S \u2192 NT1 X1, and each NT is defined as NT \u2192 NT NT.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the given rules, I see lines like NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, which is NT producing two NTs. So all the productions are of the form NT \u2192 NT NT. So each NT can only be replaced by two NTs, which can go on infinitely. But the only way to get terminals is if somewhere down the expansion, an NT directly produces a terminal. But in the given rules, I don't see any NTs that directly produce a single terminal. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules, almost all of them produce two NTs. For example, NT7 \u2192 t74, which is NT7 \u2192 't74'. Oh, so some NTs can directly expand to a terminal. So for example, NT7 \u2192 t74. So in this case, when an NT is expanded, it can sometimes produce a terminal and another NT, or two NTs.\n\nWait, no: looking at NT7's rule, it's NT7 \u2192 't74'. So NT7 can directly produce a single terminal, 't74'. That's different. So in this grammar, certain NTs can expand into a single terminal, while others expand into two NTs. So the structure is that NTs can be of two types: those that produce a single terminal (like NT7 \u2192 t74) and those that produce two NTs (like NT1 \u2192 NT2 NT3).\n\nSo when we expand, each NT can either produce a single terminal or two NTs. However, this complicates the expansion process because the number of symbols can vary, but since some NTs produce terminals, the total number of terminals in the generated string can be any number, not necessarily a power of two.\n\nWait, but let's think about it. Each time you expand an NT, if it's an NTT that produces two NTs, the number of symbols (NTs + terminals) increases. But if an NT produces a terminal, it stops there. So the total number of terminals can be variable.\n\nBut in our given string, the length is 71. Let's see if it's possible for the grammar to generate a string of 71 terminals.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to approach this step by step, trying to find a reduction from the given string to the start symbol S. Let's try that.\n\nTo reduce the string, we need to find if we can find a leftmost derivation that breaks down the string into S.\n\nLooking at the string: t31 t92 t55 t7 t0 t59 t70 t1 t55 t59 t87 t43 t1 t85 t45 t92 t17 t31 t71 t56 t85 t73 t14 t93 t92 t29 t76 t55 t74 t6 t22 t0 t19 t17 t56 t91 t76 t9 t45 t56 t43 t43 t46 t26 t72 t80 t71.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of tokens. Let's try to process the string from the end, perhaps using a CYK-like approach, but since this is manually done, I'll try to find relevant rules.\n\nLet me start by looking for the longest possible matches.\n\nLooking for sequences that can match any production rules.\n\nWait, actually, given the rules, each production starts with an NT (like S, NT49, etc.) and outputs two NTs. Some NTs directly output a terminal.\n\nSo, to match the string, each part of the string must be formed by expanding in the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to see if the string can be split into the required subparts based on the grammar's production rules.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the start symbol S:\n\nS -> NT X\n\nSo S can be matched if the string can be divided into two parts, each part matching some NT.\n\nWait, no. Because S is the top-level symbol, and the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. So when S is expanded, it becomes two NTs, which each can produce further symbols. But all symbols in S's expansion are on the same level, right? Wait, no. Each NT can expand into a terminal or further NTs.\n\nWait, in any case, since S is S -> NT1 NT2, and each NT1 and NT2 can be part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be viewed as the concatenation of sequences generated by NTs,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-899","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes things a bit simpler because each production is either A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and it has several productions:\n\n- S can produce NT74 NT44\n- S can produce NT11 NT24\n- S can produce NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these NT symbols leads to more productions, eventually terminating in 't' followed by a number, which are the terminals that make up the actual string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\n\nt7 t73 t0 t74 t18 t92 t20 t87 t72 t19 t22 t6 t29 t11 t71 t22 t52 t76 t73 t38 t11 t92 t18 t16 t20 t71 t82 t93 t76 t92 t11 t87 t52 t80 t16 t76 t5 t6 t91 t11 t7 t98 t6 t20 t80 t71 t8.\n\nI need to parse this string and see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should note that each symbol starting with 't' is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals. So, the string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is binary, meaning that the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is two symbols, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two terminals. Wait, actually, no, in CNF, the RHS is two non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014 that's not correct. Wait, Chomsky Normal Form requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. But sometimes, if there are terminals, the grammar is extended to allow A \u2192 a, but that's the same as saying A \u2192 a, which is a production that terminates. Wait, no, in strict CNF, all productions except the start symbol are A \u2192 BC, and the start symbol can have a mix. Hmm, perhaps I should confirm, but for this problem, it's a grammar in CNF, so each production, except the start, is A \u2192 BC, and the start can be either, but it's unlikely, so I should proceed under the assumption that the RHS of each production is two non-terminals, and the terminals are leaves that appear in the productions as well.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me correct this: Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, except for possibly the start symbol, which can produce a single terminal. So in our case, looking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT74 NT44, and other NT symbols have RHS that include 't' symbols, which are terminals. This seems a bit conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding.\n\nWait, looking closer, the productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44\n\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\n\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47\n\nWait, but NT49? Wait, is that a typo? Looking at the grammar, it goes to NT59? Hmm, perhaps the grammar includes terminals, which would mean that some productions have a terminal on the RHS. So, perhaps some productions are a non-terminal followed by a terminal, but that would not be strictly in CNF. Hmm, maybe I need to check this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terminals are the 't' symbols, like t7, t73, etc., but in the grammar, the productions sometimes produce a terminal. For example, looking at the productions:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85: both non-terminals.\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56: both non-terminals.\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98: both non-terminals.\n\nNT7 \u2192 't74', which suggests that NT7 \u2192 t74, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, in this case, some of the productions are A \u2192 X a, where X is a non-terminal and a is a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the grammar is in Modified Chomsky Normal Form, allowing for productions of the form A \u2192 aB, A \u2192 Ba, or A \u2192 BC, where a is a terminal.\n\nThis is a common variation of CNF, and algorithms like CYK can still handle it, but the standard approach is to split each production into multiple rules if needed.\n\nSo, my first step is to convert the given grammar into an equivalent CNF without terminals on the RHS. Alternatively, I can handle the terminals directly during parsing.\n\nGiven that, I can proceed to analyze the given string step by step, trying to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, which must be generated by the start symbol S, with S's productions leading down to these terminals.\n\nThe first step is to note that the string is 56 symbols long. Each production rule in the grammar either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, but in CNF, each production in the body has non-terminals only. But in our case, some productions in the body have terminals, like NT7 \u2192 t74, etc.\n\nWait, let me clarify: In the given grammar, the productions for NT symbols sometimes have terminals on the RHS. For example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t74 (means NT7 \u2192 NT7 followed by t74? Or is it that NT7 \u2192 t74 as a terminal, meaning a production of NT7 \u2192 t74?)\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n\nBut then, at the bottom, we have NT7 \u2192 t74, which suggests that NT7 \u2192 t74, which is a terminal (a single 't' followed by a number, but in the string, it's 't7' etc.)\n\nWait, the string starts with 't7 t73 t0 t74...', which is t7 followed by t73, etc.\n\nSo, the terminals are 't' followed by a number, like 't7', 't73', etc.\n\nSo, first, I need to parse the string as a series of terminals.\n\nThe string is a concatenation of t7, t73, t0, t74, t18, t92, t20, t87, t72, t19, t22, t6, t29, t11, t71, t22, t52, t76, t73, t38, t11, t92, t18, t16, t20, t71, t82, t93, t76, t92, t11, t87, t52, t80, t16, t76, t5, t6, t91, t11, t7, t98, t6, t20, t80, t71, t8.\n\nWait, but each term is 't' followed by a number, so t7, t73, etc.\n\nSo, the first task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI can approach this by trying to find a way to parse the string step by step, or perhaps look for possible patterns or constraints.\n\nBut perhaps a smarter way is to look for the root symbol S and see if expanding S can lead to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and the grammar is not context-free enough, but given that it's in CNF, perhaps the CYK algorithm can help, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string starts with something that can be generated from S, and then see if the next symbols can be generated from the resulting non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each symbol in the string can be a terminal in the grammar, and if they are, ensure that there's a path from the start symbol to those terminals through the productions.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t7. Let's see if the grammar could generate t7.\n\nLooking at the NT symbols:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t74\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the NT symbols that can produce t7.\n\nBut looking through the given productions, I don't see an NT that produces t7 directly. Only 't' terms are in the productions. For example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t74\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t7, which is different from t73. So, does any NT produce t7? Looking through the productions, I don't see that. So, the terminal t7 must appear in the productions of the NT symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-916","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. My goal is to determine whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the provided grammar, I see that each production either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, as seen from the rules S \u2192 NT74 NT44, and so on. So the string we're supposed to check will start with S, and each expansion will produce more symbols until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nNow, let's look at the string to evaluate:\n\nt72 t17 t87 t76 t0 t22 t29 t17 t87 t14 t6 t56 t31 t7 t43 t7 t85 t16 t17 t18 t46 t16 t76 t17 t74 t11 t38 t93 t74 t17 t46 t22 t22 t7 t98 t46 t56 t16 t7 t17 t29 t20 t55 t31 t8 t73 t73 t1\n\nThis string consists of a sequence of terminals (like t72, t17, etc.), which correspond to the terminals in the grammar. The task is to see if each terminal in this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nOne approach is to parse the string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a top-down parsing method like the CYK algorithm, but that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, I can attempt to trace back from the string to the start symbol S, checking at each step if the productions apply.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward method is to map each terminal in the string to a production rule and see if we can expand them in a way that the entire string is generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many non-terminals produce terminals directly.

{"custom_id":"request-924","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific rules: each production is either a single terminal, two non-terminals, or a non-terminal producing two other non-terminals. The grammar provided looks like that, with productions like S -> NT74 NT44, which fits, and others like NT49 -> NT0 NT47, which also do. So the structure seems correct.\n\nThe string I'm given is a series of tokens starting with 't' followed by numbers. For example, the string starts with 't76 t88 t11 ...' and so on. My job is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, but how do I approach this? Well, in CNF, the derivation trees are binary, right? Each step produces two parts. So when generating strings, the length should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of productions. Let me check the length of the given string.\n\nCounting the tokens, I see that there are 41 tokens (including each 'tX'). Let me count them again: t76, t88, t11, t91, t73, t98, t76, t56, t56, t85, t70, t26, t38, t85, t16, t72, t91, t31, t70, t18, t91, t6, t70, t88, t76, t19, t8, t7, t74, t76, t92, t17, t52, t59, t91, t80, t7, t6, t88, t52, t56, t11, m14, t88, t91, t20, t91, t29. Wait, that's 41 tokens. Hmm, 41 = 2^6 -1, but 2^5 -1 is 31, 2^6 is 64, so 41 isn't a power of two minus one. That's a problem because in CNF, the length of the string should be of the form 2^n -1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Or perhaps the grammar allows for the string to have other rules. Alternatively, perhaps it's using a different form, but the question says the grammar is in CNF, so the derivation should strictly follow that. So if the string length isn't 2^n -1, it can't be generated.\n\nWait, 41 is 2^5 -1 is 31, 2^6 is 64, so 64-1=63. 41 isn't either. So that suggests it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the string:\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. t76\n2. t88\n3. t11\n4. t91\n5. t73\n6. t98\n7. t76\n8. t56\n9. t56\n10. t85\n11. t70\n12. t26\n13. t38\n14. t85\n15. t16\n16. t72\n17. t91\n18. t31\n19. t70\n20. t18\n21. t91\n22. t6\n23. t70\n24. t88\n25. t76\n26. t19\n27. t8\n28. t7\n29. t74\n30. t76\n31. t92\n32. t17\n33. t52\n34. t59\n35. t91\n36. t80\n37. t7\n38. t6\n39. t88\n40. t52\n41. t56\n42. t11\n43. t14\n44. t88\n45. t91\n46. t20\n47. t91\n48. t29\n\nWait, that's 48 tokens, not 41. Oh, I must have miscounted earlier. So the length is not 2^n -1. Now that's conflicting because in CNF, the derivation of a string must result in a sequence of length that's a Mersenne number.\n\nBut wait, some production rules in the grammar might produce terminals directly. For example, some NT entries map directly to a 't' followed by a number. Like NT77 -> NT92 NT85, which then might map further.\n\nBut maybe some non-terminals produce terminals directly. Wait, looking at the grammar, some lines have NT followed by 't' and a number. For example, NT7 -> 't74', NT12 -> 't85', etc. So each of these is an individual production to a single terminal.\n\nSo the grammar does include some terminals. So the overall string doesn't have to be a binary tree of non-terminals, but can have some leaves that are terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the string is generated by a context-free grammar with both non-terminals and terminals, and the length isn't necessarily Mersenne. Wait, but in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the derivation process would involve starting from S and repeatedly applying productions, each step replacing a non-terminal with two symbols (non-terminals or terminals).\n\nSo the number of symbols in the string must be exactly equal to the number of productions plus one. But wait, starting with a single non-terminal, each production adds one (since each replacement of a non-terminal with two symbols increases the number of symbols by one). So after n productions, the number of symbols is 2^n -1.\n\nWait, wait: S is the start symbol. Each step, replacing a non-terminal with two symbols. So the initial count is 1. After first production, 2. Then, each replacement adds one more. So for a string of length L, the number of productions is L-1, which must be a power of two minus one.\n\nWait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think: when starting with S, each production step adds 1 to the count. So the number of steps to get to L symbols is L-1. Since in each step we replace a non-terminal into two symbols, which increases the length by one.\n\nBut each production is applied on a non-terminal, replacing it with two symbols, which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but for the string to be in the language, the derivation must consist of starting with S and applying productions until only terminals remain, with exactly L symbols where L-1 is equal to the number of productions, which has to be 2^k -1 -1? Hmm, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to note that any context-free grammar in CNF will generate strings where the number of symbols is in the form 2^k. Because each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so the total number of symbols increases by one each time. Starting from 1, each step adding 1.\n\nWait, no, starting from 1: after one step, 2 symbols, after another step, if a non-terminal is replaced again, it could make 3, but if a terminal is produced, it stops increasing.\n\nWait, perhaps not. If a non-terminal is replaced, you go from 1 to 2. If then one of those 2 is replaced, you go to 3. If another replacement happens, maybe 4, etc. So the number of symbols can be any number, but for the derivation to be a valid parse, the number of symbols would have to be such that each step of replacement leads to the correct structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the length of the string is 48, and since 48 isn't a Mersenne number, it can't be derived from a CNF grammar that strictly uses binary expansions, but maybe the grammar allows for some steps to produce terminals early, leading to different lengths.\n\nWait, but no, the fact remains that for a string of length L, there must be exactly L-1 derivation steps, each of which splits a non-terminal into two symbols. So L must be equal to the number of leaves in the derivation tree.\n\nBut in the case where some non-terminals are replaced by terminals (i.e., in one step they produce two symbols, one of which is a terminal), that might not strictly increase the length by 1 each time. Wait, no, wait: replacing a non-terminal X with YZ, where Y could be a terminal or non-terminal. So if both Y and Z are non-terminals, you go from 1 (for X) to 2 (Y and Z).

So maybe NT19 itself is a terminal, but in the given rules, I don't see NT19 as a terminal. Looking through, I see NT17 -> 't73', NT18 -> 't14', but not NT19.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe t19 comes from a longer production, like a two-step process. But since it's a single 't' in the string, it must come directly from a production where that NT rule is a terminal.\n\nLooking again, I see NT70 -> 't73', NT12 -> 't85', NT28 -> 't20', etc. Wait, in the rules I provided, there's NT19 -> 't73' under NT70. Hmm, wait, actually, the rules are listed under each NT symbol. Let me scan through the list to find where t19 comes from.\n\nScanning the list, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT18 -> 't14'\n\nNT16 -> 't71'\n\nNT20 -> 't17'\n\nNT93 -> 't80'\n\nNT18 -> 't19'\n\nAh, here we go. So NT18 can produce either 't14' or 't19'. So t19 must come from NT18.\n\nSo the first token in the string is t19, which comes from NT18. Now, to produce NT18, what does NT18 produce? Looking at the rules, NT18 can be 't17' or 't19'. Since in the string it's 't19', it's taken from the second option. So the first substitution is S -> NT18 NT...?\n\nWait, no. Actually, let me think about this. The string is a sequence of terminals, so in CNF, S must produce two non-terminals, each of which can then produce their own terminals or more non-terminals. So perhaps S is the starting point, which can go to various combinations.\n\nWait, but the first token is t19, which is generated by NT18. So there must be a production that starts with NT18, leading to t19. So NT18 must be part of the derivation.\n\nLet me try to outline the parsing steps.\n\n1. The string starts with t19, which must come from NT18. So the first step is to take the first two symbols from the string: but wait, t19 is a single token. Wait, actually, in the string, it's a single token, but in terms of parsing, each step takes a non-terminal and replaces it with its children. So we need to see how to get t19 as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol t19 is produced by NT18 as 't19' in the production NT18 -> 't19'. So the initial substitution has to start at NT18, which produces t19, and then perhaps more symbols follow.\n\nWait, but the rest of the string is t74 t88 t92 ... etc. Let me consider how the string is built.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at the entire string and see if I can find a way to parse it. But given the length, it's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a leftmost derivation sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe trying to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each terminal in the string is produced by some NT rule. So let's go through each 't' in the string and see if it's covered.\n\nLet's list the terminals:\n\nt19, t74, t88, t92, t80, t9, t38, t72, t31, t18, t1, t20, t26, t74, t31, t18, t18, t92, t91, t80, t6, t72, t14, t22, t87, t22, t80, t22, t45, t6, t1, t74, t73, t80, t92, t1, t11, t31, t98, t55, t6, t56, t71, t87, t38, t17, t19, t38, t56.\n\nNow, each of these must come from some NT's production. Let's see:\n\nt19 \u2192 NT18 \u2192 t19 (so yes)\nt74 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 t74 (since NT7 \u2192 't74')\nt88 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 t7 (wait, NT8 \u2192 't7', but in the string it's t88. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't7', yes.\n\nWait, but the string has t88. Is there a NT that produces t88? Looking through, yes:\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't9' and 't56'. Wait, looking again:\n\nIt seems NT85 \u2192 't38'? Wait, no, looking through:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 't20', NT66 \u2192 't26', NT40 \u2192 't44', etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the given rules, I see NT92 \u2192 't52', but in the string it's t92 appearing multiple times. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT92 is present, but does any NT produce t92? Looking at the rules, yes, NT92 can produce t52? Wait, no, looking at the top of the list:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all NTs and their productions properly to check.\n\nLet me reconstruct all NT productions from the given list:\n\n1. S -> NT49 NT74\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n4.

{"custom_id":"request-939","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is `t20 t71 t73 t71 t45 t16 t73 t9 t71 t14 t87 t80 t70 t9 t91 t7 t16 t80 t38 t59 t16 t16 t82 t45 t19 t45 t29 t46 t80 t76 t5 t14 t56 t52 t18 t0 t14 t14 t87 t59 t98 t11 t82 t20 t59 t93 t22 t19 t45`.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule has either a single non-terminal on the left or two non-terminals on the left, with the right-hand side being terminals or non-terminals. The grammar provided has all rules in CNF, which makes parsing a bit easier, though it might not be straightforward.\n\nThe string consists of a series of tokens starting with 't', which seems to correspond to terminal symbols. Each 't' is followed by a number. My first thought is to map these 't' tokens to the grammar's production rules and see if they can be generated.\n\nI think the approach here is to build a derivation starting from the start symbol S, applying the production rules step by step until we either reach the target string or determine it's impossible.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S. Looking at the initial productions:\n- S -> NT74 NT44\n- S -> NT11 NT24\n- S -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, S branches into three possibilities. Each of these must be expanded further until we get to the root.\n\nBut the string starts with 't20', which, looking at the grammar, seems to come from NT12: NT12 -> 't20'. Let me check the grammar. Yes, there's a rule NT12 -> 't20'. So, NT12 must come from one of the productions that generate NT12.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NT's produce NT12? Looking at the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces NT12 except NT12 itself. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I see NT12: `NT12 -> 't20'` but also, let me check if any other rule has NT12 on the left. Scanning through, I don't see any. So the only way to get NT12 is via `t20`.\n\nSo, let's think about the first step: S can produce NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. The first token is 't20', which seems to come from NT12. But NT12 isn't in any of the immediate productions from S. So that's a problem because S can't lead directly to NT12. Therefore, the first part of the string is 't20', but S can't generate 't20' as a single step unless we have a way to get NT12 from somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the productions again. The grammar is given, and S is the start symbol. Each production rule is either A -> B C or A -> a (terminal). So S can only produce two NTs. But in the string, the first token is 't20', which can only come from a production where A is producing a terminal.\n\nBut in the initial productions from S, none of them produce 't's. S's first rule is S->NT74 NT44; neither of those are terminals. So that implies that initially, S can only produce combinations of NTs, but the initial 't's are only present in the later parts of the string, which suggests that perhaps the derivation needs to go through multiple steps, producing NTs that then eventually become terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the first 't20' comes from a deeper expansion of the NTs. Let's consider that. So starting from S, we choose one of its productions, then each NT in that production can be expanded further until terminals are reached.\n\nSo the initial production could be S -> NT74 NT44. Let's take that as the first step. Then, each NT in NT74 and NT44 needs to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT74: The rule is NT74 -> NT39 NT99. Then NT39 -> NT8 NT25, and NT99 -> NT51 NT66. Let me try expanding this path.\n\nWait, let's proceed step by step. Starting with S -> NT74 NT44.\n\nExpanding NT74: NT74 -> NT39 NT99.\n\nNow expand NT39: NT39 -> NT8 NT25.\n\nThen NT8 is a terminal? Looking at the grammar, I see NT8 -> 't7', so 't7' is the terminal for NT8. NT25 -> NT28 NT7. Let's expand that.\n\nNT28 can be expanded: NT28 -> 't20' NT13.\n\nWait, but 't20' is a terminal, so that would give us 't20' from NT28's next expansion. Let's see:\n\nNT28 -> 't20' NT13. So if we choose that, we get 't20' followed by NT13.\n\nBut our string starts with 't20', so perhaps we can get there. Let's see the expansion:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25\nNT8 -> 't7'\nNT25 -> NT28 NT7\nNT28 -> 't20' NT13\nNT13 -> 't31'\n\nWait, that gives 't7' followed by 't20' and 't31', which doesn't match the string starting with 't20'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different path. Let's try another route.\n\nLet me consider the initial production S -> NT40 NT92. Let's expand that.\n\nNT40: NT40 -> NT16 NT80.\n\nNT16 -> 't71'; NT80 -> 't55'.\n\nWait, what? NT40 can be NT16 NT80, which become 't71' and NT55 (since NT80 -> 't55').\n\nSo S -> NT40 NT92 would first give 't71' and then proceed with NT92.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't20', not 't71'. So that might not be the path. Alternatively, perhaps the initial expansion is S->NT11 NT24.\n\nLet's check NT11: NT11 -> 't87'. NT24 -> 't88'.\n\nSo S->NT11 NT24 would directly produce 't87 t88', which doesn't match the string starting with 't20'. So perhaps none of the initial steps from S can directly give us 't20' as the first symbol. That suggests that maybe the first 't20' isn't directly reachable from S, meaning the entire string is not part of the language. But wait, that can't be because S can only generate two NTs, each of which may eventually lead to terminals. The string is quite long, but maybe it's possible that after several expansions, the string is built.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the string is part of a leftmost derivation. Let me try to see if after several expansions starting from S, the string can be built.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. Each production splits into non-terminals on the left, which then need to be expanded. The string is a series of terminals, so each step must eventually produce all the necessary terminals.\n\nBut starting from S, the first expansion is two non-terminals, and each of those needs to be expanded until they become terminals. So the string may be built in such a way that each terminal in the string corresponds to a path from the NTs back to S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's structure can be aligned with the productions. For example, after S->NT74 NT44, NT74 expands into NT39 NT99, and so on, until it eventually produces a terminal. Similarly for NT44.\n\nWait, but since each step involves two NTs, the entire derivation will generate a string where each internal node (non-terminals) pairs up with their expansions, but the problem is that the string has 43 tokens, which is quite long. Each application of a production adds either zero or two terminals. Wait, in CNF, each production either replaces a non-terminal with a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, starting from S, which has zero terminals, each step can increase the number of non-terminals by one (if replacing with two) or decrease by one (if replacing with a terminal). But to get a string of 43 terminals, the derivation must involve sufficient"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-958","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a trio of if-then rules where each rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right. The string starts with 't22 t98 t9 ...' and has 37 tokens. My task is to see if each 't' token can be derived from the non-terminals based on the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I'll try to map each 't' token to its corresponding non-terminal. From the grammar rules, each non-terminal (like NT49, NT39, etc.) eventually terminates into a 't' with some code. For example, NT73 becomes 't6', NT12 is 't85', and so on.\n\nI'll go through the string and note each 't' token along with its code:\n\n1. t22: Looking at the rules, NT12 is 't12' (code 12), and NT90 is 't93'. But wait, 't22' is not directly defined. Hmm, maybe I need to see which non-terminal ends with 't22'. Checking the rules, NT59 is 't6', NT25 is 't28', etc. Wait, is there a non-terminal that ends with 't22'? Looking at the grammar, I don't see a rule that directly maps to 't22'. That might be an issue.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at how the non-terminals generate the 't's. Each rule leads to a chain ending in 't's. For example, NT73 is 't6', NT17 is 't73', so NT17 -> NT73 -> 't6', which is t6. But 't22' is a different code. Maybe I need to see if any non-terminal leads to 't22'.\n\nLooking through the rules: NT12 is 't12', which is t12. NT90 is 't22' (from the rule NT90 -> 't22'). Wait, no, checking the grammar, the rule is 'NT90 -> 't22''. Yes, so NT90 is t22. So, in the string, the first token 't22' must come from NT90.\n\nNext token: t98. Looking at the grammar, NT91 -> NT64 NT90, and NT90 is 't22'. But does NT91 lead to 't98'? Let me check. NT91 has rules like 'NT91 -> NT64 NT90'; but looking further, NT91 also has 'NT91 -> 't46''. Yes, so NT91 becomes 't46'. But in the string, it's 't98', so maybe another rule. Let me check NT98. Oh, NT98 is defined as 't38' (from the rule NT98 -> 't38'). Hmm, no, that's t38, not t98.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake because in the grammar, NT98 might not be directly a terminal but a non-terminal leading to another. Wait, looking back, the grammar doesn't list NT98 as a terminal; instead, looking through the rules, each non-terminal eventually ends with a 't', so perhaps some are not listed here. Alternatively, maybe 't98' is generated by a non-terminal I'm not seeing. Alternatively, perhaps 't98' comes from NT92: checking NT92 rules, I see NT92 -> NT64 NT12, which leads to t12 (t12) and nt64 (which is 't26'?), wait, NT64 is 't26' (from NT64 -> 't26'), so NT92 would be t26 and t12? But that would make 't26 t12', not t98. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps each 't' corresponds to a non-terminal that, when expanded, ends with that 't'. So, for each 't' token in the string, I need to find a non-terminal that can generate it, perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nLet's take the first tokens step by step:\n\n1. t22: As above, NT90 \u2192 't22', so that's OK.\n\n2. t98: Now, from the grammar, looking for a non-terminal that ends with 't98'. Scanning through the rules, none directly map to t98. Wait, maybe the 't98' comes from a longer chain. Let's see:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that when expanded, one of the steps is 't98'. Alternatively, perhaps a rule like NTsomething -> something that leads to 't98'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each 't' to its corresponding NT, if possible.\n\nAnother approach is to trace back each 't' to a path in the grammar.\n\nFor example:\n\nt22 \u2192 NT90\n\nt98 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking for a NT that can produce 't98'. From the rules, I don't see a direct mapping. Wait, perhaps it's through another chain. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT directly leading to 't98'. So this might be a problem. If 't98' cannot be derived from any NT, then the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in processing the rules. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the rules are:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47  \nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25  \n... and so on.\n\nWait, but some of the NT rules are long chains ending in 't's. For instance, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and looking at the rules, NT92 is 't56' (wait, from the list at the end, NT56 \u2192 't56'). Wait, in the last part, the rules are listed with the non-terminals and their 't' codes. So, each non-terminal X is defined as a 't' followed by a number. For example, NT77 becomes 't52'?\n\nWait, actually, looking at the end:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't72'  \nWait, let me parse it. The grammar seems to be written as rules where each non-terminal is on the left, and the right side is a series of elements, some of which are 't's with numbers or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me parse the grammar correctly. Each rule is in the form S \u2192 something, where each \"something\" is a sequence of non-terminals (NT...) and\/or 't' codes.\n\nFor example, the first rule is S \u2192 NT74 NT44.\n\nSo, the approach is that each S, NT74, etc., are non-terminals, and they can be expanded into other non-terminals or 't's with numbers.\n\nEach non-terminal can produce either another non-terminal or a 't' code.\n\nSo, to find if the string can be derived, each 't' must come from some non-terminal expansion, and non-terminals must be expanded accordingly.\n\nGiven that the string starts with 't22', 't98', etc., let's try to see for each 't':\n\n1. t22: As per the rules, NT90 \u2192 't22', so that's okay. So, perhaps this 't22' comes from NT90.\n\n2. Next 't98': Now, looking at the grammar, is there a non-terminal that can produce 't98'? The rules don't have any NT directly leading to 't98'. For example, checking the end of the rules, do any NTs produce 't98'? Looking at the end:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'  \nNT90 \u2192 't22'  \nNT66 \u2192 't26'  \nNT51 \u2192 't98'  \nHTHINKING: Wait a second, looking at the very end, I see NT51 defined as 't98' (from the last line: NT51 -> 't98').\n\nYes, so NT51 becomes 't98'. So, to get 't98', we have a non-terminal NT51.\n\nSo, second token 't98' would come from NT51.\n\nNow, looking at the previous token, 't22' is from NT90. But wait, now, in the string, the third token is 't9', which is part of NT39: looking back, NT39 \u2192 't9'.\n\nWait, perhaps each token is a terminal in the string, so the entire string must be composed of a sequence of terminals, derived from applying production rules step by step.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work backward, from the string, to see if each 't' can be part of the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for production rules that can generate this string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' corresponds to a non-terminal, and I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-957","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is good because that makes parsing methods like CYK applicable, but I'm not sure if I need to use a parser here. The string is long, but I think analyzing it step by step might help.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the grammar. It starts with S, which branches into several non-terminals like NT11, NT24, NT44, etc., each of which eventually expands into terminal symbols (like 't73', 't18', etc.) or other non-terminals. The string given has a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which are the terminals. So, I need to see if these can be produced by the grammar.\n\nI notice that the grammar's production rules are all of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a terminal token. So, every step in the derivation is replacing a single non-terminal with two others, or a single terminal.\n\nLet me try to analyze the string. The string starts with 't18 t91 t11 t71 t76 t16 t72 t92 t38 ...' which is 42 tokens long. Since each production in CNF can produce two terminals, the length of the string should be equal to (n-1)*2 + 1, where n is the number of non-terminals in the derived string. Wait, actually, for CNF, each step produces two symbols, so the number of symbols is 2^k, where k is the number of productions used. But the string here is 42 tokens, which suggests log2(42) is about 6, so maybe 2^5=32, but 42 isn't a power of two. That might indicate it's not a straight derivation, or perhaps some variables are used multiple times. Hmm, I'm not sure if the length being not a power of two is a problem here, but I might need to check further.\n\nLooking at the grammar, certain terminals appear multiple times. For example, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, and NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25, which then breaks down further. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, which then breaks down into NT92 and NT85, which are further expanded.\n\nI think a good approach is to work backwards, trying to match the string to the grammar. Starting from the left, see if the first few tokens can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nThe string starts with 't18 t91 t11 t71 ...' Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't18' and 't91' and other tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT18 appears in several productions: NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT90, which becomes 't12' and 't90'. Wait, maybe not. Let's look at all the terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't70' directly, but that's just a single terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing non-terminals and terminals. Let me see all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that many non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't70'\n- NT17 \u2192 't73'\n- NT16 \u2192 't71'\n- NT69 \u2192 't93'\n- NT68 \u2192 't82'\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n- NT18 \u2192 't14' but wait, is that the case? Wait, the grammar has NT18 \u2192 't14'? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar has lines like:\n\n\"NT18 -> 't70'\", \"NT17 -> 't73'\", etc. Wait, I might be misreading. Let me go through each production.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- \"NT70 -> 't70'\" directly.\n\nWait, but in the full list, it's written as:\n\n\"NT17 -> 't73'\", \"NT16 -> 't71'\", \"NT69 -> 't93'\", \"NT68 -> 't82'\", \"NT7 -> 't74'\", \"NT18 -> 't14'\", \"NT98 -> 't40'\", \"NT93 -> 't66'\", \"NT73 -> 't6'\", etc.\n\nWait, but hold on, perhaps the non-terminals that directly produce terminals are these, and others don't. So, for example, NT18 can directly produce 't14' (but in the given grammar, is that correct? Or is it another production? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't14'?\nNo, wait, let's see the exact lines:\n\nLooking through:\n\n\"NT98 -> 't40'\", \"NT93 -> 't66'\", \"NT73 -> 't6'\", etc. Also,\n\n\"NT18 -> 't14'\", yes, that's one.\n\nSo, for example, if a non-terminal can produce 't18 t91', then we need to see if that non-terminal can split into those terminals. Wait, but in the grammar, to produce a string of two terminals, the non-terminal must split into two terminals. But looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT18 \u2192 't14', but another non-terminal might split two terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the only way a non-terminal can directly produce a string is if it itself is a terminal, or it splits into two other non-terminals which can then produce the terminals.\n\nWait, actually, a non-terminal in CNF can produce a single terminal in one production, or split into two non-terminals. So, to generate a string of 't18', a non-terminal must directly produce 't18' (if possible) or split into two non-terminals that can each produce the required parts.\n\nBut wait, looking back, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't18' or 't91'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't14' (I think)\n- NT20 \u2192 't0', 't17', etc., but I'm unsure.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n\"NT18 -> 't70'\", \"NT17 -> 't73'\", etc. Hmm, no, perhaps I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let me try to find which non-terminals directly produce each terminal in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, let's break it into individual 't's and numbers:\n\nt18, t91, t11, t71, t76, t16, t72, t92, t38, t71, t1, t17, t11, t7, t85, t9, t6, t93, t52, t5, t73, t56, t43, t85, t8, t31, t6, t18, t20, t93, t6, t59, t80, t9, t22, t11, t9, t14, t8, t46, t59, t87, t55, t56, t1, m56, m16, m14, m46, m38.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me see if any of the given non-terminals produce these specific terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT18 \u2192 't14' (but I don't see 't14', or perhaps I'm looking at the wrong production. Alternatively, maybe the non-terminals can split into multiple non-terminals that eventually produce these.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to approach this by checking if each terminal in the string can be generated by some non-terminal, and ensure the structure follows the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nWait, to avoid confusion, perhaps I should consider each token and see where they can originate from.\n\nBut considering the string length, and that each production in CNF can only add one non-terminal each step, the length check might indicate feasibility.\n\nWait, for a string of length n, the number of symbols must be 2^k, where k is the number of productions used. Since the string here is 42 tokens, which is 2*21, so if 21 is 2^4 (since 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64), 21 is not a power of two, but perhaps the grammar allows for a mix, though I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can't be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check each line:\n\nLooking at each production that ends with a terminal string.\n\nWait, only the ones where the right-hand side is a single terminal:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't85'\n- NT69 \u2192 't93'\n- NT68 \u2192 't82'\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'\n- NT90 \u2192 't22'\n- NT18 \u2192 't14'\n- NT93 \u2192 't88' \u2192 Oh, wait! NT93 \u2192 't88', which is the last part of the string.\n\nBut wait, the string is \"t87 t88\". So \"t88\" is produced by NT93. But where is \"t87\" coming from?\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces \"t87\" in a single production. So maybe \"t87\" has to come from a chain of productions.\n\nLet me see if any non-terminal can produce \"t87\" by first producing a non-terminal that eventually leads to \"t87\".\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, perhaps there's a non-terminal that can produce \"t87\" via a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"t87\" comes from a chain where a non-terminal A \u2192 B t87, but I don't see that.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions again, I don't see any that result in 't87' directly or through a chain. For example, maybe a non-terminal that goes to 't87' by going through other terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check what produces NT92, since in some rules NT92 goes to 't52', but that's not helpful for 't87'.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me check the production NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85. And then, looking at NT92 \u2192 't52', which isn't helpful. But if we have more productions, maybe through another path.\n\nWait, perhaps another route: Let's see, NT93 \u2192 't88', which is part of our string. So the second word is \"t88\", which is from NT93. So the first word is \"t87\".\n\nNow, looking for how to get \"t87\". Let me see if any non-terminal A can derive 't87' when we apply the productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nLooking for NT9, which is 't46'. Not helpful.\n\nLooking for NT14? Wait, does any NT have \"t87\" in its right-hand side?\n\nLooking through all productions again, I don't see any that produce 't87' directly. So maybe it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"t87\" is in the right-hand side of some production. Let me check each production's right-hand side:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- Then each of these NTs are defined further down.\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT44 \u2192 NT27 NT something? Wait, the production is NT44 \u2192 NT99, as per line nt44: NT44 -> NT98. Wait, no, line 66 says NT44\u2192NT98. Oh, no, looking back, the line says NT44 \u2192 NT98.\n\nWait, actually, let me recheck some lines because this could be time-consuming.\n\nLooking at line 66: NT44 \u2192 NT98\n\nLine 67: NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT13\n\nWait, more specifically, I'm looking for any production that is exactly 't87' on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see any with just \"t87\" on the RHS. So if that's the case, then \"t87\" is not a terminal that can be produced directly. So we can't have a string that includes \"t87\" unless it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, all terminal symbols are single characters, so for \"t87\", the first token would have to be a production that results in \"t87\". Since I don't see such a production, that would mean \"t87\" cannot be in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way to get \"t87\" via a longer derivation. For instance, maybe a series of substitutions that eventually result in \"t87\".\n\nBut considering the grammar, the only way to produce a terminal string is through chains ending in terminals. If none of the non-terminals directly produce \"t87\", but \"t87\" is not even present as a terminal in any production, then \"t87\" cannot be part of any string derived from this grammar.\n\nWait, let me cross-check that. The list at the end of the grammar gives the terminals as:\n\nt87, t88, t7, t12, t16, t18, t19, t20, etc.\n\nSo \"t87\" is a terminal but is it present as a terminal in any production?\n\nLooking through all the productions, the only terminals are those in the last list of the grammar. So \"t87\" is there, but I need to see if any production ends with \"t87\" or reaches it.\n\nWait, the last part lists all the terminals as strings. So for example, NT73 \u2192 't6', which means that the production NT73 becomes the terminal string '6', because in the grammar, the non-terminal NT73 is replaced directly by 't6'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar given, do any non-terminals produce 't87'?\n\nLooking carefully at the grammar rules, perhaps I missed one.\n\nLooking through all the productions again from the start:\n\nThe first part defines various NTs, and then in the end, each NT pointing to a terminal.\n\nWait, let's check if any non-terminal directly produces 't87'. Scanning through each production:\n\nLooking for any RHS that is exactly 't87'. Let me check the end list:\n\nWait, the end of the grammar has a list"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means that each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly one non-terminal or a terminal on the right. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems all the rules follow this structure, so that's good.\n\nNow, the string given is \"t71 t55 t93\". I notice that each of these tokens is either a terminal or must be derived from a production rule. Since it's a string, I need to see if each \"t\" part can be generated by the grammar, and then check the structure of how these \"t\" parts fit together.\n\nLet me list the \"t\" parts: t71, t55, t93. My goal is to see if each of these can come from the starting symbol S through some series of productions.\n\nStarting with the grammar, the S rule is:\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo S branches into three possibilities.

{"custom_id":"request-21","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t71 t55 t52\" can be generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The rules provided are a bit lengthy, but I notice that the initial productions of S are:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce these combinations ofNT terms. Each NT rule then further breaks down into other NT or terminal symbols. The terminating symbols (non NT) are t followed by a number, except for a few that are t followed by a different number. Wait, looking more closely, I see for example \"NT73 -> 't6'\" and others. So, the NT rules eventually lead to terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers. But I'm not sure if all NT rules end with t symbols. I should probably list all the NT rules and their terminals to see.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, each ultimately leads to a 'tX' where X is a number. For example:\n\nNT73 -> 't6'\nNT17 -> 't73'\nNT16 -> 't71'\nNT69 -> 't93'\nNT68 -> 't82'\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT1-> 't70'\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the entire string generated will consist of tX tokens where X is some number between 1 and 99, I suppose, except for some like 't73' which map to specific numbers. Wait, how does that mapping work? Each 'tX' represents a terminal symbol where X is a two-digit number, or maybe single digit? For instance, t73 is one symbol, t74 another, etc.\n\nBut the string we have is \"t71 t55 t52\". So, each 't' is followed by two digits. Let me confirm the NT rules:\n\nLooking under NT16 -> 't71' \u2014 that's one of the NT rules. So, when we have NT16, it expands to 't71'. Similarly, NT55 -> 't55' \u2014 no, wait, looking at the rules, I see \"NT55 -> 't47'\". Hmm, no. Wait, no. Let me check the provided rules again.\n\nWait, the user provided the NT rules, but they are a bit spread out. Let me list the relevant ones for terminals:\n\nLooking through the provided NT rules, I see:\n\nNT73 -> 't6'\nNT17 -> 't73'\nNT16 -> 't71'\nNT69 -> 't93'\nNT68 -> 't82'\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT1-> 't70'\nNT24 -> 't88'\nNT28 -> 't26'\nNT59-> 't6'\nNT47-> 't72'\nNT92 -> 't93'\nNT61-> 't39'\nWait, this seems a bit inconsistent. For example, some NT rules end with 't6', others with 't18', etc. So, each NT rule, when expanded, gives a specific 'tX'. So, to get \"t71\", we need to find which NT rule produces 't71'.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see \"NT16 -> 't71'\", so NT16 expands to 't71'. Similarly, 't55' must come from some NT rule. Wait, looking through the rules, I see \"NT59 -> 't6'\". Wait, no, that's under 'NT59'. Alternatively, maybe 't55' is from another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the 'tX' rules:\n\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT17 -> 't73'\n- NT50-> 't59' \u2014 because 'NT50 -> NT18 NT85', and looking at NT18, it's 't17' and NT85 is 't61'? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps some 't's are produced directly from NT rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a mapping from each terminal 'tX' to their source NT. For example:\n\n- t71: comes from NT16\n- t73: from NT17\n- t74: from NT7\n- t6: from NT73\n- t47: from NT55? Wait, no, looking at NT55 -> 't47'? No, looking back: I see \"NT55 -> NT47 NT65\". So that doesn't produce a terminal; it breaks down further. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse through each rule and see which ones end in a 'tX' symbol.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT17 -> 't73'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT1-> 't70'\n- NT24 -> 't88'\n- NT28 -> 't26'\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- NT47 -> 't72'\n- NT92 -> 't93'\n- NT61 -> 't39'\n- NT2 -> 't28' and 't13'?\n\nWait, perhaps some rules directly produce 't's, like \"NT25 -> NT28 NT7\" \u2014 no, that's still non-terminal. So, perhaps the NT rules that have a final expansion into a 'tX' are those that end directly in a t symbol. For example, NT55 -> 't47'? No, wait, I see \"NT55 -> NT47 NT65\", so it doesn't produce a t. Similarly, \"NT40 -> NT44 NT98\" \u2014 non-terminal, so it won't produce t.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to parse the rules again:\n\nLooking through all the provided NT rules, any that end with 'tX' where X is a number. For example:\n\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT17 -> 't73'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT1-> 't70'\n\nAlso, \"NT50 -> NT18 NT85\" \u2014 so NT18 is 't17' and NT85 is 't61'? Wait, let me check the rules for NT18 and NT85.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT18 -> 't17' or something else? Wait, \"NT18 -> NT95 NT33\" \u2014 non-terminal, so perhaps it expands further. So, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, are there any other rules that end in 't'? For example:\n\n- NT92 -> 't93' \u2014 so NT92 -> 't93'\n\n- NT93 -> 't80'\n\nBut wait, NT93 has two productions: \"NT93 -> 't80'\" and \"NT93 -> 't80'\". Wait, looking back, no, that's under NT51. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the string \"t71 t55 t52\" requires each of these t's to be the result of NT rules. So:\n\nt71 comes from NT16.\n\nt55 comes from... Hmm, wait, looking for a rule where NTx -> 't55'. Looking through all rules, I don't see any NTx that directly maps to 't55'. For example, \"NT55\" is defined as NT47 NT65 \u2014 two non-terminals, so it doesn't expand to a single t symbol. Similarly, \"NT5\" is defined as 't5' \u2014 so that's a direct expansion.\n\nWait, looking at the list again, I see \"NT5 -> 't5'\". That must be the case. So, NT5 directly produces 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't55', I see somewhere, for example, \"NT55 -> NT47 NT65\", so it takes two NTs. Neither of those produce 't55' directly. So, wait, I'm not seeing any NT rule that directly expands to 't55'. So, perhaps 't55' cannot be generated by this grammar, meaning the entire string cannot be generated. But wait, the provided string is \"t71 t55 t52\", so the first character is 't71', the second is 't55', and the third is 't52'.\n\nWait, wait, 't55' isn't appearing anywhere as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-38","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best to figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side, except the starting symbol which can have a terminal. The starting symbol here is S, and according to the rules, S can produce four different combinations of NT and another NT. So, S can generate strings composed of two NT symbols, which then might expand into more symbols until terminals are reached.\n\nThe string we need to test is `t71 t73 t56 t93`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My job is to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first step is usually to note what each NT symbol expands into. Since the grammar is large, I'll focus on whether each terminal in the string can be derived from the NTs in the grammar. Also, I should make sure that the entire string can be generated through some series of productions.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual terminals: t71, t73, t56, t93.\n\nI'll start by mapping each terminal back to its possible NT sources. If an NT can directly produce a terminal, then that's an indication that it's part of the derivation tree.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- t71 is generated by NT16.\n- t73 is generated by NT7.\n- t56 is generated by NT11.\n- t93 is generated by NT57.\n\nSo, the string can be represented as NT16 \u2192 t71, NT7 \u2192 t73, NT11 \u2192 t56, NT57 \u2192 t93. So, each symbol in the string corresponds to a NT production.\n\nWait, but the starting symbol S produces combinations of two NTs. So, the string is four symbols long, which means there must be a series of productions that start from S, then each step adds two more symbols until we reach the four-terminals. Let me see how that could work.\n\nEach production from S is a combination of two NTs. So, for example, S \u2192 NT49 NT99. But those NTs can then further expand.\n\nBut let's consider that each terminal in the string corresponds to a specific NT. So the string t71 t73 t56 t93 would correspond to some sequence of NTs generating t71, followed by another pair to get t73, then another pair for t56, and another for t93. But that might not make sense because each production from S gives two NTs, and each NT can only expand once or multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is constructed from expanding S to two NTs, each of which then expands, potentially leading to four terminals.\n\nLet me see: S \u2192 NT16 NT11. Then NT16 \u2192 t71 and NT11 \u2192 t56. That gives me t71 t56, which is only two terminals, so that's not the string we're looking at.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT7 NT93. Then NT7 \u2192 t73 and NT93 \u2192 t57. But t57 is generated by NT57 \u2192 t18. So that would give t73 t18, but our string is four terminals, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built by multiple expansions. Let me think about how a longer string can be formed. Since S produces two NTs, and each of those can produce more NTs, but in this grammar, each NT seems to only produce one terminal, except some NTs produce two NTs.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, for example, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85. So, to get more symbols, NT77 would expand into two NTs. Similarly, NT57 can produce NT85 and NT56, which themselves might expand further.\n\nSo perhaps the string is built by expanding one NT into two, and then those into more, etc. Let me try to see if each of these terminals can be reached.\n\nt71 is from NT16, so NT16 must be an important part of the derivation.\n\nt73 is from NT7.\n\nt56 is from NT11.\n\nt93 is from NT57.\n\nSo, the NTs involved are NT16 (t71), NT7 (t73), NT56 (t56), and NT57 (t93).\n\nWait, so the string is t71 t73 t56 t93, which would correspond to NT16 \u2192 t71, NT7 \u2192 t73, NT56 \u2192 t56, NT57 \u2192 t93.\n\nBut NT56 is actually NT9 (since looking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 t5). Wait, wait, no. Looking again, the grammar for NT9 is in the list. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 \"t5\" \u2014 so correct, t5 is from NT9.\n\nBut in the string, we have t56, which is a single terminal. Looking back at the grammar, what NT produces t56?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40.\n\nHmm, that's a two-step, meaning NT56 expands into two NTs, which then each expand to other NTs until they become terminals.\n\nWait a second, but the string is `t93 t56 t56 t93`? No, the string is `t71 t73 t56 t93`.\n\nWait, in the string, it's t71 (NT16), t73 (NT7), t56 (which is NT11?), and t93 (NT57). Wait no, earlier I thought t56 is from NT11, but looking again:\n\nWait the string is `t71 t73 t56 t93`. So:\n\nt71: NT16 \u2192 t71.\n\nt73: NT7 \u2192 t73.\n\nt56: NT11 \u2192 t56? Wait, looking at the grammar, does NT11 produce t56?\n\nWait no, let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT with a production that includes 't56':\n\nIn the rule list, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT24 NT92 (from the initial part), but also further down:\n\nNT11: Let me scan through all the rules, but it's long. Wait, looking at the grammar, does NT11 have a production to t56? Or is it another NT.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules:\n\n- There's a rule NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57\n\n- NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n\n- So, NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56. So, NT56 is itself an NT.\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40.\n\n- So, starting from NT56: 56 \u2192 92 40.\n\n- NT92 \u2192 t52?\n\nWait, looking for NT92: the rules are:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 t52 (from rule 92: NT92 \u2192 t52)\n\nAnd looking at rule 76:76 \u2192 t74\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused. Let me map what each NT produces.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as a series of productions. Each line is \"NTx \u2192 NTy NTz\", except for the terminals, which end with 't' and a number, like 't71'.\n\nSo, each production with numbers is a terminal, and each with 'NT' is a non-terminal.\n\nSo, for all the rules, let's list all NTs and their productions.\n\nLet's parse the grammar:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-52","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t22 t70 t98 t92 t56\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding what the grammar is doing and how I can derive the string step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it has multiple production rules starting from S. The initial productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce three different combinations involving NT and terminal symbols. My string starts with t22, which I notice isn't among the initial productions. Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see that some NT symbols have productions that lead into terminals. For example, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and then NT92 can go to 't52', and NT85 can go to 't64' and NT64 leads to 't26', etc. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right path.\n\nLet me list out what each NT leads to in terms of terminals. From the rules provided:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\nNT8 NT25 leads to NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT98 and NT25 also \u2192 other rules, but looking for terminals. Oh, wait, NT25 may produce t8 because I see NT25 \u2192 't8' somewhere? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n- NT8 looks like it might be 't7' because in the rules, NT87 \u2192 't73' (not exactly). Wait, no, NT8: I don't see NT8 directly, but in the rules, NT35 \u2192 NT88 NT53, and NT88 \u2192 't69' and NT35 leads to other NTs. This is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I should list all the NT symbols and their possible paths to terminals.\n\nLet me go step by step for each part of the string.\n\n1. The first part of the string is 't22'. Looking at the grammar rules, I don't see NT9 resulting in 't22' directly. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT91 \u2192 't22' because NT91 has a production that leads to 't22'. So 't22' comes from NT91.\n\n2. Next is 't70'. Let's see where 't70' comes from. Looking at the rules, NT90 \u2192 't22', and NT12 \u2192 't1', NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT90. So 't70' comes from NT70, which splits into NT12 and NT90.\n\n3. Then 't98'. That could come from NT98 which directly turns into 't98' because I see NT98 \u2192 't98'. Alternatively, NT8 can go somewhere, but I don't think that's the case.\n\n4. Next is 't92'. Looking at the grammar, NT92 can come from NT74 \u2192 ... \u2192 't92' or other routes. Let me check. S can go to NT40 NT92, which would lead to 't92' if NT40 leads to that. Wait, NT92 has a production NT92 \u2192 NT52 which is 't52', but that doesn't help here. Alternatively, in S\u2192NT40 NT92, NT40 \u2192 't44'? No, I don't see. Wait, NT40 might lead to 't44'.\n\n5. Finally, 't56' comes from NT56, which is produced by NT56 \u2192 't56' directly or through other paths. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the NTs. Let me take each part one by one.\n\nStart with 't22'. From the rules, NT91 \u2192 't91' and also a production that leads to 't22' because NT91 can split into NT67 and NT85. Checking rules, indeed, NT16 \u2192 't71', but that's not relevant here. Wait, looking at the rules: NT17 \u2192 't73', NT12 \u2192 't85', NT77 \u2192 't92', NT91 \u2192 't22' because in the rule NT91 \u2192 NT64 NT90, and NT64 \u2192 't26' but that's not right. Alternatively, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck: looking at the rules, I see NT91 \u2192 NT64 NT90. Then NT64 \u2192 't26' and NT90 \u2192 't22' (based on earlier). So 't22' is produced by NT91 \u2192 't91' leading to 't64' and 't90', and then 't64' leads to 't26', and 't90' leads to 't22'. Wait, that's possible. So 't22' comes from NT91, which leads to 't22'.\n\nSo 't22' is from NT91.\n\nNext is 't70'. Looking at the rules: NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT90. So 't70' is produced by NT70, which splits into NT12 and NT90. So 't70' is a combination of NT12 and NT90. Now, NT12 can go to 't85' directly because in the rules, NT12 \u2192 't85'. Wait, no: checking NT12 rules, NT12 has multiple productions, like NT12 \u2192 't85' because in the rules, NT12 \u2192 't85'. Yes, under NT12: one of the rules is NT12 \u2192 't85'. So 't70' would be 't85' (from NT12) followed by 't90' (from NT90). But wait, the string is 't70' which is a single symbol, so this approach is wrong. Wait, no\u2014each NT can split into two parts, so 't70' as a single unit must come from a production where a single NT produces a terminal, not two NTs. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again, the string is 't22 t70 t98 t92 t56'. Each is a single terminal, so each must come from an NT that directly produces that terminal. So each 't' in the string must be the result of a single NT's production to a terminal.\n\nLet's re-examine the grammar:\n\nFrom the grammar, I can see NT40's production leads to 't44' because I see NT56 \u2192 't56', but I'm confused. Wait, let me list all NTs and their direct terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't74'?\nWait, in the rules, NT47 \u2192 't71', NT57 \u2192 't72', etc. Wait, let's go line by line through all rules to find which NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules provided, I should look for lines where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't74' (as in NT74 \u2192 't74')\n- NT40 \u2192 't71' (if there's a rule like NT40 \u2192 't71'), but I don't see that. Wait, looking for 't's in the RHS.\n\nWait, looking at each rule:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT74 NT44 (both NTs)\nLine 2: S \u2192 NT11 NT24\nLine3: S \u2192 NT40 NT92\nLine4: NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47\nLine5: NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\nLine6: NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\nLine7: NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\nLine8: NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\nLine9: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nLine10: NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\nLine11: NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\nLine12: NT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12\nLine13: NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\nLine14: NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65\nLine15: NT76 \u2192 NT2 NT68\nLine16: NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT99 (duplicate of line8)\nLine17: NT38 \u2192 NT13 NT98\nLine18: NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13\nLine19: NT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25\nLine20: NT12 \u2192 NT93 NT70"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string in question is `t22 t70 t98 t46 t56`, and the grammar has several production rules that I need to analyze.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have production rules of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal symbol. Some rules might also have the form A \u2192 B, but in this case, looking at the given grammar, I see that all the left-hand sides are non-terminals, and some of their right-hand sides seem to involve terminals and non-terminals. Wait, actually, the initial productions are all S \u2192 NT... But looking closer, most of the NT productions are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTyz, except for some that directly produce terminals, like NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, but then there are others that connect NTs with terminals.\n\nWait, no, on second look, I think the NT... symbols eventually derive into terminals.

The grammar is provided along with the string to evaluate, which is `t7 t26 t74 t98 t46 t56`. My task is to figure out whether this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that in a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. This structure helps because it simplifies the parsing and can be checked using algorithms like the CYK algorithm or by building derivation trees.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that almost all the rules are of the form NT followed by two other NTs or an NT and a terminal. For example, `NT49 -> NT0 NT47` and `NT7->t74`. So, most productions expand into non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nThe string to check is `t7 t26 t74 t98 t46 t56`. I'll start by trying to parse this string from the beginning, looking for the longest possible match from the grammar rules, which is typical in a top-down parsing approach.\n\nLet's break down the string into tokens: t7, t26, t74, t98, t46, t56.\n\nI'll start with the entire string: `t7 t26 t74 t98 t46 t56`.\n\nStep 1: The first symbol is `t7`. Looking at the grammar, `NT7 \u2192 t74` isn't helpful because it starts with `t74`. Wait, but I have `t7` in the string. Let me check the grammar rules for NT7. In the provided grammar, I see `NT7 -> t74`. There's also `NT70 -> t82`, `NT74 -> t56`, and others. Hmm, but I don't see any rule that produces `t7`. Wait, in the initial grammar, I think I might have missed some rules. Let me double-check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- `NT7->t74`\n- `NT74->NT39 NT99`\n- `NT49->NT0 NT47`\n- `NT39->NT8 NT25`\n- `NT0->NT77 NT34`\n- And others.\n\nWait, so there's no production for NT7 that gives `t7`. That's a problem because the string starts with `t7`. So, if the grammar doesn't have any rule for NT7 that produces `t7`, then the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe some other non-terminal resolves to `t7`. Let me check.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- `NT24 -> 't24'? Wait, no, looking at the rules, `NT12->t1` and `NT24->t88`. But does any non-terminal directly produce `t7`?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- `NT7 -> t74`\n- Other NTs like NT12 produce t1 or t85, NT24->t88, NT70->t82, NT40->t55, NT57->t72, etc. I don't see any rule that produces `t7`.\n\nSo, the first token is `t7`, but the grammar doesn't have any production from any NT to `t7`. That suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar, which would answer 'No', but I need to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, perhaps a NT further down the parse tree produces `t7` through a chain. Let's see: for example, NT49->NT0 NT47, and NT0->NT77 NT34, and NT77->NT92 NT85, and so on. Maybe some combination of these could eventually lead to a `t74` or something else, but can any of these end up producing `t7`?\n\nLooking at all the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces `t7`. So, if the first token is `t7`, it's impossible to derive it from any NT in the grammar. Therefore, the entire string can't be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with `t7`, but the grammar does not have any non-terminal that produces `t7`.

So, the strings generated by S will start with NT74, NT11, or NT40, followed by another NT... each of which would produce more symbols until we reach the 't' symbols.\n\nLet me consider each possible top-level rule and see if the string can be derived from any of them.\n\nFirst, starting with S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Then, NT74 is a production that goes to NT39 NT99. From NT39, we can go to NT8 NT25 or other options. Let's see:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\n\nNow, NT39 can split into NT8 NT25:\n\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25\n\nThen, NT8 could go to NT7 NT49, according to the grammar:\n\nNT8 -> NT7 NT49\n\nNT7 is a terminal 't74', as per the rules:\n\nNT7 -> NT49 NT73\n\nAnd NT49 can go to NT0 NT47, but let's see how this will build up.\n\nWait, this might get too complicated. Maybe I should instead look at the string and see if it can be broken into components that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t56 t71 t55 t93 t71 t55 t52.\n\nLet's check the first few symbols. The string starts with t56. Looking at the terminal rules, I see NT55 \u2192 t59, but wait, t55 is directly produced by NT55. Wait, actually, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at the terminal symbols, there are direct productions like:\n\nNT55 \u2192 t47\n\nWait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the terminal symbols are assigned to some NT productions. For example:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t77 NT34\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit complex, so perhaps I should create a map of each non-terminal to its possible terminals and other non-terminals. That might help.\n\nLet me list each production and see what terminals they can produce:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t74\n\nNT12 \u2192 t85 (twice)\n\nNT16 \u2192 t71\n\nNT18 \u2192 t14, t76, t91, t19, t20, t0, t17, t69, t73, t12, t39, t98, t18 (twice)\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for instance:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT70 NT25 (from the main rules), but also in a more detailed list, there are productions like NT18 \u2192 t14, t76, t91, t19, t20, t0, etc. Hmm, perhaps I need to parse each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to consider the breakdown of the string step by step, trying to match each terminal from left to right, ensuring that each symbol is produced by some rule.\n\nThe string is: t56, t71, t55, t93, t71, t55, t52.\n\nLet's start with t56. Looking at the grammar, which NT production produces t56?\n\nLooking through the end rules:\n\nLooking for 't56' in the string:\n\nNT53 \u2192 t43 (not 56)\n\nNT12 \u2192 t1 or t85\n\nNT69 \u2192 t93\n\nWait, I think in the provided grammar, some non-terminals directly correspond to terminals. For example, NT55 \u2192 t59 (looking at the last lines):\n\nLooking through all the terminal mappings:\n\nYes, several NTs directly produce 't' followed by some number:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT55 \u2192 t59\n\nNT53 \u2192 t43\n\nWait, but I'm looking for t56. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the end rules:\n\nLooking down the list, I see:\n\nNT55 \u2192 t47\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me parse each rule's terminal output.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nI see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t46\n\nNT13 \u2192 t31\n\nNT57 \u2192 t18\n\nNT53 \u2192 t45\n\nNT70 \u2192 t82\n\nNT68 \u2192 t82 (twice)\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the terminals and their sources.\n\nWait, let me go through each production and note when a non-terminal (NT) produces a terminal.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73 (output terminals are none)\n- NT12 \u2192 t85\n- NT16 \u2192 t71\n- NT18 \u2192 t14\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- NT28 \u2192 t20\n- NT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25\n- NT40 \u2192 NT44 (twice)\nWait, no, the grammar has S \u2192 NT40 NT92 etc. So, the NT40 appears in multiple productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

{"custom_id":"request-94","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t22 t70 t73 t18 t14 t46 t56`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF looks like. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that B and C can be terminals as well. Also, the start symbol should only produce non-terminals in the first step. I should check if the given grammar fits this structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the productions seem to be of the form NT... \u2192 NT... NT... or NT... \u2192 terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which fits CNF because both sides are non-terminals. Then there are productions like NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and some NT rules that directly produce terminals like NT73 -> 't6'. So this grammar is indeed in CNF because each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string `t22 t70 t73 t18 t14 t46 t56` to see if it can be derived from the grammar. Parsing in CNF is done by working from the top of the grammar (starting with the start symbol S) and replacing non-terminals with terminals or other non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step, keeping track of possible derivations.\n\n1. **Identify Non-Terminals and Terminals:**\n   The string consists of terminal symbols. So, I need to see if each terminal can be derived from the grammar.\n\n2. **Looking at the Start Symbol S:**\n   The start symbol is S. From the grammar, S can produce:\n   - S -> NT74 NT44\n   - S -> NT11 NT24\n   - S -> NT40 NT92\n\n   So, the initial step is to choose one of these productions.\n\n3. **Choosing a Path:**\n   Let's take each possibility:\n\n   **Option 1: S \u2192 NT74 NT44**\n   Now, the string starts with `t22 t70...` which doesn't immediately correspond to NT74 or NT44.\n\n   Wait a minute, maybe this path won't lead to the string. Let me check what NT74 and NT44 can produce.\n\n   From the grammar:\n   - NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n   - NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\n   - NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59\n   - NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50\n   - NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\n   - NT17 \u2192 NT19 NT57\n   - Wait, NT17 \u2192 't73'? No, looking back, NT17 is actually a terminal. Because in the grammar, NT17 -> 't73'. Wait, no: looking at the rules, NT17 -> 't73', NT73 -> 't6', etc. Let me confirm:\n\n   Looking through the grammar:\n   - NT73 -> 't6', which is a terminal?\n   Wait, checking the grammar:\n   Oh, I see some rules like NT17 -> 't73', but that can't be right because NT17 is a non-terminal. Wait, maybe I misread.\n\n   Let me look again. For example, there's a rule NT17 -> 't73', but 't73' is a string, which is a terminal in this context. So, that's allowed because in CNF, terminals can be on the RHS.\n\n   So, NT17 \u2192 't73', which is a single terminal. So, NT17 is a non-terminal that directly produces a terminal string 't73'. Similarly, other NTs might produce terminals or other NTs.\n\n   So in Option 1, S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which then needs to derive the string starting with 't22 t70...'.\n\n   NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n   NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n   NT8 is a terminal 't7' (from NT8 \u2192 't7'), and NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7.\n\n   Wait, but the string starts with 't22 t70 t73 t18...'. 't22' isn't a terminal I immediately recognize. Let me see if 't22' is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where an NT directly produces 't22'. So 't22' may be produced by an NT that eventually leads to 't22'.\n\n   Let me look for NTs that produce 't22':\n   Scanning the grammar rules, I don't see a direct production for 't22'. Wait, looking in the 'r' section for NTs ending with 't22' isn't there. Hmm, maybe there's no NT that directly produces 't22'. That suggests that if the path goes through S \u2192 NT74, the first token would need to come from NT74, which would need to produce 't22' through some chain.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe another S production is better. Let's try the other S productions.\n\n   **Option 2: S \u2192 NT11 NT24**\n   NT11 \u2192 NT87 NT25\n   NT87: let me see if I have a grammar rule for NT87. From the list, there is NT87 -> NT66 NT64. Then NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1, and NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65. Wait, this seems to go on. Let me check if 't22' comes from here.\n\n   NT11 \u2192 NT87 NT25\n   NT87 \u2192 NT66 NT64\n   NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1\n   NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65\n   NT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61\n   Wait, that's recursive and might loop. Perhaps this path won't reach 't22'.\n\n   **Option 3: S \u2192 NT40 NT92**\n   NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\n   NT16 \u2192 NT71 NT12\n   NT71's rule isn't listed, so maybe looking for NT16: The rules under NT16 seem to be NT16 \u2192 't71' (or wait, NT16 \u2192 't71' because in the grammar, NT16 \u2192 't71'. Let's check: yes, looking at the grammar, NT16 \u2192 't71', which is a terminal. So NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80, and NT16 is a terminal 't71', but our string starts with 't22', which is not 't71'. So maybe this path won't work because the first token would be 't71' from NT40's rule, but our string starts with 't22'.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps NT92 is the one that produces 't22'? Let me check.\n\n   NT92 has a rule NT92 \u2192 NT64 NT12, among others. Then NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13, and NT65 has multiple rules. Let me check NT92's rules:\n\n   NT92 \u2192 NT64 NT12\n   NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13\n   NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\n   NT17 \u2192 't73', so that starts with t73. Not helpful. Alternatively, NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19, and NT17 \u2192 't73', so that branch is 't73'. Not matching 't22'.\n\n   So S \u2192 NT40 NT92 would not start with 't22' either because NT40 produces 't71' as the first part. So maybe the correct S production is S \u2192 NT74 NT44, but that didn't seem to get us to 't22' right away.\n\n   Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I need to build the derivation tree step by step.\n\n   Another approach is to work backwards from the string. Let's see what the string ends with. The last token is 't56'. Looking at the grammar for NT that produce 't56', I see NT44 \u2192 NT98 NT56 and NT56 \u2192 't56' through NT56 \u2192 't56'? Wait, actually, the rules have NT92 \u2192 NT85 NT44, and others. Wait, perhaps I need to look for a non-terminal that can directly produce 't56'.\n\n   Looking through the NTs, there is NT56 \u2192 't56' (I think I see a line saying NT56 -> 't56'), yes, so NT56 is a terminal.

The string is a sequence of terminals, so each word must be produced by a production that can result in that terminal. Let me list the terminals in the string:\n\nt7, t20, t74, t73, t18, t19, t46, t56.\n\nLooking at each terminal:\n\n1. t7: Which non-terminals produce 't7'? Looking through the rules, I don't see any production for t7 except maybe a rule that's not listed. Wait, checking all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't7'. Did I miss one? Let me go through the rules again. \n\nWait, the grammar also has NT7 -> 't74' and other NTs that become specific terminals. But for t7, I don't see any NT which directly produces it. So maybe the string can't be generated because t7 isn't present anywhere in the grammar as a terminal.\n\nWait, double-checking the grammar: I don't see any production where a non-terminal becomes 't7'. Let me scan the entire list of productions. \n\nLooking through each line, I see NT9 -> 't5', NT90->'t22', NT12->'t16', etc. Hmm, but no NT produces 't7'. So that's a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the first rule: S -> NT74 NT44. NT74 can produce 't74', which is the fourth word in the string. So that's okay. \n\nBut what about t7? It's the first word. None of the NTs in the grammar produce t7 except maybe if some non-terminal leads to t7. Maybe it's possible through a chain. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT73 -> 't6' and NT7 -> something else. Wait, is there a non-terminal that can produce t7? Looking at the grammar, there's an NT7 rule? Wait, scanning again: NT7 appears as 'NT74' and 'NT73', but not as a non-terminal on the left side producing a terminal t7. So, no NT directly produces t7.\n\nTherefore, the first word in the string is t7, which can't be generated by any production in the grammar. That would mean the entire string is not in the language of this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NT73 rule. Let me check if any non-terminal can eventually produce t7. For example, is there a chain that goes from some NT to t7?\n\nLooking through the rules, let's see:\n\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\nNT92 -> 't56'\nSo NT92 produces t56, which is the last word in the string. That's okay.\n\nWait, but looking at the string: the first word is t7. Since no NT in the grammar produces t7, the string cannot be generated. So the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-110","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. First, I need to understand how the grammar works and how to derive this string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with the start symbol S, which can produce different combinations of two non-terminals. The production rules for S are:\n\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from one of these. The provided string is `t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76`. Since the entire string is a sequence of terminals, but the grammar only has S starting with NT symbols, I think the idea is to have all NT symbols expand into a single terminal step by step through leftmost derivations.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts that may match the NT productions. The string is of length 8, so S must be expanded in a way that each step adds a terminal. Since each production rule for S emits two NTs, the derivation will require multiple steps.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the grammar. Each NT symbol on the left side of a production must first expand into the right side, which is a combination of two NTs. So, the derivation will involve breaking down each NT into smaller parts until the terminals are reached.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t26`. From the grammar, I can check where `t26` appears. Scanning through the right-hand sides of the productions, I notice in NT26 -> NT65 NT50. But that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, looking at the mappings: NT26 -> t26 is mentioned.\n\nWait, in the list of NT productions, under NT26, it's written as NT26 -> NT65 NT50. That might mean that to get t26, we have to go through NT26 -> t26 directly, but in the production list, I see that NT26's right-hand side is NT65 NT50. Hmm, but in the mappings, under NT26: 't26'. That seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT26: the production is NT26 -> NT65 NT50. But in the mappings, the line says `NT26 -> 't26'` which is the terminal. So that's a bit confusing. I think the grammar actually uses the right-hand sides to produce non-terminals, except for the specific lines where it's mapped to a terminal. So perhaps I should use the right-hand sides to build the string step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building the entire expansion tree. Starting with S, which can be any of the three productions.\n\nLet me try using the first production: S -> NT74 NT44.\n\nSo, NT74 and NT44. Looking at the NT74 production: NT74 -> NT39 NT99. And NT44 is not a production; wait, looking back, I see under NT44: the production is NT44 -> NT98, because in the mappings under NT44: 't98'. So, S -> NT74 NT44 would become NT74 -> NT39 NT99 and NT44 -> t98.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the productions are structured so that each NT on the left can be replaced by the right-hand side. So, for S -> NT74 NT44, both NT74 and NT44 would expand. So let's see:\n\nNT74 expands to NT39 NT99, and NT44 is a terminal (since under NT44: 't98'), so substituting back, we have:\n\nNT74 => NT39 NT99\nNT44 => t98\n\nSo, S -> NT74 NT44 becomes NT39 NT99 t98.\n\nNow, let's process each component:\n\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25\nNT99 -> NT51 NT66\n\nSo, NT39 becomes NT8 NT25, and NT99 becomes NT51 NT66. So now, the string is NT8 NT25 NT51 NT66 t98.\n\nNext, we need to expand each of these NTs:\n\nNT8: I don't see a production for NT8, except that in the mappings under NT8: 't7'. So NT8 -> t7.\n\nSimilarly, NT25: NT25 -> t28? Wait, looking back at the grammar, under NT25, the production is NT25 -> NT28 NT7. Wait, in the mappings, NT25: 't28'.\n\nWait no, the mappings list each NT and their corresponding expansion. So for example, NT28 -> 't20', etc. So, perhaps to expand, I need to replace each NT with its production.\n\nLet me correct my approach.\n\nEach NT can be replaced according to their production. For example, NT39 can be replaced by NT8 NT25. But in the mappings, NT25 is a terminal if it's present, but looking at the mappings:\n\nLooking for NT25 in the grammar: It says NT25 -> NT28 NT7. Wait, but under the mappings, under NT25: the production is 't28'. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe that's incorrect. Let me clarify.\n\nI think the grammar is given as a list where each line is an NT and its production.\n\nFor example, the line `NT25 -> NT28 NT7` would mean NT25 can be replaced by NT28 NT7. But the line `NT25-> 't28'` is conflicting. Wait, no, perhaps the line is showing all the productions for each NT. So for example, NT25 has one production: NT25 -> 't28'? Or multiple? Hmm, confusing.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the lines are like:\n\nNT26 -> NT65 NT50\n\nNT25 -> NT28 NT7\n\nSo, for each NT, their possible productions are listed. For instance, NT25 can be replaced by NT28 NT7 or 't28'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe each line represents a production, where each production for an NT is a separate line. So for example:\n\nNT25 has these productions:\n\nNT25 -> NT28 NT7\n\nand\n\nNT25 -> 't28'\n\nBut no, that can't be because only one production is present. Wait, perhaps the mappings list all the possible expansions for each NT. \n\nWait, the problem lists the grammar as a series of lines, each starting with NT followed by a production. So for example:\n\nNT49 -> NT0 NT47\n\nand so on. So each line is a production for that NT. Then, some NTs directly expand to a terminal.\n\nFrom the mappings, the lines where NT is followed by -> 't' are:\n\n- NT18 -> t14\n- NT9: t5\n- NT12 -> t85\n- NT39 -> t9\n- NT74 -> t73\n- NT26 -> t26\n- NT7 -> t74\n- NT12 -> t1\n- NT28 -> t20\n- NT17 -> t73\n- NT16 -> t71\n- NT69 -> t93\n- NT18 -> t19\n- NT20 -> t17\n- NT20 -> t0\n- NT28 -> t26\n- NT59 -> t6\n- NT47 -> t72\n- NT92 -> t56\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT56 -> t40\n- NT51 -> t98\n- NT44 -> 't98' (Wait, no. Wait, looking again, no: for NT44, the line is 't98'. So NT44 can be replaced by t98.\n\nWait, so in the mappings, the production for NT44 is NT44 -> 't98', not a production. That means when NT44 appears, it can only be replaced by 't98'. So, in the initial production, when S is expanded via S->NT74 NT44, then NT74 is expanded further, and NT44 becomes 't98'.\n\nSimilarly, for other NTs:\n\nLooking at the mappings, let's list which NTs directly expand to terminals:\n\n- NT18 -> 't14' and 't19'\n- NT25: Not in the mappings? Wait, NT25 is present. Looking again, no, I think I'm mixing.\n\nWait, let me collect all NTs and their possible productions:\n\nNT49 -> NT0 NT47\n\nNT39 -> NT8 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t98 t0 t52`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except for the terminals, which are the base cases. The grammar provided lists all the possible productions, which are the rules that the non-terminals can expand into.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that each production is either a non-terminal (like S, NT49, etc.) that expands into two non-terminals, or directly into a terminal ('t' followed by a number). So the string we need to evaluate consists of a sequence of terminals, each of which must correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nThe strategy I think I should use is to try to parse the string from left to right, reducing the grammar step by step. Each reduction step should bring us closer to the start symbol S, which is the initial non-terminal that should generate the entire string.\n\nThe given string is `t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t98 t0 t52`. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first token is `t26`. From the grammar, `NT26` expands to `NT65 NT50`. Then, `NT65` is `t66` and `NT50` is `t92`.\n2. So `t26` comes from `NT26`.\n3. The next token is `t74`. Looking at the grammar, `NT74` expands to `NT39 NT99`. So `t74` is a terminal, probably from NT74.\n4. Next is `t73`. From the grammar, NT73 is directly `t73`, which is a terminal.\n5. Next `t73` again, same as above.\n6. `t18` corresponds to NT18, which expands to NT76 NT91. NT76 is t82 and NT91 is t22. But wait, that can't be right. Wait, in the grammar, NT18 -> t14. No, wait, looking again, I see:\n\nWait, checking the grammar, for NT18, the productions are:\n\nNT18 -> NT76 NT91\nNT76 -> NT2 NT68\n NT18 also has a production -> t14. Hmm, but in the string, it's `t18`, which must correspond to a direct terminal. Checking the grammar, NT18 has a production -> t14. So t18 is actually t14? Wait, no. Wait, the string has `t18`, but looking at the grammar, NT18 has a production to t14. But perhaps I misread. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions for NT18:\n\nNT18 -> NT76 NT91\nAlso, looking around, I see NT20 -> t17, NT93 -> t80, etc., but for NT18, do I see a production directly to t18? No, it seems NT18 might not have a direct terminal. Wait, actually, checking the list:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT18, I see:\n\nNT18 -> NT76 NT91\nBut is there any other production for NT18?

No. From the grammar:\n\nLooking at the entire provided grammar, I don't see any production where NT18 is directly a terminal.

But that seems like a problem because 't18' is not a terminal that directly appears in any production. Instead, the only production for NT18 is into two non-terminals, so it must be that 't18' is part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, that's confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-147","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t56` and the grammar has several production rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have each production rule being either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure simplifies the parsing process, but for generating strings, it's useful to see if the string can be formed by applying these rules step by step.\n\nLooking at the given string, I notice it contains several 't's followed by numbers. These 't's likely correspond to terminals in the grammar. My goal is to find a derivation starting from the start symbol S and ending with the given string.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which has several production rules:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, S is a non-terminal that can produce two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals (NT74, NT44, etc.) can further produce other non-terminals or terminals. I'll need to follow this down until I reach the terminals and see if the sequence matches.\n\nI'll start by examining the first symbol: 't20'. Looking through the grammar, I see production rules for 't20' as 't20' \u2192 't17' and also 't20' appears in some other productions, but more importantly, I remember that 't20' is a terminal and might be generated from specific NTs.\n\nWait, looking at the productions provided, I see entries like:\n- NT12 \u2192 't20'\n- NT28 \u2192 't26'\n- NT59 \u2192 't6'\n- NT47 \u2192 't72'\n- NT92 \u2192 't52'\n- NT80 \u2192 't55'\n- NT33 \u2192 't8'\n- NT53 \u2192 't43'\n- NT12 \u2192 't11'\n- NT66 \u2192 't46'\n- NT51 \u2192 't98'\n- NT44 \u2192 't56'\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'\n- NT13 \u2192 't31'\n- NT57 \u2192 't18'\n- NT53 \u2192 't45'\n- NT92 \u2192 't76'\n- NT70 \u2192 't82'\n- NT35 \u2192 't91'\n- NT0 \u2192 't29'\n- NT11 \u2192 't87'\n- NT66 \u2192 't92'\n\nWait, looking again, I think I saw that NT12 can produce 't20' directly. Let's check: NT12 \u2192 't20' is there. So if I have a 't20', it's likely coming from NT12. But wait, in the grammar, I see multiple productions for NT12, like NT12 \u2192 NT2 \u2192 NT28, etc., but also a terminal. So, for example, NT12 can be 't20' directly.\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce NT12 via S \u2192 NT40 NT92, but wait, S's first rule is NT74 NT44. Hmm, maybe I should look at each step more carefully.\n\nWait, the string is t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t56.\n\nBreaking it down, each symbol must be generated by some production. Let's see the sequence:\n\n1. t20\n2. t74\n3. t73\n4. t72\n5. t73\n6. t73\n7. t18\n8. t31\n9. t11\n10. t56\n\nI think I should try to work backward using the parser approach, checking if each terminal can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first term, t20. From the grammar, I see that NT12 can produce 't20' directly (NT12 \u2192 't20'). So t20 comes from NT12. Now, what does NT12 produce? Let's look at the productions for NT12:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT28 NT7 \u2192 NT26 NT59 \u2192 NT69 NT1 \u2192 ... Wait, looking through the list, it's quite extensive. Wait, I see:\n\nLooking at NT12 in the productions:\n- NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT80 \u2192 't71' 't55' which would produce 't71' 't55', but we have 't20' as the first term, so that can't be.\n\nWait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me look again. The productions for NT12 are:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT28 NT7\n- NT12 \u2192 NT51 NT20 \u2192 which would be NT12 \u2192 NT51 't20' \u2192 since NT51 can produce 't98' via NT51 \u2192 't18' 't85', but wait, that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's easier to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT12 NT24. So S produces NT12 and NT24. If t20 comes from NT12, then NT12 must produce 't20', and NT24 must produce the second symbol, t74.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT12 NT24\n- NT12 \u2192 't20' (using NT12 \u2192 't20')\n- Now, NT24: what does it produce? Looking through, I see NT24 \u2192 't88' is given (as per the end of the list, 't24 \u2192 't88') So t74 would come from NT24 \u2192 't74' \u2192 so NT24 must produce 't74'. \n\nWait, no, the second symbol is t74. Let's confirm: the second symbol is 't74'. So if S \u2192 NT12 NT24, then the first part is 't20' (from NT12), and the second part starts with 't74' (from NT24). So, in this case, the first symbol in NT24's expansion is 't74'.\n\nLooking through, I see NT24 \u2192 't88' is a production, but that's a terminal. So maybe NT24 produces t74 directly? Wait, looking at the list, I don't see a production for NT24 \u2192 't74'. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't88'\n\nBut that's a terminal. So if NT24 produces 't88', then it cannot produce t74. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, S could be expanding to S \u2192 NT11 NT24. Let's see: first symbol t20 is from NT12, but S \u2192 NT11 would produce something else. Wait, perhaps S is not going S \u2192 NT11, because the first symbol is t20, which comes from NT12. So S must be expanding to NT12 and NT24.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT12 NT24. NT12 \u2192 t20, and NT24 must produce t74.\n\nBut looking at NT24, the only production is NT24 \u2192 't88', which is a terminal. So that would mean the second symbol can only be 't88', but in our string the second symbol is 't74', which doesn't match. So that can't be.\n\nThis suggests that S cannot expand through the path S \u2192 NT12 NT24 because it would generate 't20' followed by 't88', but the second part is 't74'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in which production is used. Let's check the initial productions again:\n\n- S can be NT74 NT94 -> wait, no, the initial productions are:\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, no, S can't produce NT12 directly. So how did t20 come from NT12?\n\nWait, that can't be, because S only produces NT74, NT11, or NT40, not NT12. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLooking again, NT12 is a non-terminal that can produce 't20' via NT12 \u2192 't20'. But S can't directly produce NT12. Hmm.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the grammar looks like. The given grammar consists of several production rules. Each non-terminal symbol is on the left side, and the right side has pairs of non-terminals or terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals or one of B or C is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it seems to be S because the first production is S -> NT74 NT44, etc. So I think the start symbol is S.\n\nThe next thing I notice is that some of the non-terminals have productions that eventually lead to terminals. For example, NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and both NT92 and NT85 may lead to terminals. Other non-terminals like NT73 directly produce 't6', which is a terminal.\n\nMy string is \"t22 t70 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t14 t92 t56\". I need to see if each of these terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting from the beginning of the string, let's try to break it down into the possible steps.\n\n1. The first symbol is \"t22\". I need to find a production that ends with \"t22\".\nLooking through the rules, I see NT91 -> NT64 NT90, and then looking at the rules for other non-terminals:\n- NT64 -> NT65 NT13\n- NT13 -> 't31' (from NT13 -> t31)\nWait, but in the rule, NT13 is not the end, it leads to 't31'. Hmm, maybe I need to look for which non-terminals directly lead to \"t22\".\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT59 -> 't6' and NT39 -> 't9', etc. Wait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that have productions ending in \"t22\".\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT73 -> 't6', and other rules like NT70 -> NT12 NT90. Not sure. Let's make a list of which non-terminals directly produce certain terminals.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT0 -> NT77 NT34\nNT49 -> NT0 NT47\nAnd others, but looking for 't22':\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT13 -> 't31', NT59 -> 't6', NT9 -> 't46', NT0 -> 't29', NT7 -> 't74', etc. Wait, where does \"t22\" come from? Hmm, I might have missed that.\n\nWait, the rule: NT59 -> 't6'. So, not \"t22\". Let me check all the terminal productions. Maybe I can list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals are:\n- 't6', 't7', 't8', 't69' (from NT69 -> 't93'), 't85' (from NT85 -> 't64'), 't14' (from NT14?), wait, no, in the rules, I see NT18 -> 't14'.\n\nWait, let me list all terminal productions:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT73 -> 't6' (so 't6' is a terminal)\nNT70 -> NT12 NT90\nBut looking further, NT12 is also a non-terminal that can lead to t70 (from NT12 -> 't70'), I think.\n\nWait no, looking again: The rule NT12 -> 't70' is not present because in the rules provided, I see NT12 -> 't16' and 't1', etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT12 is written as S -> NT12, but wait no, looking for NT12 -> 'something'.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT12 -> 't1' (from rule NT13 -> 't31'), no: NT12 -> 't16' and 't1'?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look for any NT that produce 't22'.\n\nIn the rules:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT66 -> 't26'\n\nNT17 -> 't73'\n\nNT16 -> 't71'\n\nNT69 -> 't93'\n\nNT91 -> 't22'? Wait, looking for NT91: NT91 -> NT64 NT90, and then looking at NT64 and NT90.\n\nWait, no. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT70 -> 't73' (from NT70 -> 't73'), but wait, in the rules, I don't see NT70 directly. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, the user provided a lot of rules, but for 't22', I'm checking each rule and see if any NT production ends with 't22'.\n\nWait, in the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't22'. Hmm, perhaps \"t22\" comes from a non-terminal that produces another non-terminal which in turn produces \"t22\". Or maybe it's a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead approach this by starting from the string and see if each terminal can be matched by some production.\n\nThe string is \"t22 t70 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t14 t92 t56\".\n\nI need to parse from left to right, trying to match each terminal by following the grammar.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into individual tokens: t22, t70, t73, t73, t18, t98, t46, t14, t92, t56.\n\nLet's see the first token is t22. So we need a production that can derive t22. Looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly produces 't22'. Wait, did I miss something? Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I don't see any NT directly leading to 't22' as a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, in the rules, the only way to get 't22' is if some production ends with 't22', but I don't see any. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me go through each rule to see if any ends with 't22'.\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\n- NT47 -> 't6'\n- NT56 -> 't56'? No, NT56 produces other non-terminals. Wait, no: the rule for NT56 is NT56 -> NT92 NT40, etc.\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

However, considering the string is not very long, perhaps it's feasible to construct the parse tree manually.\n\nLet's start by looking at the possible starting points.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has three productions:\n\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nI need to check if any of these can produce the string. Let's look at the first production, S -> NT74 NT44.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t7. Let's check what NT74 expands to. From the productions, NT74 -> NT39 NT99. So NT74 would expand into NT39 and NT99.\n\nNow, let's check the string. The first two symbols are t7 and t26.\n\nWait, the string starts with t7, which would correspond to NT7. But in the grammar, there's NT7 -> NT49 NT73. NT49 then is NT49 -> NT0 NT47, and so on. This seems a bit long, but perhaps I can compare the string to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting with S -> NT74 NT44, as that starts with NT74. Let's see if the string can be covered.\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99.\n\nSo NT74 would be replaced by NT39 and NT99. So S becomes NT39 NT99 NT44 (since NT44 is from the S production S->NT74 NT44, so NT44 is attached to the expansion).\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the entire string and see if it can be covered by the productions starting from S.\n\nLooking at the string: The first symbol is t7. Let's see what NT7 maps to. NT7 -> NT49 NT73. Then, NT49 is NT0 NT47, so NT7 would expand into NT0 NT47 NT73. NT0 is production nt0 -> nt77 nt34, so NT0 would expand into that. Let me track this:\n\nNT7 -> NT49 NT73\nNT49 -> NT0 NT47\nNT0 -> NT77 NT34\nSo NT7 expands to NT77 NT34 NT47\n\nThen NT73 (from NT7's expansion) maps to 't6', as per NT73->'t6'.\n\nSo putting it together, NT7 -> t6 after a series of expansions.\n\nWait, but NT73 is a terminal in the grammar, mapping to 't6'. So the initial expansion for NT7 would lead to t6, but that would only account for the first token. However, the actual string starts with t7, not t6. Hmm, that seems off. Did I get the NT wrong?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are named NT followed by numbers, but in the productions, NT7 is actually NT7 -> NT49 NT73.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals as well. The start symbol here is S.\n\nThe grammar rules are numerous, so I'll list out some important ones to get an idea. \n\nLooking at some of the non-terminals:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n- NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47\n- NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n- NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n- NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n- NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n- And many more, ending with some non-terminals mapping directly to terminals like 't74', 't85', 't55', etc.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: t56 t71 t55 t76 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t55 t52.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step expands exactly one non-terminal into two other non-terminals or a terminal. The process to generate a string is a series of such expansions starting from the start symbol S.\n\nSo, the string has a length of 11. Since each step contributes at least one symbol to the output, the number of steps would be related to the length. But in CNF, it's possible that some steps might not contribute directly, but given the way CNF works, it's possible that the string can be generated in a way where each step contributes one symbol.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree that generates the given string. Let's see if we can find a path through the grammar that leads to this string.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first symbol is t56. So, I need to see which non-terminals can produce t56. Let me scan the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT56 is listed as NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40 (since in the rules, NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40, as per the user's provided list).\n- Also, NT40 \u2192 NT44 NT98, and NT44 \u2192 t56. Wait, no, looking through the provided rules, I see NT44 \u2192 t56 (because in the list: NT44 -> t56). \n\nWait, that might be useful. So, NT44 can produce t56. Similarly, let me check other rules.\n\nLooking further, NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40, and NT40 can go to NT44, which goes to t56. Alternatively, NT44 can directly produce t56.\n\nSo, let's see if I can start from S and expand non-terminals to eventually get t56.\n\nLooking at S's rules:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, from S, expanding into two non-terminals. Now, looking at the first symbol in the string: t56. That must come from one of the non-terminals in the expansion of S. So, either NT74 or NT11 or NT40.\n\nLooking at the rules for these:\n- NT74: Let's check if any of the rules for NT74 produce t56. Looking through the provided rules, I see NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. Then, NT39 can go to NT8 NT25, and so on. It doesn't seem to directly produce t56. Wait, but earlier I thought NT44 \u2192 t56. So, perhaps that's a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. In the grammar provided, certain non-terminals directly map to terminals. For example, NT74 is mapped to t56? Or is it that NT44 \u2192 t56? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, the last few lines mention:\n- NT44 -> t56\n- NT71 -> t71\n- NT55 -> t55\n- NT76 -> t76\n- NT56 -> t56\nWait, no, let me double-check the provided grammar lines.\n\nIn the provided rules, under 'Grammar:', there are several lines ending with 't6', 't77', etc. Let me look for any non-terminal that directly maps to a 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the list:\n- NT74 \u2192 t56? Wait, in the list, I see NT74 -> t56. Wait, actually, no. Wait, let me scan the provided rules:\n\nIn the rules, at the end, towards the end, I see:\n- NT56 -> NT92 NT40\n- NT57 -> NT55 NT18\n- NT7 -> t74\n- NT66 -> t26\n- NT9 -> t46\n- NT90 -> t22\n- NT12 -> t16\n- NT39 -> t9\n- NT92 -> t52\n- NT28 -> t26\n- NT59 -> t6\n- NT47 -> t72\n- NT66 -> t46\n- NT51 -> t98\n- NT24 -> t88\n- NT7 -> t74\n- NT68 -> t82\n- NT27 -> t7 (Wait, no, looking at 'NT27' lines: actually, looking through, I see some specific mappings. Let me re-express this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the non-terminals that directly map to terminals:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT66 \u2192 t26\n- NT69 \u2192 t93\n- NT74 \u2192 t56\n- NT71 \u2192 t71 (Wait, looking for 't71' in the rules: Yes, I see NT71 \u2192 t71)\n- NT55 \u2192 t55\n- NT76 \u2192 t76\n- NT51 \u2192 t98\n- NT12 \u2192 t16\n- NT39 \u2192 t9\n- NT92 \u2192 t52\n- NT28 \u2192 t26 (Wait, I think I'm getting some from later rules)\n- NT65 \u2192 t17\n- NT77 \u2192 t92\n- NT70 \u2192 t82\n- NT40 \u2192 t55\n- Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. Wait, actually, CNF requires that each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right. So let me check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most rules have two non-terminals on the right, except for some that have a terminal. For example, `NT7 -> NT49 NT73` is in CNF because both sides are non-terminals. But other rules like `S -> NT74 NT44` and `S -> NT11 NT24` are terminals? Wait, no, NT abbreviations are non-terminals, right? So S is a non-terminal because it has NTs. Then, the string contains terminals like 't20', which must be derived from some non-terminals.\n\nNext, I notice that many of the NT productions lead to terminals. For example, `NT73 -> 't6'`, `NT16 -> 't71'`, etc. So this grammar has a lot of terminal symbols, which are used to build the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t20 t29 t72 t6 t73 t73 t18 t31 t80 t85 t22 t52`. Since it's split into segments, I assume each is a single token derived from a non-terminal, so the entire string should correspond to a derivation that starts with the start symbol S and reduces it step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces two NTs. The two rules given for S are `S -> NT74 NT44` and `S -> NT11 NT24`. Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, S only has two rules, but I think the initial response might have repeated some lines. Let me check again.\n\nYes, in the grammar, S is directly producing two NTs in three different ways, but actually, looking at the initial lines, S is written three times, but I think that's a mistake. Wait, no, the user provided the grammar as a list from S to various NT expressions. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, the grammar starts as:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nAnd then continues with other NT productions. So the start symbol S can produce any of these three combinations of NTs. So each production of S produces two NTs, which are part of the string we're evaluating.\n\nThe string starts with `t20`, so perhaps one of the NTs in the production leads to 't20'. Let's look at all the NTs that derive to terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT20 -> 't17' or 't0' (wait, no, let me check the grammar lines provided)\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT16 -> 't71'\nNT69 -> 't93'\nNT68 -> 't82'\nNT7 -> 't74' again\nNT18 -> 't14', 't19', 't17', 't0', 't20', 't18'\nWait, no, looking at each NT:\n\nNT7 -> 't74' (from `NT73 -> 't6'`? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look for NTs that have rules ending with a terminal.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT69 -> 't93' (from `NT92 -> 't93'`? Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-190","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t56 t71 t55 t76 t56 t71 t55 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and is followed by two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it branches into three different productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these NTs is a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal string made of 't' followed by numbers. The goal is to see if there's a derivation from S that produces the given string.\n\nThe string is composed of a series of 't' followed by two-digit numbers. Each 't' is followed by numbers that are either part of the rules in the grammar.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step:\n\nThe string is: t56 t71 t55 t76 t56 t71 t55 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56\n\nHmm, wait, each \"t\" is followed by two numbers, so perhaps the string can be split into pairs:\n\nt56, t71, t55, t76, t56, t71, t55, t56, t71, t73, t56, t56\n\nSo that's 12 tokens. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT1 NT2, and each step replaces a non-terminal into two non-terminals, the number of NTs should double each time until we get to the terminal.\n\nThe initial S produces two NTs, leading to 2. Each step replaces an NT into two, so the number of NTs is 2^n, where n is the number of steps. The terminal string's length is 12, which is a product of 2^something, but 12 isn't a power of 2. Wait, that might be a problem because 2^n will be 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. 12 isn't among them, so maybe the string can't be generated. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the count works.\n\nWait, no, the initial S is replaced by two NTs, then each of those can be replaced, leading to the number of NTs after each step. For example, after one step, it's 2, then if both are replaced, 4, and so on. The number of tokens in the string is 12, which is divisible by 2 as 6*2, 3*2, etc. Wait, but 12 is 2*6, but maybe we can get there. Wait, no, because each replacement step doubles the number of NTs. So starting from 2, each replacement step leads to 2^n, where n is the number of steps.\n\nWait, but 2^k = 12? That's not possible because 2^3=8, 2^4=16. So maybe the string cannot be generated because the length isn't a power of 2. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the structure. The start symbol S is producing two NTs, leading to a derivation where each NT eventually becomes a terminal string. So the entire string must have an even number of terminals because each production adds two. But wait, in the given string, each \"tX\" is two characters, so the entire string is a sequence of such pairs. So how many pairs are there? Let's see: t56 t71 t55 t76 t56 t71 t55 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56. That's 12 tokens, which is 6 pairs. Each step of replacement would process one NT into two, so perhaps each pair corresponds to a terminal in the string.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe I should consider that each 't56' is the result of a production. For example, if the grammar has a rule like NT56 \u2192 t56, then the string would consist of t56s concatenated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't56' is the result of a derivation path. So the full string would be a sequence of such steps.\n\nBut wait, maybe the string isn't possible because the length isn't a power of two. For example, S \u2192 NTnt1 NTnt2, then each of NTnt1 and NTnt2 are further expanded. The total number of terminal tokens should be a sum of expansions where for each NT, the number of expansions doubles. So starting with S: 2 NTs.\n\nAfter one replacement, each NT could be expanded into more NTs or terminals. But to get the total number of terminals, it's the number of leaves in the parse tree. So the total number must be a power of two because each replacement step doubles the count.\n\nWait, that makes sense. If the initial S is split into two NTs, then each split could only produce even counts. So for example:\n\n- S splits into 2 NTs.\n\nIf each of those 2 splits into 2, we get 4 NTs.\n\nThen 8, 16, etc. So for the number of terminals, the count must be a power of two. The given string has 12 tokens, which is not a power of two (next is 16). So 12 isn't possible, meaning the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but is the string exactly the given in the question? Let me count the tokens again. It's 12 tokens: each is \"t followed by two digits.\" So that makes 12 in total, right? So 12 isn't a power of two, which suggests that the string cannot be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the length is considered differently. For example, each NT expansion adds a certain number of symbols, but perhaps not doubling each time. But in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two non-terminals, so the number of symbols would double at each step. So starting with two NTs:\n\n- After 1 step: 2\n- After 2 steps: 4\n- After 3 steps: 8\n- After 4 steps: 16\n- And so on.\n\nSo 12 isn't in that sequence. Hence, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe some NTs can produce multiple terminals. For example, if an NT can produce a string longer than one symbol. But in this grammar, each NT is only replacing to two non-terminals until it becomes a terminal. Wait, no, the grammar as given has each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production step can only produce two NTs, not terminals directly. So actually, each NT is replaced until it's a terminal.\n\nWait, but for example, NT56 \u2192 t56. So NT56 is a single terminal. So perhaps in some paths, a NT is replaced into two NTs, which further could turn into terminals.\n\nLet me try to build the string step by step.\n\nBut since the string has 12 tokens, which is 6 pairs, perhaps it's built from 6 NTs. But initial S splits into 2 NTs, which must combine into 6. That doesn't fit, because each replacement would have to double.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the number of terminals isn't a power of two, it's impossible. So the answer is 'No' because the length isn't correct.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-206","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. CNF for a grammar has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) has exactly two non-terminal symbols, except for the start symbol which can have a single terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems that all RHSs are two non-terminals except when terminals appear, like 't74', 't26', etc. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t76 t71 t73 t56 t56`. \n\nI need to see how this string can be generated by the grammar. Since each production either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal, the process would involve tracing back from the string to the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nLet me list the productions again for clarity, focusing on the relevant ones that produce terminals:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44, which likely leads to t74 t56 via NT74 -> NT99 NT49, and NT49 -> etc., ultimately leading to a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, I see that each NT has specific productions, and many of them eventually produce terminals. The string provided seems to be a concatenation of these terminals. I'll check each step to see if each 't...' can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first token: 't56'. In the grammar, NT53->t43? Wait, no. Let me check the productions:\n\nFrom NT74 -> NT39 NT99, which leads to NT39 -> NT8 NT25, etc. Following this chain, NT53->t43? Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT53->t43? Or is it elsewhere? Wait, actually, looking at the RHSs, NT53 is in some productions. Wait, in the grammar, looking at the list:\n\nNT53->t45? Let me search the grammar for NT53. I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice:\n\n- NT53 -> t43?\n\nHmm, not seeing it. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me go through each production step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map each 't' in the string to the corresponding NT production.\n\nLet's take the string step by step:\n\n1. t56: Looking for which NT produces t56. Checking the grammar, I see NT56->t92 (in the first part of the grammar), but also NT56->t40 in another production. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT56->t92 and also NT56->t26? Wait, let me look again:\n\nIn the grammar, NT56->t92 and NT56->t40 is under S->NT40 NT98. Wait, no, NT56 is under NT56->t92 and NT56->t40? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, at the end, I see:\n\nNT56 -> NT92 NT40\nNT56 -> t92\nNT56 -> t40\n\nWait, no, I think I misread. Let me re-express:\n\nFrom the last part of the grammar:\n\nNT56 -> t92\nNT40 -> t71\nNT69 -> t38\nNT18 -> t19\nNT93 -> t80\nNT18 -> t14\nNT20 -> t0\nNT28 -> t20\nNT69 -> t93\nNT68 -> t82\nNT7 -> t74\nNT66 -> t26\nNT9 -> t46\nNT90 -> t22\nNT12 -> t16\nNT39 -> t9\nNT92 -> t52\nNT1 -> t70\nNT24 -> t88\nNT28 -> t26\nNT59 -> t6\nNT47 -> t72\nNT8 -> t7\nNT12 -> t1\nNT50 -> t59\nNT80 -> t55\nNT33 -> t8\nNT92 -> t56\nNT53 -> t43\nNT12 -> t11\nNT66 -> t46\nNT51 -> t98\nNT44 -> t56\nSo, yes, NT56 can produce t92 or t40, but in the string, the first token is t56. Wait, that's a problem because t56 isn't directly produced by any NT in the grammar. Wait, that can't be right because every terminal in the string should come from some NT production.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t56, but in the grammar, NT56 can produce t92 or t40. There's no NT56->t56, so that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in mapping. Alternatively, perhaps there's another NT that produces t56.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I misread. Let me cross-verify:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT53->t43, NT56->t92, NT56->t40, NT66->t26, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing an NT that produces t56. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar again more carefully. Perhaps I missed an NT that produces t56.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT56 -> t92\nNT56 -> t40\nOther NTs produce other terminals.\n\nSo, how can the first token be t56? There's no rule that produces t56 directly. That suggests that maybe the first token isn't t56, but perhaps I have the grammar wrong. Wait, perhaps the initial production is S->NT74 NT44, which leads to t74 t56, as S -> NT74 NT44, and NT74 produces t74, and NT44 produces t56.\n\nWait, looking at NT74->t74. Let me check:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25\nNT8 -> t7\nNT25-> NT28 NT7\nWait, NT28->t20\nNT7 leads to t74\nWait, this seems to loop. Alternatively, looking at NT74:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT74 -> t39 NT99\n\nWait, no. The given grammar for NT39 is NT39->NT8 NT25, and NT8->t7. So, following this:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\nNT39->NT8 NT25\nNT8-> t7\nNT25-> NT28 NT7\nNT28-> t20\nNT7-> t74\n\nSo, NT74 would produce t74, which is 't74', but in the string, the first token is 't56', which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is `t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t76 t71 t73 t56 t56`, and the first token is t56. So, the first part of the string starts with t56. But looking at NT56, in the grammar, NT56->t92 and NT56->t40. So, t56 is not directly produced by any NT, which suggests that perhaps the string starts with t56, but that's not possible because NT56 doesn't produce t56.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I misread the grammar. Let me take a step back.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT56: NT56 -> t92, which is 't92'; also, look for any other NT that might produce 't56' as the start.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at it wrong. Let me list all NT productions that produce terminals:\n\nS has two options, each leading to two NTs, but perhaps the RHS in S gives non-terminals that eventually produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the non-terminals produce either terminals or other non-terminals, except for the ones that directly produce a terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar, looking for NTs that have a production to a terminal:\n\nNT74 -> t39 NT99\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, after NT74, is there a direct production to a terminal?

{"custom_id":"request-205","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should simplify things a bit.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t0 t52`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals directly correspond to terminals. Some important ones are:\n- NT7 \u2192 t74\n- NT77 \u2192 t92\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT19 \u2192 t73\n- NT66 \u2192 t66\n- NT91 \u2192 t64\n- NT35 \u2192 t35\n- But in the string, I see t26, t74, t73, etc., which all correspond to certain non-terminals. For example, t26 corresponds to NT28, t73 corresponds to NT19, etc.\n\nEach token in the string is a terminal, so I need to see if the grammar can produce this sequence step by step.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which can split into various combinations based on the productions:\n- S \u2192 NT49 NT44\n- OR S \u2192 NT39 NT92\n- OR S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nLooking at the string, I'll need to determine which production to choose first. I'll try each option and see if it leads to the string.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT49 NT44\nNT49's expansion leads to NT0 NT47, and NT44 directly becomes t56.\n\nWait, in the string, the first part is t26, so maybe NT28 is involved. Let me check the grammar for NT28. From the grammar, NT28 can produce NT20 NT13, which in turn must produce terminals.\n\nWait, but NT28 is also in the string as t26. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT19 NT98. NT19 is 't73' and NT98 is 't38'. But in our string, we have 't26' after that. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. Like NT7 \u2192 t74. So, in the string, if I encounter 't74', that's exactly NT7. Similarly, NT77 is t92, and so on.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t26. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't26'? Looking through the grammar, I see that NT26 \u2192 NT19 NT98, but I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't26'. However, in the string, t26 is a token, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see lines like \"NT28 -> t20\", which isn't t26. Let me check all the terminals:\n\nLooking for terminals starting with 't', I see:\n\n- t74 from NT7\n- t93 from NT73\n- t73 from NT19\n- t74 from NT74\n- t52 from NT92\n- t88 from NT44\n- t66 from NT46\n- t26 from NT28? Or is t28 a different non-terminal?\n\nWait, no. In the grammar, NT28 is defined as \"NT28 -> t20\". So NT28 produces t20. But the string has 't26' somewhere. Hmm, but in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't26'. So perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me re-examine the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like:\n- NT26 \u2192 NT19 NT98\n- NT28 \u2192 t20\n- NT35 \u2192 NT11 NT77\n- NT12 \u2192 NT93 NT70\n- NT9 \u2192 t46\n- NT93 \u2192 t80\n- NT18 \u2192 t19\n- NT70 \u2192 t82\n- NT0 \u2192 t29\n- NT11 \u2192 t87\n- NT66 \u2192 t26\n\nWait, wait! I think I missed that. Looking at the grammar, there's a non-terminal NT66 which is defined as NT66 \u2192 t26. So in the string, the first token is t26, which must correspond to NT66.\n\nLooking through: \n\nNT66 \u2192 t26 (terminals directly)\nSo in the string, \"t26\" is directly NT66. How does that happen? Let me see how the string can be broken down.\n\nWait, the string is: `t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t0 t52`\n\nLet me split this into individual tokens:\n1. t26 \u2192 NT66\n2. t74 \u2192 NT7\n3. t73 \u2192 NT19\n4. t73 \u2192 NT19\n5. t18 \u2192 NT? Let's see. From the grammar, NT18 is not directly a terminal. Looking back, I see NT18 rules:\n- NT18 \u2192 t76 (Wait, no. Let me check the grammar. Looking at the rules, NT18 doesn't appear. Instead, I see other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong place.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example, NT17 \u2192 t73, which is 't73'. But looking for NT18, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, I can't find any direct terminal productions for NT18. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar, lines like:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t82\n- NT18 \u2192 t19\n- Wait, under NT18, it's \"t19\"? No, looking at the grammar, in the part \"NT18 ->\", I don't see any lines.

{"custom_id":"request-232","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has each production rule as either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The string provided is `t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t56`. I notice that each token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My task is to see if these tokens can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S:\n- S can produce NT74 NT44 (option 1)\n- S can produce NT11 NT24 (option 2)\n- S can produce NT40 NT92 (option 3)\n\nSo, the start symbol S branches into three possible non-terminal combinations. Each of these are two non-terminals, meaning each will have to be expanded further according to the grammar rules until we reach the terminal tokens in the string.\n\nI need to see if the string can be derived starting from S. The string has 14 tokens: the count is important because each rule in CNF produces two non-terminals, which can further split into more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, how does the length of the string relate to the grammar's productions? Each step in the derivation replaces one non-terminal with two others, so the number of symbols can grow exponentially. However, here we're dealing with a specific string, so perhaps it's more efficient to work backwards, starting from the string and seeing if it can be reduced to S.\n\nLet me list the string again: t26, t29, t72, t6, t73, t72, t73, t72, t73, t73, t18, t31, t16, t56.\n\nEach of these is a terminal symbol. To see if it's generated by the grammar, I can try to reconstruct a parse tree starting from the string. Since each production rule in CNF splits a non-terminal into two parts, the string should be a result of a series of such splits.\n\nBut reconstructing the tree for such a long string might be tedious. Alternatively, I can check if each terminal symbol is directly produced by any non-terminal rule, and then see if the sequence makes sense.\n\nLooking at the terminal symbols:\n\nt26: Checking the grammar rules, '26' is a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 't26' and also NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50. Wait, no, in the given rules, NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50. So, t26 is directly produced by NT28.\n\nWait, but in the provided rules, NT28 is not present. Let me check the given grammar again. Oh, wait, the rules are listed as `NT28 -> 't26'`. So, NT28 directly produces t26. So, the first token t26 is NT28.\n\nBut looking at the start symbol S, it never produces NT28 directly. S produces NT74, NT11, or NT40. So, to produce t26, which is NT28, we must have a rule that expands NT28, but S never goes to NT28.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a rule for NT28. Looking through the rules: yes, there's `NT28 -> 't20'` and `NT26 -> NT65 NT50`, and `NT28 -> 't26'` isn't directly present. Oh, wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check: no, the grammar includes `NT28 -> 't26'`. Yes, under NT28: `NT28 -> 't26'`, which means NT28 can directly produce t26. But in the start symbol's options, S can't directly produce NT28. So, to produce t26, we need to have a path from S through other non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, the very first token is t26, which is NT28. So, to get t26, NT28 must be derived from S via some expansion. But looking at the start symbol S's productions, none of them produce NT28 directly. So, the first step is: S \u2192 NT? something. For example, option 1: S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Let me see if either NT74 or NT44 can produce NT28 or something else that can lead to t26.\n\nLet's see: NT74 can produce t6 via `NT74 -> 't6'`. But how?\nWait, the rules: looking for NT74 productions. I see `NT74 -> 't73'`, `NT74 -> 't18'`, and `NT74 -> 't93'`. Hmm, not t6. Wait, let me check all the rules for NT74: looking at the given rules, there's no direct production for NT74 producing t6. So, to get t6, where does it come from? Let me check the rules: in NT77, rule is `NT77 -> NT92 NT85`, etc. But the string starts with t26, which comes from NT28 \u2192 t26. But then S doesn't produce NT28, so how can t26 appear in the string?\n\nThis suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first symbol is t26, which requires NT28, which S never directly expands to. So, unless there's a way for the grammar to derive NT28 from S via some path, which seems impossible because S only branches into NT74, NT11, or NT40, none of which expand to NT28.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in associating the first token. Let me re-examine: the string is `t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t56`.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread NT28 \u2192 t26. Because in the list, the rule is `NT28 -> 't26'`, yes. So, the first token t26 can only come from NT28. But S doesn't produce NT28. Therefore, unless NT28 can be derived from S via some other paths, which I don't see.\n\nWait, let me check all rules: S can only go to NT74, NT11, or NT40. None of these directly produce NT28, so how can NT28 appear in the string?\n\nWait, maybe the first symbol is NT28, but after that, other non-terminals can be expanded, but the overall structure would still require the first expansion to produce NT28, which isn't possible from S. So, that would mean that the string cannot be generated because the first symbol can't come from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I overlooked a path where S can produce NT28 indirectly, but looking through S's options, none lead to NT28. So, it's impossible.

The string we're evaluating is: `t56 t71 t55 t56 t26 t74 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t56`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to approach this. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a), I can likely use a parsing strategy, maybe a recursive descent parser or something similar. But since manually parsing this string step by step might be time-consuming, I should look for patterns or connections between the symbols of the string and the grammar productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can map some of the non-terminals to terminals. For instance, there are several productions where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal string. These terminals can be used as building blocks in the string.\n\nLet me list out which non-terminals produce which terminals to simplify things:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 t74 (since NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and eventually NT77 produces 't92')\nWait, actually, looking closer, NT77\u2192NT92 NT85, and then NT92\u2192t56, NT85\u2192t64, but wait, NT85 itself has multiple productions. Hmm, this might get complicated quickly. Maybe a better approach is to represent the non-terminals and their possible terminals, building a mapping.\n\nAlternatively, I can note which non-terminals directly map to 't's:\n\nLooking through the given grammar, here's the mapping for each non-terminal to terminal where applicable:\n\n- NT92: NT92 \u2192 t52 (from NT92->t52) and NT92\u2192t93 (wait, no, NT92 has multiple productions, but some of them lead to terminals. For example, NT92\u2192t52 because of NT52->t52, and NT92\u2192t93 because NT93->t80, which is NT80\u2192t55, etc. So it's unclear if NT92 directly maps to a terminal, but perhaps through other steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note all non-terminals that can directly produce a terminal symbol as per the given grammar. Let's list them:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t29\n- NT1 \u2192 t70\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT7 \u2192 t49\n- NT8 \u2192 t7\n- NT9 \u2192 t46\n- NT11 \u2192 t87\n- NT12 \u2192 t1 and t85\nWait, NT12 has two productions: NT12\u2192t1 and NT12\u2192t85. Wait, looking back, the grammar for NT12 is: NT12 \u2192 NT93 NT70 and NT12 \u2192 t85. So it can directly produce 't85' and also other things.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals might produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, for example:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47 \u2192 t29 and NT47 \u2192 t72, so does NT0 produce 't29' directly? Yes, and NT47\u2192t72. So NT49\u2192t29 t72.\n\nWait, but NT49 is a two-step: it goes through NT0 and NT47, each of which might produce terminals. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the productions for NT49 are given as NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47. But NT0 has a production to t29, and NT47 has a production to t72. So the production NT49 \u2192 t29 t72.\n\nSimilarly, NT74 \u2192 t73 because NT74\u2192t73.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t49 (from NT74 \u2192 t73, but NT74 is further down. Wait, let me check the productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT74 \u2192 t73 is a production. No, wait, in the given grammar, NT74's production is listed as NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99.

Wait, no, looking again, in the provided grammar, the NT7 production is: NT74 -> t73. Or wait, no, looking at the lines:\n\nHmm, I realize I might be making a mistake here.

NT71 isn't a non-terminal; wait, no, NT71 is part of the grammar rules? Wait, no, in the grammar, each production starts with a non-terminal followed by \u2192. So in this case, S is a non-terminal that can be split into NT71 and NT55, but I'm not sure why that's a production. Wait, no, the grammar provided seems to list all the productions, so non-terminals on the left side. So S \u2192 NT71 NT55 might be a mistake because S is a non-terminal, and it's split into NT71 and NT55. But since NT71 and NT55 aren't defined as non-terminals earlier, perhaps there's confusion.

{"custom_id":"request-248","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is `t56 t20 t74 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76 t71 t73 t56 t76`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminal strings as well. In this case, the grammar starts with S, and the productions for S include NT expressions converting to other NTs or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, S seems to produce combinations of NTs, which in turn produce more NTs or terminals. Some of the NTs immediately produce a terminal letter followed by a number, like NT92 \u2192 't52', and others are combinations of more NTs.\n\nThe string given consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I might need to parse the string from the top down using the CFG rules, checking if each terminal can be derived by expanding the non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by trying to parse the string step by step. However, since the string is quite long, maybe 15 tokens, I can look for the productions that produce 't's and see how they connect.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice some of the NTs produce terminals directly or through other NTs. For example:\n- NT92 \u2192 't52'\n- NT66 \u2192 't26'\n- NT57 \u2192 't18'\n- NT35 \u2192 't9'\n- NT70 \u2192 't82'\n- NT73 \u2192 't74'\n- NT11 \u2192 't87'\n- NT24 \u2192 't88'\n- NT28 \u2192 't20' and 't6' perhaps, but the production shows NT28 \u2192 't20' and 't6'?\n\nWait, looking back, some NTs have multiple productions. For example, NT92 has two productions: NT92 \u2192 't52' and NT92 \u2192 't56'. So NT92 can produce either t52 or t56.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't56'. Let me check if NT92 can produce that. Yes, NT92 \u2192 't56'. Then the next token is 't20'. Looking at the grammar, NT28 produces 't20' as one of its options.\n\nBut wait, looking at NT28's productions: NT28 \u2192 't20' and also NT28 \u2192 NT69 and 't91' via NT68's production? Maybe not. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar shows:\n- NT28 \u2192 't20' as a production, so NT28 can directly produce 't20'.\n\nSo, after 't56', the next 't20' would require that the current NT is 92, but wait, after S, it's NT49 NT74 etc. Wait, I think I need to approach this differently. Maybe I should try to see each 't' as a terminal and see which NT production rules can generate them.\n\nBut starting from S, which has rules like S->NT49 NT74. So the initial expansion would be something like NT49 and NT74. Then, each NT can expand further until they reach terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look at each step the string must go through.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse the string and see if it can be generated by the reverse of the grammar. Because sometimes it's easier to think about generating the string from the start as the reverse. But since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps that's not much easier.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to write a parse tree for the string given the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t56 t20 t74 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76 t71 t73 t56 t76.\n\nSo that's 14 't's, each with numbers. The numbers are all two digits from 7 to 99, except for t73 which is just 73, but in the string it's t73 four times.\n\nI think each 'tXY' is a terminal, and the numbers are just part of the identifier, so NT92 \u2192 't52' would represent the terminal token 't52', and similarly for others.\n\nSo each 't' followed by a number is a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, first, the start symbol is S, which must produce a sequence of these terminals.\n\nLooking at the starting productions:\n\nS can be NT49 NT74, NT40 NT24, or NT40 NT92.\n\nSo, each of these produces a combination of two NTs. Then each of those can produce their own NTs or terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some combinations can produce the terminal parts directly.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts:\n\nt56, t20, t74, t73, t73, t73, t18, t31, t16, t76, t71, t73, t56, t76.\n\nI need to see if these can be generated step by step.\n\nLooking at the first 't56', let's see which NTs produce it. The grammar shows:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT47 NT61\nWait, NT56's productions are:\nWait, looking back at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for 't56':\n\nLooking at NT92 \u2192 't56' (Yes)\nLooking for others: perhaps NT92 is the only one that produces 't56'.\n\nSo the first 't56' must come from NT92. So, the first step is that S expands into something that includes NT92. Looking at S's productions, S can be NT40 NT92. So perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT40 NT92.\n\nThen, NT40 can expand into more NTs or a terminal. Looking at NT40's productions:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80, NT44.\n\nSo, NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80 or NT44.\n\nWait, but the first symbol after S is 't56', which comes from NT92. So perhaps S \u2192 NT40 nt92.\n\nSo, in the parse tree, the root is S, which has NT40 and NT92 as its children.\n\nBut NT92 expands to 't56', so that's the first symbol. Then NT40 needs to generate 't20'. Let's see what NT40 can produce.\n\nNT40 has two productions: NT16 NT80 and NT44.\n\nSo, NT40 can produce S \u2192 NT16 NT80 or S \u2192 NT44.\n\nWait, no: wait, the productions for NT40 are:\n\nLooking in the grammar, for NT40: NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80 or NT44.\n\nWait, no: the grammar as provided shows:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT40 directly, but looking for where NT40 is produced.

{"custom_id":"request-246","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t9 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t85 t93 t71 t55 t59 t6 t92 t56`. \n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. Each production can have at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, and the start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the productions starting with S, I see:\n- S -> NT74 NT44\n- S -> NT11 NT24\n- S -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the string starts with various t's, which correspond to the terminals derived from non-terminals. Let me map which non-terminals lead to which terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT productions:\n\nI notice that many non-terminals eventually lead to 't' followed by a number, like NT77 -> NT92 NT85, and then NT92 leads to 't52', and NT85 leads to 't64'. Similarly, NT73 -> 't74', and so on. \n\nLet me try to build a parse tree for the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a binary tree, and the string should be a sequence of productions that derive it step by step.\n\nBut wait, the string is quite long, so perhaps there's a simpler approach. Maybe I can check if each 't' in the string corresponds correctly to a non-terminal and then backtrack to see if the entire string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can derive the string by seeing how each 't' is generated from the non-terminals in the productions.\n\nLet me parse the string into individual terminal symbols: ['t9', 't73', 't73', 't73', 't73', 't18', 't31', 't85', 't93', 't71', 't55', 't59', 't6', 't92', 't56'].\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from S.\n\nFirst, let's consider the starting symbol S. It can produce either NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. Each of these is a pair of NTs.\n\nWhen expanded, these will give two terminals each because each NT can produce two non-terminals, which in turn may produce terminals.\n\nBut the string has 15 terminals. Let me check if the number of symbols matches. In a CNF grammar, each step either combines two symbols into one (if producing non-terminals) or leaves them as is.\n\nWait, actually, starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, expanding to two, then each of those can expand to two more, and so on. The total number of symbols in the string should be 2^k, where k is the number of splits. However, if some non-terminals produce terminals directly, that changes the count.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So starting from one, each level doubles the number of symbols. However, some of these could become terminals, so the actual number of terminals in the string can be different.\n\nBut I'm not sure that's the right approach. Maybe I should consider the entire derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for all paths in the grammar that lead to these 't's and see if the sequence is consistent.\n\nLet me start from the end of the string and see if there's a way to backtrack.\n\nThe last symbol is 't56'. Looking at the grammar, 't56' comes from NT47 -> 't47' and NT61. Wait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking for 't' followed by a number, like 't47' is from NT47's production. Wait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nI see that for example, NT73 -> 't74', NT77 -> NT92 NT85, NT49 -> NT0 NT47, etc. Also, some NTs directly produce 't's.\n\nFor example, NT73 -> 't74', which corresponds to 't74'.\n\nLooking at each 't' in the string:\n\n1. t9: Where does 't9' come from? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT leading directly to 't9', except maybe 't9' is a terminal. Wait, no, because the grammar is given with NTs, and some of the NTs directly produce terminals. For example, NT73 -> 't74', so 't74' is a terminal. Similarly, NT16 is in the productions: NT16 -> 't71'. So 't71' is a terminal from NT16. Let me check all possible 't's:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- t9 is a terminal. Wait, no, wait: the grammar's non-terminals are named like NT1, NT2, etc. The productions for NT7: NT73 -> 't74' So 't74' is NT73's production. So 't74' is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, let me list which NTs directly produce 't' symbols:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT73 -> 't74'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT28 -> 't26'\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT39 -> 't9'\n- NT92 -> 't52'\n- NT33 -> 't8'\n- NT92 -> 't56' (also a terminal)\n- NT53 -> 't43'\n- NT85 -> 't64'\n- NT31 -> ? Wait, 't31' is in the string, but looking at the grammar, is there an NT that produces 't31'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't31'. Hmm. That's a problem. Because in the string, we have 't31' which is an odd one out since none of the NT productions seem to directly lead to 't31'.\n\nWait, let me scan all the productions for NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT53 -> 't43'\n- NT8 -> 't7'\n- NT12 -> 't17'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT69 -> 't38' (Wait, 't38' is another NT producing a terminal)\n- NT18 -> 't14'\n- NT93 -> 't80'\n- NT18 -> 't19'\n- NT20 -> 't0'\n- NT28 -> 't20'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n- NT9 -> 't46'\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT39 -> 't9'\n- NT92 -> 't52'\n- NT53 -> 't43'\n- NT85 -> 't64'\n- NT33 -> 't8'\n- NT92 -> 't56'\n\nWait, I'm noticing that 't31' is not directly produced by any NT in the grammar. But since the string includes 't31', which is part of the string to be derived, this could cause an issue because 't31' is not a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be derived, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, do any of the non-terminals produce 't31'? Let me check each NT's production.\n\nLooking at each NT's production, I see NT35 leading to 't34' and 't56' (NT35 -> NT34 NT25; but I don't see any NT directly giving 't31').\n\nWait, NT35's productions are:\n\n- NT35 -> NT34 NT25\n- NT35 -> NT56 NT93\n- NT33 -> NT8 NT98\n- NT92 -> NT64 NT92 (but that's recursive)\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go through each NT:\n\nLooking through all NTs, none of them directly give 't31' as a terminal except possibly for NT31, but in the provided grammar, there is no NT31. So 't31' is not a terminal in the grammar, meaning it cannot be produced, so the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: `t22 t70 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t80 t85 t22 t93 t71 t55 t19 t26 t56`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a symbol to two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar provided seems to have all rules adhering to CNF.\n\nI notice that each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminals, which are end symbols. So, to determine if the string can be generated, I probably need to check if each terminal appears in the correct positions based on the grammar rules.\n\nThe string starts with `t22`. Looking through the grammar, I see there's a rule `NT0 -> NT77 NT34`, and `NT91 -> NT9 NT47`. Hmm, but wait, I need to find rules where the left-hand side is producing a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I need to see which non-terminals produce `t` terminals. From the rewritten rules, I can see several NT rules that end with 't'. For example:\n\n- `NT7 -> 't6'`\n- `NT12 -> 't85'`\n- `NT17 -> 't73'`\n- `NT16 -> 't71'`\n- `NT69 -> 't93'`\n- `NT68 -> 't82'`\n- `NT7 -> 't74'`\n- `NT66 -> 't26'`\n- `NT9 -> 't46'`\n- `NT90 -> 't22'`\n- `NT12 -> 't1'`\n- `NT39 -> 't9'`\n- `NT92 -> 't52'`\n- `NT8 -> 't7'`\n- `NT12 -> 't1'`\n- `NT50 -> 't59'`\n- `NT80 -> 't55'`\n- `NT33 -> 't8'`\n- `NT53 -> 't43'`\n- `NT12 -> 't11'`\n- `NT66 -> 't46'`\n- `NT51 -> 't98'`\n- `NT44 -> 't56'`\n- `NT9 -> 't5'`\n- `NT13 -> 't31'`\n- `NT57 -> 't18'`\n- `NT53 -> 't45'`\n- `NT92 -> 't76'`\n- `NT70 -> 't82'`\n- `NT35 -> 't91'`\n- `NT0 -> 't29'`\n- `NT11 -> 't87'`\n- `NT66 -> 't92'`\n\nI think the important ones here are where 't' appears as the result of a NT -> t. So each 't' in the string must correspond to a rule where NT produces that 't'.\n\nSo let's parse the string step by step, symbol by symbol, from left to right, trying to see if each 't' can be matched to a NT rule, and the structure of non-terminals can be reduced using the grammar.\n\nStarting with `t22`. Looking at the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't46' \u2192 but 9 isn't 22.\n- NT12 -> 't85' \u2192 12 is 12, but needs to produce 22.\n- Oh, wait, there's also NT90 -> 't22'. So the rule NT90 -> 't22' suggests that NT90 can produce 't22'. So the first token 't22' could come from NT90. So we can start with NT90.\n\nNow, the string is `t22 t70 t73 t73 t73 t18 ...`\n\nAfter NT90 -> 't22', what is the rule for NT90? Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT90 -> 't22' (from the rewritten rules). So when we have 't22', we can reduce it to NT90, and then find contexts where NT90 appears.\n\nBut let's look at the grammar rules. Is there any rule where NT90 appears on the right-hand side? Yes: looking at the original grammar, I don't see any rule where NT90 is on the right-hand side. Wait, let me double-check:\n\nIn the initial grammar, NT90 seems to appear on the left side in rules like `NT66 -> 't92'`, but looking for NT90, perhaps I missed it. Wait, the initial presented grammar is in a list, and I need to search for NT90 in the RHS of any production.\n\nLooking through the initial productions:\n\nS->NT74NT44, S->NT11NT24, etc.\n\nLooking at the NT rules: I can see NT91 -> NT9NT47, NT69 -> NT93NT71, etc., but I don't see any NT90 appears in the RHS except as the terminal 't90'?\n\nWait, I might have misread earlier. Let's check again: in the rewritten grammar, NT90 is part of the rules? Let me go through the rewritten rules again.\n\nLooking at the rewritten rules, I found:\n\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT12 -> 't85'\n- NT17 -> 't73'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT7 -> 't6' \u2192 but 7 is used elsewhere\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n- NT51 -> 't98'\n- NT44 -> 't56'\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't31' (this is relevant)\n- NT57 -> 't18'\n- NT53 -> 't45'\n- NT92 -> 't52'\n- NT8 -> 't7'\n- NT92 -> 't76' (multiple rules)\n- NT70 -> 't82'\n- NT35 -> 't91'\n- NT0 -> 't29'\n- NT11 -> 't87'\n- NT66 -> 't46'\n\nSo, only NT90 is on the left producing 't22' and 't90' perhaps? Wait, the rewritten rules show NT90 -> 't22', but are there any other NT rules that contribute to 't22'? No, seems only NT90 produces 't22'.\n\nBut then, in the grammar, is there a production that has NT90 on the right-hand side? Let me check the original grammar: looking back, for example, S \u2192 NT12 \u2192 't85', which is on the RHS because in the rewritten rules, NT12 \u2192 't85' for example. But in the initial presentation, the rules like NT70 -> 't82', which is directly a terminal.\n\nSo, if we have 't22', which comes from NT90, then we need to find a production that sends NT90 to something else. But looking through the initial grammar rules, I don't see any rule where NT90 is on the right-hand side except in the rewritten version, but perhaps I'm mixing the initial and rewritten rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the rewritten rules with the original. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the original grammar, the rules are in Chomsky normal form, each having two non-terminals except for the base cases. So, all rules are of the form NTa -> NTbNTc, except where a terminal is present.\n\nLooking again at the original grammar rules, I see none except maybe the t rules. But wait, the t rules are on the RHS? For example, in the rewrite, we have NTs sending to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is presented in a way where the left-hand side non-terminals can sometimes produce terminals, making it not strictly CNF. But since the user mentioned it's in CNF, perhaps the initial non-terminals can produce terminals directly.\n\nIn that case, the first symbol 't22' must correspond to a production where a non-terminal NT22 directly produces 't22', but in the provided grammar, NT22 isn't listed as a separate non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the rewritten rules, I see NT90 producing 't22', which suggests that NT90 can be rewritten as 't22'.

{"custom_id":"request-270","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is `t22 t70 t98 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t52 t71 t55 t70 t56`.\n\nFirst, I should parse the grammar to see how it structures the string. The grammar starts with S and can branch into several non-terminals. Each step, non-terminals are replaced by two others until we get to terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can go through multiple paths:\n\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nI'll need to check all possible derivation paths to see if the string can be formed. However, this seems time-consuming, so maybe I can find matching productions step by step.\n\nLet me take the string and break it down into parts that might correspond to the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's list the tokens in the string:\n\nt22, t70, t98, t72, t73 (four times), t18, t31, t16, t52, t71, t55, t70, t56.\n\nI notice that t73 appears four times. In the grammar, NT73 is a terminal (it's 't73'). So that could be one of the initial steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT77 -> nt92 nt85, and NT85 -> nt64 nt12. From NT92, it's 't52', and NT12 becomes 't13'. Hmm, but how do I get t73?\n\nWait, looking at the end symbols, t73 is a terminal, so it's produced by NT73 directly. So in the derivation, I should have places where NT73 is used. Let me see how NT73 is produced.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT73 -> 't73' is not in the given grammar. Oh wait, no: looking through the given productions, I see:\n\nNT73 is not directly a production. Wait, actually, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I have:\n\nNT73 -> 't74' (from NT73 -> NT74, then NT74 -> NT39 NT99, and so on, until it becomes 't74'? Or is NT73 a different non-terminal?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the productions for NT73.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT9 -> 't5'\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me make a list of all the NTs and their terminals:\n\nNT73: Not present except as a terminal? Wait, no. The string has t73, which is a terminal. So in the grammar, any non-terminal that can produce 't73' must have a production that ends with it. So maybe NT73 is such that NT73 -> 't73', or it is derived via some steps.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT73 as a non-terminal. So perhaps it's a terminal. Therefore, during the derivation, at some point a NT must reduce to 't73'.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, NT73 isn't present except as a terminal. So in the grammar, 't73' must be produced by a non-terminal. Let's check:\n\nNT73 is not a non-terminal in the original grammar. The NTs in the grammar are listed first, so perhaps in the original grammar, 't73' is produced by NT73. But in the provided grammar, NT73 is not a non-terminal; instead, 't73' is a terminal.\n\nWait, that might be confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the grammar provided lists the non-terminals as NT49, NT39, etc., and some of them have productions that end with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nFor example, NT9 -> 't5', NT0 -> 't29', etc.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT73 is not listed. Wait, no, looking through the productions, I see:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT73 isn't a non-terminal. Instead, the production for NT73 is 't73'. Wait, no, actually, the grammar seems to have each non-terminal as NT followed by numbers, and each with possible productions. But in the given list, I don't see any NT with ID 73. So maybe I have miscounted.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe list of non-terminals starts with S, then NT49, NT39, NT74, etc. Let me check for NT73. I don't see it. So perhaps 't73' is not part of the grammar's terminals but is an intermediate symbol that can produce 't73'. Wait, that would mean there's an NT73 that produces 't73'.\n\nBut in the given list, there is no NT73, so maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT76: NT76 -> NT2 NT68, which then can produce t49 t76? Or wait, maybe NT76 is derived to 't72'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to map each production step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that 't73' is a terminal, so to produce it, a non-terminal must have a production that directly results in 't73'. If there is no such production, then the string cannot be generated. Wait, but looking through the list, there is no NT that directly produces 't73'. Let me check each non-terminal to see if any produce 't73' via their productions.\n\nLooking through each NT and their productions:\n\n- NT74: produces NT39 NT99\n\n- NT40: produces NT16 NT80\n\n- NT65: NT17 NT53\n\n- NT85: NT64 NT12\n\n- NT57: appears to produce NT85 NT56, but NT56 is also another non-terminal which eventually leads to 't56'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see which NTs end up producing 't73'.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the string, 't73' appears multiple times, so there must be NTs that derive into 't73'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the NT IDs. Let me re-examine the production rules.\n\nI see that in the grammar, NT74 -> NT39 NT99, which then could be further broken down. NT39 -> NT8 NT25, which further goes to NT97-> NT47 NT65, and so on. It gets complex, so maybe an alternative approach is to find a path from S to the string, applying productions step by step.\n\nThe string is: t22 t70 t98 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t52 t71 t55 t70 t56.\n\nLet me start from the left. The first token is t22. Which NT can produce t22? Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT production that results in 't22'. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me look for any NT that can produce 't22'. Scanning through the given production rules, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly leads to 't22'. That's a problem because the first token in the string is t22.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me go through each NT's productions:\n\n- NT74: NT39 NT99\n\n- NT49: NT0 NT47\n\n- NT39: NT8 NT25\n\n- NT77: NT92 NT85\n\n- NT57: NT85 NT56 (twice)\n\n- NT51: NT19 NT18\n\n- NT74 again: NT39 NT99\n\nWait, this is getting too time-consuming. Maybe there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps 't22' is a result of some non-terminal, but I don't see it in the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the end of the string. The last token is 't56'. So we can check if any NT directly leads to 't56'.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT66 -> NT55 NT1, which doesn't lead to 't56'. NT56 is a terminal. Let me see if any NT produces 't56':\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\n- NT56 appears in NT76 production: NT76 -> NT2 NT68.

{"custom_id":"request-286","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is `t56 t71 t73 t56 t52 t56 t71 t55 t93 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t73 t56 t76`.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a single non-terminal symbol. But looking at the grammar, I see rules like S -> NT74 NT44, which fit CNF as each has two non-terminals. However, the presence of 't' strings, like `t74`, `t76`, etc., suggests that these are terminal symbols, as they map to specific values, while non-terminals would be things like NT1, NT2, etc.\n\nWait, but in CNF, the productions can have terminals on the right-hand side. Actually, no, wait: CNF requires that each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So terminals can't appear directly; they must be generated through a series of non-terminals, each eventually leading to a terminal symbol via productions that directly map to terminals.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I notice that some rules like NT70 -> 't74' imply that NT70 directly produces the terminal 't74'. Similarly, other rules like NT12 -> 't85' and NT9 -> 't46' are direct terminal productions.\n\nSo, the approach here is to check if the given string can be derived starting from the start symbol, which is S.\n\nGiven the string, each 't' token is a terminal, so it must be generated by a non-terminal whose production directly maps to that terminal.\n\nStarting with the string: t56 t71 t73 t56 t52 t56 t71 t55 t93 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t73 t56 t76.\n\nI'll split this into individual terminal symbols: [t56, t71, t73, t56, t52, t56, t71, t55, t93, t56, t71, t55, t76, t71, t73, t56, t76].\n\nNow, I'll map these to the non-terminals that produce them:\n\n- t56: From NT44 -> t56\n- t71: NT16 -> t71\n- t73: NT70 -> t73\n- t52: NT92 -> t52\n- t55: NT55 -> t55\n- t92: NT64 -> t92\n- t71: NT16 again\n- t55: NT55 again\n- t93: NT38 -> t93\n- t52: Again NT92\n- t71: NT16\n- t55: NT55\n- t76: NT57 -> t76\n- t71: NT16\n- t73: NT70\n- t56: NT44\n- t76: NT57 again\n\nSo each terminal corresponds to a non-terminal. Now, I need to see if these non-terminals can be connected through productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal (except the terminals themselves) has productions:\n\nStarting with S -> NT74 NT44. NT74 -> NT39 NT99. Then NT39 -> NT8 NT25. NT8 is a terminal (not in the non-terminal list, so wait\u2014this is conflicting. Wait, no: in the grammar, NT8 is a non-terminal, and it's not among the direct terminals. The string doesn't have t8, so maybe NT8 can produce 't8'? Wait, looking back at the grammar, none of the productions directly produce 't8'. Let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, all the terminal 't' symbols that are present are like t74, t76, etc., but 't8' isn't in the list. So if the string contains t8, it's not possible. But in the given string, I don't see any 't8's. Wait, let me re-examine.\n\nThe string given is t56 t71 t73 t56 t52 t56 t71 t55 t93 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t73 t56 t76. So all terms are t56, t52, t55, t59, etc., but wait\u2014do I see any 't8's? Let me check: The string is t56, t71, t73, t56, t52, etc. There's no 't8's in the string, so that should be fine.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT8 is present, and its production is NT8 -> NT69 NT44. Wait, but NT69 -> NT57 NT93. Then NT57 has production NT19 NT99. Let's check if that's valid, but I don't think that matters directly here.\n\nWait, perhaps my first step was wrong. The start symbol S is producing NT74 NT44. So the string must start with the two non-terminals NT74 and NT44. Let's see: the first token is t56, which is from NT44, as per the production NT44 -> t56. So the first part of the string can be matched to the first part of S->NT74 NT44: S -> NT74 NT44.\n\nSo the string starts with t56, so we can have NT44 -> t56. Then we need to see what comes next.\n\nThe second token is t71, which is from NT16. So looking at the grammar, NT16 -> t71. So that's okay.\n\nSo the string so far is [t56, t71].\n\nSo S -> NT74 NT44, which produces t56, and then NT44's next part is... Wait, no, S is a sequence of two non-terminals: NT74 and NT44. Each of these needs to be expanded into the string.\n\nBut wait, no: S is the start symbol, so the entire string is built from S, step by step.\n\nSo let me consider that after S is expanded into NT74 NT44, each of these must derive into parts of the string.\n\nBut wait, that's the initial expansion. So the string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT74 and NT44.\n\nSo for the given string, the first part (t56) is from NT44. Then the next symbols would need to be derived from NT74.\n\nWait, no: S -> NT74 NT44 means S is replaced with NT74 NT44, so each of these non-terminals will be replaced in the next steps, and their derivations will produce the string.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is from NT44, and the second from NT74. Wait, no: S is replaced with NT74 NT44, so in the initial step, the string is built by concatenating the expansion of NT74 and NT44. Each of these is a non-terminal and must be expanded further.\n\nWait, no, the string is a sequence of all the expansions of NT74 and NT44. So after expansion, the entire string is the concatenation of the two expansions. For example, if NT74 expands into 'a' and 'b', and NT44 expands into 'c' and 'd', then S -> NT74 NT44 would produce 'abcd'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the tokens are all in a single sequence. So, perhaps each non-terminal is expanded into a string of terminals and non-terminals, which are then further expanded until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, no: each non-terminal must expand into a terminal or into non-terminals, but in a way that when all non-terminals are expanded, the entire string is built.\n\nBut the given string is a series of terminals, so each non-terminal in the productions must derive into exactly one terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, many non-terminals have multiple productions, some of which produce terminals and some non-terminals. So, for our string, each non-terminal in S's expansion must have a production that leads to exactly the sequence we have.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a parsing problem: starting from S, try to derive the given string.\n\nBut that might be complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-287","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if a specific string is generated by this grammar. The string provided is `t56 t56 t71 t55 t76 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t73 t56 t52 t71 t73 t56 t52`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this structure because each production on the left side of the arrow has exactly two non-terminals except for the terminals, which are terminal symbols.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, many of the non-terminals resolve to specific terminals. So maybe I can parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nLet me list the productions that result in terminals:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85: Wait, no, that's non-terminals. I need to find productions that directly produce 't' symbols. Wait, looking at the list, let me check each production.\n\nWait, the non-terminals seem to resolve into 't' and other NTs. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44: NT74 might resolve into 't56', as in NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, which then goes to NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66, which then NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59, which then NT59 \u2192 NT6, which goes to 't26'? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to map each NT to their terminal or further steps.\n\nI think it's better to create a mapping for each NT that eventually leads to a terminal. Let's look through each production:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85: Both are non-terminals, so that's a two-step.\n- NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56: NT85 might lead to 't40'? Wait, looking for NTs that end with 't'. For example:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59\n- NT59 \u2192 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 't26' (because NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1, and NT55 is a non-terminal, but NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65, etc., which might not lead directly to a 't'. Wait, perhaps I should look for NTs that directly produce 't's.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that some NTs resolve to 't's. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (from NT9 \u2192 't46', etc., but I might need to track this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nWait, the string is the concatenation of 't' and numbers, so perhaps the string is made up of terminals. My approach is to see if the string can be built by the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, which produces NT74 NT44, NT40 NT24, or NT40 NT92. Let's see what each of these produce.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT74 and NT44:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n- NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n- NT8 \u2192 't7'\n- NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 't49' (because NT73 \u2192 't6')? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree. Let's try to find possible sequences in the string that match any part of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t56 t56 t71 t55 t76 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t73 t56 t52 t71 t73 t56 t52.\n\nI notice that t56 appears multiple times. Looking through the grammar, NT56 can produce 't56' directly? Let me see.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 't56', because S \u2192 NT44 in one production. Wait, let's check:\n\nS \u2192 NT44 NT44 would be one possibility. Wait, in the given grammar, S is the start symbol, and looking at S's productions:\n\nS can be NT74 NT44, NT40 NT24, or NT40 NT92. Does any of these resolve to 't's?\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if any of the NTs directly produce 't's. For example, looking at NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59, but NT26 is a non-terminal, so that doesn't help. Maybe I'm missing some NTs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider the parse tree. Let's try to see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nThe string has 17 symbols. Let's see the possible structure.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split recursively. Let's start by splitting the string into parts that could be derived from S.\n\nSince S can be NT74 NT44, which would start with NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, which then splits into NT8 NT25. NT8 is 't7', and NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7. Wait, this might get too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by multiple applications of certain rules.\n\nWait, let me look at the possible terminals in the string: t56 appears 4 times, t71 appears multiple times, t55, t76, t73, etc.\n\nLooking at NT56's production: From the grammar, is there an NT that produces 't56'? Let's check:\n\nFrom the given productions, NT44 \u2192 't56' because S \u2192 NT44 is one production. Wait, no, that's not correct. The productions are for NTs, not for S, unless S is an NT.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which is an NT. So, S can produce combinations like NT74 NT44, so each of those NTs can produce terminal strings.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with NT74 and NT44 producing t56 each time?\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT74 NT44, so each time we have a t56, as NT74 might produce t56 when combined.\n\nBut looking back, in the grammar, NT44 \u2192 't56' is a terminal. So when S uses the production S \u2192 NT44 NT44, each NT44 would produce 't56', resulting in t56 t56.\n\nSo the string starts with t56 t56. That matches the first four symbols of the string. Wait, no, the string starts with t56 t56, but the string is t56 t56 t71 etc., so that's four symbols. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each NT to its possible terminal sequences. For example:\n\nLooking for which NTs produce which terminals:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99 \u2192 NT8 NT25 \u2192 't7' NT28 \u2192 which then would require resolving NT28 to a terminal. But NT28 \u2192 't28'? No, looking through the grammar, NT28 seems to produce 't20' when it's part of another production.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to look for the start symbol S and its possible productions, then see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nSo S can be:\n\n1. NT74 NT44\n2. NT40 NT24\n3. NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these would produce different terminal sequences.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT44 NT44, this would produce 't56' each time because NT44 \u2192 't56'. So the string could look like t56 t56 ... Let me check: the string starts with t56 t56, so that's possible via S \u2192 NT44 NT44. But then after that, we have t71 t55 t76 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t73 t56 t52 t71 t73 t56 t52.\n\nSo after the initial two t56s, we have more t's, which would come from other productions.\n\nLet's see what's next: t71. So perhaps after S \u2192 NT44 NT44, we have another NT that produces t71.\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce t71. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't71' (if any). I don't see NT71's production.

{"custom_id":"request-307","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and the productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the start symbol S must expand into one of these three combinations.\n\nLooking at the string: `t7 t20 t74 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t26 t19 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t6 t92 t56`\n\nEach 't' seems to be a terminal symbol. I need to check if these terminals can be derived from the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the structure. The string starts with t7, t20, t74. From the grammar, let's see which rules can produce t7, t20, etc.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, but looking at the initial productions from S, it's S \u2192 NT74 NT44, so the first two symbols should come from NT74 and NT44. Let's check what NT74 and NT44 expand to.\n\nLooking at NT74 in the rules: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. And NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66. Then NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT99, and NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1. Let's see the terminals that come from NT74:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\nNT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\nNT51 \u2192 NT19 NT99\nNT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57\nNT57 \u2192 NT55 NT61\nNT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65\nNT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61 (Wait, that's recursive)\nWait, let's try to see what NT74 ultimately produces. It seems complicated. Let me look at the right parts leading to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build the parse tree. Starting with S, which is NT74 NT44. So, the string must start with NT74 and NT44. Let me look at the string: first symbols are t7, t20, t74, t73, t73, t73, t18, etc. So, t7 is from NT74, t20 from NT44.\n\nBut wait, NT74 and NT44 are non-terminals. So, their expansion should consist of the terminals in the string. Let me look at NT74's expansion. From the rules:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\nNT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\n\nThen, NT8 is a terminal. So NT39 \u2192 t8 NT25\n\nWait, but NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7, and NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT13, and NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50, etc. It seems like NT74's expansion may not produce t20 directly. Because looking at the string, the next after t7 is t20, which is part of NT44.\n\nWait, perhaps I got this wrong. Let me check the initial productions again. The start symbol S is NT74 NT44, as in rule 1: S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So, the first two non-terminals are NT74 and NT44. Therefore, the parse tree starts with NT74 and NT44.\n\nNow, the string starts with t7, which is the terminal produced by NT74. Then t20, which is the terminal from NT44. Then t74, which is... Wait, no, because NT74 already expanded in the initial production. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the productions. Each production is a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals. So, starting with S \u2192 NT74 NT44, each of these non-terminals must be expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, to get the string, each Nt in NT74 and NT44 must expand to a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: after the initial t7 and t20, the next symbols are t74, t73 three times, etc. But wait, the initial S is NT74 NT44. So the first two symbols should come from NT74 and NT44.\n\nSo the first part of the string should be t7 (from NT74) followed by a symbol from NT44, which should be t20.\n\nBut in the string, t7 is followed by t20, which matches. Then the third symbol is t74, which is part of NT74's expansion?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me look again.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT74 NT44, then the string starts with NT74 and NT44. So, NT74 expands into some terminals, and NT44 expands into others. So the entire string is the concatenation of NT74's expansion and NT44's expansion.\n\nSo, the string is the result of NT74\u5c55\u5f00\u5f97\u5230\u7684 terminals + NT44\u5c55\u5f00\u5f97\u5230\u7684 terminals.\n\nLooking at the initial production rules, let's see what NT74 can derive.\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nThen NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\nLooking at NT8, it's a terminal as per the given data: NT8 \u2192 t8.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\n\nBut NT7 \u2192 t7 (from the rules: NT7 \u2192 t74; wait, wait, checking the rules: Wait, the last rule is `NT7 -> 't74'`\n\nWait, but then NT74 is a non-terminal, and in the rules, NT74 is a terminal?\n\nWait, wait, in the given grammar, some NTs are replaced by terminals. For example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t74\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't74' (the line says \"NT74 -> NT39 NT99\" etc. But the list at the end shows individual rules like NT7 \u2192 't74', meaning NT7 is expanded to a terminal symbol 't74'.\n\nWait, correcting myself: In the rules, each production is broken down, and for a non-terminal, the right-hand side might be a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nFor example, look at the end of the list:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't74'\n\nWhich means NT7 is a terminal, not a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-305","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which has some specific characteristics. In CNF, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. Looking at the provided grammar, it starts with S and the productions are all in the form of two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44, and many NT productions are like NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47, which fits the structure.\n\nThe goal is to decide if the string `t9 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t46 t98 t46 t14 t92 t56` is generated by this grammar. \n\nThe string has 19 tokens, which are mostly 't' followed by a number. Each of these 't' tokens must correspond to a terminal in the grammar. So, my first step is to map each token in the string to a terminal in the grammar. Let me list the terminals in the productions and see which ones are present in the string.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\n- t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t12, t13, t14, t15, t16, t17, t18, t19, t20, t25, t26, t28, t31, t33, t34, t35, t38, t39, t40, t44, t45, t46, t47, t49, t51, t53, t56, t57, t59, t66, t68, t70, t72, t73, t74, t77, t82, t85, t92, t93, t98.\n\nLooking at the string, the 't's are: t9, t73, t18, t59, t6, t46, t98, t14, t92, t56.\n\nNow, the first thing I notice is that in the grammar, each production splits into exactly two non-terminals, meaning each step of derivation replaces a non-terminal with two more non-terminals (until a terminal is reached). So, the entire derivation process starts from S and applies these splits until only terminals remain. Each application of a production adds one more step, increasing the length of the string by one.\n\nWait, actually, when you apply a production, you're replacing one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols doubles each step. However, if the replacement is of a non-terminal that doesn't split further, it ends there. But in this case, all the productions seem to split into two non-terminals. So, starting from S, the length of the string after each replacement would be 2, 4, 8, etc., but that's only if no new non-terminals are replaced at each step. However, in the given string, the length is 19, which is odd, so that might be a red flag because in CNF, each production replaces a symbol with two, so the number of symbols should increase in powers of 2.\n\nWait, 19 is not a power of two, and it's also not 2^k -1 or anything like that. Let me calculate 2^5 is 32, 2^4 is 16. 19 is between 16 and 32. Since each replacement increases the number of symbols by one each time a non-terminal is split, the grammar would generate strings whose lengths are one less than a power of two. Because each split replaces one with two, so each split increases the count by one. Starting with one symbol (S), after one split, we have two, then three, then four, etc., until we reach a certain number. However, the specific length of the string should align with the grammar's structure.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, the length is 19. Let me count: t9, t73, t73, t73, t18, t73, t72, t73, t73, t18, t59, t6, t46, t98, t46, t14, t92, t56. That's 19 tokens. \n\nNow, in the grammar, the start symbol S is only present in the productions as the left-hand side. So the derivation starts with S, which is applied first, and the string should be built from expanding S. Each application replaces a non-terminal with two others. So, for example, starting with S, we can apply one of its productions, say S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Then, each of those NTs can be replaced by further NTs, and so on, until we get to terminals.\n\nBut each time a NT is broken down, it only produces two NTs, not a terminal. So, the process continues until all NTs are replaced by terminals. \n\nWait, but in the given string, the longest terminal is t92, which comes from NT92. Looking at the grammar, NT92 seems to split into NT85 and NT56 (from earlier rules), which further split. Let me see what NT92's production is: Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT92 production that goes to a terminal. Let me check: the productions listed are several, and I see that NT92 is on the left side in some cases. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT56 (Wait, no) wait, let me scan: No, looking through the grammar, it seems that most of the NT productions go to other NTs. For example, NT12 appears on the left side in some productions, like NT92 \u2192 NT85 NT56, which are both NTs. So, does any NT produce a terminal like 't'? Let me check each production on the right side.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66. Not a terminal. NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. Not terminal. NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80. Not terminal.

NT38 \u2192 NT95 NT33. NT40 \u2192 NT25 NT85. Wait, is there a NT that directly produces a terminal that's in the string?\n\nWait, looking again, maybe I didn't check all. Let me look at the productions again:\n\nLooking for any NT production that ends with a terminal. For example, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85. Not terminal. NT92 \u2192 NT85 NT56. Not terminal. NT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12. NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13. So all seem to go further. There's no terminal in the grammar except for the ones built-in?

{"custom_id":"request-334","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t20 t74 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t31 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t22 t70 t26 t74 t56`.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar provided seems to fit this structure; each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nTo tackle this, I think about how to traverse the derivation starting from the start symbol S. The goal is to see if the string can be generated by systematically applying the productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t20`. So I need to see which production can derive `t20`. Scanning through the productions, I find `NT12 -> t85` and `NT20 -> t17` and `NT20 -> t0`. Wait, no, the actual productions for terminal symbols are listed, so I should check NT12 productions. Looking, NT12 -> t85 and another production is NT12 -> t16. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Wait, looking at the productions again, I see `NT12 -> t20` and `NT20 -> t17` and `NT20 -> t0`. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The terminal symbols are written as, for example, `t20`, so I think the productions for NT12 and others that directly produce terminals are what matter here.\n\nWait, looking more carefully at the grammar rules, I see things like NT12 -> 't85', which is a single terminal. Similarly, other NT rules produce terminals. So for the string, each `t` is derived from a specific NT rule.\n\nSo the string starts with `t20`. Looking at the productions, I see that NT20 has two rules: `NT20 -> NT39 NT25` and `NT20 -> NT17 NT57`. Neither of these produce terminals directly, so perhaps I need to see if any of the NTs in there produce 't20' themselves.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I see NT12 -> 't20', and NT20 -> 't17' and 't0'. So maybe NT12 can produce 't20' directly. So perhaps the first token 't20' comes from NT12 -> t20. Then after that, perhaps another NT12 comes into play, but the string has 't74' next.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. To approach this, I can construct a top-down parse tree, starting from S, and see if I can generate the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with `t20`, so we can start by checking if any NT can produce 't20' as the first symbol. Looking through the NT productions, I see NT20 has two rules: `NT20 -> NT39 NT25` and `NT20 -> NT17 NT57`. Both of these produce two non-terminals, so perhaps 't20' is directly a production from another NT. Wait, but looking for a production where an NT directly goes to 't20', I see NT12 -> 't20'. So maybe the first step is having S -> NT44 NT40, but wait, looking at the grammar, S can produce NT44 and NT40, etc. Wait, in the S productions, the options are S -> NT44 NT40, S -> NT11 NT24, S -> NT40 NT92, etc. So none of the initial S productions directly produce 't20' terminals. So the first 't20' in the string must come from a deeper derivation, possibly through NT20.\n\nWait, but the string starts with `t20`, which isn't directly a terminal in the initial S productions. So perhaps I need to see how S can lead to a term that produces 't20'. Maybe through a chain of derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in reverse. Let's see, the last symbol is 't56'. Looking for productions that can derive 't56', I see NT56 -> 't56' (probably a typo, since the symbols are long). Wait, looking back, the productions for NT56 are: NT56 -> 't98' and NT56 -> 't26'. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misreading. The grammar shows, for example, NT12 -> t20, which is a production for NT12 directly. Similarly, NT56 has production `NT56 -> t26`. Wait, no, in the list, I see `NT56 -> NT92 NT40` and `NT56 -> t26`, perhaps? Or is it written differently? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the productions, under NT56, I see `NT56 -> t92` perhaps? I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I need a better approach. Alternatively, since the string starts with 't20', I can consider what NT can produce 't20', then see if the next symbols can be derived accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree would help. The string is quite long, so perhaps breaking it down:\n\nt20 t74 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t31 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t22 t70 t26 t74 t56.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order for clarity:\n\n1. t20\n2. t74\n3. t73\n4. t73\n5. t73\n6. t18\n7. t98\n8. t46\n9. t31\n10. t73\n11. t73\n12. t18\n13. t59\n14. t6\n15. t22\n16. t70\n17. t26\n18. t74\n19. t56\n\nSo, the first step is 't20'. From earlier, I think NT20 can produce 't17' and 't0', but not directly 't20'. Alternatively, there must be a production or a chain that can produce 't20'. Wait, looking again, I see NT12 has a production to 't20', so perhaps the first 't20' is from NT12, so S must derive into something that can lead to NT12.\n\nWait, maybe S can split into S -> NT44 NT40, for example, and then each NT44 and NT40 can be expanded further until we get to 't20'. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts corresponding to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each production in CNF emits two terminals or non-terminals, each step reduces the string by replacing a pair of symbols with two others. But perhaps another approach is to check if the entire string can be split into a sequence of productions applied in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would help, but I'm not very familiar with it, especially with this many symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each symbol comes from a production. For instance, 't20' is a terminal, so it must come from a NT that directly produces 't20'. Looking at the productions, I see NT12 -> 't20'. So perhaps that's the source of the first 't20'.\n\nThen, perhaps the remaining part after 't20' must be derived from the other part. So, after 't20', the next part is 't74 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t31 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t22 t70 t26 t74 t56', which must be derived from the NT that paired with NT12 in S.\n\nWait, S's first production is NT44 and NT40, but the first symbol is 't20', which is from NT12. So perhaps S is not using that first production. Alternatively, maybe S is using another production, but the string starts with 't20', so perhaps I'm taking a wrong approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to see if the string can be split into pairs or sequences that fit the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for where 't20' can be in the string. Since 't20' can be produced by NT20, and perhaps the grammar has some rules that can derive 't20' from other symbols.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT12 -> t20.

Let me break this down step by step. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, but I still have to carefully analyze it.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I see that it's a set of production rules. The start symbol is S, which has several production rules:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo the string we need to evaluate starts with 't7 t26 t74 t73 ...'. The initial 't7' suggests that each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. The key here is to track how these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the given string clearly:\n\nt7, t26, t74, t73, t73, t73, t18, t73, t72, t73, t73, t18, t59, t6, t26, t98, t46, t19, t26, t56\n\nEach 't' is followed by a number, which corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. So 't7' would correspond to NT7's production if NT7 is a non-terminal that can derive to 't7'. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I can note that several non-terminals end in specific terminals. For example, NT7 -> 't74', NT73 -> 't6', NT70 -> 't70' (but in our string, t70 doesn't appear except once, which is at the end...

For example:\n\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85 \u2192 Then NT92 -> 't52', NT85 -> 't64', but that's getting deeper. Maybe it's better to track a parsing strategy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to think of this as a tree and see if the string can be built by the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, we can use a recursive descent approach or a CYK parser, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to look for possible derivations step by step, ensuring that at each step, non-terminals are expanded only when possible.\n\nLet's start with the initial symbol S. The string begins with 't7' and 't26'. So, after expanding S, we should have two non-terminals, right? The grammar for S is S\u2192 NT74 NT44, S\u2192 NT11 NT24, or S\u2192 NT40 NT92.

The string is t9 t73 t73 t18 t98 t92 t26 t31 t22 t38 t56 t45 t9 t98 t46 t8 t46 t72 t26 t56. \n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. This helps because it might be easier to parse the string using techniques suitable for this form, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nI notice that some of the productions are terminal symbols. For example, NT77 -> NT92 NT85, but there's also NT77 -> 't73'. So 't73' is a terminal, and it must correspond to NT77. Wait, looking at the productions, yes: NT77 -> t73. So every occurrence of 't73' in the string must come from that production.\n\nSimilarly, checking other productions, some like NT70 -> t70, so 't70' must come from NT70. So the idea is to use these production rules to derive the string.\n\nI should approach this by trying to build the string step by step, making sure that each part of the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string again: t9 t73 t73 t18 t98 t92 t26 t31 t22 t38 t56 t45 t9 t98 t46 t8 t46 t72 t26 t56.\n\nEach part before a space is a terminal or non-terminal.

Each of these pairs are non-terminals, so we need to see if these can lead to the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first three symbols are t9, t73, t73. The third 't73' is the result of NT77. So perhaps the S production that includes a NT77 would be the way. For example, if S expands into NT40 NT92, and NT92 is t92, but the third t73 is from NT77, which isn't directly connected here. Alternatively, if S is NT49 followed by NT99, and NT49 could produce t49 which isn't present in the string. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me look more carefully. The first part is t9, which comes from NT9, as per NT9 -> t5. No, looking at the productions, I see NT9 -> t5. So 't9' must come from NT9. Then what produces NT9?

{"custom_id":"request-366","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific set of production rules where each rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, with A, B, and C being non-terminals and 'a' being a terminal. This structure simplifies parsing and helps in analyzing the grammar.\n\nThe grammar provided has a start symbol S, and the production rules are all in CNF. The given string to evaluate is: `t9 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t76 t71 t55 t73 t18 t14 t46 t98 t92 t14 t92 t56`. \n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do this, I'll likely need to trace back the string to the start symbol S using the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce 't's (terminals) or combine other non-terminals. The string starts with t9, t73, etc., so I need to see which non-terminals can produce these.\n\nLet me start from the beginning of the string:\n\n1. The first symbol is t9. Looking at the grammar, I see production rules that produce t9. For example, NT73 -> t74, but wait, looking at the list, I see: NT73 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal. Checking the productions for t9, I see NT53 -> t43, but that's not t9. Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, let me search through the grammar for 't9'. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> t5.\n- NT3 -> t7.\nWait, looking thorough, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> t5.\n- NT93 -> t80.\n- NT92 -> t52.\n- NT77 -> t92? No, wait, let's see.\n\nWait, the production NT92 -> t56 appears, but I'm looking for t9. Let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nAh, in the grammar, I see NF92 -> t93. Wait, not t9. Maybe I missed t9 somewhere. Hmm, I might be going about this the wrong way. Maybe I should instead approach this as a parsing problem, seeing if the string can be derived from S.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a top-down parsing using the given grammar. Since it's in CNF, the productions are only two non-terminals and terminals. So each step of the derivation can split a non-terminal into two others or terminals.\n\nBut to do this, I think I need to parse the string from the start, possibly using something like the CYK algorithm. However, since the grammar is given in a list of production rules, it might be easier to parse manually, perhaps starting from the string and breaking it down recursively.\n\nLet me try to parse the string:\n\nThe string is: t9 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t76 t71 t55 t73 t18 t14 t46 t98 t92 t14 t92 t56\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t9. I need to find a production rule that starts with t9. In the grammar, I see NT9 -> t5. So that's a production that creates t5 from NT9. But we have t9, not t5, so maybe NT9 isn't the right non-terminal here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking for a production rule that produces t9 as a terminal. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> t5. That's t5.\n- NT73 -> t74? No, actually, looking at the grammar, I see: NT73 isn't in the list as a production.

{"custom_id":"request-367","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to understand how the non-terminals expand. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal on the right. This form is helpful because it simplifies the process of parsing and checking derivations.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44  \nS \u2192 NT11 NT24  \nS \u2192 NT40 NT92  \n\nSo, S can derive three different sequences of two NT symbols each. I'll need to see how these can eventually lead to the provided string.\n\nThe provided string is: `t9 t73 t73 t18 t19 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t26 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t22 t6 t26 t56`.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the symbols in the string are 'ts' followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, some of these 't's are terminal symbols. Specifically, certain NTs have productions that end with a 't' followed by a number. My task is to see if these 't's can be generated by the NTs.\n\nFor example, NT73 \u2192 't6', so when NT73 is derived, it becomes 't6'. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and NT92 \u2192 't52', NT85 \u2192 't64'. But before that, those NTs need to be further expanded, which might result in 't's as well.\n\nI should try to find a series of derivations that can break down the NTs in the string into the starting symbols S or the terminal 't's with numbers.\n\nLet me look at each part of the string and see what NTs might correspond to it.\n\n1. The string starts with t9 t73 t73. I need to find NTs that can derive 't9' and 't73'. From the grammar, looking at the NT productions:\n\nLooking for NT that can produce 't9': I see NT69 \u2192 't93' (but that's 't93'), NT24 \u2192 't88', NT39 \u2192 't9' according to this: wait, no, looking through the NT productions, I don't see any NT directly producing 't9'. Wait, let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have some entries that might be terminal. For example, NT9 \u2192 't46', NT12 \u2192 't1', etc. So, some NTs directly produce a terminal like 'tX'. I need to check all NTs to see if any correspond to 't9'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT9 is 't46', so no.\n- NT12 is 't1', so no.\n- NT13 is 't31', which is a 't' plus a number. So NT13 is 't31'.\n- NT12\u2192 't85' and 't1', but not 9.\n- Looking for a NT that ends with 't9' but in the given grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't9'. That might be a problem. Because if the first 't9' in the string can't be derived from any NT, then the string isn't possible.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. I see:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT35 NT74  \n- NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40  \n- NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59  \n- NT12 \u2192 NT51 NT20 (but NT12 itself isn't producing t9).\n- Other NTs like NT28, NT59, NT19, etc., but none directly leading to 't9' except for NT35 \u2192 NT88 NT53, and not sure.\n\nWait, looking in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't73'\n\nWait, NT70 is not listed here, but in the given grammar, I think some NTs are broken down further. Let me go through the main NT rules:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\nNT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12\nNT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\nNT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\nNT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\nNT92 \u2192 NT77 NT85\nNT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25\nNT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34\nNT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\nNT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13\nNT35 \u2192 NT88 NT53\nNT53 \u2192 NT45\nNT73 \u2192 prime to 't6'\nNT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\nNT92 \u2192 NT93 NT18? Wait, no. Let me check the given grammar properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the grammar and see if any NT can produce a 't9'. Looking again, the terminals are like t9, t73, etc. I see that NT73 \u2192 't6', so NT73 is definitely a 't6'. What about NT58? No, but in the provided grammar, let me check each rule.\n\nLooking through each NT production:\n\n- NT9 is 't46'\n- NT12 is two options: 't85' and 't1'\n- NT13 is 't31'\n- NT16 is 't71'\n- NT18 has multiple 't's, like 't14', 't76', etc. Wait, the NT rules in the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't9' specifically:\n\nIn the grammar, perhaps NT9 is 't46', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps there's no NT that directly produces 't9', which would be a problem because the string starts with 't9'. If no NT can generate 't9', then the string can't be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the provided grammar, I missed an NT that can produce 't9'. Let me go through each rule again:\n\nWait, I think I see that NT35's production is NT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25. And NT34 \u2192 NT56 NT93. NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40, and NT92 \u2192 't52', NT40 \u2192 't71'. So that's 't52' and 't71', which don't help with 't9'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Looking further down, I see NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1, and NT1 \u2192 't70' (from NT1 \u2192 't70'), which is not t9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check each NT for a terminal symbol:\n\nLooking at all NTs, I see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't92', NT85 \u2192 't64', NT55 \u2192 't47', etc. But I don't see an NT that directly produces 't9'. That's a problem because the string starts with 't9', so unless some NT indirectly leads to it, the string can't be generated.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake here because the string starts with 't9', which in the provided grammar doesn't seem to be produced by any NT. Therefore, the string isn't possible, so the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but let me ensure I'm not missing something. Maybe the first part is 't9 t73 t73', so 't9' must come from some NT. Let me check if any NT in the grammar produces 't9' when fully expanded.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I don't see any NT directly producing 't9'. Therefore, it's impossible for 't9' to appear in the string, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-392","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's see what I can do here.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal. Wait, no, actually CNF can have two symbols, either both non-terminals or a terminal, but in standard CNF, it's typically two non-terminals. But some definitions allow for a single non-terminal as well, but I think in this case, it's using the two symbols approach because the production rules seem to have either two non-terminals or a terminal. Hmm, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, looking again, some of the rules have two non-terminals, like S -> NT74 NT44, S -> NT11 NT24, and S -> NT40 NT92. Then, there are rules like NT49 -> NT0 NT47, which are two non-terminals each. Some rules like NT7 -> 't6' are terminals. So the entire grammar allows for productions that can split into terminals or keep going as non-terminals. \n\nThe string I'm given is `t7 t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t20 t31 t82 t46 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t80 t82 t6 t26 t56`. That's a sequence of twenty tokens, each starting with 't'. Each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. \n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, some of them directly translate to 't's. For example, NT7 -> 't6' is a rule. Similarly, other NT rules like NT12 -> 't85', NT17 -> 't73', etc., have terminals as their terminals. So each NT can either produce a string of two NTs or a single 't' symbol.\n\nSo my task is to see if the entire string can be generated by this grammar, starting from S. To approach this, perhaps I should look for a way to parse the string into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, since each production can generate terminals in a specific way, maybe the string is built by replacing each non-terminal back into its terminal sequence. But I'm a bit confused here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and trying to see if I can find matches for each terminal part. \n\nThe string is:\nt7, t20, t74, t73, t72, t73, t73, t18, t20, t31, t82, t46, t72, t73, t73, t18, t31, t80, t82, t6, t26, t56.\n\nSo 22 tokens in total.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, each NT has a production that eventually leads to a 't' followed by another. Or, for some, it's a fixed 't' value. Wait, no, each NT rule either leads to two other NTs or a 't' followed by a number. Wait, actually, the right-hand sides of the NT rules that are terminals have a single 't' with a number, like NT7 -> 't6', so each NT can derive a single 't' string, which is just one character: 't' followed by a number. So for NT7, the only terminal it can produce is 't6'; for NT20, it's 't85', etc.\n\nBut looking at the string, some terms are multiple 't's, like t7 followed by t20, etc. Wait, but the string actually is a sequence of single 't's, each followed by a number. For example, the first token is t7, then t20, then t74, etc. So that might mean that each of these could correspond to separate NT productions, each generating a single 't' followed by a number, and all of these are concatenated.\n\nWait, but that might not be possible because the grammar might not have productions where an NT can generate just a single 't' token. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking again, most NT productions are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, meaning they split into two NTs. But some NTs, like NT7, have NT7 -> 't6', which is a terminal. So NT7 can only generate 't6' as a terminal string of length 1. Similarly, NT12 -> 't85', which is a single 't85'.\n\nBut in the given string, each term is a single 't' with a number, like 't7', 't20', etc., each of length 1. So in order for the grammar to generate this string, possibly each of these 't' terms corresponds to a production where the NT generates that specific 't' followed by its number, and these are all concatenated.\n\nBut to do this, each of these 't' tokens must be produced by some NT in the grammar. But in the given grammar, some NTs produce a single 't':\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT7 -> 't6'\n\nIs that present? Looking at the grammar list, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't6' is there. Similarly, let me check all NTs that have terminal productions:\n\n- NT7 -> 't6'\n- NT20 -> 't85'\n- NT31 -> 't31' (No, wait, looking back, there's a line that says NT12 -> 't1', for example, but checking:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, I see entries like NT7 -> 't6', NT20 -> 't85', but let's check each:\n\nLooking at each production in the grammar, the ones that end with a single 't' followed by a number:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT7 -> 't6'\n\nSo NT7 can generate 't6', which is a single terminal.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT20 -> 't85'\n\nSo that's another NT that can produce a single 't85' as a terminal.\n\nLooking further, let's check all NTs for any that have a single 't' terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\nLooking back:\n\nIs there NT9 -> 't5'? Yes, one line says NT9 -> 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 -> 't20': yes, that's an NT producing a single 't20' as a terminal.\n\nOther NTs with single terminals:\n\nWait, the grammar as given has:\n\nLooking through the production lines:\n\nLooking for lines where NTx -> 't' followed by a number.\n\n- NT7 -> 't6'\n- NT12 -> 't85'\n- NT58 -> 't64' (Wait, no, looking through, I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT66 -> 't26'\n\nWait, but looking at the list:\n\nLooking through all NT lines, for example:\n\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\n\nWait, but some have 't' as the first symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-408","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: t7 t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t46 t70 t56.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can be a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT49 NT74, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. These non-terminals then break down further into other non-terminals or terminals, and some eventually become terminals like 't7', 't20', etc.\n\nSo the grammar has a binary tree structure where each step combines two non-terminals until they become terminals. My goal is to find a way to parse the given string from the start symbol by recursively applying the productions.\n\nLet me see the string in chunks that might correspond to the non-terminals. The string is: t7 t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t46 t70 t56.\n\nI notice that certain terminal sequences correspond to non-terminals. For example, t77 is derived from NT77, which in the grammar is NT92 NT85. And in the string, looking for a t77 would require t92 followed by t85, but in the string, I see t74 after t73, which are both t's, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by looking for possible non-terminals that can generate parts of the string. For instance, NT77 can produce t92 and t85. Looking for a t92 in the string: Let me scan the string for t92. The string is ... t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t46 t70 t56. I don't see a t92, so maybe that's not the route.\n\nAnother non-terminal is NT74, which is NT39 NT99. So that would produce t39 followed by t99. Looking in the string, after t74 comes t73. Hmm, t39 is not in the string, so that's confusing. Maybe I'm thinking about the wrong non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, the start symbol S \u2192 NT49 NT74. So the first step is to produce two non-terminals. Let me look at the beginning of the string: t7 t20... t7 is from NT7, and t20 is NT20. So does NT49 produce t7 and something else? Wait, looking back, the productions for NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73. So that means NT7 can produce the string t49 followed by t73. But in the string, the first t is t7, which would require NT7, but NT7 is generated from NT49 and NT73.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT49 NT74, among others. Let's consider S \u2192 NT49 NT74.\n\nNow, breaking down NT49 and NT74:\n\nLooking at NT49: The production is NT49 \u2192 NT77 NT39. So that would be t77 followed by t39. But in the string, after t49 is t73, not t77. So that doesn't seem to align. Maybe NT49 has another production? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar for NT79? Let me check again.

{"custom_id":"request-407","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar is presented in CNF, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing. Each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure should make it easier to model the derivation process.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t7 t20 t76 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t93 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t80 t72 t6 t98 t46 t56.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are many production rules for non-terminals NT followed by numbers, eventually leading to terminals like 't' followed by a number or just a single character. Each NT production breaks down into two non-terminals, which in turn produce more until they reach terminals.\n\nMy approach should be to model this as a parsing problem, perhaps using a top-down method like recursive descent, but given the complexity, maybe I can represent the grammar as a graph and check for a path from the start symbol to the string using these rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S can produce combinations of NT rules. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So, the beginning of the string should match one of these S productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t7, t20, etc. Wait, but in the grammar, S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Let me check what NT74 and NT44 produce.\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66.\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18.\n\nSo, NT74 would eventually break down into NT39 and NT99, which then break down into more non-terminals. Each of these eventually reaches terminals like 't' with numbers.\n\nSo, each step, I can replace the non-terminals with their possible terminal sequences and see if it matches the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree by expanding S into NT74, NT44, and then each of those into their components, and so on, until we get terminals and see if they match the string.\n\nBut manually expanding this might be time-consuming. Let me see if I can find a pattern or perhaps use a different approach.\n\nEach production step produces two parts, so the string must be a sequence that can be divided into pairs that match the production rules. So, perhaps for each step in the string, I can check if it can be split into two parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, considering that this is a context-free grammar, it can be parsed via a pushdown automaton. But without setting up the automaton, it might be easier to see if the string can be reduced step by step according to the grammar rules, using reverse steps.\n\nStarting from the given string, perhaps I can look for any two adjacent symbols that form a production rule, then replace the non-terminals with the corresponding terminals.\n\nWait, but the grammar uses non-terminals on both sides, so perhaps it's better to look for sequences that can be matched by the grammar.\n\nLet me list the production rules again to see the available terminals and how they're derived:\n\nFor example, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and NT92 \u2192 t52. NT85 \u2192 t64 to t12 (from NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13, NT13 \u2192 t16, etc.), but looking at the given string, the first few t's are t7, t20, t76, t73, t73, t18, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the top-level production rule, which is S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Then each of these NT's can be further broken down. So, let's see what NT74 and NT44 produce.\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66.\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18.\n\nSo, NT74 breaks down into NT39 and NT99, which in turn break down into more non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT44 \u2192 NT85 NT56.\n\nNT85 \u2192 t64 NT12.\n\nWait, NT12 can be further broken down.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT93 NT70.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t85, we have t56. Let me see.\n\nWait, the given string starts with 't7 t20 t76 t73 t73...' So maybe the first part is S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which then breaks down into their respective components, and each of those into their parts, until we get to the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the string step by step, applying the grammar rules to see if each part can be generated.\n\nBut perhaps a systematic way is to write down each possible production and see if the string can be split accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps using a recursive approach, trying each possible split at each step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string is: t7 t20 t76 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t93 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t80 t72 t6 t98 t46 t56.\n\nLet me see the first part: t7. Is there a production that directly leads to t7? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t7. The only production for t7 is in 't73', which is NT73 \u2192 't6'. So t7 isn't a terminal; it must be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, the grammar has productions like NT73 \u2192 't6', but do any non-terminals produce 't7'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT77 \u2192 't64' and 't85', but not 't7'. Similarly, NT76 \u2192 't49' and 't64', but 't49' is NT49, which doesn't produce 't7'. Wait, maybe somewhere deep in the productions, perhaps via some chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't7' is produced by some non-terminal. Let me check all the productions for terminals. Each NT production ends with a terminal, except for some cases where NT is followed by a digit. Wait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't6'\n- NT12 \u2192 't1' (in some rules, but earlier it's nt12 \u2192 NT93 NT70. Hmm, no.

The string is: \n\n`t7 t26 t74 t73 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t52 t71 t73 t56 t14 t46 t56`\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, it seems that all non-terminals expand into either two terminals or two non-terminals, which aligns with CNF.\n\nThe string is a series of terminal symbols, which are all 2-character strings like 't7', 't26', etc. So I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI'll start by trying to work backwards since the grammar is in CNF. That way, I can see if the string can be derived by breaking it down into the smallest possible units.\n\nLet's take the last symbol: 't56'. Looking at the productions, I see that '56' appears multiple times. For example:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 t56\n- NT44 \u2192 t56\n- NT59 \u2192 t6 (but 6 isn't a terminal in our string)\n- NT51 \u2192 t98 (98 isn't in the string)\n- NT40 \u2192 t44 is in NT40? Wait, looking at the productions, NT40 has multiple options: looking at NT40: it can produce NT16 NT80, NT69 NT45, etc. Not sure about 56, but 44 might be from NT40 production.\n\nWait, looking for NT that produce 't56'. There's:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 t56\n- NT44 \u2192 t56\n- Also, looking at NT16: does NT16 have a production that includes a 't56'? I don't see it. Next, looking at NT92: NT92 can go to t56, but does NT92 also produce something else? Yes, in the grammar, NT92 is used in other productions, like S \u2192 NT92 NT85, so it's possible that NT92 is expanded to t56. Similarly, NT44 \u2192 t56, so both NT92 and NT44 can produce 't56'.\n\nNow, looking at the string before that: ... t56 (the last symbol). The one before that is 't14'. Hmm. So let's think about the entire string.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the string is 24 symbols long. Since each production in CNF replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^k for some k, since each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols. Wait, no\u2014that's the opposite. In a derivation, each non-terminal is expanded into two symbols, so the length doubles each time. So if the initial string is a single non-terminal, after one step, it's two symbols, then four, eight, etc. So 24 isn't a power of two, which suggests that the initial string might not be reachable. But wait, perhaps the initial string isn't derived from S; perhaps it's part of a longer derivation. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the structure of the string. Each terminal is a two-character code, like 't7', 't26', etc. So the length is 24, which is even, 24=2*12, which might fit with the grammar.\n\nWait, but the starting symbol is S. Let's see how the derivations go from S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can be written as:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo S can go to two non-terminals, each being NT74, NT11, or NT40, followed by another NT.\n\nEach NT must eventually produce a terminal or another pair. So, for the string to be generated by S, it must consist of the concatenation of the two sequences produced by each NT in each production.\n\nSo first, the string is split into two parts, each being the result of expanding each NT. For example, if the first NT (e.g., NT74) produces a string A, and the second NT (e.g., NT44) produces string B, then the overall string is A concatenated with B.\n\nLooking at the given string, it's 24 symbols. So each part (A and B) would be 12 symbols each, since 12 +12=24.\n\nWait, but NT74 and NT44 would each produce some number of symbols. Since each expansion is context-free and each node could split into two, the total number of terminals depends on how each NT expands.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each NT's expansion is of a particular pattern. Let's look at the individual NT productions to see how each NT can be expanded.\n\nLet me check each NT to see what production rules they have.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n- NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\n- NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n- NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57\n- NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n- NT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12\n- NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13\n- NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\n- NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40\n- NT92 \u2192 NT39 NT93\n- NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n- NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56 (duplicate)\n- NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57\n- NT88 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46\n- NT90 \u2192 NT22\n- NT12 \u2192 NT93 NT70\n- NT39 \u2192 NT88 NT53\n- NT40 \u2192 NT44 NT98\n- NT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61\n- NT50 \u2192 NT18 NT85\n- NT38 \u2192 NT95 NT33\n- NT12 (duplicate) \u2192 NT51 NT20\n- NT35 \u2192 NT34 NT25\n- NT11 \u2192 NT87\n- NT69 \u2192 NT93 NT64\n- NT68 \u2192 NT90 NT38\n- NT20 \u2192 NT39 NT25\n- NT39 \u2192 NT90 NT1\n- NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT90\n- NT35 \u2192 NT88 NT53 (duplicate)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT25 NT85 (duplicate)\n- NT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73\n- NT18 \u2192 NT76 NT91\n- NT93 \u2192 NT66 NT64\n- NT18 \u2192 NT19 (duplicate)\n- NT20 \u2192 NT39 NT25 (duplicate)\n- NT20 \u2192 NT0 (duplicate)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT13\n- NT69 \u2192 NT93 (duplicate)\n- NT68 \u2192 NT82 (duplicate)\n- NT7 \u2192 NT74 (duplicate)\n- NT66 \u2192 NT26 (duplicate)\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 (duplicate)\n- NT90 \u2192 NT22 (duplicate)\n- NT12 \u2192 NT16 (duplicate)\n- NT39 \u2192 NT9 (duplicate)\n- NT92 \u2192 NT52 (duplicate)\n- NT1 \u2192 NT70 (duplicate)\n- NT24 \u2192 NT88 (duplicate)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT26 (duplicate)\n- NT59 \u2192 NT6 (duplicate)\n- NT47 \u2192 NT72 (duplicate)\n- NT92 \u2192 NT56 (duplicate)\n- NT53 \u2192 NT45 (duplicate)\n- NT12 \u2192 NT11 (duplicate)\n- NT66 \u2192 NT46 (duplicate)\n- NT51 \u2192 NT98 (duplicate)\n- NT44 \u2192 NT56 (duplicate)\n- NT9 \u2192 NT5 (duplicate)\n- NT13 \u2192 NT31 (duplicate)\n- NT57 \u2192 NT18 (duplicate)\n- NT53 \u2192 NT45 (duplicate)\n- NT92 \u2192 NT76 (duplicate)\n- NT76 \u2192 NT2 NT68 (duplicate)\n- NT17 \u2192 NT73 (duplicate)\n- NT16 \u2192 NT71 (duplicate)\n- NT69 \u2192 NT93 (duplicate)\n- NT18 \u2192 NT7 (duplicate)\n- NT93 \u2192 NT56 (duplicate)\n- NT18 \u2192 NT19 (duplicate)\n- NT20 \u2192 NT78"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-432","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's see. The string is: t22 t70 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t26 t73 t73 t18 t14 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t85 t6 t26 t19 t46 t56.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. That usually makes it easier to parse, and I can use something like the CYK algorithm if needed, but maybe I can work it out manually.\n\nLooking at the string, I see tokens like t22, t70, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, some of these t's are terminal symbols. For example, in the grammar, NT7-> t6, so NT7 is a non-terminal that can produce 't6'. So when I see a 't' followed by a number, I need to check if the corresponding NT can produce that terminal.\n\nWait, let me list all the NTs and their productions. For example, the grammar starts with S, which is the start symbol. Let me write down all the production rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, S \u2192 NT40 NT92.\n\nThen the rest are for NTs like NT49, NT39, NT77, etc., each splitting into two NTs. Finally, many of the NTs produce terminals like 't74', 't93', etc.\n\nSo the string starts with t22, t70, t73, etc. So t22 and t70 must be produced by some NT. Looking at the grammar, I see that some NTs go directly to t's. For example, NT9 \u2192 t5, NT12 \u2192 t16 and t1 (from two different productions). Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT7 \u2192 t74. So NT7 generates 't74'. Similarly, NT12 has two productions: NT12 \u2192 t1 and t16. Wait, or is it something else? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar is more complex. For example, NT12 has a production like NT12 \u2192 NT28 NT73, which also eventually leads to producing t12. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to parse the entire string step by step using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can count how the non-terminals expand into the terminals. The string has 25 tokens, and the grammar starts with S which produces two NTs. Then each of those NTs would produce two other NTs or a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree. Let's see:\n\nThe main string is: [t22, t70, t73, t73, t73, t18, t98, t26, t73, t73, t18, t14, t73, t72, t73, t73, t18, t31, t85, t6, t26, t19, t46, t56]\n\nSo I think the strategy is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar, step by step. Let's think about the possible paths.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t22. Looking at the grammar, which NT produces t22? Checking the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing t22. For example, NT53 is in the grammar, but I don't think any of the rules produce t22. Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT47 \u2192 t72, and NT92 \u2192 t56, and so on. But t22 isn't directly produced by any NT. That might be a problem because the string starts with t22, which may not be in the language. Wait, no, the string starts with t22, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules for all NTs. I need to make sure none of them produce the necessary t tokens. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t22. So if t22 is the first symbol, then the grammar can't generate it, which would mean the string isn't part of the language.\n\nWait, but that might not be entirely true. Perhaps some NTs expand into a chain that eventually produces a terminal. Let me see if that's possible. For example, does any NT eventually produce t22?\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NTs that directly produce t22. Let me check each production rule to see if any NT leads to t22. Scanning through, for instance, NT51 produces NT26 NT59, and NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50, and so on. I don't see any rules that lead directly or indirectly to t22. So the first token t22 can't be generated, which means the entire string isn't in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe I've made a mistake. Am I sure that t22 isn't produced by any NT in the grammar? Let me check all production rules again. Going through each NT, I don't see any that produce t22. So the conclusion is that the string starts with t22, which is not possible, so the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t7 t20 t74 t73 t73 t73 ...` and so on. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain analyses easier.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's a set of productions where non-terminals (like S, NT49, NT39, etc.) are on the left, and on the right side, they're either split into two non-terminals or end with terminals (like 't74', 't20', etc.). So each production either expands into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t7 t20 t74 t73 t73 t73 ...`. My goal is to see if there's a way to derive this string starting from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the initial production, S can derive into two of the NT rules:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo the grammar has three starting points. Let me consider each case.\n\nFirst, looking at the string, the first token is `t7`, `t20`, `t74`, etc. So I need to see if these can be generated by any of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check the NT rules that produce 't7'. Scanning through the productions, I don't see an NT directly producing 't7'. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nAh, wait, there is NT7 \u2192 't74', which is one of the productions. So NT7 is a non-terminal that can produce 't74'. But does any NT produce 't7'? Scanning through, I don't see any NT rule that directly ends with 't7'. So maybe 't7' isn't directly possible. Hmm, that's a problem because our string starts with `t7`.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check all the NT productions for any that end with 't7'.

So if the string starts with `t7`, how is that possible? Because all the NTs either go to other NTs or terminals, but none of them directly produce 't7'. So either the string isn't possible, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again. Oh, wait, looking at the NT47 production: NT47 \u2192 NT55 NT65. And then, looking further down, NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT61. Hmm, that's a cycle between NT47 and NT55. Similarly, NT50 \u2192 NT18 NT85, but no NT85 production seems to directly end with 't7'.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any of the NTs can produce 't7' through their productions, even if it's multi-step. For example, if an NT produces another NT which in turn produces a terminal.\n\nBut looking carefully, none of the NT productions directly produce a terminal that starts with 't7'. So unless there's a way to produce 't7' via a chain of non-terminals, which seems impossible given the current rules, the string starting with `t7` can't be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking for 't7'. Wait, let me check all NT productions again.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't74' (yes, so 't7' is 't74', but that's 't7' not '7')\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused between the letters and the numbers. Let me clarify.\n\nEach NT has rules; for example, NT7 has a production that produces 't74', which is a string starting with 't7', 't4', etc. So 't74' is a terminal sequence, right?\n\nWait no, 't74' is a single terminal symbol. So in the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't74' means that the non-terminal NT7 can be replaced by the terminal string 't74'.\n\nSo if the grammar has a production NT7 \u2192 't74', then the string 't74' can be produced. However, in the given string, the first part is `t7 t20 t74 ...`, which includes 't7' as a separate token. So that can't be from NT7 because NT7 produces 't74', which is one token, not two.\n\nWait, but in the string, the user has written the string as a sequence of `t7 t20 t74 ...` which are individual terminals. So each is a separate token in the input string. Therefore, the first token is 't7', then 't20', then 't74', and so on.\n\nSo the input string is `t7 t20 t74 t73 ...` etc. Each is a separate terminal token, meaning each is a single terminal symbol.\n\nNow, to see if the grammar can produce this string, each symbol in the string must be produced directly by some NT. But looking back at the grammar, the only NTs that produce single terminals are the ones where the production ends with a terminal string.

{"custom_id":"request-448","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what a context-free grammar is. CNF means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. This structure is particularly useful for parsing, but here I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S, which has three productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these productions involves NT symbols which are non-terminals. So the parsing will involve breaking these NT symbols down until we reach the terminal 't' followed by numbers, which are the actual characters in the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t7 t26 t74 t73 t18 t20 t31 t22 t31 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t76 t71 t73 t56 t5 t72 t92 t56`\n\nI notice that each 't' is followed by a number, which are essentially terminals. So each 't7' would correspond to the terminal symbol consisting of 't' followed by '7'. Now, I need to see if each of these can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the main NT symbols and their productions to see how they break down:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n- NT44 \u2192 NT56 NT93\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n- NT24 \u2192 NT64 NT40\n- NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\n- NT92 \u2192 NT64 NT90\n- NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n- NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n- NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85\n- NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65\n- NT76 \u2192 NT2 NT68\n- ... etc.\n\nEach NT symbol eventually resolves into terminals or more NT symbols until we get to the terminals like 't7', etc.\n\nI'll start by looking at the string and seeing which NT symbols correspond to the substrings.\n\nThe first symbol is 't7'. Let's see which NT in the grammar can produce 't7'. Looking at the grammar, there's an NT7 which eventually becomes 't7' because of NT7 \u2192 't7' somewhere. Wait, in the grammar, is there an NT7? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT74 \u2192 ... But I don't see an NT7 directly. Instead, I see things like NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, but that doesn't help. Hmm, maybe I'm missing NT7 here. Alternatively, maybe 't7' comes from NT7, but I don't see NT7's production. Wait, perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, let me look again. Actually, in the productions, I don't see an NT7. Instead, some NTs reduce to 't7' directly, like NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, and then each of those might further resolve.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see an NT7. Instead, I see NT74, NT77, NT76, etc. So where does 't7' come from? Looking through the productions, some NT symbols resolve directly to 't7', like NT74 reduces to NT39 NT99, then NT39 \u2192 NT90 NT1, and NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66, etc. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't7' comes from NT77, but I'm not seeing that. Alternatively, I might have missed the production that sends NT7 to 't7'. Let me scan through the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, at the bottom of the grammar, I see entries like NT7 \u2192 't74', but no, looking again, I see:\n\nWait, the grammar's bottom productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't74'\n\nWait, looking at the end, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nSo NT7 \u2192 't74', which would produce the terminal 't74'. Similarly, NT12 \u2192 't20'. But I'm looking at the string 't7', not 't74'.\n\nWait, that might be a key point. The string has 't7', which would require an NT that produces 't7'. Let me check the grammars.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- I don't see an NT7, but NT74 produces 't74'. So maybe 't7' doesn't appear anywhere. Wait, but that would mean the string has 't7' which doesn't have a corresponding NT symbol. Hmm, that could be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading some NT symbols. Let me check again. In the grammar, looking at the very bottom:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT71\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT50\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT6\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT59\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused. Wait, let's list all the NTs and their corresponding bottom symbols:\n\nLooking at the end, I see lines like:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT12 -> 't85'\n\nNT17 -> 't73'\n\nNT16 -> 't71'\n\nNT69 -> 't93'\n\nNT18 -> 't14'\n\nNT93 -> 't80'\n\nNT18 -> 't19'\n\nNT20 -> 't17'\n\nNT20 -> 't0'\n\nNT28 -> 't20'\n\nNT69 -> 't93'\n\nNT68 -> 't82'\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT66 -> 't26'\n\nNT9 -> 't46'\n\nNT90 -> 't22'\n\nNT12 -> 't16'\n\nNT39 -> 't9'\n\nNT92 -> 't52'\n\nNT1 -> 't70'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't88'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT59 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT92 \u2192 't93'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't7'\n\nWait, here it is: NT8 \u2192 't7'. So NT8 produces 't7'. That's good because the string has 't7'.\n\nSimilarly, let's check other 't's in the string:\n\n- First: t7 \u2192 comes from NT8.\n\nNext: t26 \u2192 looking at the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT71. But then, do any of these produce t26? Hmm, perhaps I need to see which NT8 is part of.\n\nAlternatively, looking for NT8: NT8 \u2192 t7. But to get t26, I need to see if NT26 can produce 't26', but in the grammar, I don't see NT26 producing 't26', but instead, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT71. Then NT68 \u2192 NT90 NT38, and NT71 \u2192 NT16 NT55. Hmm, perhaps 't26' comes from another NT symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's list each symbol in the string and see how they can be derived.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. 't7' \u2192 as discussed, comes from NT8.\n\n2. 't26' \u2192 need to find an NT that produces 't26'. Looking, I don't see an NT26 in the top-level symbols, but perhaps it's a derived symbol. Let's check the productions. Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, in the production rules, I don't see NT26 being a left-hand side. Instead, looking at the starting symbols, S has NT74, NT11, NT40, etc. So, maybe NT26 arises from expanding one of these.\n\nWait, maybe I should work backwards. Let's see each part:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt7 t26 t74 t73 t18 t20 t31 t22 t31 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t76 t71 t73 t56 t5 t72 t92 t56\n\nThat's 23 symbols.

Hmm, let's break this down. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the string consists of. It looks like a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which are likely terminal symbols. The non-terminals are labeled NT followed by numbers, like NT77, NT49, etc. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals seem to have productions that eventually lead to terminal symbols. For example, NT49 -> NT0 NT47, and then NT0 -> NT77 NT34, and so on until we hit terminal symbols. So, each non-terminal eventually resolves to a sequence of terminals. \n\nThe string starts with t22, which should come from some non-terminal that can produce t22. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT66 -> t26, but I don't see an NT directly leading to t22. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the rules again. \n\nAh, no, there's no production that directly leads to t22. Hmm, maybe t22 comes from a non-terminal that eventually produces t22. Or perhaps t22 is part of a longer chain of productions that ultimately result in the string. \n\nWait, let me see. The start symbol is S, which produces combinations of NTs: S -> NT74 NT44, S -> NT11 NT24, etc. So the string must be generated by starting from S and expanding each NT into terminals.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t22 t70 t73 t73... Maybe t22 comes from a production like NT22 -> t22. But in the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t22. The non-terminals that lead to t22 might not be present.

Do any NTs lead to t22? Checking the rules, I don't see an NT whose production includes t22 directly. The only production that starts with t22 is... nowhere. So if the string starts with t22, that's impossible because there's no rule that produces t22 from any non-terminal. \n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it begins with t22, which isn't produced by any rule in the grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which directly expands into NT49 NT74, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. So, S is the root, and the string should be built up from these.\n\nEach of these NT non-terminals then expands into other NT symbols and eventually into terminals (letters like t, n, etc.) or more non-terminals. My goal is to parse the string step by step, seeing if I can break it down into the non-terminals according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the string:\n\nt22 t70 t73 t73 t73 t73...\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several NT symbols expand into a pair of terminals. For example, NT12 is 't16', NT17 is 't73', which is also useful because t73 appears multiple times.\n\nWait, the first token is t22. Let me check the grammar to see which NT symbols produce t22. Scanning through, I see that NT91 expands into t93, t73, and also t22? Or looking more carefully, I see NT91 has a rule to 't93' but not directly t22. Maybe I'm misreading. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar again, I see NT91 is defined as NT64 NT90. Then NT64 is NT65 NT13, NT53 is NT43 NT..., Hmm, this could get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should look through all the terminals first to see where t22 comes from.\n\nLooking through all NT productions, I find that NT66 -> NT55 NT1, and then NT55 -> NT47 NT65. Also, NT65 is NT17 NT55, which is recursive, leading me to think that perhaps t22 isn't directly from an NT production but maybe indirectly. Wait, actually, looking again, I see that some NT productions directly terminate to a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, each rule is between two NTs, or a terminal. The terminals seem to be a lot. For example, NT92 is 't56', NT40 is 't55', NT0 is 't29', NT12 is 't16' or 't1', etc. So, many NTs expand into terminals, which are the 't' strings.\n\nSo, for t22, I need to find which NT symbol expands directly into it. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT91 has a production: NT64 NT90, but that doesn't directly give t22. Let's see:\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan the rule definitions again. Wait, in the grammar provided, the NT59 is defined as NT66 NT50, and NT51 is NT26 NT59. Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing t22 directly expand. Maybe I should look specifically.\n\nLooking through, I see that NT92 has a production NT76 NT71. NT77 is NT92 NT85 or others, but perhaps t22 is produced by some NT. Alternatively, perhaps t22 isn't directly a terminal of any NT but is in a chain.\n\nWait, no, looking carefully, each production ends in a terminal or another NT. So for the string to start with t22, there must be an NT that directly produces t22, or a path of NTs leading to t22.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, for instance, NT53 has a production to t43, but that's not relevant. Let's check NT91: It's NT64 NT90. NT64 is NT65 NT13, and NT13 is NT28 NT7. NT7 is NT49 NT73, which in turn are NTs. This seems recursive. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t22 is from NT12? But looking at the grammar, NT12 can be 't16' or 't1' or other NTs. Wait, according to the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> NT51 NT20\n- NT20 -> NT39 NT25\n- NT25 -> NT28 NT7\n- NT7 -> NT49 NT73\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n\nYes, here it is: NT12 has a production that is NT51 NT20, which is further expanded, but also directly terminal as 't1'. So t1 can come from NT12.\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT12: \"NT12 -> NT20\", or \"NT12 -> 't1'\". So directly, NT12 can be 't1' or other NTs.\n\nSimilarly, looking for where a production directly yields 't22'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> 't20' or other NTs\n- NT65 -> 't17' or other NTs\n- NT95 -> 't35' or other NTs\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT53 -> 't43'\n- NT70 -> 't82' or other NTs\n- NT77 -> 't93' or other NTs\n- NT51 -> 't98'\n- NT11 -> 't87' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a rule. Let me re-examine the provided grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, here's a rule: NT64 -> NT65 NT13. NT65 is NT17 NT55, and NT13 is NT28 NT7. NT28 is NT26 NT7. So that seems like a chain. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps some rules directly produce t22.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's see if the entire string can be represented as products of the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t22 t70 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t31 t98 t22 t70 t20 t74 t76 t56 t71 t73 t56 t52 t71 t55 t19 t92 t56.\n\nLet me split the string into individual tokens:\n\n[t22, t70, t73, t73, t73, t73, t18, t98, t46, t31, t98, t22, t70, t20, t74, t76, t56, t71, t73, t56, t52, t71, t55, t19, t92, t56]\n\nSo, there are 27 tokens in total.\n\nI'll try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nStart with S. The options for S are:\n\n1. NT49 NT74\n2. NT40 NT11 NT24 (Wait, no. Wait, looking back, the original grammar. Oh wait, no, S in the grammar is defined as three productions:\n\n- S -> NT49 NT74\n- S -> NT11 NT24\n- S -> NT40 NT92\n\nWait, that's incorrect.

{"custom_id":"request-491","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of symbols ending with 't' followed by numbers, like `t56 t56...`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a production form where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal symbol. In CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the productions do follow this, like S \u2192 NT74 NT44, where NT74 and NT44 are non-terminals. However, some productions have terminals on the RHS, like NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, the RHS can have two terminals. So NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85 is fine because both sides are non-terminals. But I'm not sure if the grammar strictly follows CNF, but given that the user stated it's in CNF, I should proceed with that.\n\nNow, the task is to check if the given string can be generated by this grammar. The string is `t56 t56 t20 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t93 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t93 t71 t55 t56 t71 t73 t56 t93`.\n\nWait, I should note that in the grammar, there are several productions that directly produce a single terminal, such as NT77 \u2192 t93 (assuming it's a typo, seeing as the user listed NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, but others have 't's). For example, NT77 \u2192 t93 t80 or others ending with t.\n\nBut actually, looking back, the user listed several productions ending with 't' followed by a number. Like NT92 \u2192 t52, NT1 \u2192t70, etc. Each of these corresponds to a terminal symbol (like t74, t20, etc.) followed by a non-terminal or another terminal. Hmm, perhaps the grammar is designed such that each production either sends a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, to see if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to reverse-engineer the parse tree starting from S, and see if the entire string can be produced through a series of productions.\n\nThe string starts with t56, t56, t20, t74, t73, t73, ..., ending with several t56 and t73 etc.\n\nFirst, looking at the string, let me write it down:\n\nt56, t56, t20, t74, t73, t73, t18, t31, t16, t93, t56, t56, t71, t73, t56, t56, t71, t73, t56, t93, t71, t55, t56, t71, t73, t56, t93.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, except possibly the last 't56' etc. Wait, but in the grammar, do any non-terminals produce a single terminal? Looking at the grammar, I see that some NTs go to terminals like NT77 \u2192 t93 t80, but others go to two non-terminals. So t93 is a terminal, as are t71, t73, etc.\n\nSo the string is a series of terminals, each is of the form tnnn, which seems to be a sequence of terminals.\n\nI need to see if each t in the string can be generated by a production starting from S.\n\nBut considering that the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since it's CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, with exactly two symbols on the RHS (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in CNF, it's either two non-terminals or a single terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, Chomsky Normal Form requires that the RHS is two non-terminals or one terminal. So any production in CNF should produce either one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking back, the grammar provided has some productions like NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, which is two non-terminals. Other productions like NT92 \u2192 t52, which is a terminal. So that's allowed. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nTherefore, the length of the string must be either equal to the number of non-terminals expanded via these productions. Since S is the starting symbol, and each production either produces two non-terminals or one terminal. Therefore, the parse tree must derive a string of terminals whose count is 2^n, where n is the height of the tree, but actually, each step can produce two terminals or one. Wait, no: each production either produces two non-terminals (like A \u2192 BC) which will each be expanded further until they produce terminals. So the number of terminals is equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which depends on how many non-terminals are expanded into terminals versus those that are split into two non-terminals.\n\nBut in this case, each S\u2192NT74 NT44, which are two NTs. Each of these NTs will produce either a terminal or split into two more NTs.\n\nSo the string's length is 28 symbols. So the parse tree would have a structure that leads to 28 terminals. Since each NT production can either produce a terminal (reducing the count by 1) or two NTs (increasing the count by 1). Starting from S, which is one NT. Each NT can produce either:\n\n- A terminal (count increases by 1, but that's not right because it's adding a terminal, but actually, each NT production contributes 1 terminal. Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nEach terminal in the string consumes one production that directly produces that symbol. Each non-terminal production might split into two non-terminals, which could lead to more terms.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of terminals is equal to the number of non-terminals expanded into terminals, but that's probably too vague.\n\nBut perhaps instead of focusing on the length, I should try to see if the sequence of terminals can be produced by the given grammar.\n\nLet me list the string:\n\nt56, t56, t20, t74, t73, t73, t18, t31, t16, t93, t56, t56, t71, t73, t56, t56, t71, t73, t56, t93, t71, t55, t56, t71, t73, t56, t93.\n\nThat's 28 symbols.\n\nGiven the starting symbol S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So the first two symbols should come from NT74 and NT44. Let's see, S produces NT74 and NT44. So the first two elements in the string are t56, t56. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nLooking into the grammar, which NTs produce t56? Let me search for any productions ending with t56.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT56 is not present as a non-terminal in the given productions, but wait, I see NT55 \u2192 t59 NT74, which is a production with a terminal and a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-493","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is \"t56 t20 t74 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t18 t14 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t6 t92 t31 t11 t76 t71 t73 t56 t52\". \n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for parsing because it simplifies the structure, making it easier to apply algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm doing this manually, I need to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions only involve S being broken down into NTs (non-terminals) and terminals. The string provided consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals in the grammar.\n\nI notice that each 't' in the string corresponds to a production rule ending with that 't'. For example, NT56 \u2192 t56, which means whenever there's 't56' in the string, that part of the string must have been derived from NT56.\n\nNow, looking at the string, I can break it down into individual tokens: t56, t20, t74, t73, t73, t73, t73, t18, t73, t73, t18, t14, t73, t73, t18, t31, t1, t6, t92, t31, t11, t76, t71, t73, t56, t52.\n\nI need to check if each of these 't's can be generated by the grammar. So essentially, each token must be the terminal produced by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't56'. Looking through the productions, I see NT56 \u2192 t56. So t56 is valid. Next, t20: checking the productions, there's NT20 \u2192 t20? Looking through, I don't see an NT20 production. Wait, looking back at the productions, I see NT20 appears in NT53 \u2192 t43, no, that's not right. Wait, let me scan the productions for NT20. It says NT20 \u2192 NT93 NT27? Wait, no, the list isn't complete. Wait, I'll scan the given productions:\n\nLooking for NT20, the productions are: NT20 \u2192 NT93 NT71, NT20 \u2192 t17, and NT20 \u2192 t0. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the productions are:\n\nWait, looking through the productions listed, I see:\n\n- NT20 appears in NT53 \u2192 t43?\nNo, actually, going through the entire list, I see:\n\nLooking for NT20:\n\nI see several instances of NT20 as the left-hand side, but what are their productions?\n\nYes, in the productions, I see NT20 \u2192 t17 and NT20 \u2192 t0. So NT20 can produce t17 or t0. But in the string, the second token is t20, which doesn't match any production rule. So that's a problem. Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, the string starts with t56, then t20. So the second token is t20. But looking through the productions, is there an NT that produces t20?\n\nLooking through the list provided:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT47 NT6, which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, let me check each NT to see if any of them produce t20.\n\nLooking through all NT entries, I don't see any NT with a production ending in t20. For example:\n\n- NT20 occurs only as a left-hand side in multiple productions, but the right-hand sides are either combinations of NTs or in terminals as t17, t0, etc. Wait, in the productions listed, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT91 (from the grammar list)\n- NT20 \u2192 t17 (I think so? Let me check: looking for NT20 in the productions, I see NT20 \u2192 t17 and NT20 \u2192 t0, as per the list: yes, NT20 \u2192 t17 and t0.\n\nSo, there is no NT that directly produces t20. Therefore, the second token in the string is t20, which cannot be generated by any production rule in the grammar. Hence, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The second token is t20, so in the grammar, I need to find an NT that produces t20. But from the list, I see that NT20 produces t17 and t0, but there's no NT that directly produces t20. Therefore, t20 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, since the second token is t20, which is not present, the entire string is invalid. So the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI see multiple NT20 productions on the left-hand side, but the right-hand sides are either combinations or terminals. The only terminals are 't's with numbers, like t56, t20, etc. For NT20, the productions are:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT91 (I think), which are both NTs, so they don't produce terminals. Then, later in the list, I see NT20 \u2192 t17 and NT20 \u2192 t0. So, yes, NT20 can produce t17 or t0, but not t20. Therefore, t20 can't be generated, which means the string is invalid.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-510","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces: \"t22 t70 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t18 t26 t31 t82 t73 t73 t18 t31 t22 t92 t73 t18 t19 t72 t73 t73 t18 t70 t19 t26 t56\". \n\nFirst, I remember that in context-free grammars, especially in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule produces at most two non-terminal symbols. Looking at the grammar, it's set up in CNF because the left-hand side of each rule is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides are pairs.\n\nEach non-terminal can produce two symbols, which can be either other non-terminals or terminals. The final output is the string of terminals derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe goal is to reduce the string from the start symbol S by matching the production rules. Each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two symbols that match a production rule, working backwards until we reach S.\n\nThe process is a bit like parsing, where we check if the string can be derived step by step. I can try to reverse-engineer this by starting from the entire string and dividing it into segments that could come from the productions.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules to see how each non-terminal can produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n- NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n- NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66\n- NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18\n- NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57\n- NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n- NT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12\n- NT12 \u2192 NT93 NT70\n- NT93 \u2192 NT66 NT64\n- NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1\n- ... and so on until we hit terminals like t6, t73, etc.\n\nWait, the terminals are in lowercase starting with 't' followed by a number, like t73, which appears in several productions. For example, NT73 is 't73' and NT7 \u2192 't74', which then goes further.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t22. I need to see which non-terminal can produce 't22'. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT91 \u2192 't22'. So 't22' comes from NT91.\n\nSo starting from the beginning, we have 't22', which must have come from NT91. Now, looking at the production for NT91: NT91 \u2192 NT64 NT90. Wait, no, in the grammar, it's NT91 \u2192 't22', but actually, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar doesn't have a rule where NT91 directly produces 't22'\u2014actually, looking at the provided grammar, I think 't22' comes from NT91, which itself is a terminal. So the production for NT91 is: NT91 \u2192 't22', but let me check. In the provided rules, I see NT91 \u2192 't22'? Let me check. Oh, yes, under the grammar, there's an entry:\n\nNT91 -> 't22'\n\nSimilarly, elsewhere:\n\nNT12 -> 't85'\n\nNT39 -> 't9'\n\nNT66 -> 't26'\n\nWait, no: Actually, some of the grammar entries are under NT2, NT9, etc. Let me parse the grammar rules correctly.\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit scattered in the provided text. Some entries are like:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT18 -> 't14'\n\nNT93 -> 't80'\n\nNT18 -> 't19'\n\nWait, that\u2019s confusing. Each line is a production for a non-terminal, consisting of two non-terminals on the right. However, some exceptions are given where a non-terminal is directly a terminal, like NT7 \u2192 't74', meaning that NT7 can produce the terminal 't74'.\n\nSo, each of the grammar's lines starts with a non-terminal and then has a production consisting of two non-terminals, except for some cases where it's just a terminal? Wait no, in context-free grammars, each production is a rule where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side can be any sequence of terminals and non-terminals. But in this case, it looks like the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, let me look. For example, the first rule is S \u2192 NT74 NT44. That\u2019s S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which is a non-terminal followed by another non-terminal. But S is the start symbol. Wait, perhaps the grammar is using a different form. Or maybe the NTs are terminals? That can\u2019t be because NTs are part of the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the NTs are non-terminals, and the symbols after the NTs are either NTs or terminals, depending on the production.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44\n\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\n\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nThen, NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47\n\nAnd so on. So each NT is a non-terminal, and the productions can result in other NTs. But some lines have a non-terminal equal to a terminal:\n\nFor example, NT91 -> 't22'. So 't22' is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT12 -> 't85'\n\nNT35 -> 't34'\n\nWait, that doesn\u2019t make sense because 't34' is another terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, some lines have a non-terminal mapped to a terminal, like:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't19'\n\nWait, but in context-free grammar, a non-terminal can have a production that is a single terminal as well. So for example, if a non-terminal A has a production A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal, that's allowed.\n\nBut in this grammar, many of the productions have two non-terminals on the right, which makes it in CNF.\n\nSo, to find if the string is generated by this grammar, I need to see if each token in the string can be matched by the productions, starting from S.\n\nBut wait, the string is a sequence of terminals, like 't22 t70 t73 t73...', so the string is a series of terminal symbols. So the parsing would involve breaking this string into pairs that match the productions.\n\nEach step in reduction would involve replacing a non-terminal with a pair of symbols, which can themselves be non-terminals or terminals. So in the reverse direction, for each token in the string, we would need to find which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nBut actually, it's more complicated because each production is left-associative and in CNF. So each step in the reduction would split the string into two parts: the left part and the right part.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build a parse tree from the tokens and check if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order:\n\n1. t22\n2. t70\n3. t73\n4. t73\n5. t73\n6. t18\n7. t73\n8. t18\n9. t26\n10. t31\n11. t82\n12. t73\n13. t73\n14. t18\n15. t31\n16. t22\n17. t92\n18. t73\n19. t18\n20. t19\n21. t72\n22. t73\n23. t73\n24. t18\n25. t70\n26. t19\n27. t26\n28. t56\n\nThe string has 28 tokens.\n\nLet me start from the beginning. The first token is t22.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT91 \u2192 't22', as per the list.\n\nSo t22 must come from NT91. Now, NT91's production in the grammar might be something else, but in the list, there's a rule for NT91 \u2192 't22', which is a terminal. Wait, but according to the grammar, each production rule for a non-terminal either has two NTs or a terminal.\n\nWait, the grammar has multiple lines where a single NT is a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't22'\n\nSo perhaps this means that NT91 can produce 't22'. Similarly, if another production for NT91 exists, it could produce other things.

This structure simplifies parsing because it avoids the need for epsilon productions, which can complicate things.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the top symbol is S, which then branches into several other non-terminals: NT49, NT39, NT77, NT57, NT74, NT40, NT65, NT85, NT55, NT76, NT57 again, NT38, NT64, NT35, NT12, NT91, NT34, NT0, NT19, NT88, NT66, NT91, NT65 again, NT25, NT80, NT61, NT68, NT20, NT35 again, NT26, NT2, NT95, NT56, NT51, NT12 again, NT39 again, NT70, NT35 again, NT40 again, NT47, NT50, NT38, NT40 again, NT7, NT18, NT93, NT18 again, NT20, NT39 again, NT70, NT35 again, NT88, NT53, NT40 again, NT47 again, NT50 again, NT38 again, NT40 again, NT7, NT18 again, NT93, NT18 again, NT20, NT39 again, NT70, NT35 again, NT92, NT72, NT9, NT90, NT12 again, NT39 again, NT70, NT35 again, NT40 again, NT7, NT18 again, NT93, NT18 again, NT20, NT39 again, NT70, NT35 again, NT40 again, NT7, NT18 again, NT93, NT18 again, NT20, NT39 again, NT70, NT35 again, NT40 again, NT7, NT18, NT93, NT18 again, NT20, NT39 again, NT70... Wait, this seems like a lot. I notice that some of the rules are repeated, like NT57 -> NT19 NT99 and NT57 -> NT55 NT65. That might be a typo or perhaps different rules, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nNext, the string starts with `t26`, so looking at the grammar, I see the non-terminal NT26. In the grammar, NT26 is defined as NT65 NT50. Let me check the productions for NT65: from NT65 -> NT17 NT19 and NT66 -> NT55 NT13, but there's also NT65 -> NT17 NT55. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT65 -> NT17 NT19 and NT68 -> NT90 NT38, but I don't see NT65 -> NT17 NT55. Oh right, no, wait: looking at the grammar, I see NT50-> NT18 NT85, NT51-> NT26 NT59, and NT26-> NT65 NT50. So yes, NT26 is NT65 NT50.\n\nSo to derive `t26`, NT26 must be used and resolved into NT65 NT50. Then, each of those must be resolved further until we get all terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, after t26 comes t56. Let's see what's on the right side. So, from NT26->NT65 NT50, we get `t65 t50`. Now, let's check where NT65 and NT50 go.\n\nLooking at NT65: from the grammar, it has two productions: NT65->NT17 NT19 and NT66->NT55 NT13, but wait, no, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Wait, the original grammar has:\n\nNT65 -> NT17 NT19  \nNT68 -> NT90 NT38  \nNT26 -> NT65 NT50  \nNT95 -> NT35 NT74  \nNT56 -> NT92 NT40  \nNT51 -> NT26 NT59  \nNT12 -> NT51 NT20  \nNT35 -> NT11 NT77  \nNT26 -> NT65 NT50  \nNT2 -> NT28 NT13  \nNT95 -> NT35 NT74  \nNT56 -> NT92 NT40  \nNT51 -> NT26 NT59  \nNT12 -> NT51 NT20  \nNT35 -> NT11 NT77  \nNT26 -> NT65 NT50  \nNT2 -> NT28 NT13  \nSo, wait, let me list all NT65's productions:\n\nNT65-> NT17 NT19  \nIs there another rule for NT65? No, it only has one rule in the provided list. So, once it's resolved, it's NT17 NT19. Both NT17 and NT19 are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT17: the grammar says NT17-> NT73 NT93. So each of NT17 and NT19 can be split.\n\nBut wait, let's see: NT19 has a production NT19->NT70 NT73. So NT17 and NT19 are both two-symbol rules.\n\nSo, starting with NT26, which becomes NT65 NT50.\n\nNT65 becomes NT17 NT19.\n\nNT17 becomes NT73 NT93.\n\nNT19 becomes NT70 NT73.\n\nSo, from NT26, we get:\n\nt26 -> t65 t50 -> (t17 t19) (t70 t73) -> (t73 t93 t70 t73)\n\nWait, so t26 branches into t17 t19, each of which branches further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to model the parsing as a series of symbol expansions, ensuring that each step brings us closer to the full string.\n\nBut rather than doing that for the entire string, which could take a lot of time, maybe there's a better approach. Perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of symbols and check if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother way is to model the possible derivations step by step, tracking what each non-terminal could expand into. Given that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single non-terminal or a pair of non-terminals, so the process of expanding should follow a certain order.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the concept of a parse tree, starting from the root symbol S and seeing if the string can be built as a result of the productions.\n\nWait, the string starts with t26. So looking back, the non-terminals must begin with t26, so there must be a derivation starting with S or one of its children leading to t26.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the children of S are NT49, NT39, etc. Let's see:\n\nS -> NT49 NT74  \nS -> NT39 NT25  \nS -> NT40 NT92  \nSo the first symbol after S's expansion must be one of NT49, NT39, or NT40.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t26, which comes from NT26. So, for the string to start with t26, the first step of the derivation must be a production that leads to NT26 somewhere, but the root symbol is S, which doesn't produce t26 directly.\n\nWait, this seems confusing. Let me think about it.\n\nWait, S is the start symbol and it produces other non-terminals. So when S is expanded, it generates a sequence of non-terminals, which then get expanded further into terminals.\n\nSo the initial expansion is in terms of S -> something, which then leads to a string of non-terminals that eventually derive into the given string.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t26, which is generated from NT26. But if S's expansion starts with t26, then S must expand to NT26 followed by something else.\n\nWait, looking at the S productions, none directly produce t26. Let me check all S's productions:\n\n- S-> NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-531","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is quite long, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that the start symbol can also be a terminal. But looking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the productions are of the form NTxx \u2192 NTyy NTzz, which fits CNF. However, I see some terminals mixed in, like when some rules produce literals such as 't6' or 't74'. So, that's normal in CNF where non-terminals expand into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t9 t73 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t85 t76 t71 t73 t56 t19 t26 t31 t98 t0 t93 t71 t55 t14 t92 t56.\n\nI assume each of these tokens separated by spaces is a terminal symbol. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has the following productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these productions is a combination of two non-terminals. So, the string must be generated by expanding S through these rules, possibly recursively, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first symbol is 't9'. Let's see if any production for the non-terminals that could generate 't9' are present. Scanning through the grammar, I notice that NT9 is a non-terminal. Wait, no, looking again, I see that some NTs expand into t-something. For example, NT9 is written as 't9' in one rule. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, there are rules like NT9 \u2192 't9', right?\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, I see a rule like:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't9'\n\nBut in the string, I see a 't9' as the first symbol. So, could the first NT9 in the start symbol's expansion produce 't9'?\n\nWait, the start symbol S expands to NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92. So, for each of these, I need to see what non-terminals they produce.\n\nFor example, if I take the first production: S \u2192 NT74 NT44. Then, each of these non-terminals would need to expand into the string. But looking at the string, the first symbol is 't9', which might not necessarily come from NT74 or NT44.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another production for NT74 or NT44 leads to 't9' somewhere down the line.\n\nWait, but let's look at the grammar rules for NT74. Oh, here it is: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. Then NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25, and NT99 \u2192 NT51 NT66. Following that, NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT18, and NT18 \u2192 't14' (looking back at the rules). Wait, no, in the rules, I see NT18 \u2192 't14', NT19 \u2192 't73', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can trace a path from S to the string. But this might get complicated because the string is quite long, and tracing each step might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be divided into a sequence of tokens that correspond to the right-hand sides of the grammar productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t9 t73 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t85 t76 t71 t73 t56 t19 t26 t31 t98 t0 t93 t71 t55 t14 t92 t56.\n\nI notice that several terminals repeat, like t73, t18, t56, etc. So maybe these correspond to specific productions. For example, t73 seems to appear often. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT73 \u2192 't74' and other rules, but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a rule NT73 \u2192 't74', but in the string, there's a t73. So that might not directly come from NT73. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe another non-terminal produces t73.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT50 \u2192 NT18 NT85, but no, that leads to NT50 expanding into others. Wait, looking at the rules, I might need to list all the possible terminals that can be generated.\n\nWait, let me compile a list of all terminals that appear in the grammar:\n\nFrom the given rules, the terminal symbols are:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t3, t6, t7, t8, t9, t13, t14, t16, t17, t18, t19, t20, t26, t28, t31, t33, t35, t38, t40, t44, t45, t47, t49, t50, t51, t53, t55, t56, t57, t59, t61, t66, t68, t69, t70, t71, t72, t73, t74, t76, t77, t78, t80, t82, t85, t88, t90, t91, t92, t93, t98.\n\nWait, hold on. Some of the terminals may be missing if I miscounted. For example, 't74' is in NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, and then NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25. So, if any of these expand into a terminal like t74, but in the string, I don't see t74 except as part of NT74. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that in the second line, NT73 \u2192 't74'. Wait, that's a rule: NT73 \u2192 't74'. So, NT73 can produce 't74'. But in the string, the first symbol is 't9'. So how does that fit in?\n\nWait, perhaps the start symbol S must expand into a combination of non-terminals, and each of those non-terminals must expand into a sequence of terminals. So, perhaps each production from S is two non-terminals, each of which must derive a substring in the given string.\n\nFor example, if the first production S \u2192 NT74 NT44 is chosen, then NT74 must generate the first part of the string, and NT44 must generate the second part. Similarly, if S \u2192 NT11 NT24 is chosen, then NT11 and NT24 generate the respective parts, and so on.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't9', so I need to see if 't9' can be produced by any of these non-terminals. Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see a direct rule for NT9 \u2192 't9', except for 't9' appearing in the production for NT59 \u2192 't6', but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar rules more carefully. The user provided a very long list of rules, and I might have missed some. Let me scan through them again.\n\nLooking for terminals, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't77'\n- NT1 \u2192 't70'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT6 \u2192 't76'\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\nWait, no, looking more closely, I see that NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and in another rule, NT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1, but no, 't73' is a terminal and appears as NT73 \u2192 't74'? Or is that a rule?\n\nWait, checking the list, I see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't74'\n\nSo, yes, NT73 \u2192 't74', which is a terminal. So if any non-terminal can lead to NT73, then it can produce 't74'.

{"custom_id":"request-533","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make parsing easier, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm, but since this is a single string, perhaps a more straightforward approach is possible.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t56 t71 t55 t56 t56 t56 t71 t55 t56 t56 t71 t55 t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t73 t56 t93`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of several tokens starting with 't' followed by numbers. The grammar has a mix of non-terminals (NTs) and terminals. For example, rules like S -> NT11 NT24 suggest that S is rewritten with two NT productions, which might further break down into more NTs and eventually into 't's and numbers.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the initial symbol is S, which can split into various combinations of NTs. Each NT then can either split into more NTs or end up producing a terminal (like 't' followed by a number), which is an atom (e.g., t56 is a terminal produced by NT56).\n\nMy plan is to see if the given string can be derived starting from S. To do this, I can try to map the string tokens to the grammar, ensuring that each part of the string corresponds to a valid derivation.\n\nLet me break the string down into individual tokens:\n\n1. t56\n2. t71\n3. t55\n4. t56\n5. t56\n6. t56\n7. t71\n8. t55\n9. t56\n10. t56\n11. t71\n12. t55\n13. t56\n14. t26\n15. t74\n16. t73\n17. t73\n18. t18\n19. t31\n20. t16\n21. t76\n22. t56\n23. t71\n24. t55\n25. t76\n26. t71\n27. t73\n28. t56\n29. t93\n\nNow, the string has 29 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step generates two non-terminals. So, the initial S produces two NTs, each of which can further split into more NTs or terminals.\n\nBut thinking recursively, the number of tokens should correspond to a certain number of splits in the grammar. For example, starting with S, which splits into two NTs, each of those could split into more NTs, leading to a binary tree structure. The total number of tokens would be 2^(n+1)-1 where n is the number of productions, but it's easier to see that each step can double the number of tokens, but perhaps not exactly, because it depends on non-terminals being split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parsing tree bottom-up, but that's complicated.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps use the fact that in CNF, each production is of two non-terminals, so the string can be considered as a sequence of pairs that correspond to the productions. However, since the string may involve multiple levels of splits, it's not straightforward.\n\nLet me check the grammar rules to see which NTs produce which terminals. Looking through the grammar, I notice that some NTs produce specific 't' with numbers:\n\nFor example, NT47 -> t72, NT56 ->t55, NT52 -> t46, etc. Wait, actually, the grammar rules have 't's as follows:\n\nWait, looking more closely, some of the grammar rules end with t, like NT7 -> t74, NT12 -> t1, NT24 -> t88, etc. So for example, NT7 -> t74, which is a terminal production. Similarly, NT12 -> t1, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, looking at the string, all tokens start with 't', which are probably the terminals produced by certain NTs.\n\nSo the idea is to map each 'tXYZ' token back to the NT rule that produces it. For example, t56 must come from NT56, which needs to be checked if it's a terminal or has a production.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I need to see which NTs are terminals. Wait, in the grammar given, the production rules are like S -> NT11 NT24, which suggests that NT11 and NT24 are non-terminals. Then, looking at the terminals present in the string, they are all 't' followed by numbers. Let me check the grammar to see which NTs produce these terminals.\n\nFor example, in the grammar:\n\n- NT7 -> t74 (terminal)\n- NT12 -> t1\n- NT24 -> t88\n- NT26 -> t74\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT74 -> t73\n- NT18 -> t19\n- NT3 -> t?\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT productions that produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT7 -> t74\n- NT12 -> t1\n- NT24 -> t88\n- NT26 -> t74\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT95 -> t35\n- NT56 -> t55\n- NT92 -> t56\n- NT77 -> t92\n- NT57 -> t56\n- NT53 -> t43\n- NT33 -> t8\n- NT43 -> t45\n- NT92 -> t96\n- NT91 -> t46\n- NT18 -> t14\n- NT66 -> t26\n- NT9 -> t46\n- NT12 -> t16\n- NT39 -> t9\n- NT26 -> t20\n- NT69 ->t93\n- NT74 ->t73\n- NT85 ->t64\n- NT68 ->t82\n- NT2 ->t28\n- NT66 ->t66\nWait, maybe it's better to list all NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the ones that end with 't' are as follows:\n\n- NT7 -> t74\n- NT12 -> t1\n- NT24 -> t88\n- NT26 -> t74\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT95 -> t35\n- NT56 -> t55\n- NT77 -> t92\n- NT57 -> t56\n- NT53 -> t43\n- NT33 -> t8\n- NT43 -> t45\n- NT92 -> t96\n- NT91 -> t46\n- NT18 -> t14\n- NT66 -> t26\n- NT9 -> t46\n- NT12 -> t16? Wait, NT12 is a non-terminal. Wait in the grammar, NT12 is not listed as a terminal. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, let me look through all the grammar rules again to list the NTs that produce terminals (t followed by numbers):\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each line is of the form NTx -> y z or NTx -> tyy.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT7 -> t74\n- NT12 -> t1\n- NT24 -> t88\n- NT26 -> t74\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT95 -> t35\n- NT56 -> t55\n- NT77 -> t92\n- NT57 -> t56\n- NT53 -> t43\n- NT33 -> t8\n- NT43 -> t45\n- NT92 -> t96\n- NT91 -> t46\n- NT18 -> t14\n- NT66 -> t26\n- NT9 ->t46\n\nWait, in the given grammar, are there any other 't's?

{"custom_id":"request-551","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to figure out how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like the non-terminals are all the NT... and the string starts with S, so the entire string should be derived from S. The productions in the grammar are all of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTwy. Each production takes two NT symbols and replaces them with two others.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t56 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t52 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t55 t31 t16 t56`. So each symbol after 't' is a terminal.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. But in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, B \u2192 CD, etc. Wait, no, in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C, A are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, it's all NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTwy, so that fits because NT are non-terminals and the right-hand side is two NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, the productions like NT77 -> NT92 NT85 seem to have NTs on both sides. So each production is a non-terminal (NTxy) that produces two other non-terminals (NTxz and NTwy) which eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nSo the process of derivation is similar to parsing, but perhaps in reverse. The string is a sequence of terminals, and each non-terminal must expand into the corresponding parts.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the approach is to see if the string can be broken down into the parts that correspond to the productions. Since all the non-terminals eventually lead to terminals, I can work backwards by checking if the string can be split into parts that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each NT production expands into two other NTs. So for the string to be generated, it must be composed of a series of such expansions. Each terminal in the string comes from a non-terminal's terminal production.\n\nSo, step by step, I can try to parse the string from left to right, or maybe from right to left, since each production's right-hand side is two non-terminals, which themselves can be broken down.\n\nLet me consider the string as a sequence of terminals: t56, t26, t29, t72, t6, t73, t73, t18, t31, t11, t56, t26, t74, t73, t73, t73, t73, t18, t31, t11, t52, t56, t71, t55, t76, t71, t55, t31, t16, t56.\n\nSo 33 terminals in total.\n\nGiven that S starts with NT49 and NT74. Wait, S is defined as NT77 -> NT84 NT44, but in the grammar definitions, S expands to two NTs. So when S is produced, it's replaced by two NTs, and each of those NTs are replaced by more NTs, until we get to the terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the first line is S -> NT77 NT84. Wait, no, the first line in the grammar is S -> NT77 NT84? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, looking back: the first production is S->NT77 NT84? Wait, no, in the given grammar, the first line is:\n\nS -> NT77 NT84? Or is it another? Wait, the user wrote:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT77 NT84\nWait, looking back, I see the user's grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT77 NT84\nWait no, the user wrote: Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait no, the user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar: S-> NT77 NT84 S-> NT77 NT84 ...\"\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nS -> NT77 NT84\nS -> NT77 NT84\nS -> NT77 NT84\n...\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me check.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT77 NT84\nS -> NT77 NT84\nS -> NT77 NT84\n...\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.

Maybe I misread.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as follows:\n\nS -> NT77 NT84 (three times)\nThen each NT... production is listed.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because S would have only one production, so the grammar is:\n\nS can produce NT77 followed by NT84, or nothing. That can't be right because that would mean the only string generated is \"nt77 nt84\" in some form.\n\nBut in the string we have, the first part is t56, etc. So perhaps I misread.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a formatting mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-548","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is a sequence of symbols: `t56 t20 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t80 t82 t52 t56 t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76 t56 t71 t73 t56 t76 t71 t73 t56 t76`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this grammar is. CFGs in Chomsky Normal Form have each production rule as either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see several rules, each starting with S, NT, or T, and ending with a terminal.\n\nWait, some of the grammar rules end with NT or S, but the specific form would depend on how they're written. I should parse through each rule to see how symbols are generated.\n\nLooking closer, the grammar seems to have a mix of non-terminals (NTs) and terminals (t followed by numbers). Each production seems to expand non-terminals into other non-terminals and eventually terminals. The T's seem to represent the terminals, which are the 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, so I'll need to see if S can derive this string. Each production for S is:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo S expands into two NTs. Each of these NTs must then expand further until we get to terminals.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts and see if I can find a way each part is generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t56. Looking at the grammar, I need to see which production can generate 't56'. Scanning the terminals, I notice that some NTs like NT56 or NT76 might be involved.\n\nWait, looking at the NT56 rule:\nNT56 -> NT92 NT40 \u2192 So NT56 -> NT92 NT40. Then each of those would have to expand further.\n\nBut 't56' is a terminal, so it must be a production of NT56. But in the grammar, I see a rule NT56 -> NT92 NT40. So NT56 can't directly produce 't56'; it has to produce other non-terminals. Unless one of the downstream non-terminals can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at all the terminals and their possible origins. Let's list out all terminal symbols in the grammar and their possible NTs:\n\n- 't53' \u2192 NT53\n- 't54' \u2192 NT54? Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT becomes 't53' or 't54'... Hmm, maybe I'm missing some.\n\nWait, perhaps each terminal is generated by a specific NT. For example, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't43'?\nNo, not directly. Wait, perhaps I should map each terminal to their NT.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the NT rules produce other NTs or terminals. So each time a NT is expanded, if it's in the left-hand side of any rule, it's an intermediate step.\n\nBut perhaps some NTs directly produce terminals. Let's check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT53 -> 't43'\n- NT55 -> 't47'\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- NT47 -> 't72'\n- NT51 -> 't98'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT39 -> 't9'\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT57 -> 't18'\n- NT47 -> 't72' (duplicate)\n- NT92 -> 't56'\n- NT70 -> 't82'\n- NT35 -> 't91' (multiple definitions)\n- NT19 -> 't76'\n- NT20 -> 't17', 't0', 't16', 't76 t maybe?\nWait, no, looking more carefully, perhaps some NTs produce terminals.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals present in the string and see if they have corresponding NT productions:\n\n- 't56': NT56 \u2192 t56 exists? Looking at the grammar, I see NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40, but no direct rule for NT56 \u2192 t56. Wait, in the grammar, is there any rule that produces 't56'?\n\nLooking through all the terminals, I notice that in the string, 't56' occurs a few times. I need to see if any NT has 't56' as a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at all the NTs and their possible terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT70 -> 't76' \u2192 NT70 can produce 't76'.\n- NT18 -> 't14', 't76', etc. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at each rule:\n\n- NT70 -> 't76' (Is this correct?)\n\nWait, the rule is NT70 -> 't76'? No, scan through the given rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see anything like NT70 \u2192 t76. Wait, perhaps that's incorrect. Maybe I should double-check the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, the rule `NT70 -> 't76'` is present?\n\nNo, I can't find that. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's see.\n\nWait, looking through the rules as given in the problem:\n\nLooking for 't56', 't20', 't74', etc.\n\nWait, let's go through each string token and see what NTs they come from.\n\nFor example, the first token is 't56', which must be produced by some NT. Looking through the rules, the NT with a rule ending in 't56' is NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40, but that's an internal step. Alternatively, is there an NT that directly produces 't56'? From the given rules, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't56' except possibly NT56, but that would require that NT56's rule ends in some terminals. Alternatively, NT56 may produce other non-terminals which might lead to 't56' through a chain.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's try a different approach.\n\nEach step of expansion uses the grammar rules. So starting from S, which can expand to NT74 NT44, NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92.\n\nLet's try to see if any of these can generate the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work from the string backwards, trying to reduce it using the grammar rules. That is, start from the end of the string and see if it can be reduced to S using the reverse of the grammar rules.\n\nBut that might take a while, but perhaps it's more systematic.\n\nThe string is: `t56 t20 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t80 t82 t52 t56 t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76 t56 t71 t73 t56 t76 t71 t73 t56 t76`.\n\nLooking at the first symbols: t56, t20, t74, t73, t73, t18, t31, t80, etc. Let's try to match these against possible NT productions.\n\nWait, let's first look for any terminals that directly come from NT productions. For example, if any NT ends directly in t56, t20, etc.\n\nLooking through the terminals in the string, I notice that 't56' appears multiple times. Let me check if any NT has 't56' as part of its production.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't43'\n- NT54 \u2192 Does any NT produce 't54'? Looking through, I don't see any.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT rules and their terminal outputs.\n\nHere's a comprehensive list:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44: NT74 and NT44 expand further.\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24: NT11 and NT24.\n3.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It seems a bit complex, but I notice that many non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT7->'t6', NT12->'t85', and so on. These terminals are 't' followed by a number. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t7 t26 t56 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t52 t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t31 t16 t52 t71 t55 t80 t72 t6 t73 t18 t19 t46 t56`. I'll need to parse this string according to the grammar. \n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, top-down parsing (like using the CYK algorithm or something similar) might work, but I'm not sure.

Because the first symbol is 't7', which would require a rule like NT7->'t7', but the grammar provided doesn't have that. That would imply that the string can't be generated, right?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the rules.

The first symbol is t7, but if there's no rule that produces t7, then it's impossible. But let's check all the terminal symbols in the string.

{"custom_id":"request-573","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I have to determine if a particular string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like 't56 t56 t26 ...' and so on. I need to figure out if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar structure. CNF grammars have each production rule on the left side of the arrow as a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 aB or A \u2192 Ba.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that each production rule starts with something like S \u2192 NT74 NT44. So the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals, NT74 and NT44. Then, each of these non-terminals can further expand into other symbols until we reach terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string given is a series of 't's and three-digit numbers, ending with 't6'. Each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. So, for example, 't56' must correspond to a production where a non-terminal expands into 't56'.\n\nMy goal is to see if each 't' in the string can be traced back through the grammar. Each step should consume two symbols (non-terminals or terminals) and produce the next two in the string.\n\nLet me start by parsing the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt56 t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t85 t76 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t76 t26 t74 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t93\n\nSo the first part is 't56 t56'. I need to see if the grammar can generate these two 't56's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT56 is a non-terminal that can produce 't8' and 't55'. Let me check:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40\n\nAnd looking at NT92 and NT40, their productions are:\n\nNT92 \u2192 NT64 NT12\nNT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13\n NT13 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, no, let's look deeper. Each NT has its own productions.\n\nLet me build a parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with 't56' from the first symbol in the string. Since 't56' is a terminal, that must come from a production that starts with a non-terminal that expands into 't56'.\n\nLooking at NT56's productions:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40\nNT40 \u2192 NT44 NT98\nNT44 \u2192 NT66 NT64\nNT66 \u2192 NT55 NT1\nNT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65\nNT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\nSo this path seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, is there another production for NT56?\n\nLooking at the list provided, I see:\n\nWait, under the grammar rules, I have:\n\nNT56 -> NT92 NT40\n\nThen, NT92 can produce other things.\n\nNT92\u2019s productions:\n\nNT92 \u2192 NT64 NT12\n NT12 \u2192 NT16 NT90\n NT90 \u2192 NT12 NT22\n NT12 \u2192 't16'\n NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13\n NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\n NT13 \u2192 't2'\nSo, from NT56 producing NT92 and NT40, and NT92 can go to NT64 and NT12. Then NT40 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the NTs and their possible terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to start from the start symbol S and see how it can produce the string.\n\nS can produce NT74 and NT44.\n\nLooking at NT74:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\nNT25 \u2192 NT28 NT7\nNT28 \u2192 NT26 NT13\nNT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT19\n\nWait, NT26 is not a terminal. Let me trace this:\n\nSo, from NT74, we go to NT39 and NT99.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 (terminal) and NT25 (non-terminal).\n\nNT8 \u2192 't7' (terminal).\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT28 and NT7.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT26 and NT13.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT65 and NT50.\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 and NT19.\n\nWait, so this seems like a long chain, but let's see:\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT74 can produce 't7' and something else.\n\nBut that's not directly obvious. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be represented as a series of pairs, with each pair generated by an NT production.\n\nLet me split the string into pairs:\n\nt56 t56 \u2192 (t56, t56)\n\nt26 t74 \u2192 (t26, t74)\n\nt73 t73 \u2192 (t73, t73)\n\nt18 t31 \u2192 (t18, t31)\n\nt85 t76 \u2192 (t85, t76)\n\nt56 t71 \u2192 (t56, t71) [Wait, but in the given string, after t56 comes t71, but our input splits as t56, t56, t26,... So I need to make sure that each 't' is part of a pair for each production. So perhaps the correct way is to group the string into pairs, starting from the first symbol.\n\nWait, actually, the string is:\n\nt56 t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t85 t76 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t76 t26 t74 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t93\n\nSo that's 32 symbols. Since each production in the grammar uses two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, the number of symbols should correspond to a certain depth.\n\nIn CNF, each production is two symbols. So to generate a string of length N, you have N-1 productions, but in terms of the breakdown, for each symbol, except the start, you'd follow a production chain. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in the grammar is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, I can model this using a derivation process: starting from S and replacing non-terminals with their productions until all are terminals.\n\nBut the string given is 32 symbols. Let's see how many steps that would be.\n\nEach step replaces a non-terminal with a pair of symbols (two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal). So the number of symbols increases by one each time a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols. But in this case, we're trying to match the string, which has a fixed length, so perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is about 32 symbols, and each production either adds two symbols or reduces, it's probably built by expanding each symbol step by step. But I think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I can parse the string back to the grammar. Each 't' is a terminal, which must come from a non-terminal that has a production ending with a 't'. For example, 't56' must come from NT56, which needs to have a production where the second symbol is 't56'.\n\nWait, let me see if any NT rule has a terminal symbol at the end or start.\n\nFor example, looking for NTs that produce 't56':\n\nI see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40\n\nBut then, do either of these produce t56?\n\nHmm, maybe I should make a list of which NTs produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT49: produces 't6' and 't73' as per the rule NT73 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, let's check each rule where a terminal appears:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't73' (from NT18 \u2192 't73')\n\nNT91 \u2192 't22' (from NT68 \u2192 't74'?)\n\nWait, let me make a list:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't73' (from NT70 \u2192 't7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side, or a terminal symbol if it's directly producing a terminal. That helps because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain algorithms like CYK, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to trace the string through the grammar.\n\nThe string given is:\nt22 t70 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t46 t31 t16 t52 t71 t55 t98 t26 t59 t6 t92 t56.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I notice that a lot of the NT (Non-Terminal) productions are ending up as 't' symbols with subscripts. For example, NT73 -> 't6', NT93 -> 't80', and so on. Each production rule, when expanded, will substitute a terminal.\n\nSo, the approach here is to start from the top-level non-terminals and expand them step by step until we reach the terminals, matching the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar's starting symbols:\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the start symbol S can be derived from these three options. Since S is at the top, we'll need to choose which rule to apply based on the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't22', which is a terminal. But according to the grammar, none of the NT productions directly produce 't22'. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT12 -> 't16' and 't71', NT28 -> 't20', NT7 -> 't49', NT66 -> 't26', etc. Wait, I see that NT92 -> 't56', NT77 -> 't92', and others.

Let me look through all the NT productions to see if any produce 't22'.\n\nLooking through the list, I only see NT77 -> 't92', which produces 't92', but no rule directly gives 't22'. Hmm, that's odd. The string starts with 't22', but none of the NT productions in the grammar produce 't22'. So, if the first symbol is 't22' and it's not produced by any NT, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something.

So 't22' is not a terminal in the grammar. That's a problem because the string starts with 't22', which can't be derived from any non-terminal symbol.\n\nIn that case, the string 't22 t70...' cannot be generated by this grammar because the first step is to produce 't22', which is not possible with the given productions.

{"custom_id":"request-587","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are pretty long, so I need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. The grammar is given with production rules, and each rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side since it's in CNF. The string to check is a series of tokens ending with 't', like 't56', 't26', etc. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules.\n\nI think I should start by looking at each production rule in the grammar and see which non-terminals can generate the 't' symbols in the string. Since each production expands a non-terminal into two others, I'll need to track how each 't' symbol arises from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: `t56 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76 t71 t73 t56 t98 t26 t31 t11 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56`.\n\nI notice that each 't' is a terminal symbol, so I need to find paths in the grammar where non-terminals expand into these terminals. Let me create a map of which non-terminals produce each terminal:\n\n- 't56' can come from NT56->t56\n- 't29' from NT29->t29\n- 't72' from NT72->t72\n- 't6' from NT6->t6\n- 't73' from NT73->t73\n- 't18' from NT18->t18\n- 't31' from NT31->t31\n- 't16' from NT16->t16\n- 't76' from NT76->t76\n- 't71' from NT71->t71\n- 't58' Wait, but the string has 't58' isn't present. Wait, the string I provided has 't56' and others, no 't58'. I'll check again. Let me double-check the string given to me. Oh, no, the string has 't56 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73...' etc. So the terminals are all present as per these rules.\n\nSo, the non-terminals that can produce these terminals are:\n\nNT56: t56\nNT29: t29\nNT72: t72\nNT6: t6\nNT73: t73\nNT18: t18\nNT31: t31\nNT16: t16\nNT76: t76\nNT71: t71\n\nNow, I need to see if there's a derivation starting from S that results in the string. Since the string is long, I wonder how many steps it would take, but maybe I can look for possible sequences.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that S can produce NT1, NT44, etc. Wait, the initial grammar for S is:\n\nS -> NT49 NT98\nS -> NT62 NT42? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the initial problem statement for grammar shows multiple S rules. Oh, no, let me list them correctly.\n\nWait, the grammar is provided as:\n\nS \u2192 NT49 NT98\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nWait, looking again, user wrote:\n\nWait, the grammar given is:\n\nS -> NT49 NT74\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\nWait, no, the user's grammar is:\n\nGrammar: \nS \u2192 NT49 NT74\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\n... (and then many other rules for NTs)\n\nSo S has three initial productions.\n\nWait, so the first step in the derivation would be S expanding into one of these three: NT49 and NT74, NT11 and NT24, or NT40 and NT92.\n\nSince the string starts with t56, maybe we can backtrack to see which NT can produce t56.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT56 \u2192 t56 (from NT56's rule)\n\nSo the last symbol in the string is 't56', so the last step must involve a production that ends with NT56.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT56 can be generated in several ways. For example, NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40. Let's see if NT92 and NT40 can produce t symbols that align with 't98' and 't56'.\n\nWait, the previous in the string before the last t56 is 't18', then 't73', then 't56'. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's list the string:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt56 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76 t71 t73 t56 t98 t26 t31 t11 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56\n\nWait, actually, the last part is ... t56 t98 t26 ... No, wait, maybe I should parse the whole string correctly.\n\nWait, the string is:\n\nt56 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76 t71 t73 t56 t98 t26 t31 t11 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56\n\nWait, that's a lot, but let me break it down into individual symbols.\n\nSo, the string is:\n\n1. t56\n2. t26\n3. t29\n4. t72\n5. t6\n6. t73\n7. t72\n8. t73\n9. t72\n10. t73\n11. t72\n12. t73\n13. t73\n14. t73\n15. t73\n16. t73\n17. t18\n18. t31\n19. t16\n20. t76\n21. t71\n22. t73\n23. t56\n24. t98\n25. t26\n26. t31\n27. t11\n28. t56\n29. t71\n30. t73\n31. t56\n32. t56\n\nWait, that's 32 symbols. So the entire string is 32 tokens long.\n\nSo starting from S, the first step would produce two non-terminals. Then each of those would potentially produce two more, etc.\n\nGiven that, the strategy might be to see if the entire string can be built up by these non-terminals.\n\nBut it's a bit complex to do this manually, so maybe we can find some patterns or use a parsing approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in a CNF grammar, each production is a binary tree, and the entire string can be seen as a series of leftmost derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the terminals in the string appear in such a way that each pair of NTs can produce the next set of terminals.\n\nFor instance, starting from S, let's see possible initial steps.\n\nI can consider the possible initial productions of S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT49 NT74\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these will split into NTs that we can then attempt to derive the corresponding symbols in the string.\n\nLooking at option 1: NT49 and NT74.\n\nFrom NT74, the production is NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99.\n\nFrom NT39, we have NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25.\n\nFrom NT8, NT8 \u2192 NT7 NT17.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t56. But the initial productions of NT49 and NT74 may not lead directly to t56 as the next symbol. So this path might not be feasible.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT11 NT24.\n\nNT11's production is NT11 \u2192 NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-612","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should help because CNF grammars have specific properties, like the length of strings they generate.\n\nLooking at the string I need to evaluate: `t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t92 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t18 t98 t92 t20 t31 t22 t31 t71 t73 t56 t93 t71 t73 t56 t5 t72 t92 t31 t82 t56`. \n\nSince it's in CNF, the valid strings must have exactly 2^n -1 symbols, where n is the number of production rules. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, the length is determined by the depth of the derivation. But since all rules except terminals produce two non-terminals, each step increases the length by 1. But in this case, the string is made up of terminals, so I need to find the corresponding non-terminals that can produce each 't' and check if the structure is valid.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many non-terminals map directly to 't's after two applications. For example, NT2 \u2192 t28, but in the string, we're seeing 't74', 't73', etc., which are already terminals. So perhaps each 't' is a result of a production that terminates after a certain number of steps.\n\nWait, but the grammar seems to have certain paths that resolve to 't's. For instance, NT7 \u2192 t74, so if a non-terminal can derive to NT7, then in the string, 't74' would appear. Similarly, NT73 \u2192 t73 directly? Or does it go through more steps?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT73 \u2192 t73, so that's a direct production. Similarly, NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, but then NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25, and so on. So for a string to end with 't73', for example, the grammar must have a production that terminates with 't73'. From the grammar rules, NT73 is a terminal 't73', so yes, that's possible.\n\nBut in the string, we have 't74', which is a direct terminal because there's a rule NT74 \u2192 t74. So any occurrence of 't74' in the string is allowed.\n\nBut let me think about the overall structure. The string is 35 symbols long, but in CNF, the number of symbols in the derived string is 2^n, so for example, if you have a derivation of depth n, the string length is 2^n. Wait, but that's if the initial grammar starts with one non-terminal. In our case, the start symbol is S, which splits into two non-terminals, so for each step, the number doubles until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string is all terminals. So for each 'S' production, we have to check if the entire string can be derived from S. Since each application splits into two non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to reverse-engineer the string: see if starting from the string, we can collapse it back to S, checking step by step if each part can be matched by any rule.\n\nLet me list the string: t26, t74, t73, t73, t18, t31, t92, t73, t73, t73, t18, t73, t73, t18, t98, t92, t20, t31, t22, t31, t71, t73, t56, t93, t71, t73, t56, t5, t72, t92, t31, t82, t56.\n\nThat's 35 symbols, which is 2^5 + 3, which isn't a power of two. Wait, in CNF, the maximum length is 2^n -1, so for n=6, the maximum length is 63 (since 2^6 -1 =63), 35 is less than 63, but it's not a power of two. Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to see if the string can be broken down starting from the left, matching possible productions.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for any rule that ends in 't's and see how they fit the string. Alternatively, perhaps identify the possible paths.\n\nLet me think about 't26'. Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT42 \u2192 NT26 NT50, but wait, no, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT59 \u2192 NT12, which then goes to 't39'? Wait, no, NT12 \u2192 't1' or 't93' or other.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of each 't' as a terminal and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nFor example, 't26' is produced by NT26, which has a rule NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50. But then NT65 can produce other things... Hmm, but perhaps it's better to trace the string back to the start.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be derived from S, which produces two non-terminals. So perhaps the string should be able to be represented as two parts, each of which can be further split into two more parts, until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut 35 is an odd number, which may complicate the splitting.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the fact that in CNF, each production is binary, so the number of symbols should be 2^n. But our string is 35, which is not a power of two. That suggests that maybe it can't be derived from a single S (2^5=32, 2^6=64). 35 is between them, but 35 is not of the form 2^n -1. Wait, 32 is 2^5, so perhaps a string of length 32 could come from a derivation that ends with 5 splits, but 35 is longer.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the grammar can produce strings of varying lengths as long as it's more than a certain threshold. Alternatively, perhaps the specific structure allows for certain lengths.\n\nBut this might not be the right approach. Instead, maybe I should look at each 't' in the string and see which non-terminals can produce it, then try to see if a path exists in the grammar to connect all these 't's back to the start.\n\nFor example, 't26' comes from NT26. Looking at the rules, NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50. NT65 can go to NT17 NT55, and NT55 can go to NT47 NT61, etc. This seems a bit too deep.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each 't' is compatible with the grammar's terminal productions. For instance, NT28 \u2192 t28 is a rule, so if a 't28' appears in the string, it can come from NT28.\n\nWait, for example, 't74' is directly from NT74, which is a rule. 't73' is directly from NT73. 't26' is from NT26. So the challenge is to see if all the 't's in the string can be produced by the grammar through a series of rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I think some of the 't's are direct, so maybe if all symbols can be matched to a terminal in the grammar, then the string is acceptable.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the grammar may not have a production for every possible 't' combination, so perhaps the string is invalid if any 't' is not in the terminal list.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal symbols are things like t74, t73, t18, t31, t92, etc. So each 't' is derived from a specific non-terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is valid if every 't' is present as a terminal in the grammar. Let me check:\n\nFirst part: t26, is that in the terminal list? Let's see. Yes, NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50, but wait, no, the terminals are the ones listed as 't' strings. Looking through the rules, I don't see 't26' as a terminal.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That simplifies parsing because each production is only to two symbols.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the productions for S are:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, any valid string generated by the grammar must start with one of these combinations. The example string starts with \"t56 t56...\", so I need to see if these can be derived from the productions starting with S.\n\nI notice that in the string, each \"t\" is a terminal. So, I'll translate the string into terms of the grammar. Let's list each component:\n\n- t56 \u2192 NT56\n- t56 \u2192 NT56\n- t26 \u2192 NT26\n- t29 \u2192 NT29\n- t72 \u2192 NT72\n- t6 \u2192 NT6\n- t73 \u2192 NT73\n- t73 \u2192 NT73\n- t18 \u2192 NT18\n- t31 \u2192 NT31\n- t73 \u2192 NT73\n- t18 \u2192 NT18\n- t14 \u2192 NT14\n- t0 \u2192 NT0\n- t56 \u2192 NT56\n- t26 \u2192 NT26\n- t74 \u2192 NT74\n- t73 \u2192 NT73\n- t73 \u2192 NT73\n- t73 \u2192 NT73\n- t18 \u2192 NT18\n- t98 \u2192 NT98\n- t26 \u2192 NT26\n- t31 \u2192 NT31\n- t85 \u2192 NT85\n- t93 \u2192 NT93\n- t56 \u2192 NT56\n- t71 \u2192 NT71\n- t55 \u2192 NT55\n- t76 \u2192 NT76\n- t71 \u2192 NT71\n- m71 \u2192 NT71\n- m76 \u2192 NT76\n\nWait, I see some inconsistencies here. The string seems to have \"t11\" and \"t24\", but looking at NT11 and NT24. Are those present? Let me check the grammar rules:\n\n- NT11: Looking for where NT11 is used in productions. Scanning through, I see that S \u2192 NT11 NT24 is a production. Also, checking the rules, I see NT11 is used as NT11 \u2192 NT17 NT57 and NT24 \u2192 t88.\n\nSo, the string starts with t56 t56, which means NT56. Looking at the grammar, I need to find if NT56 can be derived.\n\nLooking for NT56 productions:\n\n- From the rule list: NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40.\n\nHmm, so NT56 can only be replaced by NT92 NT40. That means the first NT56 would expand to NT92 NT40.\n\nSo the first t56 in the string would be derived from NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40.\n\nSimilarly, the second t56 would also expand to NT92 NT40.\n\nWait, but in the string, the two t56s are consecutive, so perhaps both are derived from the same NT56.\n\nSo, let's represent this as:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT56 \u2192 (NT92 NT40) (NT92 NT40)\n\nBut looking at the string, the first two t56s are followed by t26. So let's see what comes after.\n\nThe first two t56s would expand to NT92 NT40 followed by NT92 NT40. So now, the string after the first two t56s is t26, which is NT26. How does NT26 expand?\n\nLooking for NT26: The grammar includes NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT7 and NT26 \u2192 NT20 NT20 (wait, I need to check the rules. Looking through, I see NT26: Let me check.\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT7\n- NT26 \u2192 NT50 NT77? Wait, no. Wait, the grammar shows:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLet me look for NT26:\n\nYes, I see: NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT7 and NT62 \u2192 ... Wait, no, looking carefully:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT26 -> NT28 NT7,\n\nand somewhere else:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> NT28 NT7\n\nand\n\n- NT28 -> NT26 NT7? Wait, no, looking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> NT26 NT13,\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list the relevant rules.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT7\n- NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT13\n- etc.\n\nSo, NT26 can be expanded into NT28 NT7, and NT28 can be expanded into NT26 NT13.\n\nSo, is there a way to derive a terminal from NT26? It seems not directly, because both NT26 and NT28 are non-terminals that expand into each other.\n\nWait, that could be a problem. Because if NT26 and NT28 are mutually recursive, that suggests that they can't be reduced to terminals unless we have some path that leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, do either NT26 or NT28 have a production that expands into a terminal symbol?\n\nLooking through again:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT69 NT38.\n\nAh, so NT28 can expand into NT69 NT38.\n\nSo, let's see if NT69 and NT38 can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking in the rules for NT69:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 NT55 NT1.\n\nSimilarly, NT55 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but looking further, do any of these expand into 't's?\n\nYes, for example:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40,\n- NT92 \u2192 NT26 NT64 (is that correct? Wait, looking back: The rule for NT92 is: NT92 \u2192 NT56 NT93.\n\nWait, I might be getting confused. Let me make a list of the NT productions to understand the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this using the CYK algorithm or some sort of parsing method, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into the possible expansions.\n\nLooking back, the string starts with t56 t56 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t73 t18 t31 t73 t18 t14 t0 t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t26 t31 t85 t93 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t55 t76.\n\nWait, another approach is to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nBut this might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the string as a list of NT terms and see if they can be grouped into the productions.\n\nWait, each 't' is a terminal, so the sequence of t's comes from expanding NTs. So let's list the entire string in terms of NTs:\n\nt56 \u2192 NT56\n\nt56 \u2192 NT56\n\nt26 \u2192 NT26\n\nt29 \u2192 NT29\n\nt72 \u2192 NT72\n\nt6 \u2192 NT6\n\nt73 \u2192 NT73\n\nt73 \u2192 NT73\n\nt18 \u2192 NT18\n\nt31 \u2192 NT31\n\nt73 \u2192 NT73\n\nt18 \u2192 NT18\n\nt14 \u2192 NT14\n\nt0 \u2192 NT0\n\nt56 \u2192 NT56\n\nt26 \u2192 NT26\n\nt74 \u2192 NT74\n\nt73 \u2192 NT73\n\nt73 \u2192 NT73\n\nt73 \u2192 NT73\n\nt18 \u2192 NT18\n\nt98 \u2192 NT98\n\nt26 \u2192 NT26\n\nt31 \u2192 NT31\n\nt85 \u2192 NT85\n\nt93 \u2192 NT93\n\nt56 \u2192 NT56\n\nt71 \u2192 NT71\n\nt55 \u2192 NT55\n\nt76 \u2192 NT76\n\nt71 \u2192 NT71\n\nt55 \u2192 NT55\n\nt76 \u2192 NT76\n\nSo, the entire string in NTs is:\n\n[NT56, NT56, NT26, NT29, NT72"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-627","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So every step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others, until we get to terminals.\n\nThe string provided is: `t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t22 t70 t31 t71 t55 t52 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t85 t76`.\n\nFirst, I think it's helpful to note that each 't' followed by a number might be a terminal symbol, and the rest (like NT49, S, etc.) are non-terminals. The non-terminals seem to be all the NT... identifiers, and S is the start symbol.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT49 NT44 or other similar productions. Each NT production eventually breaks down into terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, each 't' is followed by numbers like t20, t74, etc. So I need to see if the string can be derived from S by breaking down each non-terminal step by step.\n\nStarting with S, the initial productions lead to combinations like NT49 NT99, NT49 NT39, etc. Each of these non-terminals further breaks down. For example, S could go to NT49 NT99, and then NT49 can go to NT0 NT47, and so on until terminals are reached.\n\nI think it's a bit tricky to parse manually, but maybe I can focus on a strategy. Perhaps using the parsing approach, recognizing patterns or using a recursive-descent parser. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF and deterministic, maybe I can apply the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language.\n\nBut without writing CYK, maybe I can look for the structure. Let's see: each production is two non-terminals until they resolve to terminals. So the string length should be a certain multiple. The string has 40 tokens (each 't' plus number is a token? Wait, no, looking at the string, it's a sequence of t followed by a number, like t20, t74, etc. Each 't' part is a single token, so the string is 40 tokens long (counting each letter and number separately? Or as each 't.. ' is a word character? Wait, in the problem statement, each 't' is followed by a number but they are individual tokens. So for example, the string is split into segments like t20, t74, etc. So the string is 40 tokens long, meaning that in the derivation, S would have to produce a tree that expands to 40 terminals.\n\nIn CNF, each production applies to a single non-terminal, so each production step replaces one non-terminal with two, thus the number of symbols increases by one each time. Starting from 1 (S), after one step, 2, then 3, etc. For 40 terminals, how many steps? Starting from 1, to get to 40, you need 39 steps. Which is possible.\n\nBut the exact derivation is too long. So perhaps a better approach is to look for known derivations or specific rules.\n\nLooking at the last part of the string: ... t76. So the last production leading to t76. Checking the grammar, there's a production rule NT76 \u2192 t6 t73. But t76 isn't present elsewhere as a terminal. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, in the given grammar, for example, I see NT92 -> t56. Wait, no, actually looking back:\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, the productions of non-terminals end with some rules mapping to terminals. For example, the production NT76 \u2192 t2 t73? Or wait, looking back at the grammar rules:\n\nHmm, the provided grammar has a lot of entries. Let me scan for any NT that ends with 't73' or other specific terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT76 \u2192 NT2 NT73\n...\nAt the bottom, NT18 \u2192 t19, etc. So some non-terminals are already mapped to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be generated if each 't' corresponds to a production. But to go step by step:\n\nEach 't' is a terminal, so each must be the result of a production where the non-terminal directly goes to that 't'. So I'll need to check if each 't' is allowed in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't6'\n- NT67 \u2192 't26'\n- NT72 \u2192 't73'\n- NT93 \u2192 't64' etc.\n\nLooking for 't20' in the grammar: Wait, no, 't20' isn't in the grammar as a terminal. It's in the NT12 \u2192 t16, t71, but not as a terminal itself. Wait, perhaps the string includes 't20' but in the grammar, there's no non-terminal that directly maps to t20. Hmm, that could be a problem.\n\nWait, the string has several 't20's. Let's look at the grammar for any NT that directly produces t20. Scanning the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal maps directly to t20. For example, looking through the end:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\nNT69 \u2192 NT64 NT93\n...\nLooking for t20, checking where any NT directly maps to t20: I don't see that. All the terminals are things like t5, t7, t6, etc. So perhaps the string contains t20, which isn't a terminal in any of the grammar's rules. That would mean that t20 is a non-terminal, but it's being used as a terminal, which isn't allowed. Therefore, the string might not be derivable.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. In the grammar, if t20 is a terminal, but it's never defined, it's invalid. So if t20 is a terminal and is present in the string but no production in the grammar allows it, then that's a problem. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces 't20', so that would mean the string includes a symbol that the grammar can't produce.

{"custom_id":"request-633","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: t20 t29 t72 t6 t73 t73 t73 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76 t71 t73 t56 t31 t1 t93 t71 t55 t98 t72 t73 t73 t18 t70 t31 t85 t93. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form grammars have productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal, but since all productions are in the form of non-terminals, it's the binary case. So, each step in a derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others until terminals are reached.\n\nI need to parse the string from left to right, checking if each terminal can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a straight-line derivation without any left or right recursion. Also, the structure suggests that each step might produce a certain number of symbols, but it's not a fixed length because terminals can be produced directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a recursive descent parser could be used, but without writing a parser, I need another approach.\n\nLet me look at the grammar productions:\n\nLooking through, the S starts with NT49 or NT11 or NT40. Each of these, in turn, produce two non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nS -> NT49 NT99\nNT49 -> NT0 NT47\nNT0 -> NT77 NT34\nAnd so on.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals resolve to terminals. For instance, NT7 -> 't74' etc. So the string in question has a lot of terminals like t20, t29, etc.\n\nI need to see if each of these terminals can appear in the leftmost positions as the derivation proceeds.\n\nWait, perhaps building the parse tree would help. Alternatively, considering that each production is either two non-terminals, perhaps the string is generated via a series of steps where each step produces a non-terminal that in turn produces more, eventually leading to the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the string as a sequence of symbols, each of which must be matched by the grammar. So perhaps starting from the start symbol S and applying productions, can I form the given string.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of a stack-based parsing since it's a context-free language, but again, without writing a parser, maybe I can approach it by trying to see if each symbol can be generated step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is such that each token can be matched by the grammar's terminal rules. Let me check if each part of the string corresponds to any of the terminal rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are: t7, t8, t14, t16, t17, t20, t25, t26, t28, t31, t33, t35, t38, t40, t44, t47, t49, t50, t51, t53, t55, t56, t57, t59, t61, t66, t68, t69, t70, t71, t72, t73, t74, t76, t77, t79? Hmm, wait, looking more carefully, I see NT7 is 't74', NT12 is two terminals: t85 and t... wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the given grammar rules under NT:\n\nNT7 -> 't74' - Yes\nNT12 -> 't85' (twice?) Wait, looking at the list, one of the NT12 rules is NT12 -> 't85' but another rule for NT12 is NT12 -> 't20'. Similarly, other NT entries have both non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, so for instance:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT12 -> 't85' and also NT12 -> 't20'\nHmm, so NT12 can produce 't85' or 't20'.\n\nSo in the string, there are several 't85' and 't20' segments.\n\nSo perhaps each of these can be handled by NT12. So perhaps the string can be built by starting with S and expanding non-terminals that can produce the required terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first four symbols are 't20 t29 t72 t6', then 't73 t73...' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it would help to see if the string can be split into segments that correspond to expansions of the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each non-terminal can expand into two non-terminals, and those can continue to expand until they reach terminals. So each step effectively divides the current string segment into three parts: the first non-terminal expansion, and the second.\n\nBut parsing from left to right, perhaps using a recursive descent approach, it's challenging without explicitly writing a parser. Maybe instead, I can check for each terminal if it's produced by some NT, and whether their preconditions can be met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by starting at S, and each step produces two parts, and the string is a concatenation of the left, middle, right parts. But given the string, perhaps it's easier to think backward or try to find if the string can be deconstructed into expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to model how the string would be built. For example, each symbol must be the result of an expansion path.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to check each terminal in the string and see if there's a rule for each of them, then see if their predecessors can be formed.\n\nWait, but let's look at the string again:\n\nt20 t29 t72 t6 t73 t73 t73 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t76 t71 t73 t56 t31 t1 t93 t71 t55 t98 t72 t73 t73 t18 t70 t31 t85 t93.\n\nLooking at the first three symbols: t20, t29, t72.\n\nWait, t20 is an NT. Looking back at the grammar, NT12 can produce t20, for example. So perhaps the first T20 comes from NT12, which could be the expansion of a non-terminal.\n\nBut how does that chain together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the entire string and try to backtrack.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the string is built by starting with S and expanding each non-terminal in a leftmost way, and seeing if the end result matches the string.\n\nSince the grammar is small, perhaps I can model the first steps.\n\nLooking at S:\n\nThe start symbol S can produce NT49 NT99, or NT11 NT24, or NT40 NT92.\n\nEach of these non-terminals can then be expanded further.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT49 NT99.\n\nNT49 expands as NT0 NT47.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47.\n\nThen NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT49 NT99 \u2192 NT0 NT47 NT99.\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34, so S \u2192 NT77 NT34 NT47 NT99.\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, so now we have NT92, NT85, NT34, NT47, NT99.\n\nBut this approach gets too complicated, as each step unfolds into more non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for the terminals in the string and see if they can be derived by NTs.\n\nSo, starting with the first symbol t20. Looking at the grammar, find all NTs that can produce 't20'. From the grammar:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't20' (first rule) or NT12 \u2192 't85' (another rule).\n\nSo, the first symbol t20 must have come from NT12 expanding as 't20'.\n\nBut how did NT12 get there? It must have come from somewhere in the derivation chain. Since S starts with either NT49, NT11, or NT40.\n\nSo if the first part of the string starts with NT12 \u2192 't20', that would mean that the leftmost symbol would have to come from NT12.\n\nLooking back, S can start with NT49, NT11, or NT40.\n\nIf the first symbol is t20 (NT12), then perhaps the leftmost non-terminal in the derivation is NT12. But S doesn't produce NT12; it only produces combinations like S \u2192 NT12 NT24, etc.\n\nWait, so if the derivation starts with S \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-650","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and then analyze the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal or terminal on the right. The start symbol is S, which produces combinations of NTs (non-terminals) that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's defined with a series of rules. Each rule has a left-hand side (NT) and right-hand side (two NTs). The NTs eventually resolve to terminals with strings of 't' followed by numbers. Some of these also have loops or connections, so I need to map out the hierarchy.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t22 t70 t73 t73 t73 ... up to 25 tokens. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each 't' followed by a number must be derived from a production rule starting from the grammar.\n\nLet me try to break it down.\n\n1. Start with the string: t22 t70 t73 repeated 6 times, then continuing with other t sequences.\n\nI'll start from the beginning:\n\nThe first part is t22 t70 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t93 t71 t73 ... etc.\n\nLet's see how each terminal can be derived.\n\nFirst, t22 corresponds to NT90 -> 't22'. So the production is NT90 -> 't22'.\n\nLooking into the grammar, NT90 is defined as NT8 -> 't7', right? Wait, let me check the grammar rules. Oh, actually, looking through, I realize NT90 might be part of a larger production. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT90 as a start symbol or an intermediate, but looking deeper, I notices NT9 -> 't46', NT12 -> 't16', NT39 -> 't9', etc. Maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a dependency tree for the string. Let me list the tokens and see how they could be generated.\n\nWait, the string starts with t22, which is from NT90. So NT90 must be rewritten as 't22'.\n\nLooking into the grammar, I see that NT90 is not directly an NT, but in the provided grammar, I notice that some rules have 't's attached, like NT9 -> 't46', etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar is provided in a way that the right-hand sides are a series of NTs and terminals. For example:\n\nNT9 -> 't46'\n\nNT12 -> 't16'\n\nNT39 -> 't9'\n\nSo each NT eventually maps to a single terminal when resolved.\n\nGiven that, the string is a concatenation of these terminals, so each can be traced back as an NT chain leading to a terminal.\n\nSo the approach is to see if the sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me see the string again:\n\nt22 t70 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t93 t71 t73 t56 t98 t92 t19 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t52 t71 t55 t98 t26 t98 t26 t70 t56\n\nI can start by looking at each terminal and seeing which NT it comes from, then work backwards to see if the grammar can produce that.\n\nFor example, t22 comes from NT90 -> 't22', as per the grammar. So we need to find a production that starts with NT90, but looking through the grammar rules, I don't see an NT90. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I get confused because the grammar uses NTs as left-hand sides, and each rule is like NTs -> NTs. So, for example, looking for NT90, it's not a direct non-terminal in the grammar; instead, the terminals are directly derived from certain NTs.\n\nLooking back, the terminals are as follows:\n\nNT9 -> 't46'\n\nNT12 -> 't16'\n\nNT39 -> 't9'\n\nNT66 -> 't26'\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT18 -> 't14'\n\nNT93 -> 't80'\n\nNT18 -> 't19'\n\nNT20 -> 't17'\n\nNT20 -> 't0'\n\nNT28 -> 't20'\n\nNT69 -> 't93'\n\nNT68 -> 't82'\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT66 -> 't26'\n\nNT9 -> 't46'\n\nNT90 -> 't22'\n\nNT12 -> 't16'\n\nNT39 -> 't9'\n\nNT57 -> 't18'\n\nNT53 -> 't43'\n\nWait, so 't' numbers are directly mapped to certain NTs.\n\nSo, for the string, each 'tX' is a terminal, and it corresponds to a specific NT.\n\nLet me list the mappings:\n\nt22: NT90\n\nt70: ?\n\nWait, looking through the mappings:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NTs. Let me go step by step.\n\nFor example, in the string, the first token is t22, which maps to NT90, as per the rule NT90 -> 't22'.\n\nSo the production for NT90 is \"t22\". But in the grammar, I don't see NT90 being rewritten; instead, the terminals are from NTs. So this suggests that the production must have come from some other NT that eventually leads to NT90 and others.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, the start symbol is S, and it's defined as:\n\nS -> NT49 NT74\n\nS -> NT11 NT24\n\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nWait, but the given grammar has multiple production rules for S, each producing two NTs. So each of these NTs must be able to expand into the necessary strings.\n\nSo for the string to be derived, the entire sequence must be generated by a series of these NT expansions.\n\nBut considering the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string by breaking it down into parts that correspond to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start, t22. From the terminal mappings, t22 is NT90. So to get t22, we need NT90 to produce 't22', which in the grammar is written as NT90 -> 't22'.\n\nBut in the given grammar, there's no rule for NT90. Therefore, this would imply that NT90 must be reachable from another NT, which expands into it.\n\nWait, let me check the provided grammar to see if any NT leads to NT90. Looking through, I don't see such a rule. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the mappings.\n\nWait, in the grammar, let's look for any production that ends with NT90. Scanning through:\n\n- I see NT9 -> 't46'\n\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n\n- NT39 -> 't9'\n\n- NT66 -> 't26'\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n\n- NT18 -> 't14'\n\n- NT93 -> 't80'\n\n- NT18 -> 't19'\n\nSo, none of these produce NT90 as a terminal. Hence, if t22 is mapped to NT90, then NT90 must be derived from another NT, but if there's no rule that defines NT90, it can't be derived.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if NT90 isn't present in any rule's right-hand side, then it can't be part of the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and t22 doesn't come from NT90, but from another NT. Let me check the grammar to see if any production rule produces t22.\n\nLooking at the mappings, perhaps I missed some? Let me go carefully:\n\nLooking for 't22' in the mappings:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar mappings:\n\n- NT59 -> 't6' \u2192 not 't22'\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't8'\n\n- NT92 \u2192 't56'\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't95'\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't59'\n\n- etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that maps to 't22'. So how is the string starting with t22? That's a problem because in the grammar, 't22' isn't directly produced by any NT. It must be a typo or a mistake in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-673","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar provided has a set of production rules. I notice that many symbols are on the left side of the arrows, and the right side consists of other symbols. Some of these symbols are terminals (they end the derivation), while others are non-terminals. The string I need to evaluate starts with 't22' and has several 't's, which are terminals. So, the string is entirely composed of terminals, which makes sense because we're trying to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production rules all start with S, and some of the other non-terminals also have their own rules. The string has a length of 42, so that's quite long. I need to see if there's a derivation starting from S that can generate this string.\n\nI'll list out the string again for clarity:\n\nt22 t70 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t92 t98 t26 t31 t1 t76 t71 t73 t56 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t26 t59 t6 t46 t56.\n\nHmm, let me try to map this string to the possible derivations. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production generates exactly two symbols on the right side. So, each step of the derivation doubles the number of symbols. But since the string is long, it's going to be a lot of steps. However, instead of trying to expand the entire string, maybe I can check if each 't' in the string can be paired with another symbol correctly.\n\nLet me list the string as tokens:\n\n1. t22\n2. t70\n3. t73\n4. t73\n5. t73\n6. t73\n7. t73\n8. t73\n9. t73\n10. t18\n11. t98\n12. t92\n13. t98\n14. t26\n15. t31\n16. t1\n17. t76\n18. t71\n19. t73\n20. t56\n21. t73\n22. t72\n23. t73\n24. t72\n25. t73\n26. t72\n27. t73\n28. t72\n29. t73\n30. t72\n31. t73\n32. t72\n33. t73\n34. t73\n35. t18\n36. t59\n37. t6\n38. t26\n39. t59\n40. t6\n41. t46\n42. t56.\n\nI think it would be helpful to see if the first symbol 't22' corresponds to a non-terminal that can produce t22 directly. Looking at the grammar, most symbols that end with 't' are either terminals or have production rules that include a terminal. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the right-hand side, I see that some symbols like NT77 have a production leading to 't93' and 't85'.

{"custom_id":"request-688","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several production rules. Each rule starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left and is followed by two non-terminal symbols on the right. For example, S -> NT74 NT44. The bottom of the grammar has various terminal symbols like 't73', 't20', etc., which I assume are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t20 t29 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t26 t22 t70 t31 t71 t73 t56 t93 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t76 t71 t73 t56 t93 t71 t55 t6 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t76.\n\nI'll need to analyze each part of the string and see if it can be derived from the grammar. Let's start by looking at the initial symbols.\n\nThe string starts with t20. Looking at the grammar, I see rules where non-terminals like NT12, NT20, NT28, etc., might produce t20. For example, NT11 is in a rule that produces t87, which doesn\u2019t help. NT20 has rules like NT20 -> NT39 NT25, NT20 -> NT0, NT20 -> NT39 NT25, NT20 -> 't17', NT20 -> 't0'. Wait, wait, looking at the bottom, I see NT20 -> t17 and NT20 -> t0? Wait, the bottom has several rules for NT20. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the bottom, I see:\n- NT20 -> t17\n- NT12 -> t13 -> perhaps not since NT12 is more complex.\n\nWait, looking again at the bottom:\n\nOh, here's NT20 -> 't17' and another rule NT20 -> 't0'\u2014wait no, let me find all NT20 rules: Oh, no, in the given bottom list, I see entries like NT20 -> t17? Let me check the bottom part.\n\nWait, the bottom seems to include lines like:\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT95 -> t35 ... (but that's for NT95)\n- Looking through all the entries, I see NT20 has the rule NT20 -> 't17' and NT20 -> 't0'. Oh, wait, no: let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar's bottom:\n\nI see:\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n...\n- NT96 -> 't73'\nBut more importantly, I see:\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT20 -> 't0' \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me look again.\n\nIn the bottom part:\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT18 -> 't14'\n- NT19 -> 't73'\n\nWait, looking through all the lines, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n\nYes, that's present. So NT20 can produce 't17'. So the first token is t20, which is 't17'? Wait, t20 is different. Let me check the mappings.\n\nLooking for t20, I see it's under NT0 -> t29, NT12 -> t20, and other rules. Wait, no, in the bottom part:\n\nNT12 -> t13\nWait, no, perhaps I got mixed up.\n\nWait, the bottom part lists many NT rules that directly produce terminal tokens. For example, some have \"NTx -> 'ty'\". So let's go through each line in the bottom to see which ones produce 't20'.\n\nScanning the bottom:\n\nLooking for NT rules that produce 't20' \u2014 I see:\n\n- NT17 -> 't73'\n- NT18 -> 't14'\n- NT60 -> 't53' (Wait, no, looking at the bottom entries: let me list all the ones that produce terminals.\n\nThe bottom part, line by line:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT18 -> 't14'\nNT19 -> 't73'\nNT29 -> 't93'\nNT30 -> 't66' (Wait, line 91: NT35 -> 't35'?)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me go through each line to find which NTs produce 't20':\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT24 -> 't88'\n- NT28 -> 't26'\n- ... many lines ...\nLooking at each line, I'm looking for 't20' in the RHS.\n\nWait, the bottom seems to have:\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking through all lines:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT18 -> 't14'\n- NT19 -> 't73'\n- NT20 -> 't17' (line NT20 -> t17)\n- NT12 -> 't13'\n Wait, no, looking at the lines:\n\nIt's a long list, but to save time, I'll note that if any NT directly produces 't20', that's the key. Let me check all lines for the exact term 't20'.\n\nLooking through, I see in the bottom:\n\n- NT25 -> 't28' (so not relevant)\n- NT66 -> 't26'\nLooking, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't20'. Wait, hold on. Wait, does any line have NT20 -> 't20'? Or perhaps NTx -> t20? Hmm.\n\nWait, in the bottom part, looking again:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n\n- NT28 -> 't26'\n\nWait, where is t20? Let me check all the strings:\n\nWait, in the string given, the first token is t20. So we need to find a production that can derive t20. But in the bottom, looking through all the entries, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't20'. But perhaps it's via a combination.\n\nWait, maybe t20 is produced by some NT, which in turn is produced by another NT, leading down. Let's think about possible paths.\n\nWait, let me check all NT20 rules. Looking back at the given grammar, the production rules are:\n\nLooking at all the NT20 rules, does any rule have NT20 in the LHS? Wait, the grammar doesn't show multiple NT20 rules. Wait, in the bottom, any NT20 rules. Hmm. Wait, the bottom part lists the productions for NT.\n\nLooking again:\n\nFrom the bottom, the only NT rule involving 20 that I see is:\n\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't20'. Wait, this might be a problem. Because if the grammar doesn't have any NT that can produce t20, then the string starts with t20, which isn't possible. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should check other rules. For example, the top-level productions:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo S starts with either NT74 and NT44, NT11 and NT24, or NT40 and NT92. So the first part must be derived from S -> NTx NTy.\n\nLooking further down, the NT rules: NT74 is in a rule that produces NT39 and NT99.

{"custom_id":"request-687","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left or a single terminal symbol. Since it's CNF, it should be straightforward to apply the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can do this manually for simplicity.\n\nThe string to check is: `t20 t29 t72 t6 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t98 t9 t20 t74 t76 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t73 t18 t14 t17 t93 t71 t55 t31 t16 t31 t11 t52`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many of the productions lead to terminal symbols. So, each production can generate a specific terminal string. My task is to see if the entire string can be derived starting from S by expanding the non-terminals using the rules.\n\nLet me first list all the terminal symbols present in the string to cross-reference against the grammar. The terminals are:\nt20, t29, t72, t6, t73, t18, t31, t98, t9, t74, t76, t26, t93, t14, t17, t91, t52, and others. Wait, let me check the string again. Actually, from the string:\n\nLooking at the string, let me list the terminals as they appear:\nt20, t29, t72, t6, t73, t73, t73, t73, t18, t31, t98, t9, t20, t74, t76, t26, t29, t72, t6, t73, t73, t73, t73, t18, t31, t73, t18, t14, t17, t93, t71, t55, t31, t16, t31, t11, t52.\n\nThe unique terminals are:\nt20, t29, t72, t6, t73, t18, t31, t98, t9, t74, t76, t26, t93, t14, t17, t55, t16, t52, t71, t31, t98.\n\nWait, t73 appears multiple times and is present in the grammar. Now, checking if all these terminals are covered in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each production either leads to a terminal or two non-terminals. So, let's see which terminals are directly defined.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly correspond to terminals:\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85, which eventually leads to t93 and t73, based on other rules. Wait, but in the grammar, some of these produce other non-terminals, which then produce terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar has many non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. For example, NT77 -> NT92 NT85, which then via NT92 -> t93 and NT85 -> t71, so NT77 produces t93 t71, which would give a string of \"t93 t71\". Similarly, NT74 -> NT39 NT99, which then might lead to other non-terminals until it reaches terminals.\n\nBut in the string to check, we have certain terms that must be produced by some rule.\n\nAnother approach is to see if every substring of terminals can be derived from the grammar. However, that's too vague. Instead, perhaps I can consider top-down parsing or dynamic programming, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps it's easier to see if the entire string can be formed by starting at S and expanding.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules for S:\nS can be produced by:\n- NT49 NT74\n- NT11 NT24\n- NT40 NT92\n\nSo S is a combination of two non-terminals. The string starts with t20, so let's see if any of these production rules can generate t20.\n\nLooking at the rules, the only way to get t20 is through NT11, because NT11 -> t87. Wait, no, let me check the grammar. Wait, in the grammar provided, looking for NT11: yes, NT11 is defined as -> t87. Similarly, NT12 is -> t1.\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules, for example, NT20 -> t17, but perhaps the terminal we are trying to get is t20. Hmm, looking at the grammar, do any NT rules produce t20?\n\nWait, in the grammar, for NT12: NT12 can be t1 or t90. Wait, looking at the rules under NT12: NT12 -> NT93 NT70, but also, looking at the rules section, I see multiple NT12 productions: like NT12 -> t1, t90, and others. Wait, let me scan through the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT12, the production rules are:\n- NT12 -> t85\n- NT12 -> NT51 NT20\n- NT12 -> t1\n- NT12 -> t90\n- NT12 -> t1\nHmm, actually, multiple rules for NT12. Wait, the user provided a list, so looking for NT12 in the production rules:\n\nLooking at the provided rules, I see:\n- NT12 -> t85\n- NT12 -> NT51 NT20\n- NT12 -> t1\n- NT12 -> t90\n\nWait, NT12 is defined as any of these. So, under NT12, it can produce t85, t51 t20, t1, or t90.\n\nSo, if in the string, t12 appears, it could be via either t1 or t90. But in our string, I don't see t12; I see t20.\n\nWait, in the string given, the initial part is t20, which would correspond to NT20 or another NT that leads to t20.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT20 -> t17, but also, looking through, do any NTs lead to t20?\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT20 is not directly a terminal. Let me check:\n\nThe rules for NT20:\n- NT20 -> NT39 NT25\n- NT20 -> t17\n- NT20 -> t0\n\nWait, in the rules, NT20 is defined as:\nNT20 -> NT39 NT25\nNT20 -> t17\nNT20 -> t0\n\nSo, NT20 can produce t17 or t0. Therefore, t20 is not directly produced by any NT. So, how do we get t20 in the string?\n\nWait, but in the string, the first few elements are t20, t29, etc. So, in order for our string to be generated, there must be a way to derive t20 from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, it seems that t20 isn't directly a terminal. So perhaps the entire string cannot be generated because t20 is not present in the grammar as a terminal.\n\nBut that's not necessarily true because maybe another non-terminal can produce t20 through expansion. Wait, so perhaps there's a non-terminal NT somewhere in the grammar that can lead to t20.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see:\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce t20. Scanning all the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t20. All the NTs that end in t20 require being connected via other NTs, but since t20 is not directly a terminal, it's hard to see.\n\nWait, but the string given starts with t20, which suggests that somewhere in the derivation, a production rule must generate t20 as a terminal. However, from the grammar provided, no NT directly expands to t20. All the rules lead to other non-terminals or terminals that don't include t20. Therefore, the string contains t20, which cannot be generated by the grammar, meaning the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-714","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is quite long, so it's going to take some time, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and it's defined to produce various combinations of NT11, NT12, NT24, and NT44. Each of these non-terminals eventually leads down to terminals (t's and numbers), which represent the final string.\n\nThe string provided is a series of t's and numbers. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. To do this, I'll probably need to perform a top-down or bottom-up parsing approach, maybe even use the CYK algorithm since it's efficient for CNF grammars. But since I'm doing this manually, top-down recursion might be more manageable.\n\nLet me list out the string components for clarity:\n\nt26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t26 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t18 t19 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t26 t31 t11 t6 t46 t31 t82 t56.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT11 NT24\nS \u2192 NT40 NT92\nS \u2192 NT49 NT99\n\nSo the string starts with either NT11 NT24 or one of the other two options. Let's check the first token, which is t26. I need to see which NT rules produce t26.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice NT26 \u2192 ... Hmm, wait, in the grammar, NT26 is defined in the production rules? Let me check: Yes, near the bottom, I see NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50. But wait, looking through the list, I don't see a direct nt26 production. Wait, actually, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT26 NT7\n\nWait, but in the list provided, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50\n\nWait, in the given grammar, is NT26 present? Let me scan the list. Yes, lines like NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT7 and others, but does NT26 have a production? Looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50\n\nWait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, no. In the given grammar, I don't see NT26. Let me go line by line.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT26 NT7\n\nHmm, but NT26 isn't defined here. Wait, I think I misinterpreted the list. Let me read the entire list carefully:\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\nNT26 isn't listed as a NT; instead, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT26 NT7\n\nWait, perhaps I need to correct that. So if NT26 is in the grammar, but in the given list, I don't see NT26's production. Let me check the original grammar. Wait, the user provided a list that includes NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT7, so it seems that NT26 is a non-terminal because it's used in other productions. So, for example, NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT7, meaning NT26 is defined elsewhere. So somewhere in the grammar, NT26 must have a production.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nLine says: NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT7\n\nThen, another line: NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50\n\nWait, looking at the list: Yes, line after NT50 is:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT26 NT7\n\nAnd then NT26 is defined as NT65 NT50:\n\nYes, NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50.\n\nSo NT26 produces t65 and t50. Wait, no, NT65's productions? Let me see:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT17 NT55 and elsewhere, and eventually leads to t26. Wait, perhaps NT65 is a non-terminal that eventually produces a terminal, t26.\n\nLet me see: NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT55.\n\nLooking further, NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65. Oh wait, that creates a cycle here: NT47 \u2192 NT55, NT55 \u2192 NT47 and others. Hmm, that's a problem because it would lead to infinite recursion.\n\nWait, but do these NTs ever reach terminals? Let's check NT17 and NT55.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT73 NT19.\n\nNT73 is a terminal, so that's straightforward.\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57.\n\nNT57 appears here: NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56.\n\nBut NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40.\n\nNT92 \u2192 NT76 NT93.\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Let me try to map this out.\n\nSo if the string starts with t26, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT11 NT24, but that would lead us down to NT11 and NT24.\n\nBut NT24 would produce, for example, NT66, which eventually leads to t82, t56, etc. However, I'm more interested in the NT26 part, which might be part of another production. Wait, in the string, the first token is t26, so maybe the production involving NT26 is part of a larger chain.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again: The string starts with t26. So the first step would be to have a production that starts with NT26, which produces t26 and another terminal. Let's see:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT26 NTsomething, but in S's definitions, the start productions don't have NT26. So starting the string with t26 would require that the first production in S's expansion is one that leads directly to t26, but looking at S's rules:\n\nS can only produce combinations of two NTs, like NT11 and NT24. So S is the start symbol, and each production is S \u2192 NTX NTY. So the first two symbols in the string must come from some NT derivation.\n\nWait, the first token in the string is t26. So unless there's an NT production that directly leads to t26, it's impossible for the string to start with t26.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t26. The NTs that produce t26 would be NT26, as defined earlier, but NT26 is itself a combination of NT65 and NT50, which then have to derive. So NT26's expansion leads to t26 and another terminal, which would come from NT50.\n\nLooking at NT50:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT50 \u2192 NT18 NT85.\n\nThen NT18 \u2192 t7 in one case, and other NTs in other cases. So for NT50, depending on the path, it could produce t85 and t18, for example, leading to multiple possibilities.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me try another approach: identify which NTs eventually reach t26.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT65 NT50\n  - NT65 \u2192 NT17 NT55\n    - NT17 \u2192 NT73 NT19\n    - NT73 is terminal (t73)\n    - NT19 \u2192 NT17 NT57\n    - NT57 \u2192 NT85 NT56\n      - NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40\n        - NT92 \u2192 NT76 NT93\n          - NT76 \u2192 t2 NT68\n            - NT68 \u2192 NT82 t82\n              - NT82 is t82\n- NT50 \u2192 NT18 NT85\n  - NT18 \u2192 t7 t19\n  - NT85 \u2192 NT64 NT12\n    - NT64 \u2192 NT65 NT13\n      - NT65 \u2192 same as above\n- So the path starting with NT26 would eventually lead to t73, t93, etc. But is there a way for NT26 to produce t26?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me retrace: Does any NT in the grammar directly produce t26, or do they all require non-terminals to eventually derive t26?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any rule where an NT directly goes to t26.

{"custom_id":"request-707","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols. The non-terminals are N terminals and non-terminals, while the terminals are single characters or strings as per the rules. The start symbol is S, which produces various combinations of NT and other non-terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the top-level productions from S are:\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these leads to a chain of productions that ultimately must be resolved into terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t22 t70 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t26 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t98 t17 t52 t71 t73 t56 t98 t46 t31 t98 t17 t22 t56 t71 t73 t56 t59 t6 t46 t56`\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S following the grammar rules.\n\nTo do this, I can use a parsing approach step by step, reducing the string from the start. Alternatively, I can parse the string starting from the beginning, checking if each part of the string corresponds to the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial productions from S. The string starts with 't22', which I need to see how it can be derived. Looking at the grammar, 't22' is the terminal resulting from NT12 -> 't16' and NT66 -> 't26', which are not directly relevant here. Alternatively, looking for NT productions that end with 't22', I see NT92 -> 't52' and NT92 -> 't93'. Wait, let me check the given rules.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n- NT92 -> 't52' (from S productions, S -> NT40 NT92) but also NT74 -> 't56', NT52? Wait, no. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I need to find if any production leads to 't22'. Looking at the terminal productions:\n\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT70 -> 't12' and 't73'\nWait, no.

So NT7 is a non-terminal, and its production is to other non-terminals or terminals. Wait, but in the provided rules, I don't see any NT with a terminal as the only production.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me parse it again.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided rules, some non-terminals directly have terminal strings. For example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73 \u2192 which is a non-derivation because both are non-terminals, so no terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-734","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF means. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, all productions are either generating two non-terminals or a single terminal. This structure simplifies analysis, especially for parsers and algorithms like CYK.\n\nThe grammar given is in CNF, which is good because it means the string can be derived using a certain structure. The string I need to evaluate is `t7 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t18 t98 t26 t19 t26 t31 t11 t93 t71 t73 t56 t9 t91 t9 t98 t26 t8 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t46 t56`. Let's break down how many tokens this string has. Counting each 't' as a token, I see 42 tokens.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, each production either breaks down into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, which should correspond to a leftmost derivation starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol in the grammar is S. The rules provided all have S as a left-hand side in some form, like S -> NT74 NT44, S -> NT11 NT24, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, the first three rules for S all expand into two non-terminals each. The left-hand sides are S and some combinations involving NT and numbers. I need to see if these NT rules eventually lead to terminals and form a structure that can generate the given string.\n\nLet me look at the NT productions. For example, NT74 -> NT39 NT99, etc. So each NT seems to split into two NTs, and some of them eventually produce a terminal 't' followed by a number. For instance, some NT rules end with 't6', 't7', etc.\n\nEach terminal in the string corresponds to a particular step in the derivation. For example, if I have t7, that must come from a production like NT7 -> t7, looking at the grammar provided. Let me check the grammar: yes, NT7 -> t7.\n\nSo, the strategy here would be to try to match the string to the grammar by building a parse tree. The string has 42 tokens, which should correspond to the leaves of the parse tree, with each production expanding from the root S down to the string.\n\nBut how can I do this efficiently? Maybe it's easier to look for the structure of the string and see if each group of non-terminals can be replaced as we go.\n\nWait, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be helpful here. CYK is designed to determine membership in a CFG given in Chomsky Normal Form. It works by parsing the string in a bottom-up manner, using dynamic programming to keep track of possible non-terminals that can derive substrings of the string.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm not implementing an algorithm here, perhaps I can look for the structure of the string and see if it matches possible expansions.\n\nLooking at the string: t7 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 ... etc.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. t7: This comes from NT7 -> t7. So S must produce something that eventually includes this.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S can go to NT74 NT44, S to NT11 NT24, etc. Let's pick one and see if it can include t7.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first rule is S -> NT74 NT44. So S would expand to NT74 NT44. Let's see what NT74 can produce.\n\nLooking up NT74: NT74 -> NT39 NT99. So NT74 is a sequence of NT39 and NT99.\n\nNow, NT39: NT39 -> NT8 NT25. NT8: NT8 -> NT78 NT44? Wait, no. Let me see the grammar more carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT88 -> NT69 NT44. NT87 is not present, but looking at the provided rules, I need to check each NT production.\n\nWait, I think I need to make a list of all NT productions to understand their structure.\n\nLet me list all the NT productions.\n\n1. S produce rules, but other NT rules start from NT74, etc.\n\nLooking at NT74: NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\nNT8: Let me check. Looking through the provided rules: I don't see NT8 as a left-hand side.

Wait, wait, wait, in the grammar, the NT7 is the non-terminal that maps to t7. So S must, through a chain of productions, eventually derive nt7.\n\nLooking back: S can produce NT74 NT44. So, let's see:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25\n\nSo, NT74 expands into NT39 (which is NT8 NT25) and NT99 (NT51 NT66).\n\nSo, we have NT74 \u2192 NT8 NT25 (from NT39) and NT51 NT66 (from NT99). Let's look further:\n\nNT8: Not sure where NT8 goes. Looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT8 production. Wait, maybe I missed it?\n\nLooking through:\n\nAfter NT99, I see NT78, no.\n\nWait, the first line after NT57 is NT57 -> NT85 NT56, but no NT8. So, perhaps NT8 is not a non-terminal, but a terminal? But that can't be because in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are non-terminals breaking into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, perhaps some rules are missing? Or maybe it's a typo.\n\nWait, I see NT7 \u2192 t7, which is a terminal, so NT7 must be a non-terminal. So, perhaps the grammar includes NT7 as a rule.\n\nYes, the grammar has:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t7 (since in the list of rules, after the S rules, under NT7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-746","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar seems a bit complex, with a bunch of production rules, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to analyze the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to have several non-terminals (like S, NT49, NT39, etc.) and terminals (like t73, t74, etc.). I notice that some non-terminals are defined by other non-terminals (e.g., NT51 \u2192 NT19 NT99), while others are directly connected to terminals (e.g., NT7 \u2192 't74').\n\nThe string provided is: t56 t71 t73 t56 t93 t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t73 t18 t59 t6 t72 t73 t73 t18 t70 t31 t1 t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t31 t11 t76.\n\nFirst, I'll try to identify the non-terminals that can produce each of these terminals. Each production rule provides a way to generate a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nStarting with the first symbol in the string, which is 't56'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT56 \u2192 NT92 NT40 (from the production rules). But wait, actually, I need to check which non-terminals directly produce 't56'. Scanning through the grammar, I notice NT56 \u2192 't59' NT53, but that's not helpful. Wait, no\u2014looking more carefully, I see NT40 \u2192 NT44 NT98, and NT98 \u2192 't56'. Oh, so NT98 can produce 't56'. So to get 't56', we can have NT98 \u2192 't56'.\n\nBut wait, how do we get to NT98? Do we have a production for NT98? Yes, looking at the grammar, NT98 \u2192 't53' NT53. So NT98 can produce 't53 NT53', but 't53' is another terminal. So for each occurrence, I need to check if it's a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is 't56', so I can replace it as follows: 't56' comes from NT98 \u2192 't56'. So the first step is to replace 't56' with NT98.\n\nNow, looking at the production for NT98, it\u2019s NT98 \u2192 't53' NT53. So after NT98, we have 't53 NT53'. So in the string, after t56, the next symbol is 't71'. Hmm, but according to the production, after 't56', we should have 't53' followed by something. Wait, no\u2014TTT, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Each symbol in the string is either a terminal or a non-terminal. If it's a terminal, I can directly use the production that gives that terminal. If it's a non-terminal, I need to expand it according to its rules.\n\nSo, let me list out each symbol in the string and see what they can expand to.\n\n1. t56: as above, this comes from NT98 \u2192 't56'. So NT98 can produce 't56'.\n\nSo the first symbol is covered by NT98. Now, after t56, the next symbol is t71. Wait, but 't71' comes from NT16 \u2192 't71', right? Because looking at the grammar, NT16 is defined as 't71'.\n\nSo the second symbol t71 comes from NT16. Now, let's move on.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t56, which comes from NT98 \u2192 t56. So the next step is to expand NT98.\n\nLooking at the production for NT98: NT98 \u2192 't53' NT53. So after producing 't56', we have to produce 't53' and NT53.\n\nBut wait, in the string after 't56' is 't71'. So maybe NT98 can't produce directly 't71' as the next symbol. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step, expanding each symbol one by one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree by starting from the top-level symbol S and seeing if it can derive the given string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S has three possible productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nSo, S expands into two non-terminals, which need to generate the entire string.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't56'. Let's see which production can produce 't56' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking for a production where the first symbol is a terminal. For example, looking for NTX \u2192 'tX' where the first part is 't56'. Wait, I see NT99 \u2192 't93' NT66, but that's not 't56'. Let me check all the terminals:\n\nLooking back, NT98 \u2192 't53' NT53.\n\nWait, but NT99 \u2192 't93' NT66. Hmm, where is 't56' coming from? Let me check all the productions again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT44 NT98: but NT98 is a non-terminal, so that's not helpful. Wait, another production: NT98 \u2192 't53' NT53.\n\nWait, looking again, is there any NT that directly produces 't56'?

{"custom_id":"request-753","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. In CNF, every production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Here, the start symbol is S, which produces NT49 NT74, among other options. The NT symbols are non-terminals, and the string contains tokens like 't6', 't70', etc. These tokens are terminals, each corresponding to a specific string of characters.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t56 t26 t29 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t26 t22 t70 t93 t56 t43 t22 t70 t98 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t70 t8 t6 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t31 t80 t82 t56 t71 t55 t76`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar, starting from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, derivations are straightforward, and each step reduces symbols by applying productions. \n\nFirst, I'll look for the start symbol S and see how it can split into two non-terminals. The initial productions from S are:\n\nS -> NT49 NT74\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, S can split into any of these three combinations. The first step in deriving the string is to choose which production to use. Each production leads to a tree where each node is a production step.\n\nThe given string is quite long, but perhaps I can approach it by trying to match the string step by step. Each terminal 't' is a result of a production that terminates in a terminal. Therefore, each occurrence in the string must correspond to a production where the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal (NT), and the right-hand side (RHS) includes that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal seems to have production rules that either produce two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. For example:\n\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\nNT77 can also be 't85'.\n\nSimilarly, NT57 -> NT55 NT61 or 't72' if it's NT47 on the RHS.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NTs can directly produce terminals, such as NT7 -> 't74', and others need to go through a chain.\n\nSo, the idea is to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of these terminals, each corresponding to a production step starting from S and eventually reaching the terminals in the string.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to reverse engineer the string. Starting from the given string, we can try to find patterns in the grammar that can generate it.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts:\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t56, t26, t29, etc. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has NT66 -> NT55 NT1. If NT1 is part of a production, but in the given string, I don't see a 't1' right after t56. Wait, perhaps I need to check more carefully.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t56. Looking at the grammar, NT56 has production rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT56:\n\nLooking through, I find NT56 -> NT92 NT40 (maybe?), and some others. Wait, I should list them systematically.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a mapping of each NT and their possible productions. Let me summarize the productions for each NT based on the grammar provided.\n\n[Note: I realize this could take a while, but it's crucial to understand each NT's possible productions.]\n\nStarting from NT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT69 -> NT66 NT64, but also NT68 etc.\n\nWait, this might take too long. Maybe a better approach is to work backwards from the string towards the start symbol S.\n\nEach terminal in the string should have a production where it is on the RHS as a terminal. So, for each 't', we check which NT can produce it.\n\nLooking for the first token, t56. Let's see which NT can produce t56.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT93 -> 't82', and NT99 -> 't51'.\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should make a list of all NTs and their possible terminals.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, let's scan each production and see when a terminal appears as the RHS.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nNT69 -> 't93'\n\nNT68 -> 't82'\n\nNT78 -> 't14' (Wait, in the grammar, it's NT18 -> 't14'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a list:\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT18 -> 't14'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT50 -> 't59'\n- NT85 -> 't46'\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT93 -> 't80'\n- NT18 -> 't19'\n- NT20 -> 't0'\n- NT28 -> 't20' and 't26' (looking at the grammar, NT28 has two productions producing 't20' and 't26')\n- NT69 -> 't68' (Wait, no, checking the grammar again:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all production RHS, any that are terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT68 -> 't82'\n- NT18 -> 't14'\n- NT93 -> 't80'\n- NT18 -> 't19'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT50 -> 't59'\n- NT85 -> 't46'\n- NT90 -> 't22'\n- NT93 -> 't80' (duplicate)\n- NT28 -> 't20', 't26'\n- NT69 -> 't68' (Wait, no, NT69: '66' and others. Let me check each NT's production.\n\nWait, this is taking too long. Maybe I should look for each 't' and find if any NT can produce it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a bottom-up approach: start from the string and try to match from the end.\n\nThe last token is t76.\n\nLooking through the grammar, which NTs can produce 't76'?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, is there any NT rule that ends with 't76'?\n\nYes, looking for RHSs that result in a terminal. Wait, perhaps I should look for productions where the RHS includes 't76' directly.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT12 -> 't1' and 't85', but that doesn't help. Wait, I should look for any NT that has a production with 't76'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI see a production for NT76: NT76 -> 't73' and another production for NT74: 't73' and 't73'?\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, I notice several entries:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT90 -> 't5'\nNT93 -> 't80'\n\nWait, maybe I'm not finding any NT directly producing 't76'. Hmm, perhaps I should look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, is there an NT that when expanded produces 't76'? For example, does NT47 produce 't72', and any other NT's?\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps 't76' is part of a production chain. For instance, NT74 -> NT73 NT73, and if NT73 is 't74', but that leads nowhere.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at other parts.\n\nAnother approach: check if each terminal in the string can be linked to a production path. Starting from the beginning, the first few tokens are t56, t26, t29, etc.\n\nLooking at t56: Is there any NT that can produce t56 as a terminal? Let's see the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through, I see that NT56 is part of the RHS in several rules, but does any NT produce t56 directly?

Hmm, where do I start? The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which has several productions. The string starts with t20, which I notice is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see S has productions like NT49 -> NT0 NT47, etc. But more importantly, I need to see which non-terminals derive into the string components. The string is long, so maybe it's helpful to parse it step by step.\n\nLet me list the string components to see if they correspond to any non-terminals or terminals in the grammar. The string is:\nt20, t74, t73, t72, t73, ..., up to other t's.\n\nFirst, t20. Looking at the grammar, in the production rules, I see NT16 -> t71, NT18 -> t17, but where does t20 come from? Looking at the production rules, I see NT28 is used in several productions. For example, NT28 can go to NT20 or another non-terminal. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT28 -> NT20 NT13\n- NT25 -> NT28 NT7\n- Also, NT69 -> t93, which is t93.\n\nWait, in the string, I have t20, which would come from NT28 -> NT20 NT13.\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce NT49 NT99 or others, but looking at the initial part:\n\nThe first production from S is NT49 -> NT0 NT47. So, S -> NT49 NT99, which is [NT49, NT99].\n\nThen, NT49 -> NT0 NT47. So, I need to see if NT0 and NT47 can derive into the string.\n\nNT0 -> NT77 NT34, and NT77 -> NT92 NT85, NT34 -> NT56 NT93, etc. But this seems a bit deep.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to top-down parse the string using the grammar. Chomsky normal form is good for that. Each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, so we can process the string in reverse, checking if it can be broken down into the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t98 t17 t93 t71 t55 t98 t46 t31 t80 t85 t22 t93 t71 t73 t56 t31 t11 t56.\n\nLet me reverse it: starting from the end, the string ends with t11 t56. So, looking from the end, perhaps t56 comes from NT56, which I know is a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT56 -> NT92 NT40, and maybe others. So, if t56 is at the end, we need to see how it's derived. Wait, let me list all the terminals in the string to see what non-terminals could produce them.\n\nThe terminals in the string are:\nt20, t74, t73, t72, t71, t73, t98, t17, t18, t31, t46, t22, t80, t85, t71, t55, t98, etc.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT7 -> t74\n- NT12 -> t74 (wait, no, NT7 is t74, NT12 is t1?\nWait, let me go through all the NT rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT7 -> t74\nNT16 -> t71\nNT17 -> t73\nNT18 -> t17\nNT19 -> t9 (from NT19 -> NT90 NT1 and then NT90 -> t22\nWait, maybe I should list all NT productions with terminal symbols:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT7 -> t74\nNT12 -> t1 (Is NT12 a terminal?

Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. The NT74 production is in the list as NT74 -> NT39 NT99. But in the string, I'm seeing t74, which must come from an NT that directly produces t74. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps NT7 produces t74. Yes, in the provided grammar, I see NT7 -> t74.\n\nBut then, looking for t74 in the string, the string starts with t20, t74, etc. So, t74 would be the result of NT7 -> t74. But wait, in the string, the second symbol is t74.\n\nWait, so the first symbol is t20, which must come from NT28 -> t20 (as per NT28 -> NT20 NT13 or something else? Wait, looking back: NT28 is in the grammar as NT28 -> NT20 NT13 and also NT25 -> NT28 NT7. Wait, but in the string, I see t20 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but looking back, the list of grammar rules, let me check: in the NT rules, I see NT28 -> NT20 NT13, which would produce t20 and something else. So, how can the string start with t20? Because the first symbol is t20, which would require that the first part of the production is NT28 -> t20 and another non-terminal.\n\nWait, so for the first symbol, t20, it must be derived from NT28 -> t20 NT13.\n\nBut in the grammar, looking at NT28 rules:\n\nYes, NT28 -> NT20 NT13, which would mean that in the string, the first part is t20 followed by NT13. So, the string starts with t20 t74 t73 etc.\n\nWait, but then the next symbol is t74, which must come from NT20's next production. But NT20 in the grammar is: looking for NT20, I don't see it explicitly, but maybe it's under another NT? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT20 is under NT50: NT50 -> NT18 NT85, but I think I might have confused something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should take a different approach. Since the string starts with t20, which comes from NT28 -> t20 NT13, the next symbols must come from NT13. So, following that, let's try to build the parse step by step.\n\n1. Start with t20 t74 t73 ... t56.\n\nThe first step is to match t20. As mentioned, t20 comes from NT28 -> t20 NT13. So, the string starts with [t20, s1], where s1 is t74 t73 ... t56.\n\nThen, the next part is s1, which should be NT13.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which rule produces NT13? Looking at the rules, I see NT13 -> t31. Because in the grammar, NT13 is present as:\n\nNT13 -> t31\n\nWait, looking through all the NT rules:\n\nYes, I see NT13 -> t31.\n\nSo, the next symbol s2 = t74 t73 ... t56 must come from NT13, which produces t31 followed by something? Wait, wait, NT13 is a terminal in itself. So, the next symbol after t20 is t74, which should come from NT13, but NT13 is t31, not t74. Wait, that's a contradiction. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nIn the string, the second symbol is t74. So, if the first was t20 from NT28, the next symbol t74 must come from NT20 or another part.

{"custom_id":"request-773","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a pretty strict structure. Each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string provided: it's a sequence of t's followed by numbers, so it's composed of terminal symbols. The grammar's right-hand sides of the non-terminals are mostly combinations of two non-terminals except for a few that directly produce a single terminal, like NT7 -> 't6' or NT70 -> 't73'. So, each rule in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string length is quite long, 44 tokens. Since the grammar starts with S, which can split into multiple non-terminals, the parse tree could be quite deep, but each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, so the maximum possible derivation depth would be around 44, which is manageable.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I need to see if it can be generated by the grammar. I'll try to do a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has three productions:\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo, the first symbol of the string is 't7', which suggests that the S production should start with a non-terminal that can produce 't7'. Let's check which non-terminals can produce 't7'. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT7 is defined as NT49 NT73. Both NT49 and NT73 are non-terminals, so unless one of those can produce a terminal, it won't help. Wait, NT74 -> NT39 NT99, NT40 -> NT16 NT80, NT74 is part of the production S->NT74 NT44. Hmm.\n\nLooking for terminals in the grammar, I notice some rules like NT7->'t74'? Wait no, let me check the grammar again. No, actually, the right-hand sides for NT are all combinations except for ones like NT7 -> 't74'? Wait no, looking back: no, in the provided grammar, some rules produce terminals. Wait, for example:\n\nNT16 -> 't71' (line 16: NT16 -> 't71')\n\nNT18 -> 't14' (line x: NT18 -> 't14')\n\nNT20 -> 't17' (not listed in the given, but from the rules provided, NT20 -> 't0' (line where NT20 -> 't17') and others like NT20 -> 't0' and 't18'? Wait, wait, in the grammar provided, some NT rules produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT16 -> 't71'\n- NT18 -> 't14' (I think)\nWait, let me check line by line:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74' (line 40: NT7->'t74')\n- NT16 -> 't71' (line 2: NT16->'t71')\n- NT18 -> 't14' (line 19: NT18->'t14')\n- NT20 -> 't17' (line 35: NT20->'t17')\n- NT39 -> 't9' (line 25: NT39->'t9')\n- NT70 -> 't82' (line 16: NT70->'t82')\n- NT50 -> 't59' (line 28: NT50->'t59')\n- NT66 -> 't26' (line 60: NT66->'t26')\n- NT73 -> 't74' (line 55: NT73->'t74')\n- NT9 -> 't5' (line 88: NT9->'t5')\n- NT33 -> 't8' (line 53: NT33->'t8')\n- NT92 -> 't52' (line ???: looking for NT92->t... Hmm, line 41: NT92->'t52'\n- NT55 -> 't6' (line 57: NT55->'t6')\n- NT56 -> 't40' (line 46: NT56->'t40'?)\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused, but it's clear that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. So, for our string starting with 't7', perhaps we need an NT that can derive 't7'. Wait, looking through the rules, do any NTs produce 't7'? I don't see any rule like NTx -> 't7', but I do see NT73 -> 't74', which might not help. Alternatively, maybe we can have 't7' as the result of combining two NTs that produce 't3' and 't4' or something else, but looking at the grammar, it's all combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t7. Let's see if any of the S productions start with NT that can produce t7. Looking at S's productions:\n\n1. S->NT74 NT44\n   - NT74: Let's follow the rule:\n     NT74 -> NT39 NT99\n     NT39 -> NT8 NT25\n     NT8 seems to be... Wait, NT8 isn't listed in the grammar? Or maybe it's a mistake. Wait, in the provided grammar, there's a NT40 -> NT16 NT80, NT35->..., but I don't see NT8 being defined. Wait, wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT8 rules. Hmm, that might be a problem. Or perhaps that's a typo, but I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps NT8 refers to 't8' as a terminal. But in the given grammar, it's not present. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT18 -> 't14' (line: NT18->'t14')\n- NT33->'t8' (line 53: NT33->'t8')\n- NT70->'t82' (line 16: NT70->'t82')\n- NT66->'t26' (line 60: NT66->'t26')\n- So, perhaps 't8' is derived from NT33, which is 't8'.\n\nSo, if we have 't8', that's NT33->'t8'.\n\nBut going back to NT74:\n\nNT74 is part of S's rule S->NT74 NT44. So, NT74 -> NT39 NT99.\n\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25.\n\nWait, NT8: in the grammar, do we have any rule for NT8? I need to check.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nThe rules are as provided initially, and within that, I don't see any NT8 productions. So, NT8 is undefined, which could mean it's a dead end because it can't produce any terminal, so the string starting with NT74 would produce a string starting with NT74, which is NT39 NT99, and so on, but if one of those can't produce a terminal, the entire tree would be invalid.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after t7, the next symbols are t26, t29, etc. So maybe when S is produced as NT74 NT44, each of these can derive some sequence of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that S -> NT74 NT44, and if NT74 can produce a string starting with 't7', but since NT74 is a non-terminal, it's going to generate symbols from NT39 and NT99.\n\nSo, the derivation might be:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\n  => (NT39 NT99) (something)\nBut then NT39 would be NT8 NT25. If NT8 is undefined, this could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe NT8 is a way to produce 't8' via another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should look for terminals in the first few steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another S production can be used.\n\nLooking at S's other productions: S->NT11 NT24 and S->NT40 NT92.\n\nLet's check S->NT11 NT24: NT11 and NT24.\n\nNT11 -> NT87 NT72"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-785","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is given with a bunch of production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form looks like. CNF is defined such that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. This means every production either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I think it's in CNF because all theProduction rules seem to be either terminals or two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44 is two non-terminals, and some others like NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99 also follow this structure. The only exception I notice is when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, like in some parts where NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85 would have to be checked against the string. Wait, no, actually in the grammar, many non-terminals have productions that go directly to terminals, like NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34, which in the given string appears as 't74' or 't73' etc. So, each step in the derivation would involve replacing non-terminals according to these rules.\n\nThe given string is `t7 t20 t56 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t11 t76 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t93 t71 t73 t56 t76 t56 t71 t73 t56 t93 t71 t55 t31 t85 t93 t71 t73 t56 t80 t72 t6 t73 t18 t14 t46 t56`. So, it's a sequence of terminals. The question is whether this can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI think the best approach here is to start from the top of the grammar and see if I can derive this string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to parse the string, we'd typically use a method like recursive descent parsing or a stack-based approach, but since the string is given, I can try to reverse-engineer the derivation.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol first. The grammar starts with S, and S has three productions: S \u2192 NT74 NT44, S \u2192 NT11 NT24, S \u2192 NT40 NT92. So, S must derive into one of these. Now, let's see if any of these can lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't7'. None of the S productions directly have 't7', except S \u2192 NT40 NT92, which could lead to 't56' and 't35' or something else I need to check. Wait, no. Wait, the non-terminals might expand further. So perhaps I should look for how each non-terminal can derive into the string's tokens.\n\nLet me see the first token is 't7'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, which might not help. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, but I don't see NT77 being used in the string. Alternatively, maybe NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99. Wait, perhaps I should make a tree starting from the string and see if it can be divided into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to check if the string can be generated by the grammar by seeing if each part of the string follows a path in the grammar. Since the grammar is given, I can try to see which parts of the string can be built from each rule.\n\nLet me first look at the beginning of the string: 't7 t20 t56 t73 t73 t73...' Now, looking for 't7' in the grammar, I see that NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99, and NT39 \u2192 NT8 NT25, etc. But none of the non-terminals directly produce 't7'. Wait, looking through the grammar, I notice that NT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73. Then NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47, and NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34, etc. Hmm, not sure that's helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each terminal in the string and see how they might be produced. Let's take the first few tokens: 't7', 't20', 't56', 't73'... \n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- 't7' appears in NT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73, but NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47, which would give more terminals. Alternatively, 't7' is in NT98 \u2192 t38, but that's later.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the last tokens to see which non-terminals can produce them. The last token is 't56'. Looking through the grammar, NT44 \u2192 t56. Also, NT9 \u2192 t5. NT47 \u2192 t72, and so on. So the last token 't56' could be produced by S \u2192 NT44, because S's productions include NT44 as an option.\n\nWait, S can be NT44, which is a non-terminal that can produce 't56' as per NT44 \u2192 t56. So that's the last part, but how does it tie back to the beginning?\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with 't7', which would need to come from some non-terminal expansion that eventually leads to 't7'. But in the grammar, I'm not seeing any non-terminal that directly produces 't7', except perhaps in NT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73, but that then splits further into more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, looking for subparts of the string that fit the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps build a parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if each token can be matched in the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps trying to map the string from the end. The last token is 't56', which can be produced by NT44. So, in the parse tree, the last step would be NT44 \u2192 t56.\n\nThen, before that, what produces NT44? Looking at the grammar, the start symbol S has S \u2192 NT44 NT something. Yes, S has three productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44\n\nSo, the S's first expansion is NT74 NT44. Then, in the string, if the last token is 't56' (from NT44), then before that, the two non-terminals would be NT44 and another non-terminal, perhaps NT74.\n\nWait, maybe the end of the string is generated by S \u2192 NT44, which is 't56', preceded by NT74. So the part before 't56' would be generated by NT74.\n\nSo, the string would end with '... t56', where the preceding part is generated by NT74.\n\nNow, looking at NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT99.\n\nSo, the string before 't56' would be generated by NT74, expanding into NT39 NT99. Then each of these, NT39 and NT99, would expand further.\n\nLooking at the next part of the string, it ends with ... t73 t73 t73 t73 t56. Wait, but actually, the last tokens before 't56' would be more than that. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check each token in the string to see what production rules could generate them.\n\nFor example, 't56' is generated by NT44 \u2192 t56.\n\n't72' is in NT47 \u2192 t72.\n\n't73' is produced by NT7 \u2192 t73, since looking through the grammar, NT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73, and then NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47, and NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34, etc. Wait, maybe not, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't7', which would need to come from a path that leads to t7. Looking through the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 NT49 NT73, and then NT49 \u2192 NT0 NT47, and NT0 \u2192 NT77 NT34, and NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, and NT92 \u2192 t56. So, going all the way down, NT7 would expand into t56, but the first token is 't7', not 't56'. So that doesn't match. That suggests that the first token 't7' can't come from NT7 directly, as NT7 eventually"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-809","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It has several production rules, each starting with a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. CNF requires that each production is either a single terminal or exactly two non-terminals, so the grammar seems to fit that.\n\nNext, I'll examine the string we need to evaluate: the string consists of a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers, which are probably abbreviations for terminal symbols or specific strings. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nI'll start by looking at the initial productions of S:\n\nS can produce:\n- NT49 NT99\n- NT39 NT25\n- NT40 NT92\n\nI'll need to see if the string can be broken down starting with any of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t9, t73, t73, etc. Let me see if any of the non-terminals can derive into these. For example, looking at NT73 in the grammar, it's a terminal 't73', so that will produce 't73'. Let's check if the string starts with that.\n\nWait, the first token is 't9'. Let me check if any non-terminal produces 't9'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT9 is a terminal 't9'. So if a production leads to NT9, it would produce 't9'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT73: NT73 -> 't73'. So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, looking at the first few tokens. The string starts with t9, then t73 three times. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce this.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t9. Looking for a production that can reach t9. In the grammar, NT9 is 't9', but for that to happen, the production must be NT9 -> 't9'. Looking at the given grammar, I don't see a production for NT9 except as a terminal. So perhaps NT8 is 't8' and NT9 is 't9', but unless there's a production for NT9, I can't get the t9 in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me look again. Okay, I see in the grammar:\n\nNT9 -> 't9' ?\n\nNo, wait, looking at the productions, I don't see NT9 -> anything other than itself? Or perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, the given grammar does include some NT entries that produce terminals. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT16 -> 't71'\nNT24 -> 't88'\nNT24 -> 't88'?\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see several lines where NT followed by a number is a terminal. Let me list them:\n\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n- NT70 -> 't73'\n- NT9 -> 't9' (is that correct? Or perhaps I'm misreading.)\n\nWait, in the given grammar lines, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT9->'t9'\nNT69->'t93'\nNT13->'t31'\nNT49->something\nAnd so on.\n\nSo looking for 't9', the only NT that directly produces 't9' is NT9. So the production for NT9 is NT9->'t9'.\n\nTherefore, any occurrence of NT9 in the string must be due to a production that includes NT9 on the right-hand side.\n\nNow, going back to the initial productions of S, none of them directly involve NT9. Let's check:\n\nS can produce NT49 NT99, NT39 NT25, or NT40 NT92.\n\nSo none of S's initial productions use NT9 directly. So perhaps the string cannot start with NT9. But wait, the string starts with t9, which is NT9. So if S can produce NT9 somehow, but in the given productions, S's initial productions don't involve NT9.\n\nWait, but maybe through other productions. Let me think: if there's a production that produces NT9, but it's not one of S's direct options. Maybe through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, NT98 is listed as producing 't46', but perhaps that's irrelevant. Let me see if there's a way for NT49 to produce something that can lead to NT9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT49 -> NT0 NT47. So NT49 can only produce NT0 and NT47. Then NT0 can produce NT77 NT34, which in turn leads to NT77 and NT34.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Let me try to map possible paths.\n\nBut I might be getting stuck in the trees. Alternatively, perhaps the given string can't start with 't9' because the grammar doesn't allow S to produce NT9 directly, and perhaps the first symbol 't9' suggests that NT9 must be derived from S, which is impossible because S can't directly produce NT9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, but assuming it's correct, I proceed.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the initial productions of S.\n\nLooking back:\n\nS can produce:\n\n- NT49 NT99\n- NT39 NT25\n- NT40 NT92\n\nSo none of these match NT9, which is needed for the t9 at the beginning. So to produce 't9' as the first symbol, S must produce something that includes NT9, which it can't do directly. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first symbol is 't9', and S's initial productions don't include any path to NT9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Wait, maybe the NT9 is produced by a longer chain, but in the given grammar, NT9 is only present if there's a production that produces 't9' through a sequence.\n\nBut looking again, in the given grammar, I don't see any production where NT9 is derived from other non-terminals. Only NT9->'t9'.\n\nSo the only way to get 't9' is through NT9 being in the string, but since S's initial productions don't generate NT9, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but I might be missing something. Maybe through some other path. Let me check if any of S's productions can lead to NT9. For example, does any of S's non-terminals produce NT9?\n\nLooking at S's possible steps:\n\nS can produce NT49 NT99. So if one of the NT49s can produce NT9, then perhaps the string starting with t9 is possible.\n\nLooking at NT49: NT49-> NT0 NT47. Then NT0-> NT77 NT34, and so on.\n\nWait, but this would produce 't73' ('t73' is from NT73->'t73')? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string cannot start with t9 because S can't derive NT9. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but I might be wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the string starts with t9, which is 't9'. So to produce 't9', we need a production where NT9 is part of the sequence.

{"custom_id":"request-811","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is great because it simplifies some parsing. Each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The starting symbol is S, and I see several NT rules and terminal symbols.\n\nThe string provided is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' is a terminal, and the numbers are part of the non-terminal symbols. So, the string is something like t20 t74 t73 and so on.\n\nI think I need to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S and trying to derive the entire string. Since it's in CNF, I can use a top-down approach, like the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can do it step by step manually.\n\nStarting with the string, I notice that the first symbol is t20. Looking at the grammar, I need to see which NT rules can produce t20 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides: I see NT70 -> 't6' etc., but wait, is there any NT that produces 't20'? Let me check the given grammar.\n\nWait, I see at the end:\n\nNT20 -> NT39 NT25\nNT28 -> 't20'\nNT18 -> 't14'\nNT93 -> 't80'\nNT18 -> 't19'\nNT20 -> 't17'\nNT20 -> 't0'\nNT28 -> 't20'\n\nSo, looking at the rules, there's NT28 -> 't20'. So 't20' can be derived from NT28.\n\nNow, looking at the string's second symbol is t74. So after t20, we have t74. So in the derivation, after S, which has NT49 NT74 (S->NT49 NT74), I might have to generate NT28 somewhere else, but maybe this is a stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the NT that produces t74. Checking the rules:\n\nLooking at NT74 -> NT39 NT99 and also at the end, NT74 -> 't73'? Wait, no, the end has NT7 -> 't74' but that's a different NT symbol. Let me check.\n\nActually, at the bottom, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\nSo that's a rule for NT7: NT7 -> 't74'.\n\nSo 't74' can be derived from NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 -> 't6'? Wait, no, NT73 is a non-terminal that's not further defined except in the derivations, I think.\n\nWait, looking back, at the end:\n\nNT73 -> 't6'\nSo NT73 produces t6.\n\nSo, putting that together, S produces NT49 NT74. So the first part is NT49 and NT74.\n\nIf I consider that the string starts with t20, which is produced by NT28, so if S can produce NT28 somewhere, then maybe.\n\nBut perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree starting from S and seeing if the symbols can be broken down.\n\nLet me try the first few symbols:\n\nt20 \u2192 comes from NT28, so I need to derive NT28 and then see if the other parts match.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT49 NT74, so to get t20, I might have another S somewhere or maybe the entire string is built from multiple S productions, but S is the top symbol.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar has multiple rules leading to S, so perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that each start with S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a single S derivation.\n\nBut since we have t20 at the beginning, let's see if the grammar allows for a derivation that starts with NT28. Looking at the production rules for NT28, I see:\n\nNT28 -> 't20' directly.\n\nSo the first symbol t20 can be produced by NT28.\n\nThen, what comes next is t74. So after t20 (from NT28), the next non-terminal would be another NT, say X, which when combined with Y, produces the remaining symbols.\n\nWait, but S is the top-level symbol, so the entire string must be derived from S. So the entire string must be derived by expanding S and its non-terminals into terminals.\n\nSo in this case, the string starts with t20, which comes from NT28. So let's say NT28 is the first non-terminal, then we need to see how the rest of the string can be derived.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production has either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So S can split into two non-terminals, say NT49 and NT74, each of which can then split into more symbols.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to approach this by seeing if each terminal in the string can be matched by a production from the grammar, starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct the parse tree level by level.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be divided into parts that can be matched by the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the string, it's a long sequence of t followed by numbers. Let's list them:\n\n1. t20\n2. t74\n3. t73\n4. t73\n5. t73\n6. t18\n7. t73\n8. t73\n9. t73\n10. t73\n11. t73\n12. t18\n13. t31\n14. t98\n15. t22\n16. t70\n17. t26\n18. t74\n19. t52\n20. t56\n21. t56\n22. t71\n23. t73\n24. t56\n25. t93\n26. t71\n27. t55\n28. t93\n29. t71\n30. t73\n31. t56\n32. t31\n33. t98\n34. t17\n35. t76\n36. t71\n37. t55\n38. t14\n39. t46\n40. t31\n41. t80\n42. t82\n43. t52\n\nThat's 43 symbols. Now, the grammar is a tree structure, so the number of symbols in the string should match the depth of the tree. But 43 is a bit long, but it's possible.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to look for sequences that match the rules.\n\nLooking at t20, which comes from NT28. Then, what comes after t20 is t74, which comes from NT74. Now, NT74 can be derived as NT39 NT99? Or wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking up, NT74 is present as:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\n\nWait, but in the rules, I don't see NT74.

{"custom_id":"request-827","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure this out. So I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and a string that might or might not be generated by this grammar. I need to determine whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. CNF is where every production rule has either one non-terminal on the left or two non-terminals on the right. Looking at the given grammar, I see all the S and NT rules either produce two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, except the rule S -> NT49 NT44, which is two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, all the S rules produce two non-terminals. Hmm, but after that, there are rules where non-terminals produce terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nI think the string provided is a sequence of terminals, as each 't' is followed by a number. So each token like 't22' represents a terminal symbol. The grammar's rules have some terminal symbols, like 't74', 't93', etc. But when looking at the rules, each production has either two non-terminals or a mix. So for example, S -> NT74 NT44, which means S can produce NT74 and NT44, which may each be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Each production rule's right-hand side (RHS) can only have one or two non-terminals because it's in CNF. But terminals can't have anything on the RHS except for the start symbol, but that's not typically the case. Actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the terminal symbols are defined as those strings starting with 't' followed by numbers. So for example, in the grammar, 't74' is a terminal, 't22' is a terminal, etc. So, the grammar's rules produce non-terminals, which eventually derive into terminal strings.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminal symbols. So, the question is whether the given string can be derived from S by applying the productions.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to parse the string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or apply the Floyd's method, but maybe a better approach is to see if there's a path through the grammar that can generate each part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be split into substrings that correspond to the right-hand sides of the grammar's rules.\n\nLet's list the production rules for easier reference:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nNT rules:\nNT49 -> NT0 NT47\nNT39 -> NT8 NT25\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\nNT57 -> NT85 NT56\nNT51 -> NT19 NT18\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\nNT40 -> NT16 NT80\nNT65 -> NT17 NT19\nNT85 -> NT64 NT12\nNT99 -> NT51 NT66\nNT55 -> NT47 NT65\nNT76 -> NT2 NT68\nNT57 -> NT19 NT99\nNT38 -> NT13 NT98\nNT64 -> NT65 NT13\nNT35 -> NT34 NT25\nNT12 -> NT93 NT70\nNT91 -> NT64 NT90\nNT34 -> NT56 NT93\nNT0 -> NT77 NT34\nNT19 -> NT17 NT57\nNT88 -> NT69 NT44\nNT66 -> NT55 NT1\nNT91 -> NT9 NT47\nNT65 -> NT17 NT55\nNT25 -> NT28 NT7\nNT80 -> NT17 NT44\nNT61 -> NT39 NT38\nNT68 -> NT90 NT38\nNT20 -> NT39 NT25\nNT35 -> NT11 NT77\nNT26 -> NT65 NT50\nNT2 -> NT28 NT13\nNT95 -> NT35 NT74\nNT56 -> NT92 NT40\nNT51 -> NT26 NT59\nNT12 -> NT51 NT20\nNT39 -> NT90 NT1\nNT70 -> NT12 NT90\nNT35 -> NT88 NT53\nNT40 -> NT44 NT98\nNT47 -> NT55 NT61\nNT50 -> NT18 NT85\nNT38 -> NT95 NT33\nNT40 -> NT25 NT85\nNT7 -> NT49 NT73\nNT18 -> NT76 NT91\nNT98 -> NT40 NT56\nNT93 -> NT66 NT64\nNT73 -> 't6'\nNT12 -> 't85'\nNT17 -> 't73'\nNT16 -> 't71'\nNT69 -> 't93'\nNT18 -> 't14'\nNT93 -> 't80'\nNT18 -> 't19'\nNT20 -> 't17'\nNT20 -> 't0'\nNT28 -> 't20'\nNT69 -> 't93'\nNT68 -> 't82'\nNT7 -> 't74'\nNT66 -> 't26'\nNT9 -> 't46'\nNT90 -> 't22'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT39 -> 't9'\nNT92 -> 't52'\nNT1 -> 't70'\nNT24 -> 't88'\nNT28 -> 't26'\nNT59 -> 't6'\nNT47 -> 't72'\nNT92 -> 't93'\nNT8 -> 't7'\nNT12 -> 't1'\nNT50 -> 't59'\nNT80 -> 't55'\nNT33 -> 't8'\nNT92 -> 't56'\nNT53 -> 't43'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT66 -> 't46'\nNT51 -> 't98'\nNT44 -> 't56'\nNT9 -> 't5'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT57 -> 't18'\nNT53 -> 't45'\nNT92 -> 't76'\nNT70 -> 't82'\nNT35 -> 't91'\nNT0 -> 't29'\nNT11 -> 't87'\nNT66 -> 't92'\n\nWow, that's a lot of rules. But each non-terminal on the RHS eventually resolves to a terminal or another non-terminal, except the ones with terminals in their RHS, like NT7 -> 't49' NT73, but wait, some of them directly produce terminals. For example, NT73 has NT73 -> 't6', so it's a direct terminal. Similarly, others produce terminals as well.\n\nNow, looking at the given string, it's a sequence of terminal symbols like t22, t70, t73, etc. The string is quite long, so it's going to take some time to analyze.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n1. Check if the string can be broken down into substrings that match the RHS of any production in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production's RHS is either one or two non-terminals. However, in CNF, the productions have to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Wait, but in this case, the RHS can have one or two non-terminals, but no two terminals together because it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which doesn't allow for two terminals in a single production. So each production in the grammar must have one or two non-terminals, but if a production has two non-terminals, it can't have terminals. Wait, no, CNF requires that each production is either a single non-terminal to a terminal or a non-terminal to two non-terminals. So each production's RHS must consist of exactly one terminal and one non-terminal, or two non-terminals, or a single non-terminal? Wait, actually, CNF can have both single and two non-terminals, but no two terminals together. So in this grammar, every production has either one or two non-terminals on the RHS. So in the given grammar, all the right-hand sides are either one non-terminal, two non-terminals, or perhaps sometimes a mix of non-terminals and terminals?

{"custom_id":"request-828","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's in the language it generates. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is given in a textual format, which is a bit hard to parse. I see that the grammar has variables S, NT49, NT39, and so on, leading down to terminals like 't6', 't73', 't70', etc. Each production rule either produces two non-terminal symbols or a terminal. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except when terminals appear, which means they can be the base cases.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, ending when the word ends. For example, 't22', 't70', etc.\n\nMy initial thought is that since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of a string must have a length equal to the number of symbols in the string minus one, because each step in the derivation replaces one non-terminal with two symbols (either non-terminals or a terminal). So, the number of steps required to derive a string of length n is n-1.\n\nLooking at the string: \n\nCounting the number of 't's and numbers, the string has 31 symbols (including the t's). That means a successful derivation would require 30 production steps. But I should verify if this is feasible with the given grammar.\n\nNext, I need to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the given non-terminals. For example, some parts of the string have 't73', which I see in the grammar as NT73 \u2192 't6'. Similarly, 't18' comes from NT18 \u2192 't14'. Also, 't70' comes from NT70 \u2192 't73'.\n\nI realize that this could take a lot of time to trace each step, so maybe I can approach it by starting from the start symbol S and see if I can build a parse tree that matches the string. However, since the string is quite long, I should look for patterns or structures that require specific productions.\n\nLooking at the string, after the first few 't73's, I see a 't18', which maps to 't14'. Then there's 't73' again, which aligns with some rules. Towards the end, towards 't55' and 't5' through NT5 \u2192 't5'. \n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be decomposed into a valid leftmost derivation. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation is the only possible way, as each production only inserts two symbols.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't22', which is produced by NT22 \u2192 't20'. NT20 has productions like NT20 \u2192 NT39 NT25 or NT20 \u2192 NT0. So the initial part of the string must come from one of these.\n\nContinuing, the second symbol is 't70', which is produced by NT70 \u2192 't73'. Then another 't73', which is NT73 \u2192 't6'. Then another 't73', same as before. Then 't18' \u2192 't14'. 't73' again, then 't73', then 't18' \u2192 't14', and so on.\n\nI should check if the sequence of terminals can be generated by following the grammar's productions. For instance, 't73' can only come from NT73 \u2192 't6'. Then, moving further, after 't73', I expect another NT that produces 't70', which is NT70 \u2192 't73', and that loops back, allowing continuous 't73's.\n\nHowever, towards the end, I see a 't59' which is produced by NT59 \u2192 't6'. Then 't6' comes from NT6 \u2192 't46', and so on. I need to make sure that all these steps are present in the grammar.\n\nI also need to ensure that the grammar can handle the sequence of productions required without getting stuck. For example, when a 't70' comes up (NT70 \u2192 't73'), that would require the preceding NT to have been produced, which depends on certain rules.\n\nAdditionally, I should check for recursive non-terminals that could cause infinitely looping derivations, but in this case, the grammar seems terminating as each step eventually produces a terminal or continues with non-terminals that lead to terminals.\n\nConsidering the complexity of tracking each step, maybe I can use a parsing approach, trying to find if the string can be derived by following the grammar. Alternatively, I can use a top-down parsing method, starting from S and trying to match the string symbol by symbol.\n\nLet me try to outline the possible steps:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT49 NT74. So the first two symbols must be the concatenation of what NT49 and NT74 derive.\n\n2. Looking at NT49: It can expand to NT0 NT47. So the first part is NT0, which then becomes NT77 NT34, and then each of those splits again.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't22', which is from NT22 \u2192 't20'. But S starts with NT49 and NT74. So unless there's a way to get from NT49 and NT74 to 't22', which seems unlikely, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe I got lost. Let me clarify: The start symbol is S, which can produce pairs like NT49 and NT74. Each of these can only expand into other non-terminals according to their production rules, but ultimately, each must lead to a terminal sequence.\n\nSo for the string to be valid, the entire string must be derived from either of the possible initial productions of S. So perhaps the string starts with NT49 NT74, and the string starts with 't22 t70 t73...', which would require that NT49 and NT74 derive into sequences that can combine into such a string.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT49 NT74, which would mean that the string is the concatenation of what NT49 produces and what NT74 produces. So the first symbol of the string comes from NT49, and the second comes from NT74, or their expansions.\n\nWait, that can't be because the string starts with 't22 t70 t73...'. So the first symbol is 't22', which comes from NT22. So from S \u2192 NT49 NT74, which would produce a sequence of symbols starting with what NT49 and NT74 derive.\n\nBut the first two symbols are 't22 t70', which would require NT49 to produce a 't22' and NT74 to produce 't70'. Looking at the grammar, does NT49 ever produce 't22'? Or does NT74?\n\nWait, NT22 \u2192 't20', which is a terminal. So the first symbol is 't20' if NT22 is the first. But the string starts with 't22', so unless the expansion is more involved, perhaps through a chain of non-terminals.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should check if each 't' in the string corresponds correctly to the grammar's terminals.\n\nFor example, 't22' must come from a production of a non-terminal that leads to 't22'. Looking at the grammar, NT22 \u2192 't20'. So 't22' itself is not directly a terminal in the grammar. Wait, but the string has 't22' as the first symbol, which would have to come from NT22. So let's confirm if NT22 has a production to 't22'.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the production NT22 \u2192 't20' is listed. So how can the string start with 't22'? Because 't22' isn't an option for NT22. Unless, perhaps, there's a production rule I missed for NT22.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again: \n\nThe grammar has entries for NT77, NT99, NT57, etc. Looking for NT22: Oh, I see NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65, and NT65 \u2192 NT44 NT17, but I don't see NT22. So does NT22 produce 't20' only?\n\nWait, the string starts with 't22', which according to the grammar, isn't directly produced by any non-terminal except perhaps NT22 \u2192 't20'. But that would mean 't22' is never a terminal; thus, the string would start with 't20', making the string invalid. But the string starts with 't22', which isn't produced by any rule. So that would immediately mean the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through the list, I see a production for NT22"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. The start symbol is S, and the productions are quite complex.\n\nThe string starts with `t56`, which in the grammar is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT56 is defined as `t56`. So, whenever NT56 appears, it becomes `t56`. Similarly, NT52 is `t52`, which appears early in the string.\n\nThe string seems long, and I'll need to parse it step by step. Maybe I can start by identifying the main structure. Let's see, the grammar begins with S, which can produce combinations like NTNT followed by numbers. Each S production starts with two NT rules.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: `t56`, `t20`, `t74`, `t73` repeated several times. So the first part of the string is `t56 t20 t74 t73^5` (t73 five times), then `t18 t31 t11 t52 t26 t74 t73^5 t70 t31 t1 t93 t71 t73 t56 t52`.\n\nI think each part after t56 and t20 could relate to a series of NT productions that lead to these terminals. Let's see if I can break down each part.\n\nStarting with the first production for S: S -> NT74 NT44. Let's see what NT74 and NT44 produce. NT74 is `NT39 NT99`, and NT44 is `NT52`. Wait, wait, from the grammar, NT74-> NT39 NT99 and NT52-> t52.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the grammar rules:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\n\nBut then NT39 is `NT8 NT25`, and NT99 -> NT51 NT66. This seems to be going down the NT35, NT11, NT52 path.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the string in terms of how the NT's would produce the terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can go to NT74 NT44. So the first part would be NT74 leading to `t56` and NT44 leading to something else.\n\nWait, let me check the NT definitions again.\n\nLooking for NT74 production: NT74 -> NT39 NT99. Then NT39 is NT8 NT25, and NT99 is NT51 NT66.\n\nWait, NT8 is `t7`, NT25 is `NT28 NT7`, and NT51 is NT26 NT59, which seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another production from S could lead to the string. Another S production is S-> NT40 NT92. NT40 is `NT16 NT80`, which might lead to t71 or something.\n\nAlternatively, another S production is S-> NT65 NT19, which leads to t73, as NT19 is `t73`.\n\nWait, let's see. The string starts with t56, which is NT56's terminal. So that corresponds to the production NT56->t56.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT56 is produced by NT47 NT65. So, when we have NT56, that splits into NT47 and NT65.\n\nNT47 can be NT55 NT61, and NT65 is NT17 NT55. NT17 is `t73`, and NT55 is NT47 NT65, which seems recursive but eventually leads to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Perhaps the string can be broken down into tokens that correspond to certain NT productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t56, so we have NT56->t56. Then the next token is t20. From the grammar, NT20 can be produced by which rule? Looking back: NT20->NT39 NT25 and NT20 is also in another rule? Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT20 is defined as NT39 NT25. Hmm, but I'm looking for where NT20 produces t20 or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all the NT rules and their possible productions to see how the terminals are generated.\n\nLooking at each NT symbol and their productions:\n\n- NT56: t56\n- NT52: t52\n- NT47: NT55 NT61\n- NT44: NT19 NT25\n- NT74: NT39 NT99\n- NT99: NT95 NT0\n- NT39: NT8 NT25\n- NT25: NT28 NT7\n- NT95: NT35 NT74\n- NT74 is already known\n- NT35: NT34 NT25\n- NT28: NT13 NT98\n- NT8: t7\n- NT7: t73\n- NT20: NT39 NT25\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to find a path that would produce the string.\n\nThe string starts with t56, so that's NT56. Then t20: to get t20, we need NT20. How does NT20 produce t20? Looking back, NT20 is produced by NT39 NT25. NT39 is NT8 NT25, and NT25 is NT28 NT7. NT28 is NT13 NT98, and NT98 is NT69 NT44. Wait, but that seems too deep.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another path: NT20 could go down a different route, but according to the given grammar, NT20 only has one production: NT20 -> NT39 NT25.\n\nHmm, so to get t20, which is NT20, perhaps NT39 and NT25 produce t8 and something else, but I don't recall any NT producing t20 directly.\n\nWait, looking at the string again, after t56 and t20, next is t74, which is NT74. How can NT74 produce t74? Looking at the grammar, NT74 is NT39 NT99. So to get t74, that would be via NT39->NT8 NT25 and NT99->NT51 NT66. Wait, but NT8 is t7, and NT51 is NT26 NT59.\n\nThis might not be the right path because the string has t74 followed by multiple t73s. Maybe I'm going down the wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the first production rule: S->NT74 NT44.\n\nNT74: NT39 NT99\n\nNT39: NT8 NT25\n\nNT8: t7\n\nNT25: NT28 NT7\n\nNT28: NT13 NT98\n\nNT13: NT1...

I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, all the production rules seem to fit this structure, with only single terminals on the right-hand side of some productions, like the ones ending with 't74', 't73', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t22 t70 t73 t73 t18 t26 t31 t22 t56 t71 t55 t92 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t26 t73 t18 t19 t26 t31 t22 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t6 t26 t56`.\n\nI remember that in CNF, every non-terminal must expand into terminals and non-terminals in such a way that the parse tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly two children. Since all the productions are binary, this should be manageable.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level productions in the grammar. The start symbol is S, which has three productions:\n\n1. S -> NT11 NT24\n2. S -> NT11 NT39\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nWait, no, looking back, actually the start symbol is S, which can go to NTNT or other combinations. Wait, but wait a minute, the initial grammar was presented in a way that S -> NT74 NT44, etc. So each production for S is NT something and NT something else. For example:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\n\nBut S can also produce NT11 NT24, etc. So S starts by producing two NT symbols, each of which can potentially be terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nNow, let me look at the string. The first token is t22. So I need to see which production in the grammar can start with T22. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT91 -> NT9 NT47\n- NT90 -> nt93 NT74\nWait, looking at the NT productions, I see some that produce 't' terminals.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT91 -> 't73' when S produces it.\n\nWait, no, let's list all NT productions that produce terminals, because those are the ones that can directly generate terminal strings.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT91 -> 't73' (from S->NT74 NT44, perhaps, but in the list, NT91 has NT92 NT85?

Looking at the grammar, I see that NT90 -> t22. So the first symbol in the string is produced by NT90. So we start with NT90.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT90, in the grammar, which one produces 't22'? From the list:\n\nNT90 -> NT64 NT90.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out whether the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me understand the given grammar. It starts with the start symbol S, and the rules are:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\nS -> NT11 NT24\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo S can only expand into three possibilities: NT74 followed by NT44, NT11 followed by NT24, or NT40 followed by NT92.\n\nLooking at the entire structure, I see that NT74, NT44, NT40, etc., are other non-terminals. Each of these has rules that further split them into combinations of other non-terminals and some are terminals, which in this case seem to be strings of the form 't' followed by numbers or letters. For example, NT74 -> NT39 NT99, and NT99 -> NT51 NT66, and so on. The process continues until we reach terminals like 't73', 't71', etc.\n\nI notice that the terminals in the string are like 't56', 't55', 't76', etc., and they seem to correspond to specific non-terminals. I think I need to track how each symbol in the string is generated from the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t56 t56 t71 t55 t76 t20 t76 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t92 t31 t1 t52 t71 t73 t56 t31 t11 t52 t71 t55 t80 t72 t6 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t76 t20 t74 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t31 t85 t56`.\n\nEach 't' followed by two digits is a terminal symbol, which must be generated directly by a rule in the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nTo determine if the string is in the language, I can model this as a parsing problem, checking if the string can be built starting from S.\n\nLet me jot down the key points:\n\n1. The starting point is S, which can expand into S1: NT74 NT44, S2: NT11 NT24, S3: NT40 NT92.\n\n2. The string has 42 tokens. Since each production of S adds two non-terminals, the derivation tree will have a certain number of nodes, but maybe that's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the string as a sequence of terminals and see if they can be produced step by step from S.\n\nGiven that, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be the way to go. But writing out all 42 steps might be time-consuming, but let's try to analyze the structure.\n\nAlternatively, since S can only expand into three possible combinations, each starting with certain non-terminals, perhaps we can look for starting points.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t56 t56.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't56'? Let's see.\n\nFrom the given grammar rules, for example:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\nNT44 -> NT65 NT13\nBut when I look further down, I see NT56 being defined as NT92 NT40, but wait, no. Let me check all the non-terminals and their productions to find where 't56' is produced.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have several non-terminals that produce specific terminals. Let me try to find which non-terminals lead to 't56'.\n\nLooking through the given production rules:\n\nThe only production I see with t56 is NT56 -> t56, perhaps? Wait, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT74 -> ... etc.\n- I see a line: NT99 -> NT51 NT66\n- NT66 -> NT55 NT1\n- But then, another line: NT56 -> NT92 NT40\n- Wait, no. Let me look through all productions:\n\nWait, I can see several rules that end with a terminal starting with 't':\n\nLooking through the list, many have the form NT... -> ... but then, some of them produce 't' followed by numbers.

{"custom_id":"request-866","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG). The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which makes it a bit easier to handle because each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal. \n\nLet me first look at the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are:\n\n- S -> NT74 NT44\n- S -> NT11 NT24\n- S -> NT40 NT92\n\nThese are the initial options the parser has. So, any string generated by this grammar must start with two NTs that match either of these three options. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t56 t56 t20 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t76 t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t56 t71 t55 t76 t26 t29 t72 t6 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t31 t1 t76`\n\nFirst, I notice that the first two tokens are t56 and t56. So, I need to check which production produces t56. Looking through the rules, I see that several rules produce t56:\n\n- NT44 -> t56\n- NT40 -> t44\n- NT51 -> t98\n- NT53 -> t45\n- NT56 -> t92\n- NT59 -> t6\n- NT66 -> t26\n- NT77 -> t93\n- NT92 -> t52\n- NT95 -> t35\n- NT76 -> t82\n- NT74 -> t73\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT66 -> 't6'\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, I see that NT92 is present, and NT92 has a rule NT92 -> NT69 NT40. But more importantly, I need to see how t56 is derived. Let's look at the production rules for each NT that can lead to t56:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT92 -> NT69 NT40: I don't see t56 here.\n- NT11 -> 't87': that's t87, not t56.\n- NT24 -> 't88': t88, not t56.\n- NT44 -> 't56': So, NT44 can produce t56.\n- NT40 -> 't44': produces t44, not t56.\n- NT74 -> 't73': no.\n- NT11 -> 't87': no.\n- Wait, perhaps I missed some rules. Let me go through all the rules systematically.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT0 -> NT77 NT34\n- NT1 -> NT70\n- NT2 -> NT28 NT13\n- NT3 -> ... (not relevant)\n- NT4 -> ... (not relevant)\n- NT5 -> ... (not relevant)\n- NT6 -> ?\nWait, looking at the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t56 except for:\n\n- NT0 -> NT77 NT34\n- Wait, no, in the provided grammar, NT92 is produced by NT92 -> NT69 NT40, and NT40 -> NT16 NT80, but that doesn't help. \n\nWait, looking again: \n\nI think I might have made a mistake. Looking through the list:\n\n- NT44 -> 't56' directly. So, NT44 can produce t56.\n- NT56 -> 't92': So, that's not it.\n- NT40 -> 't44': which goes to t44, not t56.\n- NT74 -> 't73'\n- NT53 -> 't45'\n- NT51 -> 't98'\n- NT76 -> 't82'\n- NT77 -> 't93'\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- NT69 -> 't93'\n- NT74 \u2192 't73'\n- Wait, I'm seeing that NT92 can be derived from NT92 \u2192 NT69 NT40. But NT40 can be broken down further: NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80, and so on. But none of these directly produce t56.\n\nWait, I think I need to look for any non-terminal that can produce t56. Looking at the rules provided:\n\n- NT44 -> 't56': So, NT44 is one that can produce t56.\n- Any other NT? NT92's rules go to NT69 and NT40, which go further down but don't produce t56 here. \n\nSo, the initial production must be S -> NT44 NT44 because the first two tokens are t56 t56, which would correspond to NT44 -> t56 and NT44 -> t56. Let me check the four rules:\n\nLooking at the initial productions of S:\n\nS \u2192 NT74 NT44: So, S can produce (t73 t56)\nBut the string starts with t56 t56, which doesn't match this.\n\nWait, no, S -> NT11 NT24 would produce 't87' and 't88', which is not our case.\n\nWait, no, S can also produce NT40 NT92: which would lead to t44 and t52, not t56 t56.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the string starts with 't56 t56', so the first two symbols are t56 and t56. \n\nLooking back at the grammar, which NTs can produce t56? Let's find all NTs that derive to t56.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nEach rule has a production that can potentially derive to a 't' symbol.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 NT69 NT40. Now, NT40 has a rule NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80, and NT80 \u2192 NT17 NT44, and NT44 \u2192 't56'.\n\nSo, breaking this down:\n\nNT92 \u2192 NT69 NT40 \u2192 NT69 (which can produce 't93') and NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80 \u2192 NT16 is 't71', NT80 \u2192 NT17 NT44 \u2192 NT17 is 't73', NT44 is 't56'. So, wait, let's see:\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the possible steps.\n\nStarting from S, the first step is to choose one of the three productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44: first two tokens would be 't73' 't56'\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24: first two tokens would be 't87' 't88'\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92: first two tokens would be 't44' 't...'\n\nBut our string starts with 't56 t56', so the first two symbols are both t56.\n\nLooking at the three possibilities:\n\n- For the first production (NT74 NT44): NT74 \u2192 t73, NT44 \u2192 t56 \u2192 so first two tokens would be t73 t56. Doesn't match.\n- Second production (NT11 NT24): both NT11 and NT24? NT11 \u2192 't87', NT24 \u2192 't88' \u2192 first tokens would be t87 t88, not t56.\n- Third production (NT40 NT92): NT40 \u2192 t44, NT92 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, NT40 \u2192 't44' and NT92 \u2192 't52' or further? Wait, no:\n\nWait, looking at the production rules for NT92: the first one is NT92 \u2192 NT69 NT40. So NT92 can expand into (t93)(t44) because NT69 \u2192 t93 and NT40 \u2192 t44. So the first two tokens would be t93 t44, which is not t56 t56.\n\nHmm, this is confusing because none of the direct productions from S seem to give t56 t56. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look deeper into the grammar's productions to find how 't56' can be derived.\n\nLooking through all the rule bodies:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't56"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-885","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar starts with S and has multiple productions. Each production on the left is a single non-terminal, and the right sides are pairs of non-terminals or terminals. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has exactly two symbols on the right side\u2014either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, they all seem to be rules that produce pairs of non-terminals or non-terminals and terminals. For example, S -> NT74 NT44 is a production that takes NT74 and NT44. Then, each NT (Non-terminals) further break down into other symbols. The end goal is to see which symbols ultimately produce the 't' symbols (which are terminals) in the given string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t56 t71 t55 t93 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t93 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t52 t56 t71 t55 t93 t71 t73 t56 t56 t56 t71 t55 t52 t71 t55 t93 t56 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t55 t56 t20 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t52.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. From the grammar rules, I can see that many NT symbols eventually produce these terminal t's. For example, NT7 -> 't74', NT12 -> 't85', etc. So, each terminal is produced by certain NT symbols.\n\nThe key is to check if the string can be derived by the grammar, i.e., each terminal must be generated by some NT symbol that's part of a production chain from the start symbol S.\n\nI think the best approach is to map each 't' in the string to the NT that produces it. Then trace whether the sequence of NTs can be produced by the grammar.\n\nFor example, the first 't56' in the string. Let's look up which NT produces 't56'. From the grammar, I see:\n- NT56 is defined as: NT56 -> NT92 NT40\nBut then NT92 and NT40 each map to other symbols that further break down. For instance, NT92 -> NT64 NT12, which then NT64 and NT12, and so on. Then, some of these will eventually produce 't's.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to represent each terminal as a node and see if their parent NTs are also in the chain. Maybe building a dependency tree for the string and checking if it connects back through the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to see the sequence of non-terminals that would produce the string. Since each 't' is a terminal, each must be a leaf in the parse tree. So the entire string is built by a tree where each non-terminal is expanded into two other symbols, which may be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI should start by listing out which NTs produce each 't'. Let me create a list:\n\n- t20 comes from NT20\n- t28 comes from NT28, which goes to t20\n- t26 comes from NT26, which is from NT9 and NT19\n- t2 comes from NT2, which is from NT28 and NT13\n- t13 comes from NT13\n- t70 comes from NT70\n- t16 from NT16, etc.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to look up each 't' in the string and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me pick a few tokens and check:\n\nt56: From the grammar, NT56 -> NT92 NT40. NT92 -> NT64 NT12. NT64 -> NT65 NT13. NT65 -> NT17 NT19. NT19 -> NT17 NT57. NT17 is terminal 't73'. NT19 -> NT57. NT57 could be from NT57? Wait, looking back, NT57 has two productions: one is NT57 -> NT85 NT56, and another is NT53 -> NT45 NT53, perhaps I'm mixing up. Wait, no, the NT57 in the grammar is: NT57 -> NT55 NT61, and also NT57 -> NT19 NT99. So, if I need to get t56 from NT56, let's work step by step.\n\nBut wait, the string is long, so this might take too long. Maybe a better approach is to see if all the 't's in the string can be obtained via the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the 't's may not be part of the language. For instance, t71. Let's see: looking at the grammar, NT71: Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT18 -> 't14', NT16 -> 't71'. So 't71' comes from NT16.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, NT16 is a non-terminal that must be produced from some rule. Let me see the productions for NT16. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT16 having a rule. Let me look through the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules: I see productions like NT16 -> 't71' but then I need to see which NT produces 't16'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, no, in the grammar, each production is left-hand side being a single NT, right-hand side being two symbols. So, for example, NT7 -> 't74', NT12->'t85', etc.\n\nWait, but looking through all the rules, NT16 seems to be only in one place: in the production NT16 -> 't71'. So NT16 is a terminal, right? Because it's being expanded into 't71', which is a terminal. So if 't71' is in the string, which it is in the given string, does NT16 exist in the grammar? Wait, but in the grammar, all non-terminals are used as left-hand sides of productions. So if NT16 is not present as a left-hand side in any production, it cannot be a non-terminal\u2014that would be a problem because we can't derive it.\n\nWait, looking back through the grammar, there's no production for NT16 on the left side. Only on the right side. So NT16 is a terminal, because it's being rewritten into 't71', which is a terminal.\n\nBut in Chomsky Normal Form, each production must have two non-terminals or terminals. So if NT16 is a non-terminal, it needs to be on the left side of some production. But in this grammar, it's only on the right side of another production. So that would make NT16 a terminal.\n\nBut then, how is NT16 being used as a non-terminal? Because in any parse tree, we start with S and expand non-terminals into other symbols, but a terminal is just a leaf node and cannot be expanded further.\n\nSo if NT16 is a terminal, then in any derivation starting from S, any occurrence of NT16 would have to be a problem because NT16 isn't a non-terminal\u2014it can't be expanded. Therefore, if the string contains 't71', which is produced by NT16, but in the grammar, NT16 is a terminal because it's only used on the right side, this would be an issue.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: in the grammar, each production is of the form NT -> something, where NT is a non-terminal. Therefore, if NT16 is not on the left side of any production, it cannot be a non-terminal, because there's nothing to derive it from. Therefore, NT16 must be a terminal. So in the string, any occurrence of 't71' must be directly produced by NT16, which is a terminal.\n\nBut in that case, in the string, 't71' can be in the string because it's a terminal. However, in the string, 't71' appears multiple times. Let me check the string:\n\nLooking at the string: it's a long list. Let me find all instances.

{"custom_id":"request-889","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t7 t20 t29 t72 t6 t98 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t85 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t56 t71 t73 t56 t19 t46 t31 t1 t70 t56` is generated by it. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form looks like. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol expands into two non-terminal symbols, or a terminal symbol and a non-terminal, but wait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where a is a terminal. So each production has exactly two symbols on the right side, which can be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, all the productions seem to be in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which is of length 2 for the non-terminals. Then, each NT symbol eventually breaks down into terminals or more non-terminals. The terminals correspond to specific strings, like 't7', 't20', etc.\n\nMy task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions. \n\nLet me start by listing all the productions for clarity. The grammar is given with a long list of non-terminal symbols (NTx), each with their own productions. Each NTx seems to expand into two other NT or terminal symbols. \n\nEach terminal like 't7', 't20', etc., is a leaf node in the parse tree. So the string is a series of these terminals, and each must be generated by some production.\n\nThe key approach here is to reverse-engineer the string. Starting from S, the start symbol, each step can combine two symbols either as non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal. But since all productions are two symbols, it might help to reconstruct possible parse trees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can work backwards from the string, grouping the terminals according to the grammar's productions to see if the entire string can be reduced to the start symbol S. This is called the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) parsing algorithm approach, which works for Chomsky normal form.\n\nBut considering the string is quite long, I might need to break it into parts. Let me see if there are known patterns.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t7, which is produced by NT74 \u2192 t7. That is, NT74 can go directly to t7. Then comes t20. Looking at the grammar, t20 is from NT16's production: NT16 \u2192 t71 NT20, but wait, actually looking back, the NT productions are:\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the NT productions. For example, NT77 \u2192 NT92 NT85, etc. But also, some NT symbols directly go to terminals. Like NT50 \u2192 NT18 NT85, which then goes to something else, but I need to see if t72 is produced by some NT.\n\nLooking through, I see NT74 \u2192 t7. Then NT97? Wait, in the given grammar, NT74 is as follows: \n\nNT74 -> NT3, or... wait, let me look through the grammar lines again.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\n\nNT49 -> NT0 NT47\n\nNT77 -> NT92 NT85\n\nNT57 -> NT85 NT56\n\nNT51 -> NT19 NT18\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT99\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t72. Let me see if any NT produces t72. Looking through, I don't see NT72 in the grammar. Wait, but let me check the grammar for any NT that leads to 't72'. \n\nLooking at all the NT productions, under NT47: NT47 \u2192 NT55 NT61. NT55 \u2192 NT47 NT65, which goes further. Wait, but maybe I missed NT72. Looking again, perhaps NT72 is an NT that directly produces 't72', or is 't72' a terminal?\n\nWait, in the string, we have 't72' which is a terminal. So I need to check if any NT production produces 't72'.\n\nLooking at all the NTs:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't85', 't20', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all terminal strings for each NT:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT57 -> NT85 NT56: so NT57 expands to NT85 and NT56.\n\nBut to find if any NT directly produces a terminal. Let's go through each NT:\n\nFor example, NT70 -> NT12 NT90, which is 't12' and 't90', which themselves may expand further.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NT may produce t... Let me see:\n\nLooking for any line where an NT ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t7 (from the line NT74->t7 and NT? Wait, no. Wait, looking again: \n\nWait, the grammar is presented as lines like \"NT49 -> NT0 NT47\", but some NTs have terminal symbols, like \"NT12 -> 't85'...\". So for example, looking for any NT that has a terminal in its production:\n\nLooking at the end of each line, some NTs have terminal symbols. For example:\n\n- NT20 -> 't17' ??? Let me check the lines. \n\nWait, looking at each line:\n\nWait, no, not all NTs have terminals. Let me see:\n\nNT7 -> NT49 NT73\n\nNT18 -> NT76 NT91\n\nNT98 -> NT40 NT56\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me look for any NT that directly produce 't72'.\n\nLooking through all the given NT productions, I can't find any NT directly producing 't72'. So perhaps 't72' is the result of a non-terminal NT. Let me check whether any NT's production includes t72 or how it can lead to it.\n\nWait, perhaps I have to re-examine the grammar correctly.\n\nLet me see: the start symbol is S, which is NT49 NT74. NT49 can produce NT0 NT47, and NT74 produces NT39 NT99. So S is split into NT49 and NT74. Each continues to split further.\n\nLooking for t7, t20, t29, etc., perhaps we can trace the derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step, breaking down the string to the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt7 t20 t29 t72 t6 t98 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t85 t56 t56 t71 t73 t56 t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t46 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t70 t56.\n\nFirst, t7: from the grammar, t7 is from NT74, as S's first production is NT74 NT44, and NT74 -> t7. So maybe the first symbol comes from NT74.\n\nSo the first part is t7, which is from NT74. Now, the next symbol is t20. So after t7 comes t20, which is part of the same unit. So how can NT74 and NT44 combine to produce t7 and then t20? Hmm.\n\nWait, S is NT74 NT44. NT74 \u2192 t7, and NT44 could be something else. Let me check NT44's production. In the grammar, NT44 isn't listed, but checking, looking through all NT lines... Oh wait, no NT44. Wait, perhaps I've missed it. Wait, looking through:\n\nLooking through each NT, like NT39, NT40, etc., I don't see NT44. So maybe I've misread the grammar. Wait, perhaps I should reconstruct the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo or didn't provide all NTs. Alternatively, maybe some NTs have longer productions. Wait, but the grammar provided is as follows, and in the context, each line is a production. So looking back, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT74 NT44\n\nS -> NT11 NT24\n\nS -> NT40 NT92\n\nNT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-910","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by this grammar. Hmm, first, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, I think. Looking at the productions, I see that the start symbol is S, and it has three productions. Each non-terminal (like S, NT49, etc.) eventually leads to terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers, which makes me think each production ultimately terminates in these 't' symbols.\n\nThe string I need to check is a sequence of 't' terms. It starts with t56 t56 t56, then more t56s and others. I should probably trace back from the start symbol S to see how this string can be formed.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n2. S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n3. S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nI notice that NT40 and NT74 are also non-terminals. Let's see where they can lead.\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\nNT16 \u2192 t71\nNT80 \u2192 NT17 NT44\nNT17 \u2192 t73\nNT44 \u2192 t56\n\nSo, putting that together, NT40 can derive t71 t73 t56.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t56 t56 t56. Maybe it's coming from NT40 (t71 t73 t56) and another production. Wait, but NT40 is part of S's production as S\u2192NT40 NT92. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should process the string step by step. Let's break it down into parts, looking for the 't's that must come from each non-terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which parses strings in CNF grammars. But I'm not very familiar with it, so maybe I can find a more straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a path from S down to the given string using the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: it's a long sequence of t terms. Let's see if each t corresponds correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to work backwards. Each 't' must come from a terminal production. Suppose each 't' in the string is a terminal, and I need to see if each can be reached by the corresponding non-terminal.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, some non-terminals have direct 't' productions, like 't74' comes from NT74, etc.\n\nLet me see: For example, NT74 \u2192 t74, so if the string has t74, it's derived from NT74.\n\nLooking at the string: starts with t56 three times. Is there a production that can yield t56 three times in a row? Or perhaps combinations.\n\nWait, let's consider the start symbol S \u2192 NT74 NT44. NT74 would be t74, and NT44 is t56. So S \u2192 t74 t56. But the string starts with three t56s, which is more than two. Oh, wait, S has three productions, not two. Wait no, looking back, the grammar for S has three options. Let me check again.\n\nThe grammar for S is:\n- S \u2192 NT74 NT44\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT92\n\nEach of these is a production with two non-terminals, meaning each production contributes two terminal symbols. But the string is way longer than two symbols, so maybe it's a combination.\n\nWait, maybe the string is being built from other non-terminals that eventually produce multiple 't's.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps each part of the string corresponds to a certain non-terminal production. Let's take the string token by token:\n\nt56 t56 t56 t71 t55 t52 t56 t20 t74 t73 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t18 t31 t1 t93 t71 t55 t93 t56 t71 t55 t93 t56 t71 t55 t56 t20 t29 t72 t6 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t52 t56 t71 t73 t56 t52 t71 t55 t56.\n\nWait, this is a lot. Let me try to parse it into segments that correspond to the grammar.\n\nFor example, if I look at S \u2192 NT74 NT44, then NT74 is t74 and NT44 is t56. So the string could start with t74 t56. But the first part of the string is t56 t56 t56. Hmm, that doesn't fit directly.\n\nAlternatively, looking for parts where t56 comes from NT44. Because NT44 \u2192 t56. Also, NT40 \u2192 t71 t73 t56. Wait, no, NT40 produces t71, t73, t56.\n\nWait, let's check the NT44 production. NT44 \u2192 t56. So if the string has a sequence that comes from a path leading to NT44, it would produce t56 once.\n\nLooking at the string, the beginning is t56 t56 t56. Maybe each t56 comes from different paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can break the string into groups that fit into the grammar.\n\nWait, another idea: each production is binary, so the number of symbols in the string should be a sum of the symbols from each non-terminal's production. For example, if S \u2192 NT40 NT92, then NT40 might produce a certain number of 't's and NT92 another number.\n\nLooking at NT40 \u2192 NT16 NT80\nThen NT16 \u2192 t71\nNT80 \u2192 NT17 NT44\nNT17 \u2192 t73\nNT44 \u2192 t56\nSo NT40 \u2192 t71 t73 t56 (3 't's).\n\nNT92 \u2192 t93 t72 (since looking at NT92's production: NT92 \u2192 t93 t72, because in the grammar, NT92 \u2192 t93 t72? Wait, wait, in the given grammar, looking at NT92's productions: looking above, NT92 is listed as:\n\nLooking back, the grammar has lots of NT productions. Wait, the grammar provided is extensive, and it's probably a bit complex. Maybe it's a typo or something, but perhaps I should focus on the given productions.\n\nWait, I might need to simplify this. Let me pick one part of the string and see if it can fit into the grammar.\n\nTake the start: t56 t56 t56.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT40 NT92, then NT40 produces t71 t73 t56, and NT92 might produce something else. But t56 t56 t56 would need three t56s, but I'm not sure NT92 would produce that.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT74 NT44: NT74 is t74, NT44 is t56. So that would produce t74 t56. The string starts with t56 t56 t56, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the start S is used with a different production. Let me check the string again.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: ... t6 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t52 t56 t71 t73 t56 t52 t71 t55 t56.\n\nSo towards the end: t56 is from NT44, t71 is from NT71, etc.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's try to parse the string backwards.\n\nThe last symbol is t56. Which non-terminals can produce t56? Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 t93 t72 (I think earlier I might have missed NT92's production)\nWait looking for 't56' in the productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, the right-hand side for NT52 is NT57 NT65, but that doesn't produce t56. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT52 \u2192 NT57 NT65, and NT65\u2192NT17 NT55, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm not tracking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps someone more experienced can help, but since I'm limited to my thought process, I'll try to find at least a few steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains 't93 t72' as a pair, which might correspond to a certain production.\n\nLooking for t93 and t72: I notice the grammar has NT72 \u2192 t70.

{"custom_id":"request-911","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and either a single terminal or a non-terminal on the right, right? Let me check the grammar provided to make sure it aligns with that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production starts with S or NT, and each has exactly two parts. For example, S -> NT74 NT44. So that's correct for CNF because each production has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals. So S is replaced by two NTs, and each NT is replaced by two more NTs until we reach terminals. Got it.\n\nNow, the string provided is a series of terminals, but each of them is represented as 't' followed by a number. So the string is: `t9 t73 t73 ...` up to some point. Let me see the string length. It's quite long, so I need to parse it correctly.\n\nI think the approach here is to use the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for parsing context-free grammars, especially in CNF. CYK stands for Cocke-Younger-Kasami, and it's a dynamic programming algorithm. The steps involve creating a table where each cell represents a part of the string and checking the possible non-terminals that can match that substring.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar provided has 39 NTs and a bunch of productions. Each production is an NT producing two other NTs or terminals. For example, NT77 -> NT92 NT85; some NTs even terminate, like NT7 -> t74, and others go further.\n\nThe string starts with t9, then t73, t73, etc. So the first step is to look at the entire string and see if it can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nBut before diving into CYK, maybe it's easier to look for the starting symbol S and see if we can form the string by combining the productions. The string starts with t9, so perhaps the initial step is to find which NT produces t9 as the last step.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT11 -> t87, NT13 -> t31, NT1 -> t70, etc. Wait, do any NTs produce t9? Let me check the given grammar again. Scanning through the productions, I notice that NT9 -> t5 is one of them. But t9 isn't listed as a direct production. So maybe t9 has to come from a more complex path.\n\nWait, let's check if any NT can produce t9. Looking through the productions, I see NT91 -> NT64 NT90. NT90 is t22, NT64 is t26, so that would produce t26 t22. That's not t9. Hmm, maybe t9 is part of a larger production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has to terminate via a series of productions. Let's look for t73 because it appears multiple times. In the grammar, NT7 -> t74, so NT73 is one of the productions. Wait, NT73 isn't listed as a terminal, but looking back, I see that NT7 -> t74 is under NT7, and NT73 is in the list of NTs, but does it produce a terminal?\n\nLooking again, NT73 -> 't6'. Wait, no, looking back, I see lines like NT73 -> 't6' and others. Wait, no, NT73 is in the list, but in the grammar, it's written as NT73 -> 't6'? Let me check. scrolling down, yes, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't74' (line 23)\nNT66 -> 't26' (line 32)\nNT73 -> 't6' (line 38)\nNT12 -> 't1' (line 51)\n...\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, looking at line 38: NT73 -> 't6'?\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me parse the grammar again. The given grammar entries are:\n\nNT73 -> 't6'?\n\nWait, in the list:\n\nNT7 -> 't74' (line 29)\n\nWait, looking at the user's grammar:\n\nThe last few lines I see are:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me look through the entire list:\n\nLooking through the NT productions (assuming NT73 is an NT, and perhaps it's a terminal? Wait, no. NT73 is an non-terminal symbol. But in the grammar, some NTs have rules leading to other NTs or to terminals.\n\nI see, for example:\n\nNT7 -> 't74'\n\nBut I don't see NT73 being a terminal, unless 't6' is NT73. Let me check the end of the grammar. There's NT70 -> 't82', NT79? No, wait, in the list:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT73 -> line 38: Wait, no, line 35 says NT35 -> NT34 NT25, etc.\n\nWait, actually, let me just list some lines to find if any NTs produce 't9'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT66 -> NT55 NT13, which becomes 't65' and 't31'?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's try a different approach. Let me check each production that can lead to 't9'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some NTs have rules that end with a terminal. For example, NT9 -> 't5' is one, NT1 -> 't70', NT11 -> 't87', etc.\n\nI need to find if 't9' can be produced. Looking through the list, I don't immediately see an NT that goes directly to 't9'. Hmm. So maybe 't9' is part of a larger production that eventually terminates in a terminal.\n\nWait, but 't9' is in the string, so it must be a terminal, so the parsing would end there. So perhaps the string is being built by a series of non-terminals that end with 't9' somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. Let's try that. CYK works by initializing a table where each cell represents a substring and checks for possible non-terminals that can derive it.\n\nGiven the string: [t9, t73, t73, t73, t73, t72, t73, t56, t56, t71, t73, t56, t52, t26, t74, t73, t73, t18, t31, t80, t16, t22, t56, t56, t71, t55, t93, t56, t56, t71, t55, t56, t71, t55, t14, t72, t73, t72, t73, t73, t18, t70, t56]\n\nEach part is a single character, so the string has, let's count, 39 tokens.\n\nWe can create a table of size 39x39. The CYK algorithm works by initializing the diagonal cells (i,i) to check if the single token can be generated by any non-terminal.\n\nFor each cell (i,j), we look for any rule NT -> X Y such that there exists a k between i and j-1 (inclusive) where (i,k) has X and (k+1,j) has Y. The NT for X and Y must be compatible.\n\nBut this is time-consuming, so maybe I can find a pattern or look for the presence of 't9' in the string, which must be the terminal, so it must be the last production in a chain.\n\nLooking at 't9' as the last terminal, we need to find a production chain that ends with 't9'. Since 't9' is a terminal, it must be produced by some NT, but in the given grammar, the only NT that ends with a terminal is NT9 -> 't5'. Wait, but 't5' is another terminal. Hmm, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps 't5' is a terminal, but in the grammar, I don't see an NT that produces 't9' directly. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, no NT seems to produce 't9' directly. But maybe 't9' can be part of a longer production. Wait, perhaps 't9' is part of a larger string from the production of some NT.\n\nLooking deeper into the grammar, some NTs go deep:\n\nFor example, NT18 -> NT70 NT71 (if I remember line 77: NT18 -> NT70 NT71).

{"custom_id":"request-927","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Since the start symbol is S, and looking at the rules, every production starts with S and breaks down into two non-terminals, except for the terminal cases.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of about 60 tokens, all of which are 't' followed by a number, except for the start symbol 'S' which isn't part of this string. My job is to see if this string can be derived step by step using the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the start symbol S is defined as S -> NT11 NT24, S -> NT49 NT44, and S -> NT40 NT92. So, the initial step would be to break the string into two parts that can be derived from these NT pairs.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t56. I'll need to see if t56 corresponds to a production. Scanning through the NT rules, I see NT56 -> NT92 NT40. So, NT56 = NT92 NT40. Then, 92 and 40 correspond to NT92 and NT40. Checking NT92: NT92 -> NT52 NT71, which would be t52 and t71. Similarly, NT40 would be, say, NT92 again, but let me double-check the rules.\n\nWait, I see NT47 -> NT55 NT61, NT55 -> NT47 NT65, NT65 -> NT17 NT19. Hmm, this might get complicated. The string is quite long, so it would be time-consuming to walk through every possibility. Maybe I can find patterns or repeated elements.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice 't56' appears many times, like t56 x10, then t55, t71, t55, etc. Maybe the same NT rule is used repeatedly. For example, if NT56 -> NT92 NT40, then NT92 could be NT52 NT71, and NT40 could be NT44 NT98. But then I see NT44 is involved, and looking at the string, we have t56 and then t55, which might relate to other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the bottom-up approach could help. Looking for the terminals at the end and seeing if they can be derived from the grammar. The last part of the string ends with t56, t55, t52, t71, t55, t76... Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to look for sequences that correspond to direct productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that match the grammar rules. For example, the start symbol S can be broken down into two parts, but since the string is quite long, it's possible that it's being generated by a series of production steps, always choosing one of the initial S branches.\n\nI'll try breaking the string down. Starting from the beginning, t56 is the first token. From the rules, t56 corresponds to NT56, which can break down into NT92 NT40. Now, NT92 is t52 and t71, and NT40 is t56 or t55, etc. But this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for known production sequences.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the string can be derived by repeatedly applying the production rules. Let me see if the string can be split into pairs of NT that match the start symbol's productions.\n\nGiven the string is a sequence of 63 tokens, and each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal is a terminal (the t tokens). However, the grammar doesn't have any terminals except these 't' symbols. Wait, no, wait: looking back, the grammar actually has 't' as a terminal only in certain cases, like NT7 -> t74, and so on. So, in the grammar, some NT rules directly produce a 't' followed by a two-digit number.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see something like:\n\nNT7 -> t74\nNT66 -> t26\nNT9 -> t46\nNT88 -> t69\nNT16 -> t71\nNT28 -> t20\nNT18 -> t14\nNT69 -> t93\nNT68 -> t82\nNT38 -> t95\nNT93 -> t80\nNT18 -> t19\nnt95 -> t35\nand so on.\n\nSo, the t tokens can come directly from certain NT rules. So, for example, if an NT rule produces 't74', then that's a terminal.\n\nSo, the first step is to look at the entire string and try to find where these T tokens come from.\n\nGiven the string: t56 t56 t56 t56 t71 t55 t52 t71 t55 t56 t71 t55 t76 t56 t26 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t93 t56 t56 t71 t55 t76 t71 t55 t93 t56 t71 t55 t93 t71 t55 t93 t56 t71 t55 t52 t56 t71 t55 t52 t71 t73 t56 t93.\n\nI'll try to scan from the beginning, looking for where a 't' token corresponds to an NT rule.\n\nSo, the first token is t56, which comes from NT56 -> t52 NT40? Wait, looking back: actually, NT56 can be NT92 and NT40. NT92 can be NT52 NT71, and NT40 can be NT44 NT98, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe NT56 is NT51, but looking at the rules, NT56 can become NT92 and NT40.\n\nWait, let me make sure: according to the grammar, NT56 -> NT92 NT40. So each occurrence of NT56 in the string would be replaced by NT92 followed by NT40.\n\nSo, t56 is the result of NT56. So, the first t56 comes from NT56, which is NT92 followed by NT40.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the tokens after the first t56 might correspond to the NTs produced by NT92 and NT40.\n\nWait, no, because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is in the form of two non-terminals. So, the overall string is a series of symbols where each symbol is either a terminal or a non-terminal, and each non-terminal further breaks down.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to attempt to parse the string up to the initial symbols and see how it can break down. Let's try.\n\nThe string starts with 't56'. So that's the first symbol. The next symbol after t56 is t56 again. So maybe the string comes from a production where 't56' is the first part from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is generated by a series of expansions starting from S.\n\nAnother approach: the entire string should be composed of sequences that are generated by the NT productions. Let's look at the end of the string: the last few tokens are t56 t55 t52 t71 t73 t56 t93.\n\nLooking at t73: from the grammar, NT73 -> t74. So t73 is t74. Maybe the string ends with something involving t74.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a long sequence generated from repeated NT56 expansions.\n\nWait, let's try to see what NT56 expands to. From the rule: NT56 -> NT92 NT40. So NT92 is another NT: NT92 -> NT52 NT71. Then NT52 is t52, and NT71 is t71.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that NT40 can be NT40 -> NT16 NT80, which is t16 and t80.

{"custom_id":"request-934","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to figure out if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. Context-free grammars are defined by their productions, which are rules that replace a non-terminal symbol with a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. The given grammar has a few initial rules, like S -> NT74 NT44 and others. It seems that S is the start symbol, and from there, it branches into combinations of NTs (non-terminals) that eventually produce terminal symbols. The non-terminals are represented by various combinations like NT49, NT39, etc., and sometimes they expand into other non-terminals or terminal 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t7 t20 t74 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t56 t20 t74 t73 t73 t18 t31 t16 t98 t92 t20 t31 t82 t5 t72 t73 t72 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t80 t82 t93 t56 t71 t73 t56 t76 t71 t55 t31 t11 t6 t26 t56`.\n\nI notice that the grammar has several production rules where non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, and some expand into terminal symbols, which are represented as 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT7 -> 't74' is a production rule that replaces NT7 with 't74'.\n\nSince the string contains a lot of 't' symbols with numbers, I'll need to trace how each 't' could have been generated from the production rules. Each 't' must come directly from a production rule of the form NTn -> 'tX', where X is a number.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many of the NTs expand into terminals. For example, NT7 -> 't74', NT12 -> 't85', NT17 -> 't73', and so on. Each of these NTs directly produce a 't' token with a specific number.\n\nSo, my approach is to parse the string from left to right, matching each 't' with a corresponding NT production rule. Each time I find a 'tX' in the string, I check if there's a production rule for NTX that produces exactly 'tX'.\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. The string begins with t7. So, we look for NT7 -> 't74'? Wait, no. Actually, according to the grammar, NT7's production is NT7 -> 't74', right? Let me check the grammar. Yes, there's a rule NT7 -> 't74'. So, 't7' must come from NT7. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT7 -> 't74', which means when NT7 is used, it directly produces 't74'. So, 't7' can't be produced directly from NT7, unless NT7 has that rule. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT7 -> 't74' is present. So, if the current symbol is 't74', it must come from NT7. But in our case, the first symbol is 't7', so I need a rule that translates NT7 to 't7', but I don't see that. Hmm, this might be a problem.\n\nWait, no, maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT7 is defined as:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't74'\n\nSo, to get 't7', we need an NT7 that somehow expands into 't7'. But according to this rule, NT7 produces 't74'. There's no rule for NT7 to produce 't7'. Therefore, 't7' cannot be generated by this grammar because the only production for NT7 is 't74'. \n\nBut wait, this seems conflicting because the string starts with 't7', but according to the grammar, NT7 can't produce that. So, unless there's another rule I haven't considered, maybe the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check if there's a rule for NT7 producing 't7' elsewhere. Looking through all the NT definitions, I don't see any NT7 producing 't7'. So, 't7' will never appear in any string produced by this grammar. Therefore, the very first token in the string is 't7', which can't be generated by any production rule in the grammar.\n\nSo, that would immediately tell me that the string is not generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains 't7', but 't7' cannot be produced by any rule in the grammar since NT7 produces 't74'. \n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar starts with S, which can be broken down into combinations of NTs ending in terminal symbols like 't38' or others, or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has three productions:\n1. S -> NT74 NT44\n2. S -> NT11 NT24\n3. S -> NT40 NT92\n\nSo the first step is to see if the string can start with any of these NT combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t20 t74 t73 ...`. I need to see if any of the S productions can lead to this.\n\nWait, S produces NT followed by NT, so the first symbol of the string should come from a terminal that's part of NT74 or NT11 or NT40.\n\nLooking at the NT productions, I see NT74 goes to NT39 NT99, which eventually, when fully resolved, would lead to 't74' via NT99 -> NT34, then NT34->NT56, and so on until it's 't74'. Similarly, NT40 goes to NT16 NT80, but looking further, NT65 can go to NT17 NT55, etc., but I see in the terminal mappings that NT40 ends up as 't56'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NTs are terminal symbols. For example, NT12 is 't85', NT17 is 't73', NT16 is 't71', NT69 is 't93', and so on.\n\nI think I need to build the parse tree step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the possible sequences that can be built from these rules.\n\nAnother approach is to check each part of the string to see if it can be generated by any NT rules.

Wait, the first production for S is S -> NT74 NT44. So if I take NT74, it needs to be followed by NT44's production.\n\nLooking at NT74's production: NT74 -> NT39 NT99. Then NT39 is NT11 -> 't7'? Wait, looking at NT39's productions, I see NT39 can go to NT8 NT25 or NT90 NT1. Wait, no, the grammar for NT39 seems to be NT39 -> NT8 NT25 or NT90 NT1. But I see more specific rules. Let me check all NT39 productions.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar for NT39 isn't clear. Let me see:\n\nWait, the grammar for NT39 isn't provided, but looking at the later productions: wait, the input seems to have the grammar in a list.

So NT92 is a terminal that's equal to 't52'.\n\nWait, but looking for NT92 in the string: in the string, there's a `t92` at position where the string has `t20 t74 t73 ...`, so perhaps I need to see if any NT92 is in the string.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT92 is a terminal 't52' (from NT92 -> NT52 and I think NT52 is a terminal 't52'), so in the string, some part is 't92', but in the grammar NT92 is 't52'.

{"custom_id":"request-949","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given with production rules starting from S. The productions are all in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except at the top level where S can produce terminals directly. Wait, no, actually in CNF the start symbol can produce a single terminal or two non-terminals. So S can produce two non-terminals, which in turn can be terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that the right-hand sides are mostly non-terminals paired together, except when the production is like S \u2192 NT... which I think is how the non-terminals are structured. For example, S \u2192 NT74 NT44, which is two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals (NT44, etc.) seem to be further broken down into pairs, except some are directly mapped to terminals when they produce 't' followed by a number or a symbol.\n\nSo the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: t7, t26, t74, t73 repeated multiple times, and so on. Each 't' is followed by a number or another symbol like 't74', which seems to be terminals.\n\nIn CNF, the string is generated by expanding non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain. The key here is to see if the given string can be derived by applying the productions.\n\nFrom the grammar provided, some of the non-terminals directly map to single terminals. For example, NT74 \u2192 t74, NT26 \u2192 t26, NT73 \u2192 t73, NT20 \u2192 t17, etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n- NT70 \u2192 't74' (so NT70 is mapped to t74)\n- NT26 \u2192 t26\n- NT73 \u2192 't73'\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- NT91 \u2192 't93', etc.\n\nWait, actually, some might produce multiple terminals. But in CNF, each production is exactly two non-terminals except for the start symbol, which can produce a single terminal. Hmm, no, maybe not\u2014it's possible that the entire start symbol can produce a terminal, but in this case, the start symbol S is producing non-terminals. Wait, no. Let me get this right.\n\nIn standard CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals. However, sometimes the start symbol can have a direct production to a terminal. So perhaps, in this grammar, the start symbol S can produce a string directly, but looking at the rules, S is producing other non-terminals, so maybe the grammar isn't using the full CNF definition where S could produce a terminal. Hmm, but looking at the initial rules, S is producing NT... which are non-terminals. So maybe it's structured such that S must produce a sequence of non-terminals that eventually break down into terminals.\n\nWait, but in this case, some of the non-terminals are directly producing terminals. For example, NT70 \u2192 t74. So NT74 is a non-terminal that produces the terminal t74. Similarly, NT26 \u2192 t26, NT73 \u2192 t73, etc.\n\nSo the approach is to see how the given string can be split into parts that match the productions in the grammar. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, and each production can only expand two non-terminals at a time, we can model this as the string being built from the bottom up, but it's easier to start from the top down, though that might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the string as a sequence of symbols that can be grouped into pairs of non-terminals according to the grammar. Each such pair must correspond to some production.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is two symbols, so the string length must be a power of two? Or wait, actually, for a string of length N, the number of productions needed would be logarithmic, but in this case, the string is long, so maybe the length is manageable.\n\nWait, let's check the length of the string. The string given is:\n\nt7 t26 t74 t73 t73 t73 t73 t73 t18 t31 t73 t73 t73 t18 t73 t18 t26 t31 t82 t46 t72 t92 t59 t6 t22 t70 t20 t29 t72 t6 t56 t20 t74 t73 t73 t73 t18 t98 t26 t31 t85 t98 t92 t73 t18 t14 t92 t19 t92 t56\n\nCounting the number of symbols: Let's see, it's a long string. Let's see, each space is a separator, so the actual count is each token. Let me count:\n\n1. t7\n2. t26\n3. t74\n4. t73\n5. t73\n6. t73\n7. t73\n8. t73\n9. t18\n10. t31\n11. t73\n12. t73\n13. t73\n14. t18\n15. t73\n16. t18\n17. t26\n18. t31\n19. t82\n20. t46\n21. t72\n22. t92\n23. t59\n24. t6\n25. t22\n26. t70\n27. t20\n28. t29\n29. t72\n30. t6\n31. t56\n32. t20\n33. t74\n34. t73\n35. t73\n36. t73\n37. t18\n38. t98\n39. t26\n40. t31\n41. t85\n42. t98\n43. t92\n44. t73\n45. t18\n46. t14\n47. t92\n48. t19\n49. t92\n50. t56\n\nSo there are 50 symbols in the string. Since each production step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, starting from one (S) and ending when all are terminals, the number of symbols must be a power of two. Let me check: 2^n = 50? Well, 2^5=32, 2^6=64. So 50 is not a power of two, which means it's impossible for such a grammar to generate this string because each production step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols doubles minus one each time. Wait, no, actually, that's not how it works. Let's think: each step allows each non-terminal to produce two, so starting with 1 (S), after one step, it could produce two non-terminals, so total 2. Then each of those can produce two, so 4, then 8, then 16, then 32, and so on. So the number of symbols must be of the form 2^k, where k is the number of derivation steps.\n\nBut in this problem, the string has 50 symbols, which is not a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar, which is in CNF.\n\nWait, but actually, the start symbol can produce two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can produce two, so the number of symbols generated is 2^k after k steps. So the number of symbols must be a power of two. 50 is not a power of two, so regardless of the specific productions, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 50 symbols, which is not a power of two. Context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form generate strings with lengths that are powers of two because each step doubles the number of symbols.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
