{"custom_id":"request-0","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t36` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT52 \u2192 't44', etc. So the leaves of the parse tree will be these terminals.\n\nThe specific string we're checking is `t36`. Let's find if any production rule directly results in 't36'. Looking through the rules, I see NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48. But that's two non-terminals, so I need to see if either of those is a terminal, or if they can produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking at NT42 and NT48, do they produce terminals? NT42 is not listed as a terminal, and checking the rules, NT42 doesn't have a production. It must be a non-terminal. Similarly, NT48 is a non-terminal with a production NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21. So NT48 isn't a terminal. This means that NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48 doesn't produce a single terminal; it produces two non-terminals which will need to be expanded further.\n\nLet me check NT42 and NT48. For NT42, I don't see any production for NT42 in the rules provided. Actually, looking through the list, I don't see NT42 appearing on the left side of any production. That means NT42 must be a non-terminal that can only produce other non-terminals. Similarly, looking at NT48, it does have a production: NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21. So NT48 is a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals, which in turn may produce more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven that, let's see if 't36' appears anywhere as a terminal. Looking through the terminals listed under the production rules, I see that NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48, but I don't see 't36' being a terminal in the provided terminal strings. Instead, the terminals are things like 't44', 't2', 't48', 't5', 't6', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the terminals, I see NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48, and NT42 and NT48 are non-terminals. Then NT36 doesn't produce any terminals directly. So if the string is `t36`, that would have to come from a production that directly outputs 't36', which isn't present here. All the productions for non-terminals either produce other non-terminals or terminal strings, but none of them produce 't36' directly or through a series of expansions that result in 't36' at the root.\n\nAlso, looking at the string `t36`, it's a single terminal, so it must come from a production rule that directly produces that terminal. Since none of the production rules for non-terminals produce 't36', the string `t36` cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAnother way to check is to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't36', like NT36. But NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48, which doesn't include 't36'. So no, `t36` isn't in the set of terminals produced by any non-terminal in this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I see that most of the non-terminals are expanded into other non-terminals, and some are terminal symbols represented by 't' followed by numbers. The start symbol is S, which immediately expands into NT15 and NT43. So the first step is S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nNow, let's look at NT15 and NT43. From the productions, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's a bit confusing. NT15 is defined as NT37 followed by NT15 again. How does that work? Well, maybe it's a recursive production. Similarly, NT43 expands into NT27 and NT0.\n\nWait, but NT0 is another non-terminal that eventually leads to 't28' or other terminals. Let me check the productions for NT0. Looking back, I see NT0 \u2192 NT52 NT8, and NT52 \u2192 't6' and NT8 \u2192 't40' but wait, no, looking again, NT40 is 't65' and NT8 is actually 't46' and NT17. Hmm, perhaps I need to correct that.\n\nWait, I might be getting confused. Let's list out all the non-terminals and see their expansions properly. Starting from S, which is NT15 and NT43. Let's explore each.\n\nFirst, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So to resolve this, we have to expand NT37. Looking at NT37, it can be NT19 NT19 or NT17 NT45. Let's pick one path.\n\nOption 1: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. Then each NT19 can expand. Looking at NT19, it has two productions: one is NT12 NT38, and another was previously noticed as NT51 NT19. Let's pick NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 for a chain. But NT51 expands into NT50 NT20. Wait, NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, and NT43 is our initial part. Hmm, maybe this path leads to something longer.\n\nOption 2: NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45. NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30, and NT45 \u2192 NT25 NT16. Wait, let me check the productions again properly. NT17 is NT2 NT30. So combining that with NT45.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's think differently. The string we need is 't54'. Looking at the grammar, are there any rules that produce 't54'? Checking the terminals, I don't see a 't54' directly. Let me see where 't54' could come from.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1? Wait, no, NT43 is defined as NT27 NT0. Let's get more precise.\n\nWait, NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0. NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17. NT8 \u2192 NT46 NT17. So NT27 expands into NT8 NT17, which further expands into NT46 NT17 and NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting lost. Let me approach this recursively, using the given string.\n\nThe string is 't54'. From the terminals, I need to see if any of the productions end with 't54' or have 't54' in them. Let's list the terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal symbols are: t5, t2, t39, t48, t6, t25, t18, t55, t13, t38, t51, t7, t30, t8, t9, t16, t49, t47, t39, t65, t72, t83, t18, t55, t2, t48, t29, t63, t88, t28, t40, t87, t24, t87, t84, t26, t12, t99, t11, t13, t69, t13, t40, t89, t4, t36, t37, t51, t38, t16, t33, t54, t51, t38, t67, t44, t39, t28, t36, t12, t37, t91, t7, t54, t31, t9, t16, etc.\n\nWait, I notice that 't54' is present as a terminal in the production NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 and somewhere else as NT19 \u2192 something else. Wait, looking back, in the productions, I see:\n\nNT19 -> NT51 NT19\nNT19 -> NT51 NT19\nWait, no, looking again, under NT19, the productions are:\n\nNT19 -> NT51 NT19\n\nand NT19 -> NT12 NT38, and NT19 -> NT21 NT31, and another one: NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. Wait, that seems redundant.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, under NT19, the productions are:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\n- NT19 \u2192 NT21 NT31\n- NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19\n- NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19\n\nWait, I think that last line might be a typo. But in any case, it's likely that NT19 can produce something that leads to 't54'.\n\nLooking back, in the provided productions, I see:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19\n\nAnd NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT46 NT17\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT32 NT8\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT25 NT16\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Let me see if I can find a path that ends with 't54'.\n\nLooking through all terminals, I see NT24\u2192't55' and NT23\u2192't5'. Wait, no, but looking again, under NT16: NT16 \u2192 t3. Under NT19 \u2192 't54'?\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Looking back, under NT19: No, I don't see 't54' explicitly produced by any production. However, somewhere in the production chains, perhaps 't54' is produced. Let me check the production rules.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT19 is part of the production NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, but how does that lead to 't54'? Perhaps I'm missing where 't54' comes from.\n\nWait, is there a production that ends with 't54'? Looking through all terminal symbols, I don't see 't54' as a terminal. That's strange because usually, in the grammar, the terminals are derived until they become leaves. Wait, maybe 't54' is derived as a combination of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't54' is a node that can be part of the derivation, like in the middle of a string, but since the input is a single 't54', I think it must directly correspond to a terminal production.\n\nBut looking through all the terminals, I don't see 't54'. So maybe 't54' is not present in any of the productions as a terminal. That would mean that the string 't54' is not in the language because the grammar doesn't have a production that produces 't54' as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't54' is a concatenation of two terminals, but that would require 't5' followed by 't4', which I also don't see in the production.\n\nWait, but checking again, under NT19: The productions are:\n\nNT19 -> NT51 NT19\n\nand\n\nNT19 -> NT51 NT19\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading.

I'm a bit new to context-free grammars, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal on the left side produces two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. This might help because some parsing techniques work well with CFD, but perhaps I can just see how the string can be broken down.\n\nThe string given is `t24 t91`. Since the grammar uses various terminals (like 't2', 't3', etc.), each of these must be directly generated by some production. Let's see if each token in the string is present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals expand into terminals:\n- `NT1` can produce 't2' or 't31'.\n- `NT31` expands into 't91'.\n- `NT24` can produce 't5' or 't48'. Wait, in the list, I see NT24 has two productions: NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35 and NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT48. Hmm, perhaps I got confused earlier.

Let me pick out the terminal ones:\n- Looking through the rules, I notice NT24 has a production: NT24 -> NT2 NT48. Wait, no. Let me go step by step.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, under NT24, I see two rules:\n- NT24 -> NT48 NT35\n- NT24 -> NT2 NT48\n\nHmm, but those are two different productions where NT24 expands into other non-terminals. So, do these non-terminals eventually produce terminals? Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the terminals in the string and see if there are rules that produce them.\n\nThe string is `t24 t91`. So, let's check if each of these terminals can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n- 't2' is a terminal in NT1 \u2192 't2' or 't31'.\n- 't91' seems to be a terminal in NT51 \u2192 't90' or others. Wait, looking through, I see NT51 has a production to 't90' and perhaps others. Wait, looking through the grammar list:\n\nI see NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20. Also, looking for 't91', but I don't immediately see a production for that. Wait, let me search through all the grammar productions to see if any rule produces 't91'.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't2' or 't31'.\n- NT31 \u2192 't91'. There it is. So, NT31 produces 't91'.\n\nNow, looking at `t24 t91`, the second part is 't91', which can be generated by NT31. So, I need to see how 't24' is generated.\n\nLooking for 't24' as a terminal. Let's search through the grammar productions for any rule that produces 't24'. Hmm, I don't see it directly. So maybe 't24' comes from another production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, maybe some NT produces 't24' directly. Let me check each rule:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't15'? No, looking further, I see NT15 \u2192 't37' or 't15'?\n\nWait, no. Let's go through all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't48'\n- NT29 -> 't63'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT9 -> 't28'\n- NT50 -> 't33'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT51 -> 't90'\n- NT48 -> 't87'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT34 -> 't87'\n- NT36 -> 't84'\n- NT21 -> 't99'\n- NT45 -> 't11'\n- NT19 -> 't13'\n- NT37 -> 't12'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT51 -> 't38'\n- NT6 -> 't16'\n- NT17 -> 't33'\n- NT19 -> 't54'\n- NT31 -> 't91'\n- NT23 -> 't7'\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n\nWait, wait, I see NT1 \u2192 't24' and also NT51 \u2192 't38'.

Also, looking at NT15: Wait, earlier in the grammar, NT15 might produce 't37' (I think I saw NT15 -> 't37 NT15'), so it's recursive.\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT5\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47\n- NT13 \u2192 NT21 NT48\n- NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21\n- NT44 \u2192 't6' NT ...\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me focus on the terminal 't24'. From the list above, I see that NT1 \u2192 't24'.\n\nSo, `t24` can be generated by NT1.\n\nNow, looking at the structure of the string: 't24 t91'.\n\nSince 't24' is produced by NT1, and 't91' by NT31, perhaps the entire string can be represented as NT1 \u2192 't24' and NT31 \u2192 't91', but how are these connected in the grammar?\n\nWait, but the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT1. From the start symbol S, it produces two non-terminals: NT15 and NT1.\n\nSo, in order for the string 't24 t91' to be generated, the entire string must be the concatenation of 't24' and 't91', which would mean that S must derive a sequence where NT15 produces 't24' and NT1 produces 't91'.\n\nBut let's see: S \u2192 NT15 NT1. NT15 can produce 't24' through its production? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, does NT15 produce 't24'? Looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT15's rule is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That seems recursive. I don't see NT15 producing any terminals directly except via other rules. So perhaps 't24' does not come from NT15.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the 't24' comes from another production.\n\nWait, earlier I thought NT1 \u2192 't24', but wait, looking again:\n\nWait, looking at NT1's productions: NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT5 or NT1 \u2192 't24'.\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT1 can produce 't24'. Similarly, the grammar's S is NT15 NT1. So if S \u2192 NT15 NT1, then NT15 and NT1 must each derive a string. If NT15 can derive 't24' and NT1 can derive 't91', then the entire string would be 't24 t91'.\n\nBut does NT15 produce 't24'? Let's see. Looking at NT15's rules: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. It seems to be recursive, but perhaps it can be reduced. Let's see if NT37 can produce any terminal.\n\nIn the grammar, NT37 has several rules:\n- NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n- NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45\n\nWait, the first production is NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45.\n\nNT17 is another non-terminal, which I see has a rule: NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30. So NT17 is non-terminal.\n\nNT45 has rules: NT45 \u2192 NT25 NT16, and NT16 is a terminal 't3'.\n\nWait, no: Looking at NT16 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo perhaps NT37 can produce 't3'?\n\nWait, let me trace:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30.\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-10","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out if the string \"t3 t84\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go directly to a terminal. The given grammar seems to consist of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT15, NT43, etc.) is defined in terms of two other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string \"t3 t84\", I notice it's composed of two parts: \"t3\" and \"t84\". Each of these is a terminal symbol. In the grammar, terminals are represented by 't' followed by a number. For example, NT43 -> NT27 NT0, but some of these arrows directly produce terminal symbols. For instance, NT44 -> 't6', NT42 -> 't5', etc.\n\nSo, I'll start by seeing which non-terminals can produce \"t3\" and \"t84\".\n\nFirst part: \"t3\". I'll look through the grammar rules for any that directly produce 't3'. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT17 -> 't30' nope.\n- NT33 -> 't2' nope.\n- NT16 -> 't3' Yes! There's NT16 -> 't3'.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is generated by NT16.\n\nSecond part: \"t84\". Let me check if any rule directly produces 't84':\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT36 has a rule NT36 -> NT65 NT36, which doesn't produce a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT36: actually, NT36 -> NT5 NT30. Neither of these are terminals. What about others?\n\nChecking NT36: NT36 -> NT5 NT30. No, so maybe it's going through productions that eventually lead to a terminal. So I need to find a way to derive 't84' from NT36. Let me trace the production chain.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the grammar, I also see NT48 -> NT44 NT27. Neither are terminals. Let me check each non-terminal that can reach a terminal:\n\n- NT44 -> 't6' yes.\n- NT42 -> 't5' yes.\n- NT13 -> 't39' yes.\n- NT28 -> 't67' yes.\n- NT0 -> 't39' yes.\n- NT40 -> 't65' yes.\n- NT46 -> 't72' yes.\n- NT32 -> 't83' yes.\n- NT24 -> 't18' yes.\n- NT24 -> 't55' (wait, this is under NT24? I think there might be a typo, but in any case, let's check NT24 for 't55' which would be a terminal, but I don't think so; 't55' isn't a terminal symbol in our problem. Wait, actually, no, in the list of production rules, each production has either non-terminals or 't' followed by numbers. So, 't' followed by a number is a terminal.\n\nWait, I have to make sure I'm looking correctly. So, in the grammar, the production NT24 has two rules: NT24 -> 't5' and NT24 -> 't55'. So that's two possible terminals, so NT24 can produce either 't5' or 't55'. But 't55' isn't in our string, perhaps.\n\nWait, but in our string, the second part is \"t84\", which isn't a direct terminal. So I need to see if any non-terminal can produce 't84', or if a non-terminal chain leads to 't84'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, is there any non-terminal whose production directly includes 't84'? Let me check each rule. Hmm, looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT producing 't84' directly or indirectly through production chains.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through all the production rules to confirm.\n\nLooking at NT52: NT52 -> NT6 NT25. No 't's here.\n\nNT37: NT37 -> NT17 NT45. So, that's two non-terminals again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let's check NT36. NT36 -> NT5 NT30. Neither NT5 nor NT30 are terminals. So NT36 can't produce 't84' directly. So how about NT36's derivation:\n\nNT36 can only go through NT5 and NT30. Let's see if either of these can reach 't84'. Looking at NT5: NT5 -> 't2' which is a terminal. NT30 has a rule NT30 -> NT32 NT8. Neither NT32 nor NT8 are terminals; they can produce more non-terminals.\n\nWait, NT32's rules: NT32 -> NT25 NT46. NT25 -> NT13 NT47. NT46 -> NT10 NT38. Both NT10 and NT38 can be used.\n\nNT10 -> 't50' and 't36' No, looking at NT10: NT10 -> 't50' (from NT10 -> NT50 NT30). Hmm, NT50's rules: NT50 -> NT41 NT43. Then NT41 is NT41 -> NT7 NT31. NT7 is 't35'. NT43 -> NT27 NT0. NT27 -> NT8 NT17. NT17 -> 't2', etc.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. Since the string is 't3 t84', I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string.\n\nBut S -> NT15 NT10. Let me check NT15 and NT10.\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that's confusing because NT15 can produce NT37 followed by NT15 again. Maybe it's a recursive rule.\n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe I should use the CYK algorithm to determine if the string is in the grammar. Let's try that.\n\nThe CYK algorithm parses the string by tables. Let's see.\n\nOur string is of length 2, so it's [t3, t84].\n\nFirst, we'll initialize a table where each cell corresponds to a substring. The indices range from 0 to 1.\n\nFirst, cell (0,0): checking if 't3' is in any NT. Earlier, I found that NT16 -> 't3'. So cell (0,0) is 't3' \u2192 yes.\n\nCell (1,1): Checking if 't84' is derived from any NT. Let's see. Does any NT have a production that directly or indirectly includes 't84'? Looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT with a terminal 't84'.\n\nWait, but maybe through multiple productions. Let's check if 't84' can be derived from any NT.\n\nLooking at production rules that include 't84', but I don't see any. So perhaps 't84' can't be directly generated. Therefore, 't84' is not a terminal in the grammar, meaning our string \"t3 t84\" can't be produced, so the answer is No.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I missed something. Let me check if any NT can derive 't84' through a series of productions.\n\nLooking for NT84, but that doesn't exist. So 't84' can't be produced. Therefore, the string contains a terminal 't84' that isn't in the grammar. Hence, the string \"t3 t84\" isn't generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-27","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a problem where I need to determine whether a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string to evaluate is `t65 t48 t88`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the grammar looks like. The grammar consists of a series of production rules for non-terminals (like S, NT15, NT50, etc.) that eventually produce terminal symbols (like 't44', 't6', etc.) or other non-terminals. My task is to see if the string `t65 t48 t88` can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI notice that the string consists of three terminals: 't65', 't48', and 't88'. So, I need to see if each of these terminals can be produced by the grammar's right-hand sides. \n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that several non-terminals produce terminal symbols. For instance, NT44 produces 't6', NT42 produces 't5', and so on. So, the strategy is to check each terminal in the string to see if it can be generated by some rule.\n\nLet's break down each terminal in the string:\n\n1. 't65' appears only once in the production rules. It's the result of NT46 \u2192 't6' and 't33' (wait, no, looking again, I see NT46 produces 't6' and 't33' is part of NT17's production. Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking closely, I see NT46 \u2192 NT10 NT38. But NT10 is NT46 \u2192 NT10 NT38, which seems recursive. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, the rule for NT46 is: NT46 \u2192 NT10 NT38. Hmm, so it's producing two non-terminals. Then looking further, NT10 is defined as NT50 NT30, and NT38 is NT51 NT29. Each of those further breaks down into more non-terminals until eventually, they produce terminals. \n\nWait, but in the given string, there's 't65' which isn't directly listed as a terminal in any production. Let me check again. The production rules don't seem to have NT46 producing 't65' as a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the production rules provided include NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', and so on. Let me check all the terminal productions:\n\nWait, I see NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT5 \u2192 't2', NT4 \u2192 't48', NT29 \u2192 't63', NT4 \u2192 't88', NT9 \u2192 't28', NT50 \u2192 't33', NT12 \u2192 't16', NT51 \u2192 't90', NT48 \u2192 't87', NT1 \u2192 't24', NT34 \u2192 't87', NT36 \u2192 't84', NT21 \u2192 't99', NT45 \u2192 't11', NT19 \u2192 't13', NT37 \u2192 't12', NT51 \u2192 't31', NT45 \u2192 't67', NT36 \u2192 't41', NT26 \u2192 't12', NT5 \u2192 't7', NT13 \u2192 't69', NT21 \u2192 't13', NT40 \u2192 't89', NT28 \u2192 't4', NT29 \u2192 't36', NT1 \u2192 't37', NT51 \u2192 't38', NT6 \u2192 't16', NT17 \u2192 't33', NT19 \u2192 't54', NT31 \u2192 't91', NT23 \u2192 't7', NT16 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo, looking at this, 't65' is not a terminal in any production. That's a problem because if 't65' is in the string, and there's no rule that produces it, then the string can't be generated. But wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the rules. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the production rules, NT46 \u2192 NT10 NT38, and NT10 is defined as NT50 NT30, while NT38 is NT51 NT29. NT50 produces 't33', and NT30 seems to produce other things, but none of them lead to 't65' directly. Similarly, NT51 produces 't90', which is not 't65'. \n\nWait, but looking further, perhaps 't65' can be derived through a chain of productions. For example, if a non-terminal leads to NT1, which leads to 't24', but I don't see 't65' being produced from any combination. Wait, maybe I should track the terminals again.\n\nWait, the string is `t65 t48 t88`. So, for each of these, I need to see if they can appear as the result of some derivation.\n\nStarting with 't65': Looking through the rules, I don't see any production that ends with 't65'. So, it's impossible for 't65' to be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the entire string can't be generated because it contains 't65', which isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Maybe I overlooked where 't65' could come from. Let me go through each rule one more time.\n\nScanning all the rules, I don't see 't65' as a terminal. The closest is 't6' from NT44, 't5' from NT42, etc. So, without a rule that produces 't65', the string isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains 't65', which isn't a terminal in any production.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-31","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string \"t67 t44 t87 t91\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by attempting to understand the grammar and then see how the string might be derived step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar in Chomsky normal form, it consists of a series of production rules that start from S. Each rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Since it's in CNF, this should make parsing easier, but I need to parse the string to see if it can trace back to S.\n\nThe string is \"t67 t44 t87 t91\". I notice that some of these are terminals with numbers, and others might be non-terminals. From the grammar, the terminals include t44, t87, t91, t67, t48, t6, t5, etc. Wait, but the string doesn't have t48, t15, or other such terminals, so maybe some of the other t's are coming from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me make a list of all the terminals present in the string: t67, t44, t87, t91. I need to check if these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S: S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo S starts with NT15 and NT43. Both are non-terminals, so each will generate some string.\n\nLet's start by expanding NT15. From the grammar, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Hmm, that looks recursive. So when expanding NT15, it will be replaced by NT37 and NT15 again. But wait, that means NT15 is producing more NT37s. Let's see:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nBut if I substitute NT15 again, it would be NT37 NT37 NT15, and so on. Eventually, this recursion would have to terminate. Looking at the rules for NT37, I see NT37 can produce either NT19 NT19 or NT17 NT45. \n\nWait, if I substitute NT37, which doesn't immediately produce any terminal, the recursion continues until it reaches a point where it can substitute for terminals or reach a non-terminal that can't be expanded further. So let's explore that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to see if the string can be built step by step by expanding each part. Since the string is a sequence of t's, perhaps each t corresponds to an applicaiton of a production rule.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals that can produce terminals in the string:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that have productions ending in a terminal, I see:\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n- NT42 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't39'\n- NT28 -> 't67', 't4' (from looking at the grammar rules)\nWait, in the grammar, NT28 has a rule NT28 -> NT26 NT23. And NT26 -> NT24 NT34, NT24 can go to 't5' etc.\n\nWait, let me go step by step.\n\nThe string is \"t67 t44 t87 t91\".\n\nLet me write these as tokens: ['t67', 't44', 't87', 't91'].\n\nNow, starting from S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo the entire string will be generated by NT15 followed by NT43.\n\nSo for S to produce the string, NT15 must generate the first part and NT43 the second.\n\nLooking at NT43: From the grammar, NT43 can produce either NT27 NT0 or 't1'. But wait, 't1' isn't in the string. So NT43 must expand to NT27 and NT0.\n\nSo NT43 -> NT27 NT0.\n\nNow, looking at NT27: NT27 can produce NT8 NT17 or 't5'. In our string, the second token is 't44', which is 't4' from NT4's production. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently, using a top-down parsing strategy, trying to reduce the string to the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is \"t67 t44 t87 t91\".\n\nLet me process this string as a series of tokens: t67, t44, t87, t91.\n\nI need to find a way to generate this string using the given rules.\n\nStarting from S, it must produce NT15 NT43. So the string is the combination of NT15's expansion and NT43's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string structure, perhaps the first part is t67, which is a terminal, and the second is t44, another terminal. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, the entire string could be built by the combination of the expansions of NT15 and NT43.\n\nWait, this seems a bit tangled. Let me try another approach: for each token, see which non-terminal it can come from.\n\nt67: Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t67?\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT28 has two rules: NT28 -> NT26 NT23 and NT28 -> 't67'. So t67 can be produced by NT28. Similarly, t44: looking at the grammar, NT44 -> 't6', so that's not helpful. Wait, t44 is in the string, but looking for which non-terminal produces t44.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n- NT6 -> 't16'\n- NT36 -> 't84'\n- So t44 is in 't44', not sure if it's a terminal or not. Wait, 't44' is the token, but looking at the grammar, perhaps I didn't have a production for a non-terminal that leads to 't44'. Wait, NT44 is a non-terminal that produces 't6', which is 't6', not 't44'.\n\nWait, perhaps the string contains 't44' as a terminal, but in the grammar, NT44 produces t6, not t44. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking carefully, the grammar has several production rules for non-terminals leading to terminals. For instance:\n\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n- NT42 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't39'\n- NT28 -> 't67' and also NT28 -> 't4' (I think I need to double-check this).\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar as provided by the user, in the section for NT28, it says:\n\nNT28 -> NT26 NT23\n\nand also:\n\nNT28 -> 't67'\n\nNo, wait, looking again, I see:\n\nNT28 rules: \n\n- NT28 -> NT26 NT23\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n\nYes, so NT28 can produce the terminal 't67', which matches our first token in the string: 't67'.\n\nSo the first token is \"t67\", which can be generated by NT28. So the first part of the string is \"t67\", which comes from NT28.\n\nNow, the next token is \"t44\". Let's see which non-terminal can generate \"t44\". Looking for a non-terminal that produces a rule where a terminal in the string is produced.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT44 -> 't6', which is a different terminal. So perhaps 't44' is part of a longer production. Wait, no, perhaps the non-terminal NT44 is something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the tokens. The string is \"t67 t44 t87 t91\". Are these four separate tokens? Let's check the grammar to see if any non-terminals produce these t's.\n\nWait, for example, NT19 -> 't54' from the grammar, but t54 isn't in our string. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's check each token:\n\n- t67: comes from NT28.\n- t44: I need to see if any non-terminal can produce \"t44\". Looking at the grammar rules, I don't see any non-terminals that produce \"t44\" directly. But wait, maybe it's part of a longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps the string \"t44\" is in the middle of a longer expansion. Maybe it's part of a NT that produces \"t44\".\n\nWait, let me look through the grammar rules again to see if any non-terminals generate \"t44\".\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't44'.

{"custom_id":"request-32","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine if the string \"t36 t88 t36 t4\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have the empty string (but in this case, it's more complex since there are terminals involved).\n\nFirst, I'll break down the grammar provided. It lists a bunch of production rules for non-terminals (like S, NT15, NT50, etc.) that eventually lead down to terminals like 't36', 't88', etc. My task is to see if the string in question can be derived from the start symbol, S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t36 t88 t36 t4\". Looking at the grammar, I notice that some terminals are connected directly to non-terminals with specific productions. For example, NT5 -> 't2', NT4 -> 't48', and so on.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and seeing if I can trace back through the grammar from the start symbol. The start symbol is S, according to the first production rule S -> NT15 NT43. So S produces two non-terminals, NT15 and NT43. To produce the given string, each of these non-terminals must generate a part of the string.\n\nLet's consider how each non-terminal (NT15 and NT43) can produce the relevant terminal strings. The string is four parts, so each non-terminal might produce two parts, or perhaps split the string into parts. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t36 t88 t36 t4\". That's four tokens, which could be split into two parts each for NT15 and NT43, or maybe other ways.\n\nWait, actually, S's production is S -> NT15 NT43, so when we apply this production, the string generated will be concatenation of the strings generated by NT15 and NT43. So the entire string is the concatenation of NT15's production and NT43's production.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps each non-terminal produces two tokens. Let's see.\n\nSo, let's hypothesize that NT15 generates \"t36 t88\" and NT43 generates \"t36 t4\". Let's check if that's possible.\n\nStarting with NT15:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT15 has a production: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Hmm, that's a recursive production. So NT15 can generate more NT15s, but perhaps through other productions. Wait, maybe I'm confusing NT15 with another. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So NT15 produces a pair of NT37 and NT15. But that seems like it would infinitely generate NT15, which isn't helpful. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, I should check if NT15 can derive a terminal string. Let's see the productions starting with NT37.\n\nLooking at NT37's productions: NT37 has two rules: NT37 -> NT19 NT19 and NT37 -> NT17 NT45. Both of these are products of NTs, which may further expand.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT37 -> NT17 NT45 and NT19 -> NT13 NT19. So NT19 is recursive as well, but NT37 can expand to NT17 NT45. Let's see where those NTs go.\n\nNT17 has productions: NT17 -> NT2 NT30 and NT17 -> NT49 NT23. Not immediately helpful.\n\nActually, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me backtrack.\n\nThe string is \"t36 t88 t36 t4\". So maybe the first two tokens \"t36 t88\" come from NT15 and the last two \"t36 t4\" from NT43.\n\nLet me check NT15's productions. Looking back, NT15 -> NT37 NT15 is a rule. So if I can find a way for NT15 to produce \"t36 t88\", perhaps that's possible.\n\nWait, but NT15 can only produce two non-terminals, so maybe each step should eventually derive a terminal.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, so each production must have two non-terminals except terminals. So in this case, I'm not sure how a non-terminal can produce a terminal, except if it's a direct terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again, I see some rules where non-terminals are assigned to a terminal. For example, NT24 -> 't5', NT5 -> 't2', etc. So those are direct terminals. So a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, in NT5 -> 't2', that means NT5 can produce 't2'. So it's a production that generates a single terminal.\n\nSo, when a non-terminal has a production that is a terminal, that's its only production for that terminal.\n\nSo, given that, let's see how we might derive the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which is S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo S will produce two parts: NT15 and NT43. So the overall string should be the concatenation of what NT15 produces and NT43 produces.\n\nSo, let's think about NT43. The first production for NT43 is NT43 -> NT6 NT1. Then further down, there's NT43 -> NT55 NT27 (wait, no, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar: NT43 has two productions: NT43 -> NT6 NT1 and NT43 -> NT24 NT27.\n\nHmm, okay. So maybe I should look for a way that NT43 can produce \"t36 t4\".\n\nWait, wait. The string is \"t36 t88 t36 t4\". So perhaps NT15 produces \"t36 t88\" and NT43 produces \"t36 t4\".\n\nLet's think about NT15: NT15 is productioned as NT37 NT15, which might be expanded, but perhaps there's a way to get t36 and t88.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach this differently.\n\nI'll try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I'll attempt to parse the string using the grammar's productions, perhaps using top-down parsing since I'm starting from the start symbol.\n\nStarting with S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo the string should be split into two parts: NT15's derivation and NT43's derivation, concatenated.\n\nSo, the string is t36 t88 t36 t4. Let's see if NT15 can produce the first two tokens, \"t36 t88\", and NT43 can produce the last two, \"t36 t4\".\n\nLet's check NT43 first, as the second part.\n\nNT43 has production NT43 -> NT24 NT27. Then NT24 has two productions: NT24 -> 't5' and NT24 -> NT2 NT48.\n\nWait, if NT24 can produce 't5', then that's a terminal. So if I can find a way for NT24 to be 't5' and NT27 to produce 't4', perhaps NT43 can produce part of the string.\n\nWait, but the string after NT15 is t36 t88, and then t36 t4 after that. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the breakdown is different. Maybe NT15 produces t36 t88, and NT43 produces t36 t4, as in, each non-terminal's production is a pair of non-terminals that produce the respective part of the string.\n\nWait, but for NT15 to produce t36 t88, it needs to have a production path that results in those two terminals.\n\nLet me see what NT15 can do. The only production for NT15 is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So that would lead to NT15 = NT37 NT15, which seems recursive. So perhaps I'm looking at a problem where NT37 needs to derive some terminals.\n\nLooking at NT37's productions: NT37 -> NT19 NT19 and NT37 -> NT17 NT45.\n\nSo NT37 can produce two NT19s or an NT17 and NT45.\n\nLooking at NT19: NT19 can produce NT13 NT19 (recursive) or NT51 NT19.\n\nWait, but NT19 can also get into recursive behavior here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT37 expands into NT37 NTsomething, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me remember how context-free grammars work. Each string is generated by starting from the start symbol, which here is S, and through a series of derivations expanding each non-terminal until only terminals are left.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), meaning each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see a bunch of rules, some of which produce terminals, denoted by 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string to check is `t90 t69 t31 t3 t38`. Let's break it down into individual tokens: t90, t69, t31, t3, t38.\n\nFirst, I should look for production rules that result in these terminals. Let's list the terminal productions:\n\n- T44 \u2192 t6\n- T6 \u2192 t16\n- T5 \u2192 t2\n- T48 \u2192 t48\n- T15 \u2192 t39\n- T4 \u2192 t48\n- T50 \u2192 t33\n- T12 \u2192 t16\n- T51 \u2192 t90\n- T48 \u2192 t87\n- T1 \u2192 t24\n- T34 \u2192 t87\n- T36 \u2192 t84\n- T21 \u2192 t99\n- T45 \u2192 t11\n- T19 \u2192 t13\n- T37 \u2192 t12\n- T51 \u2192 t38\n- T6 \u2192 t16\n- T17 \u2192 t33\n- T19 \u2192 t54\n- T31 \u2192 t91\n- T23 \u2192 t7\n- T16 \u2192 t3\n\nWait, I think I need to correct that. The terminal productions are where the rule equals a 't' followed by another number. So for example, NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, which isn't a terminal, but a production to NTs. But some other rules like NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4, which also doesn't produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I need to find all NTs that directly produce terminals. Scanning through each rule:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4 \u2192 t28? Wait, NT4 \u2192 t48. So NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 \u2192 both produce t13?

Hmm, maybe a duplication, but perhaps a typo or oversight. Let me note that NT4 can produce two different terminals, t48 and t88. So NT4 is a terminal when it produces 't48' or 't88'.\n15. NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4 \u2192 this is a production to two NTs, so not a terminal.\n16. NT12 \u2192 't16' \u2192 NT12 produces t16.\n17. NT51 \u2192 't90' \u2192 NT51 produces t90.\n18.

{"custom_id":"request-72","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's part of the language defined by the grammar. Hmm, CNF is a specific form where every production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal. The string to evaluate is `t65 t63 t28 t13 t4 t65`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Let me take a closer look at the productions. I see that the start symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT43. Each of these non-terminals then has their own productions which eventually lead to terminal symbols like t, which are part of the string we're checking.\n\nStarting with the string `t65 t63 t28 t13 t4 t65`, I can see that the string is a sequence of terminals. My goal is to trace through the grammar to see if each part of the string can be generated from the productions.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step. Starting from the left, the first part is t65. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT6 -> t2 and NT10 -> t50 NT30. Hmm, but I have t65, which isn't immediately present as a production. Wait, looking more carefully, I notice that NT40 -> t65, and NT49 -> NT47 NT27, which eventually leads to t65. So, t65 must come from NT40.\n\nSo, the initial production S -> NT15 NT43 must derive into a sequence that includes t65 as the first part. Let's see what's in NT15 and NT43.\n\nNT15 has a production NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which can lead to NT15 -> NT37 NT15, or something else. Wait, NT15 also has NT15 -> NT37 NT15, and NT15 -> NT30 NT20. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about this differently.\n\nWait, the string is six t's: t65, t63, t28, t13, t4, t65. Since each part of the string is a terminal, we need to have a path in the grammar where each t is generated by some non-terminal production.\n\nLet me look at each position:\n\n1. t65: Produced by NT40 (since NT40 -> t65). So, we need to find a production that eventually leads to NT40.\n\n2. t63: Looking for a non-terminal that produces t63. Looking through the productions, CT12 -> NT51 NT28, and NT51 is somewhere else. Hmm, maybe NT27? Wait, NT45 -> t11, but I'm looking for t63. Hmm, maybe NT48 produces t87, but I don't see t63 anywhere. Wait, NT25 -> NT28 NT48. Also, NT24 -> NT2 NT48. Maybe t63 comes from NT28 via NT51? Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT51's productions: NT51 -> NT41 NT20 OR NT50 NT20, etc. So, perhaps starting from NT51, which can produce t90, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look at each terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived as follows:\n\n- t65 comes from NT40 -> t65.\n- Then t63 comes from a production of another non-terminal. Let me check if NT63 exists. Looking through the productions, I see NT47 -> t6, NT27 -> t67, NT37 -> t12, etc. Wait, maybe NT63 is NT12, but I don't see an NT63 symbol in the productions. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking back, the productions include NT12 -> NT21 NT48, but nothing else. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine how each t corresponds to a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backwards from the string using the reverse of the grammar. Starting from the end, trying to see how the string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each terminal is the result of a specific production step. Let me think about each t and see which productions could lead to it.\n\n- t65: As before, comes from NT40.\n- t63: Let's see, NT28 -> NT26 NT23, and NT26 -> NT24 NT34. Wait, maybe starting from NT28, which can break down into other non-terminals. NT28 -> NT26 NT23. NT26 -> NT24 NT34, and NT24 can go to NT48 or other options. Maybe t63 comes from NT27 via NT27 -> NT8 NT17, but that's t67 and t2. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to find which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\n1. t65: NT40.\n2. t63: Let's see if any production ends with t63. Looking through the productions, I don't immediately see NT producing t63. Maybe it's part of a longer production. Hmm, perhaps t63 comes from NT28, which can split into NT26 and NT23. But NT26 is NT24 NT34, and NT24 can go to t4 or other options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to construct the derivation step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, we'll need NT15 to produce t65, and NT43 to produce the rest of the string. Or maybe the productions split in a way that the first part is t65, derived from NT15, and the rest follows.\n\nWait, but NT15 can produce NT30 NT20 (since NT15 -> NT30 NT20). And NT30 can produce NT32 NT8 (NT30 -> NT32 NT8), and NT20 -> NT30 NT24.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for the overall structure of the string.\n\nThe string is six terminals, so the derivation would involve multiple steps where each part is generated by a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be built starting from the start symbol S and applying the production rules step by step, eventually producing the given string.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, we need to derive NT15 NT43 into the string.\n\nFirst, NT15 can produce NT30 NT20.\n\nSo, S -> NT30 NT20 NT43.\n\nNext, NT30 can produce NT32 NT8.\n\nSo now: NT32 NT8 NT20 NT43.\n\nThen, NT32 can produce NT25 NT46.\n\nSo: NT25 NT46 NT8 NT20 NT43.\n\nNT25 can produce NT13 NT47.\n\nSo: NT13 NT47 NT46 NT8 NT20 NT43.\n\nNT13 can produce 't39'.\n\nSo: 't39' NT47 NT46 NT8 NT20 NT43.\n\nNT47 can produce 't11' (since NT47 -> NT11).\n\nSo: 't39' 't11' NT46 NT8 NT20 NT43.\n\nNT46 can produce 't7' (since NT46 -> t72, but that doesn't help. Wait, looking back, NT46's only production seems to be NT46 -> NT10 NT38, leading to t67 via NT10? Wait, let me check.)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT46 -> NT10 NT38, and NT38 -> NT51 NT29, which eventually leads to t67. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Maybe I should consider that the string `t65 t63 t28 t13 t4 t65` needs to be generated by a sequence of productions starting from S.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nt65 -> NT40.\n\nt63: Looking at the productions, I don't see a non-terminal that directly produces t63. So maybe t63 is part of a larger production.\n\nSimilarly, t28: Let's see, NT28 can split into NT26 NT23, which can further split into other non-terminals.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. I'm probably overcomplicating it. Maybe the correct approach is to see if each terminal can be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-68","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out whether the given string `t87 t90 t69 t67 t11 t83` is generated by the provided grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it's in CNF, and the terminals are the 't's followed by numbers. The rest are non-terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if a derivation exists that produces exactly this sequence. Each production must be applied correctly, and the left-hand side (LHS) of a production must be replaced by its right-hand side (RHS).\n\nI think starting from the start symbol S might be the way to go. The given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S is a combination of two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43. Both of these need to be expanded to produce the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's six tokens long: t87, t90, t69, t67, t11, t83. Since the string is a single sequence of terminals, that suggests that each non-terminal in the starting production and all subsequent derivations must lead directly to terminals without any non-terminals in the final string.\n\nLet me look at the productions for NT15 and NT43. Wait, NT15 is in the grammar. According to the rule, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Hmm, that's a recursive production. So NT15 can be replaced by NT37 followed by NT15 again. But NT15 is on both sides, so if we keep expanding, it will loop indefinitely. Wait, but in the string, there's a t87, which seems to be a terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT44 \u2192 t6, NT45 \u2192 t11, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start from the string and see if I can match any production.\n\nLet me note down the string: t87 t90 t69 t67 t11 t83.\n\nLooking at the tokens, maybe t87 comes from a production. Let's check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see NT24 \u2192 NT2, but that's non-terminal. Wait, looking for t87. Let me see each non-terminal's production that leads to a terminal. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT5 NT30, which is non-terminals. NT43 \u2192 NT24 NT0, which are non-terminals. Wait, but I see NT37 \u2192 t12, but t12 is a terminal. Wait, no, I think I may be getting confused.\n\nWait, let me look through the grammar. There's this line: NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37. NT37 \u2192 t12? Wait, no. Let me check NT37's production: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. Ok, that's non-terminals. Hmm, wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking for any production that ends with a terminal. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. NT15 can't produce a terminal directly. But check NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17. NT8 \u2192 t40 NT49, non-terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should go backward. Let's see each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nt87: Looking for a production that has t87 as a terminal. Checking the grammar:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t6\n- NT17 \u2192 t33\n- NT19 \u2192 t13\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n- NT45 \u2192 t11\n- NT48 \u2192 t87\nWait, wait a second. Looking through the rules, I see NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. So NT12 can produce NT21 followed by NT48. If NT48 can produce t87, then that part would generate t87.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how. Let's see: NT24 has a production that eventually could lead to terminals. NT24 \u2192 NT20 NT24? Or wait, how do they expand.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should try to see each step.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nSo the string should be derived from NT15 followed by NT43.\n\nNow, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So to expand, we have NT37 followed by NT15 again.\n\nBut NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So that's NT19 NT19.\n\nNow, NT19 has production: NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38. So NT19 becomes NT12 followed by NT38.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. So that's NT21 followed by NT48.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21. So NT48 is NT44 followed by NT21.\n\nNT21 has options: NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10 and NT21 \u2192 NT46 NT6. Wait, looking through the grammar, yes, lines say NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10, NT21 \u2192 NT46 NT6.\n\nNT10 has two productions: NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30 and NT10 \u2192 NT36 NT20.\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, and that goes on. This could get complicated.\n\nWait, but in our string, we have t87 as the second token. Let me check each non-terminal for a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT8: NT8 \u2192 t40 NT49. So that's a non-terminal.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, I think I have a better approach: I need to match the entire string as the product of the leftmost derivation.\n\nSo starting from S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nNow, we need both NT15 and NT43 to eventually produce sequences of terminals that concatenate to parts of the given string.\n\nLet me look at NT15 first.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15.\n\nSo NT15 expands to NT37 followed by another NT15, which could be a recursive expansion. So let's see if NT37 can produce some terminals.\n\nLooking at NT37's productions: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19.\n\nEach NT19 expands as NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38.\n\nSo the first NT19 becomes NT12 followed by NT38.\n\nNow, NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48, which is NT21 followed by NT48.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21.\n\nNow, NT44 \u2192 't6'.\n\nSo that's t6 followed by NT21.\n\nBut wait, the first token in the string is t87. Hmm, so that might not fit. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go back. Maybe the starting point is different.\n\nWait, another approach: The string is six tokens long, and the grammar is in CNF. So each step in the derivation should split into exactly two symbols, with the number of symbols increasing by one each time.\n\nWait, let me think. Starting with S, which is a single symbol. S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which is two symbols. Then each of these non-terminals will be split again. Each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by one. So for a string of length n, the derivation must go through n-1 steps. So in this case, 6 tokens mean 5 steps.\n\nWait, but in reality, each step can split multiple non-terminals, so perhaps the number of symbols can increase faster. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be formed by walking through the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t87 t90 t69 t67 t11 t83.\n\nI need each symbol in the string to come from a terminal production.\n\nLooking at t87: Where in the grammar does it appear? Let's scan:\n\nLooking through the list of rules, I see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34\n- NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21\n- NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4\n- NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n- NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\n- NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29\n- NT52 \u2192 't44'\n- Wait, looking for any non-terminal that can produce t87 directly. From the list:\n\nLet me check:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't72' (No)\n- NT42 \u2192 't5'\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47\n- NT24 \u2192 ...\nWait, maybe I'm looking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-96","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t7 t89 t37 t89 t13 t87 t55` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It seems extensive with many non-terminals and terminal symbols. But wait, some of the rules directly produce terminal symbols (like 't7', 't89', etc.). That's interesting because usually, in CNF, the right-hand side should consist of terminals or non-terminals, but here some rules produce terminals, so the grammar allows for terminal symbols to be derived from non-terminals.\n\nThe string I'm testing is `t7 t89 t37 t89 t13 t87 t55`. Each part separated by spaces. So, I'll treat each 'tX' as a symbol, either terminal or non-terminal? Wait, in the grammar, 't7', 't89', etc., are terminals because they are strings of digits. So each 'tX' is a terminal symbol.\n\nTo use the grammar to derive the string, I need to see if applying production rules starting from S can result in exactly this string. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to find a derivation that leads to that exact sequence.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S produces two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43. Each of these needs to expand into the respective parts of the string.\n\nLet's break down the string:\n\nThe string is [t7, t89, t37, t89, t13, t87, t55]. So, the first part is t7, which comes from the NT15. Similarly, the second part is t89 from NT43.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (from the provided rules). Wait, but in the initial rules for NT15, I see NT15 can go to NT37 NT15 or NT35 NT35 (I think I might have missed that earlier, but looking back, the initial grammar shows that NT15 has two rules: NT15 -> NT37 NT15 and NT15-> NT35 NT35. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user provided several grammar rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, I see NT15 -> NT37 NT15 and NT15-> NT35 NT35.\n\nWait, but in the provided rules, the first line is `S -> NT15 NT43`, then `NT50 -> NT1 NT32`, etc. So I think I may have misread them earlier. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nThe grammar starts with S, then NTs like NT50, NT36, etc. Each line is a production rule, so for example:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nNT15 -> NT35 NT35\nWait, no, actually, let me re-examine the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the entire grammar again, I notice that some of the NTs have multiple productions. For example:\n\nNT15 has two production rules:\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n- NT15 -> NT35 NT35\n\nSimilarly, other NTs have multiple productions. So this is a context-free grammar with possible left and right recursion.\n\nBut in Chomsky normal form, each production should have two non-terminals, but here, some rules have a terminal on the right. Wait, no. Wait, Chomsky normal form requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. So, in the given grammar, there are rules like NT24 -> 't5' which are terminal productions.\n\nSo the given grammar allows for terminal symbols, meaning it's not in pure CNF because CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals on the right. But in this case, there are some terminals, so the grammar is technically in weak Chomsky normal form or extended. Anyway, moving on.\n\nSo, to derive the string, I think I need to perform a top-down parse starting from S, expanding the non-terminals step by step, making sure that each expansion leads to the correct terminal symbols in the correct order.\n\nLet me attempt the parse step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t7, which is part of NT15 and ends with t55, which is part of NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15: It can produce NT37 NT15 or NT35 NT35.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 can produce NT6 NT1 or NT6 NT2.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar rules:\n\nNT43 -> NT27 NT0 OR NT6 NT1.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, looking for NT43:\n\nNT43 has two rules:\n- NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\nLine 52: NT43 -> NT6 NT15\nLine 57: NT24 -> 't5'\nWait, actually, looking through each line:\n\nI see NT43 appears towards the end. Let me search for NT43:\n\nYes, two entries for NT43:\n\n- NT43->NT27 NT15\n- NT43->NT6 NT1\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to be precise. Let me find all the NT43 productions.\n\nLooking through the 40-some lines:\n\nNT43 is defined as:\n\n- NT43 -> NT27 NT15\n- NT43 -> NT6 NT1\n\nWait, no, I think I may have misread it.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that most of the productions go from non-terminals to two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Some productions end with terminals, such as NT44 \u2192 't6', which are leaf nodes.\n\nThe string to check is a series of terminals: t72, t39, t99, t6, t88, t24, t44. So, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nLet me look at the structure of the string. The last part is t44, which is the terminal 't44'. In the grammar, NT44 \u2192 't6', so that's a terminal. Wait, but in the string, the last part is t44, which is a different terminal. So is there a production for NT44 that produces t44? Looking at the grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 't6', but not t44. Hmm, that's a problem because t44 is in the string but NT44 can only produce t6. So that might be an issue.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. I see in the NT44 productions, it goes to 't6'. So is there a production for NT44 that leads to t44? It doesn't seem so. So perhaps the string ends with t44, which isn't produced by anything. That might mean the string isn't in the language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me look at the other parts. The string starts with t72, which is produced by NT52 \u2192 't72'. That's a production, so NT52 can produce t72.\n\nThen it's t39, which is NT15 \u2192 't37', but wait, NT15 \u2192 't37' according to the grammar. So t39 would not be produced by NT15.

Let me check. The grammar has NT27 in some productions: NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29, NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17, but I don't see a production for NT27 to a terminal. So NT27 is a non-terminal that only goes to other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other terminals in the string: t39, t99, t6, t88, t24, t44.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals available are:\n\n- t6 (NT44)\n- t72 (NT52)\n- t33 (NT50)\n- t90 (NT51)\n- t87 (NT48)\n- t24 (NT41)\n- t4 (NT28)\n- t55 (NT24)\n- t18 (NT24)\n- t2 (NT4)\n- t7 (NT17)\n- t37 (NT15)\n- t54 (NT19)\n- t69 (NT13)\n- t12 (NT37)\n- t5 (NT28)\n- t83 (NT32)\n- t67 (NT29)\n- t16 (NT47)\n- t1 (NT1)\n- t24 (NT28 again, but also NT27?

Then, t39, which I don't see a production for any non-terminal ending at t39. Because the only terminals are as listed above, and t39 isn't among them. So that's a problem because t39 is the second symbol in the string, so NT52 must produce t72, then NTx must produce t39, but there's no such production. So the string can't be generated because there's no way to get t39.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The grammar doesn't have a production that produces t39 as a terminal. So any string containing t39 as a terminal symbol can't be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains t39, which is not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar\u2019s productions.

That should help in parsing.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t67, t63, t24, t11, t38, t7, t3, t54.

Start with S: S \u2192 NT15 NT43\n   So, I need to generate t67 (from NT15) and t63 (from NT43).\n\nWait, but looking at the productions, NT15 -> NT37 NT15.

But in the string, the end seems to have t54, which comes from NT1. Let me check how that happens.\n\nWait, looking at NT1's production: NT1 -> NT35 NT19. And NT19 has two options: NT19 -> NT12 NT38 or NT19 -> NT51 NT19. Hmm, so when can we get t38 or t54?\n\nWait, t38 is a terminal, so when does NT19 produce t38? I see in the productions that NT19 can produce t38 via NT38 \u2192 t38. But wait, in the given grammar, I see NT38 \u2192 't38', right? So from NT19, we can go to NT51 and then further.\n\nWait, let's map this out step by step for the string.\n\nThe string is t67 t63 t24 t11 t38 t7 t3 t54.

Let's say the first part is S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so the first terminal is from NT15 and the second from NT43.\n\nSo, first part: t67 should come from NT15. Looking at the productions for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So to get t67, which is 't67', I need to find where 't67' appears.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT24 \u2192 't55'? Wait, no. Wait, let me check the productions more carefully.\n\nWait, going through all the productions, looking for terminals:\n\nI see that NT45 \u2192 't11' \u2192 t11 is in the string.\n\nSimilarly, NT19 can produce t38, which is also in the string.\n\nLet me try to map each step:\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nFrom NT15: Since NT15 can produce NT37 NT15, which are both non-terminals, and then from there, we need to break them down until we get a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. So, from NT43, we get NT6 and NT1.\n\nNT6 produces 't6' \u2192 in the string, we have t67 and t63. Wait, no, 't6' isn't in the string. Hmm, maybe I need to see if NT24 can produce 't67' because in the grammar, NT24 has two options: NT24 \u2192 NT4 GT44 or NT24 \u2192 't55'. But in the given grammar, I don't see 't67' directly. Wait, looking at the grammar, let me check each production that results in a terminal, like 't's.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't6' (t6)\n- NT42 \u2192 't5' (t5)\n- NT13 \u2192 't39' (t39)\n- NT28 \u2192 't67' (Yes, here we go. NT28 \u2192 't67')\n- NT29 \u2192 't63' (Looking through, yes: NT29 \u2192 't63')\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT24 \u2192 't18'\n- NT13 \u2192 't39'\n- NT28 \u2192 't18' (Wait, no. Looking again, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT28: NT28 \u2192 't67' (from the rule NT28 \u2192 't67'), and also NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT9. So there are two ways for NT28.\n\nSimilarly, NT29 \u2192 't63' because of NT29 \u2192 't63'.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let me update.\n\nSo, for the string:\n\nt67 comes from NT28 \u2192 't67'\nt63 comes from NT29 \u2192 't63'\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and NT43 needs to produce the last part, which includes t54.\n\nLooking at NT51 \u2192 NT38, NT4, and others. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's step back.\n\nThe string is 8 terms: t67, t63, t24, t11, t38, t7, t3, t54.\n\nSo, first, S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nFrom NT15: since NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, it's like a chain. How can that produce a terminal? Let me see where NT37 can produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT37 has two rules: NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45 and NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19.\n\nHmm, both are non-terminals. So NT37 doesn't directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, then how is t67 or t63 obtained? Because t67 is from NT28, and t63 from NT29.\n\nSo perhaps the initial assumption that S splits into NT15 and NT43 is not sufficient because the first two terms t67 and t63 aren't in NT15 or NT43. Hmm, that suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the splitting.\n\nWait, maybe the productions from S are S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So from S, the left part is NT15 and the right is NT43. So, in the string, the first part should be generated by NT15, which would become t67, then NT43 would produce t63, and so on.\n\nWait, but how can NT15 produce t67 and then the next terms? Because NT15 is only producing in the form of NT37 NT15, recursively. So to get a terminal, we need to have a way in the grammar where NT15 can directly produce a terminal.\n\nLet me look again through the grammar for NT15 productions. Wait, the productions are:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n\nNo, I don't see NT15 directly producing a terminal. Wait, no, then how does the first t67 come from NT15? Unless, perhaps, I misunderstood the splitting.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and then NT15 produces t67 through a chain. Let me try to see how.\n\nFrom S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nLet\u2019s say NT15 generates a string, and NT43 generates another.\n\nBut according to the productions, NT15 only produces NT37 NT15, which are non-terminals.

The string to evaluate is `t4 t33 t48 t84 t24 t31 t87 t12`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Context-free grammars (CFGs) are defined by production rules, and Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires each production to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow CNF because all rules have two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for certain cases where terminals appear. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production must be to two non-terminals or a single terminal. Some of the rules might have more than one non-terminal, so I need to check.\n\nWait, the given grammar is already in CNF, so each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal, right? So every production is either A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Let me check one or two examples.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT15 NT43: that's two non-terminals, so that's fine. Another one: NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48: again two non-terminals, correct. But wait, are all the productions like this? Let me check another one: NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38: two non-terminals. Ok, seems consistent. Now, some rules like NT52 \u2192 't44' end with a terminal. So those are direct terminals. So the grammar is properly in CNF.\n\nNow, the challenge is to see if the string `t4 t33 t48 t84 t24 t31 t87 t12` can be derived from the start symbol S. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nOne way is to parse the string according to the grammar. Parsing can be done using methods like the CYK algorithm, but since I have the actual grammar, maybe a step-by-step approach would work. Alternatively, I can try to find an applicable production starting from S and see if I can generate the string.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar and the string, perhaps recursion or a systematic approach would help. Let's try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string is eight tokens: t4 t33 t48 t84 t24 t31 t87 t12. The start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the entire string must be generated from NT15 NT43. That means the first two tokens in the string must come from NT15, and the next two from NT43? Or not exactly, because NT15 and NT43 could themselves be expanded.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S generates NT15 and NT43, meaning that the production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so the entire string must be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT15 and NT43. So the string must be the combination of NT15's expansion and NT43's expansion.\n\nLooking at the given string: t4 is the first token. So perhaps NT15 starts with t4. Or does NT15 derive t4 somewhere deeper in the tree.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see what the start symbols can produce. NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, according to the production. So NT15 can be rewritten as NT37 NT15, which suggests a recursive definition. Also, looking at more rules: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. That could lead to multiple t-values.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should start by looking for the root symbols and see how they can generate the given string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reverse-engineer the parse tree. Let's consider the string: t4 t33 t48 t84 t24 t31 t87 t12.\n\nLooking at the first token, t4: when is a non-terminal derived as t4? Checking the grammar, looking for productions that result in t4. For example, NT32 \u2192 t83 according to the grammar, but I don't see t4 directly. Wait, let me check all the rules for terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t2 (rule: NT4 \u2192 t2)\n- NT48 \u2192 t88 (rule: NT48 \u2192 t88)\n- NT23 \u2192 t7 (NT23 \u2192 t7)\n- NT32 \u2192 t83\n- NT24 \u2192 t18\n- NT24 \u2192 t55\n- NT13 \u2192 t39\n- NT28 \u2192 t67\n- NT0 \u2192 t39\n- NT40 \u2192 t65\n- NT46 \u2192 t72\n- NT32 \u2192 t83\n- NT24 \u2192 t18\n- NT24 \u2192 t55\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT4 \u2192 t48\n- NT9 \u2192 t28\n- NT50 \u2192 t33\n- NT12 \u2192 t16\n- NT51 \u2192 t90\n- NT48 \u2192 t87\n- NT1 \u2192 t24\n- NT34 \u2192 t87\n- NT36 \u2192 t84\n- NT21 \u2192 t99\n- NT45 \u2192 t11\n- NT19 \u2192 t13\n- NT37 \u2192 t12\n- NT51 \u2192 t38\n- NT6 \u2192 t16\n- NT17 \u2192 t33\n- NT19 \u2192 t54\n- NT37 \u2192 t54\n- NT36 \u2192 t41\n- NT26 \u2192 t12\n- NT5 \u2192 t7\n- NT13 \u2192 t69\n- NT21 \u2192 t13\n- NT40 \u2192 t89\n- NT28 \u2192 t4\n- NT29 \u2192 t36\n- NT1 \u2192 t37\n- NT51 \u2192 t38\n- NT6 \u2192 t16\n- NT17 \u2192 t33\n- NT19 \u2192 t54\n- NT31 \u2192 t91\n- NT23 \u2192 t7\n- NT16 \u2192 t3\n\nWait, looking for any production that results in t4.

So the first token t4 in the string could come from NT28 production. So, the NT28 could be directly expanded to t4.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the next token in the string after t4 is t33. So perhaps NT28 generates t4 and t33. But how? Because NT28 might be part of a larger non-terminal.\n\nWait, the string is `t4 t33 t48 t84 t24 t31 t87 t12`. The first part is t4, which comes from NT28 \u2192 t4. But the next token is t33. How does that come into play?\n\nLooking back at the grammar, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and the string starts with t4, which is part of NT28. So maybe NT15 or NT43 contains a production that includes NT28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived from NT28 generating t4, followed by another NT producing t33.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here.

{"custom_id":"request-134","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t84 t28 t3 t6 t54 t36 t18 t91 t3`, and the grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, let's recall what CNF means. CNF requires that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. From the given grammar, I see that all the left-hand sides (LHS) of the productions are single non-terminals, and the RHS are pairs of non-terminals or a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Wait, no, looking closer, actually, the RHS can consist of two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. But in CNF, the RHS should only be terminals or two non-terminals. Hmm. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either A\u2192a or A\u2192BC where a is a terminal, B and C are non-terminals. So if any production has two terminals on the RHS, like A\u2192aB, that's not CNF. But in the given grammar, looking at some rules, like NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which seems like B\u2192BC, which is allowed in Chomsky Normal Form because it's two non-terminals. But if a production has a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like A\u2192aB, that would not be in CNF because the RHS has a mixture. Wait, but looking at the rules provided, for example, NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35, which is two non-terminals. So seems like all the RHS are either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, some rules have a mix of non-terminals and terminals, which would not be CNF. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must have either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the RHS. So, for example, A \u2192 a is allowed, and A \u2192 BC is allowed, but A \u2192 aB or aBa is not allowed. However, looking at the given grammar, all the RHS seem to be either two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32, which is two non-terminals. NT52 \u2192 't44', which is a terminal. So this grammar seems to be in CNF because all productions are strictly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So that's good.\n\nNow, the string we need to analyze is `t84 t28 t3 t6 t54 t36 t18 t91 t3`. Each of these are tokens, which in the grammar are represented as NT15, NT1, etc., except for the t's, which are terminals. So t84 corresponds to NT84, which I think we need to map. Wait, looking at the grammar, some terminals are written as 't' followed by numbers, like 't44', 't6', etc. So perhaps each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, many of the rules have 't' as terminals. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT5 NT30, and the terminals are things like 't6', 't28', etc. So, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, so the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must have a corresponding production path from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the first production, S produces NT15 NT15 (wait, actually, looking at the given grammar, it's S \u2192 NT15 NT15 with the subscript at T15, but in the input, the string has 't84', so I'm confused. Wait, wait, in the grammar provided, the production for S is written as S -> NT15 NT15, but in the string, the terminals are things like 't84', which may not correspond directly.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the grammar uses NT followed by numbers as non-terminals. For example, NT15, NT2, etc. But in the string, the terminals are 't' followed by numbers like 't84', 't28', etc. So each 't' is like a terminal symbol, but in the grammar, the non-terminals have two parts: the NT and the subscript. For example, NT15 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the string's terminals are mapped to the grammar's terminals. Wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals are terminals. For example, NT52 \u2192 't44', meaning that NT52 is a terminal because it's mapped to 't44'. Similarly, NT44 \u2192 't6', and so on. So each NT that appears on the RHS as a terminal is actually a terminal symbol with value 't' plus the number.\n\nWait, no: in the grammar, each rule either produces two non-terminals or one terminal. So for example, NT52 \u2192 't44', meaning that NT52 is a terminal symbol equal to 't44'. So in that case, any non-terminal in the string which is equal to a terminal symbol (i.e., appears on the RHS of a production as a terminal) can be replaced by that terminal.\n\nSo, in the given string, 't84 t28 t3 t6 t54 t36 t18 t91 t3', each token is a string like 't84', 't28', etc. Now, we need to see if each of these is either a terminal symbol in the grammar or can be derived from a non-terminal. But since the grammar uses 't' followed by numbers as terminals, any 't' token in the string is a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Because some of the non-terminals may be terminals. For example, NT44 \u2192 't6', so NT44 is a terminal, producing 't6'. So in the string, whenever we have a 't6' token, it can be directly matched to the terminal NT44.\n\nWait, but in the given string, 't84' is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal? Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: in the grammar, each symbol is either a non-terminal (like NT15, NT24, etc.) or a terminal (like 't7', 't15', etc.). So, the string we have is a sequence of terminal symbols. So each token in the string is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals, NT15 and NT15. So, S \u2192 NT15 NT15. Then each of those NT15s can possibly produce other sequences.\n\nBut in the string provided, each token is a terminal (like 't84', 't28') but these must correspond to terminal symbols in the grammar. Wait, but in the grammar, some of the non-terminals are terminals. For example, NT52 \u2192 't44', which is a terminal. So in the production S \u2192 NT15 NT15, if each NT15 produces a terminal, then the entire S can produce a string of terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the initial productions, S \u2192 NT15 NT15, and then each NT15 might have production rules that result in more non-terminals or terminals. Each token in the string must have been derived from some combination of the CFG productions.\n\nSo, the string is: t84 t28 t3 t6 t54 t36 t18 t91 t3\n\nI think I can approach this problem using a recursive descent parser or by building a parse tree, but perhaps a simpler approach is to track the possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the problem by working backwards. Let's see what 't3' parses as.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has a lot of non-terminals (NT) like S, NT15, NT50, etc., and some terminals like t18, t13, etc. The string to check consists of these terminals, so I need to see if there's a derivation path that transforms the start symbol S into this string.\n\nThe given string has 9 elements, so the derivation must consist of 9 steps where each step produces a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces one terminal or two non-terminals. Therefore, to produce a string of length 9, the derivation must have exactly 9-1 = 8 productions, but let's think in terms of the number of terminals.\n\nWait, actually, each production can produce a terminal or two non-terminals. Since the start symbol S is a non-terminal, each step either appends a terminal or splits into two non-terminals. To get a string of n terminals, we need n-1 productions where we append a terminal, plus possibly some productions that split and then recombine.\n\nBut maybe an easier approach is to parse the string using the grammar, treating it as a top-down parser. Each step in the derivation corresponds to a non-terminal expanding into symbols, eventually leading to the entire string.\n\nLooking at the string: t18 t13 t72 t18 t87 t65 t7 t63 t31.\n\nLet me start from the first symbol and see if it can come from a production.\n\nt18 is a terminal.

Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, no, looking at the user's grammar:\n\nThe grammar has multiple rules for some NTs. For example, NT24 appears twice:\n\nNT24 -> NT24 -> t5 (from NT4 -> t48, but not exactly. Let me check the entire list.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for where a non-terminal directly goes to t18.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t55 (I'm sorry, the grammar as provided is a bit confusing because some non-terminals have multiple rules.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's see the entire list again. The user provided many productions. Let me go through each to check if any produce 't18'.\n\nLooking through the full list:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't50' as per line NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, but no, that's producing non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any 't18' in the right-hand side of the productions. Scanning through lines:\n\nLooking at line: NT24 -> t55\n\nNo, wait, line 7: NT24 -> NT48 NT35\n\nLooking for NT24 appearing elsewhere: another rule is NT24 -> t55, but wait, looking at the provided data, the rule for NT24 is written multiple times:\n\nThere's NT24 -> t55, NT24 -> t18?

No, that's NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10 (line after 95?), which is producing NTs, not terminals.\n\nWait, I think I might be making this more complicated.

The string is `t13 t7 t13 t69 t2 t24 t16 t87 t48 t4` and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars are easier to parse because each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The given grammar has rules like S -> NT15 NT43, which fits the CNF.\n\nThe string starts with `t13`, which I assume are terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the initial step is likely going to be expanding non-terminals into other non-terminals until terminals are reached.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several productions lead directly to terminals with 't'. For example, NT24 -> 't5', NT23 -> 't7', NT37 -> 't12', etc. So each 't' is the result of a production from a specific non-terminal.\n\nThe string has ten 't's, so I need to find a derivation where each 't' comes from a corresponding rule. Let me try to map each 't' in the string to a non-terminal.\n\nStarting from the first 't13':\n- Looking for a rule where the first symbol is 't13'. Scanning the grammar, I don't see any 't13', but maybe it's a production rule that leads to it. Wait, the grammar only has rules that convert non-terminals to 't's, not the other way around. So perhaps the 't's in the string are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nWait, maybe the string is a sequence of terminals, so each 't' corresponds to a production of a non-terminal. So I need to trace back from each 't' to its non-terminal source.\n\nBut since each production in the grammar leads a non-terminal to either another non-terminal or a terminal (like NT24 -> 't5'), I can think of each 't' as being a direct production from its corresponding NT.\n\nSo, I can create a mapping from each 't' in the string to a non-terminal:\n\nt13 \u2192 NT24 (since NT24 -> 't5' is not t13, wait, no, perhaps another non-terminal? Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nWait, looking at NT13 -> 't69', so t69 comes from NT13. But the string starts with t13. So maybe NT23 -> 't7'? Wait, the string is t13, t7, t13, etc. Wait, the string is `t13 t7 t13 t69 t2 t24 t16 t87 t48 t4`.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nt13: Maybe NT23 -> 't7' is not that, but perhaps looking for a non-terminal that can produce 't13'. Wait, checking the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't13'? Looking, I see NT13 -> 't69'. So 't69' comes from NT13. But the first 't' in the string is 't13'. Hmm, that's not directly mapped. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't's are the leaves, so each 't' must be the result of a production from a non-terminal. So I need to see if the given string can be broken down into rules that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the string as the concatenation of results from the grammar. Let's try to build a parse tree.\n\nStarting from S, which is S -> NT15 NT43. So S is two non-terminals, NT15 and NT43. Each of these would produce two children each.\n\nNT15 has a production like NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that seems recursive. Similarly, NT43 has a production NT43 -> NT6 NT1. So let's try to see how these could produce the string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to approach this as a bottom-up parse, trying to match the string from the end.\n\nLooking at the string: t13 t7 t13 t69 t2 t24 t16 t87 t48 t4.\n\nLet me split this into a sequence and see what rules could produce each part. Since the grammar is in CNF, each rule produces two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: t4. The rule NT4 -> 't48' or something else? Wait, looking at the grammar, let me check:\n\n- NT34 -> 't87'\n- NT48 -> 't87'\n- NT6 -> 't16'\n- NT24 -> 't5' or other options?\nWait, actually, looking into the grammar rules for NT24:\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT24 -> 't55'\n\nSo wait, NT24 can produce 't5' or 't55'. But in the string, after t24 comes t16, which is 't16', corresponding to NT17 -> 't33', but not directly. Wait, perhaps 't16' is from another rule.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each part of the string to the possible rules.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see what each 't' in the string could come from and work backward.\n\nt13: Looking for a production where NT leads to t13. In the grammar, I don't see any 't13' production. Wait, looking at the grammar, perhaps there's a non-terminal that can reach 't13'. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, let me check all the NT rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT21 -> 't99' (no)\n- NT23 -> 't7' yes, production NT23 -> 't7'.\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT5 -> various.\nWait, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built up by combining the results of S. Let me think of the overall structure:\n\nS -> NT15 NT43. So S will produce a string that is the concatenation of NT15 and NT43. Each of these is a non-terminal that itself splits into two parts.\n\nNT15: Looking at the rules for NT15, it's NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So that's a recursive rule. So NT15 will keep producing more NT37 and NT15 until it eventually can derive into a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 -> NT6 NT1. So NT43 splits into NT6 and NT1.\n\nLet me try to expand these recursively.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS -> NT15 NT43\nWhich becomes (expansion of NT15) (expansion of NT43)\n\nExpanding NT15: It's NT15 -> NT37 NT15.\n\nThis seems like a repeating rule. So perhaps NT15 will eventually reach a point where it can derive into a terminal.\n\nLet me think of NT15 as producing a string that is made of multiple NT37 symbols until it can terminate. But I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT37 has a production that leads to a terminal. Looking at NT37:\n\nNT37 -> 't12' (wait, no), or looking at rule NT37 -> NT19 NT19. Hmm, but NT19 has some rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar for NT37, I see NT37 -> NT19 NT19.\n\nLooking at NT19, it has NT19 -> NT12 NT38 and NT19 -> NT51 NT19.\n\nHmm, so if NT19 expands via NT51 NT19, that might lead into a chain.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to try to match the string to the grammar step by step.\n\nWait, the string is t13 t7 t13 t69 t2 t24 t16 t87 t48 t4.\n\nLooking at each symbol:\n\n1. t13: So this should come from some NT rule.

So maybe it's from another path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is incorrect, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for other possibilities.

{"custom_id":"request-156","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with determining whether the string `t55 t2 t11 t55 t11 t33 t11 t31 t7 t28` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it mostly follows this pattern, though some rules have more than two non-terminals, which might be exceptions, but I need to check that.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the given grammar, some productions like NT50 -> NT1 NT32 (which is two non-terminals) or NT24 -> NT48 NT35 (two non-terminals). So, all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. That makes sense for CNF.\n\nNow, the string provided consists of a series of terminals: t55, t2, t11, etc. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: `t55 t2 t11 t55 t11 t33 t11 t31 t7 t28`.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, there are many production rules. Some terminals are actually non-terminals that eventually derive into other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT4 -> 't48', which is a terminal. So, the production of a non-terminal can result in a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nMy approach should be to parse the string from left to right, trying to find a derivation path. Start with S -> NT15 NT43, so the entire string must be a combination of the contents generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nLet's break down the string into parts. Let's assume that the string can be divided into two parts: the first part is generated by NT15, and the second part by NT43.\n\nSo, the first part would be `t55 t2 t11 t55 t11 t33 t11 t31 t7 t28`, but wait, no\u2014wait, the entire string is one derivation, so I need to consider the entire string as a single unit that comes from either NT15 or NT43.\n\nWait, no, because S splits into NT15 and NT43, so the string is the concatenation of what NT15 generates and what NT43 generates. So, I should check whether the string can be split into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT15 and the second by NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 10 tokens long. Let's see.\n\nBut how do I approach this? Maybe it's better to start from the beginning and see if I can derive the first token t55 from some non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the only production that ends with 't55' is T4: NT51 -> 't50' and NT51 -> 't20' (wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for terminals that match the string, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't5' (but no, wait, looking at the given grammar, I'm seeing lines like:\n\nFor example, some productions have terminals like 't5', 't2', etc. So, perhaps the string `t55 t2 t11 t55 t11 t33 t11 t31 t7 t28` is built from non-terminals that ultimately produce these terminals.\n\nWait, no. For example, NT9 -> 't28', NT12 -> 't16', etc. So, some non-terminals produce a terminal in one step.\n\nSo, maybe I can reverse the process. Let me check each token in the string to see if they can be derived from any non-terminal.\n\nWait, but the string is `t55 t2 t11 t55 t11 t33 t11 t31 t7 t28`\u2014each of these is a separate element. So, each of these must be generated by a non-terminal that eventually leads to that exact terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, do any non-terminals derive exactly to these t's?\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT9 -> 't28'\n- NT13 -> 't69'\n- NT17 -> 't33'\n- NT19 -> 't13'\n- NT21 -> 't13'\n- NT23 -> 't7'\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n- NT32 -> 't83'\n- NT36 -> 't84'\n- NT4 -> 't48'\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n- NT52 -> 't44' \u2192 So NT24 -> 't5' because one production is 't44', but there's another production for NT24: 't5' as well. Wait, perhaps I need to check the production rules more carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar as presented is a bit confusing. Let me list all the productions and see which produce terminals.\n\nI'll scan through each production line and note which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT0 -> 't39' (twice)\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT24 -> 't55'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT9 -> 't28'\n- NT13 -> 't69'\n- NT21 -> 't13'\n- NT23 -> 't7'\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n- NT32 -> 't83'\n- NT36 -> 't84'\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n- NT52 -> 't44'\n- NT42 -> 't5'\n\nSo, the terminals are: t2, t5, t55, t28, t67, t83, t84, t6, t44, t52, etc. But looking at each production:\n\n- NT24 has two productions: one to 't5' and another to 't55'.\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT9 -> 't28'\n- NT21 -> 't13' (but 't13' is a terminal? Or is it another NT that leads to 't13'? Wait, no, 't13' is a terminal? I need to check if any production directly produces 't13'.\n\nWait, reviewing the grammar, I see that NT13 -> 't39'. So, 't39' is a terminal. Therefore, NT13 produces the terminal 't39'.\n\nBut looking at our string, we have 't11', 't33', 't11', etc. So, do any of the non-terminals derive exactly to these 't's?\n\nHmm. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the terminals:\n\n- t55 is a result of NT24's second production.\n- t2 is NT5's.\n- t11: is there a non-terminal that produces 't11'? Looking through the terminal productions, none seem to produce 't11'. Wait, maybe the string has a 't11' which is actually a terminal. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only 't11' I see is in the production NT45 -> 't11'? No, let's look. Scanning the lines, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n- NT24 -> 't5', 't55'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT21 -> 't13' (and NT21 -> 't13'\u2014same)\n- NT23 -> 't7'\n- NT32 -> 't83'\n- NT24 again has t55.\n- NT52 -> 't44'\n- NT52 -> 't44' again\n- NT42 -> 't5'\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n- NT15 -> 't24' via NT15 -> NT37 NT15 (which would be terminals based on their productions)\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think differently.\n\nSince the string contains 't11', and in the grammar, no production I can find directly derive 't11', it seems that 't11' is a terminal. That would imply that the grammar can produce a 't11' as a terminal in some production.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't11'. Therefore, that would mean that 't11' cannot be generated by the grammar. Because all terminals are either directly generated by a non-terminal (if any) or are non-terminals in the grammar that can only produce other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but NT has several terminals:\n\nLooking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps in parsing and generating strings efficiently.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's a bit complex because there are multiple non-terminals and production rules. The start symbol is S, which is defined as NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that seems recursive, but I need to check the productions more carefully.\n\nLet me list out the productions to get a better overview. It looks like most non-terminals expand into two non-terminals, and some expand directly into terminals. The strings can be terminals, which are represented as 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t13 t38 t36 t91 t7 t2 t69 t39 t28 t38 t3`. I notice that each element is separated by a space, so the string consists of 11 tokens. Each token represents a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, to generate this string from the grammar, I need to trace back from S, expanding non-terminals until I get the terminals. The process involves checking if each part of the string can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLet's start by checking the start symbol S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Wait, no, looking again, the production is S \u2192 NT15 NT15? Or S \u2192 NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15? Wait, no, the production is S \u2192 NT15 NT15? Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT15 NT15? Oh, yes, that's the first one. So S is defined as NT15 and NT15. Hmm, no, wait, looking more carefully, the production is S \u2192 NT15 NT15? Or S \u2192 NT15 NT43? Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nHold on, the user provided the grammar, and the first line is S \u2192 NT15 NT15. Or is it S \u2192 NT15 NT43? Let me double-check: The user wrote:\n\nGrammar:\n\nS -> NT15 NT15\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the user's message, the first line after the grammar starts is S -> NT15 NT15. Let me check the user's message:\n\n\"Grammar: ```S -> NT15 NT15\n\nNT50 -> NT1 NT32\n\n... and so on until the end ```\n\nWait, no, the user's actual grammar starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT15. So, S is the start symbol, and its only production is S \u2192 NT15 NT15.\n\nWait, that seems odd because that would mean S can only produce the concatenation of NT15 and NT15. But let me check the user's message again.\n\nLooking back, the user's grammar starts with:\n\n```Grammar: ```S -> NT15 NT15\n\nNT50 -> NT1 NT32\n\nNT36 -> NT42 NT48\n\nNT25 -> NT13 NT47\n\n... etc.```\n\nWait, no, looking closely, the user wrote S -> NT15 NT15 as the first production. So, S can derive to NT15 followed by NT15.\n\nNow, I need to see if the given string can be composed by expanding these non-terminals. Since the string starts with t13, which is a terminal, I need to find a production that includes t13.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that some non-terminals expand directly into terminals. For example, NT13 \u2192 't39', but that's not helpful because it gives t39. Hmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I find:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48\n- NT13 \u2192 't39'\n\nWait, so if NT21 expands to NT13 (which is t39) and NT48, which is another production. Let me check NT48:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21\n- NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48\n\nThis seems like a recursive loop because expanding NT21 leads to NT13 (t39) and NT48, which leads to NT44 and NT21, which again expands to the same loop.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not leading me anywhere. Let's look for other non-terminals that can lead to t13.\n\nWait, I see another production:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n\nSo, NT15 expands into NT37 and NT15. Wait, that's recursive again, but perhaps it can lead to something.\n\nLet's go further:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 or NT19 NT45\n- NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38 or NT51 NT19\n- NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20 or NT8 NT4\n- NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43 or other productions like nt50 \u2192 nt52 nt4, but I need to check which ones.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for chains that can derive the given terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t13, which could come from a production like NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48, but that would produce t39 followed by NT48, which might produce more strings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t13 comes from another production. Wait, looking at the productions, I don't see a production that directly expands to t13. The closest is NT13 \u2192 't39', but that gives us t39, not t13.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the productions. Let me look carefully.\n\nLooking again, the productions include:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't41' NT43\n- NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT6 \u2192 't6' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t13 t38 t36 t91 t7 t2 t69 t39 t28 t38 t3`.\n\nThat's 11 terminals. The grammar seems to have short productions, often leading to single terminals.\n\nLet me try to match the string from the end backwards because that's often easier in parsing.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, let's see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of productions.\n\nStarting from the first token, t13.\n\nLooking at the possible productions that result in t13:\n\n- Does any non-terminal directly produce 't13'? Looking through the productions, I don't see a production like A \u2192 t13. So, t13 must come from a non-terminal expansion.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that can produce 't13':\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48, so if NT21 is expanded, it gives t39 (from NT13) and whatever NT48 produces. But that doesn't give t13.\n\n- Or maybe NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. If NT15 is expanded, it leads to NT37 and NT15. NT37 would produce something else.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me list all the productions that result in terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT2 \u2192 't41'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT3 \u2192 't37'\n- NT5 \u2192 't7'\n- NT13 \u2192 't39'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39' through NT13, and then NT48\n- NT36 \u2192 NT5 NT30.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because that means each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the grammar. I see that most of the non-terminals on the left are connected to other non-terminals, and some have terminals. For example, `NT44 -> 't6'`, which is a terminal string. These are probably the base cases that will help in breaking down the string.\n\nThe string we're testing has 11 tokens, but to properly parse it, each production might consist of multiple terminals. I should start from the top of the grammar, `S`, and see how it can generate a string that matches step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is `S`, which goes to `NT15 NT43`. So `S -> NT15 NT43`. Both `NT15` and `NT43` must produce a string that, when combined, form our target string. \n\nLooking at `NT15 -> NT37 NT15` or `NT46 -> NT10 NT38`. Wait, no, let me check. Actually, looking again, I see that `NT15` has two production rules: `NT15 -> NT37 NT15` and also `NT15 -> NT30 NT20`. Similarly, `NT43` can go to `NT27 NT0` or other rules like `NT6 -> ...` and `NT48 -> ...`.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to map each terminal in the string to possible non-terminals in the grammar. Each token in the string corresponds to a specific non-terminal on the right-hand side of some production.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n1. `t16` \u2013 I see `NT17 -> NT2 NT30` and `NT17 -> 't2'`. Wait, no, there\u2019s a rule `NT17 -> NT2 NT30` but that\u2019s not a terminal. However, there's a `NT16 -> 't3'`. Wait, that seems incorrect because our string starts with `t16`.\n\nWait, looking back, I see in the grammar: \n\n- `NT6 -> 't16'` because there's a production `NT6 -> 't16'`.\n- Similarly, `NT17 -> 't33'`, not `t16`.\n- So `t16` must come from `NT6`.\n\nSo the first token `t16` corresponds to `NT6 -> 't16'`. So the first step is for `NT6`, but `NT6` isn't directly part of the start symbol, so I need to see how `NT6` is derived.\n\nWait, the start symbol is `S -> NT15 NT43`. So the generated string will be the concatenation of the strings from `NT15` and `NT43`.\n\nOur target string is `t16 t6 t6 t67 t69 t55 t31 t72 t24 t36 t39`. Let's break it into two parts: the first part before the split and the second part after a split. Wait, but how do we split it? Since `S` is `NT15 NT43`, maybe `NT15` generates the first part and `NT43` the second.\n\nLooking at `t16` being from `NT6`, let me see how `NT6` can be part of `NT15`. Wait, no, actually, `NT6` isn't part of `NT15`'s productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at `NT15`'s productions: It can go to `NT37 NT15` or `NT46 NT27`. The latter is `NT46 -> NT10 NT38` and `NT27 -> NT8 NT17`. Hmm, not directly obvious. Alternatively, perhaps `NT15` can go to other rules. Wait, in the provided grammar, the lines go on beyond what I initially thought. Let me list the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, this might take too long, but perhaps a better approach is to see if each token can be matched by some production.\n\nGiven that the first token is `t16`, which is `NT6 -> 't16'`. So that requires that `NT6` is part of the derivation. But `NT6` is a left-hand side in the grammar. So in the context of `S`, which is `NT15 NT43`, how does `NT6` come into play?\n\nWait, perhaps `NT15` is NT15 -> NT30 NT20. Let me check the grammar rules for NT15.\n\nScanning through the provided productions:\n\n- `NT15 -> NT37 NT15`\n- `NT15 -> NT30 NT20`\n- `NT30 -> NT32 NT8`\n- `NT38 -> NT51 NT29`\n- `NT37 -> NT12 NT1`\n- Wait, I think I need to map all the productions step by step.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nSo S generates `NT15 NT43`. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the strings generated by `NT15` and `NT43`.\n\nLet me first see what `NT43` can generate. Looking at `NT43`'s productions: It can go to `NT27 NT0`, `NT24 NT48`, `NT48 NT27`. So let's see which of these can produce the latter part of the string.\n\nThe target string is `t16 t6 t6 t67 t69 t55 t31 t72 t24 t36 t39`. Let's look at the latter tokens: `t24 t36 t39`.\n\nLooking at `NT24` productions: It can go to `NT18`, `NT48`, `NT28 NT1`, `NT28 NT9`, etc. But also, `NT24` itself has terminals like `t18`, `t55`, etc.\n\nWait, let's look at the specific tokens:\n\n- `t24` appears multiple times. Looking through the grammar, I see that `NT24` can produce `t18` or `t55` via specific productions. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking for `t24` in the grammar:\n\n- `NT24` has rules like `NT24 -> NT24 NT2`, `NT24 -> NT48 NT35`, `NT13 -> 't39'`, etc. But I don't see `t24` directly as a terminal. So perhaps `t24` is from `NT24` with a rule `NT24 -> 't24'`. Wait, no, checking the grammar:\n\nI see `NT24 -> 't55'` as a terminal. So `t55` is from `NT24`. Similarly, `NT29` has `t63`, `NT7` has `t35`, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake. Let me go step by step.\n\nLet me consider each token in the string:\n\n1. `t16` corresponds to `NT6 -> 't16'`\n2. `t6` corresponds to `NT6 -> 't6'`\n3. `t6` again `t6` same as above\n4. `t67` Wait, looking for a terminal in NT that produces 't67'\u2014I don't see that. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see that `NT67` isn't mentioned. Wait, let me see: is `t67` a terminal or a non-terminal? From the grammar, I only see the non-terminals as NT followed by numbers. Wait, no\u2014the grammar has NT symbols, but the string has 't' followed by numbers, like `t67`. So 't67' is treated as a terminal because it's not a capital letter. So 't67' is a terminal, not a non-terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, are there any non-terminals that produce `t67`? Let me check the grammar lines:\n\nLooking through, I don't see any production rule where a non-terminal goes to `t67`. Hmm, that might be an issue. Alternatively, perhaps `t67` is part of a larger non-terminal symbol. Wait, maybe a non-terminal like NT27 produces something that includes `t67`. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at `NT46 -> NT10 NT38` and `NT32 -> NT25 NT46`, which then could lead to `t67` if some non-terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-195","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is `t6 t72 t67 t90 t65 t65 t55 t72 t13 t69 t44 t28`.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except for the terminals which are the leaves. Also, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, and each non-terminal has at least two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice that some productions directly lead to terminals. For example, several rules end with 't' followed by numbers, indicating terminal symbols like 't6', 't72', etc. So, the grammar's start symbol is S, which in the initial rule is S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the initial is S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which is a non-terminal producing two non-terminals. But then, some non-terminals like NT44, NT42, etc., produce terminal strings directly. So, for example, NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nSo, the approach is to see if the provided string can be derived by expanding the symbols according to the grammar's rules. The string has 12 tokens: t6, t72, t67, t90, t65, t65, t55, t72, t13, t69, t44, t28.\n\nI think the standard method is to use a top-down or bottom-up approach, but since the string is quite long, maybe I'll try a bottom-up approach, trying to parse the string by finding possible production rules that match consecutive parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a CFG in CNF, I can convert it into a Pratt parser or a recursive descent parser, but maybe simulating the parsing process would help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be efficient here, as it can parse strings in linear space and might be manageable for a string of this length.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps of the CYK algorithm for this grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to create a table where the rows represent the positions in the string, and the columns represent the length of the substring being considered. Then, for each cell, I'll check which non-terminals can derive that substring.\n\nBut with 12 tokens, this might get complicated, but perhaps I can proceed step by step.\n\nLet me first list the tokens and their positions:\n\n1. t6\n2. t72\n3. t67\n4. t90\n5. t65\n6. t65\n7. t55\n8. t72\n9. t13\n10. t69\n11. t44\n12. t28\n\nGiven that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so the top-level non-terminals are NT15 and NT43. Each of these can produce more non-terminals, and so on, until terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT13 \u2192 't39', etc. So, the idea is to see if the given string can be generated by following these production steps.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into possible sequences that match the production rules.\n\nThe string is: t6 t72 t67 t90 t65 t65 t55 t72 t13 t69 t44 t28\n\nLooking for immediate matches, perhaps the last token is t28. Let's see which non-terminals produce t28.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT28 appears in several productions. For example, NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23, NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT1, etc. Also, wait, I don't see a direct rule for NT28, but some rules have 't28' as production. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, from the given set, I don't see a rule where NT28 directly produces a terminal. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules: there's NT29 \u2192 't63', NT17 \u2192 't33', etc. Wait, I don't see t28 directly. Hmm, but looking in the provided rules, I see NT28 \u2192 't6', 't72', etc. Wait, no, actually, NT28 \u2192 't4' and 't17', but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me scan through the rules:\n\nLooking for 't28': In the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23, and NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT1, etc. But is there a rule where NT28 directly produces a terminal? Let me check the provided list again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any production for NT28 that leads to a terminal. Instead, most rules for NT28 derive further non-terminals. So, NT28 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal that must expand into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The tokens are in the order of terminal symbols, so each token is a terminal. To get the string, the non-terminals must expand into these terminals.\n\nSo, the last token is t28. Let me check which non-terminals expand into t28.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule where a non-terminal produces 't28'. Scanning down, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules...\n\nI see NT28 \u2192 't6' (multiple times), 't17', and also NT18 \u2192 't39', etc. Hmm, no, wait, perhaps I need to check all the rules more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note that most production rules are for non-terminals, and the terminals are those that appear directly in the productions without non-terminals on the right side.\n\nLooking back at the provided rules:\n\nThere are several non-terminals that may directly produce a terminal. For example:\n\nNT44 \u2192 t6\nNT42 \u2192 t5\nNT13 \u2192 t39\nNT21 \u2192 t13\nNT51 \u2192 t90\nNT9 \u2192 t28\nNT50 \u2192 t33\nNT8 \u2192 t40\nNT7 \u2192 t35\nNT29 \u2192 t63\nNT48 \u2192 t87\nNT1 \u2192 t24\nNT28 \u2192 t4\nNT17 \u2192 t33\nNT51 \u2192 t31\nNT5 \u2192 t7\nNT10 \u2192 t50\nNT36 \u2192 t84\nNT21 \u2192 t99\nNT45 \u2192 t11\nNT19 \u2192 t13\nNT37 \u2192 t12\nNT51 \u2192 t38\nNT6 \u2192 t16\nNT19 \u2192 t54\nNT31 \u2192 t91\nNT23 \u2192 t7\nNT16 \u2192 t3\n\nSo, some of these are terminals: for example, NT9 \u2192 t28, which is the last token in the string. So, the last symbol in the string is 't28', which is produced by NT9.\n\nSo, to have 't28' in the string, somewhere in the derivation, NT9 must be part of the expansion, and it must directly expand to t28.\n\nLooking back, in the string, the last three tokens are t69 t44 t28. The last token is t28, which is produced by NT9. Let's look at the previous token, t44. That would need to be generated by a non-terminal that expands into t44. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't44'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT44 \u2192 t6\n\nSo, wait, NT44 directly expands into t6, so if we have a production that leads to NT44, that can produce t6. But the string has t44 as a token, which is a terminal. So, where is t44 in the string? It's the 4th from the end, but in the string, it's position 9: t13 t69 t44 t28. Wait, no, the string is:\n\n1. t6\n2. t72\n3. t67\n4. t90\n5. t65\n6. t65\n7. t55\n8. t72\n9. t13\n10. t69\n11. t44\n12. t28\n\nSo, t44 is the 11th token. We need to see if that can come from a non-terminal. Looking at the rules, NT44 \u2192 t6, so where does t44 come from? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I'm confusing NT44 with another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again: NT44 is a non-terminal that directly expands to t6.

{"custom_id":"request-190","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string `t54 t33 t99 t99 t72 t36 t6 t90 t90 t3 t72 t84` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the terminals. That simplifies the analysis because each production step involves replacing a single non-terminal with two others. This structure will help me build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which directly produces NT15 and NT43. So the string should start with a production involving NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the target string, it starts with `t54 t33 t99 t99 t72 t36 t6 t90 t90 t3 t72 t84`. Since the first symbol is `t54`, I need to see if any of the non-terminals produce `t54`. From the grammar, NT19 produces `t54` (as per the rule NT19 -> t54), and NT31 also produces `t7` via a different production, but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo, starting with S, the first step is:\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nNow, NT15 and NT43 must produce the first two parts of the string. Let's see what NT15 and NT43 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT15, the rule is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That's recursive, so it's producing NT37 followed by another NT15. But NT37 has other rules. Wait, actually, looking back, the rule for NT15 is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Hmm, that seems like it can expand indefinitely. But wait, in the provided grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That suggests NT15 is a repeated pattern. But I'm not sure how that affects the terminal symbols.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t54, which is in NT19. So perhaps the NT15 part doesn't immediately lead to t54? Maybe I got that wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial S produces NT15 and NT43. So the first symbol would come from NT15, but NT15's production doesn't directly produce t-something. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT15's production is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which seems like it only produces non-terminals. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for example, the rule NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which would mean that NT15 can only expand into other non-terminals, so it can't produce a terminal directly. But in the string, the first symbol is t54. Therefore, the initial S must produce something that starts with t54, which means either NT15 or NT43 must produce t54.\n\nBut looking at the NT rules, let's check what can lead to t54. The rules that produce terminals are all the NTs ending with 't' followed by a number. For example, NT19 \u2192 t54, NT27 \u2192 t7, and others.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So NT15's productions are all non-terminals, which means NT15 can't produce a terminal like t54. So that's a problem. Because the first symbol in the string is t54, which must come from either NT15 or NT43.\n\nBut NT15 only produces non-terminals, so the first part would have to come from NT43. Let me check what NT43 produces. Looking at the rules, NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0. So NT43 can't produce a terminal directly either. Wait, but in the string, the second symbol is t33. Let's check NT43's first part.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0. Now, NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17. NT8 \u2192 NT46 NT17. Hmm, this seems a bit deep. Let me try to see if any of these can lead to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should start from the string and work backwards, trying to find which NTs can produce the given terminals.\n\nThe string is: t54 t33 t99 t99 t72 t36 t6 t90 t90 t3 t72 t84.\n\nLet's split this into pairs as they would come from the non-terminals produced by S. So each non-terminal (like NT15 and NT43) will produce pairs of symbols.\n\nBut first, looking at the first symbol t54. The only NT that directly produces t54 is NT19 \u2192 t54.\n\nSo the first NT must be NT19, producing t54, and then another symbol. But wait, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so the initial split is into NT15 and NT43. Therefore, the entire string must be generated from NT15 and NT43 somehow.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting somewhere. Let me try to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nThe entire string is 12 symbols long, so when split into two parts by S's production, each part would be 6 symbols each, right? Because NT15 and NT43 each produce two symbols per step, and it's a binary tree.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production produces exactly two non-terminals, so each symbol in the input string must correspond to a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the entire string should be derived from the initial S by expanding each non-terminal step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo the entire string is a sequence of terminals, each produced by some NT. Each NT production in the grammar ends in a terminal, so we can see where the t's come from.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, many NTs produce other NTs directly or through other productions. For example, NT20 \u2192 NT30 NT24, and NT24 can produce other NTs until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me try to map the string to the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t54 t33 t99 t99 t72 t36 t6 t90 t90 t3 t72 t84.\n\nThat's 12 symbols. Since S \u2192 NT15 NT43, each of these must produce 6 symbols each. So the first NT15 produces 6 symbols, and NT43 produces the other 6.\n\nLet me take the first six symbols: t54 t33 t99 t99 t72 t36.\n\nThe second six symbols: t6 t90 t90 t3 t72 t84.\n\nI need to see if NT15 can produce the first six symbols and NT43 can produce the second six.\n\nStarting with NT54. Wait, no, NT15 is the first non-terminal. Wait, no, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So NT15 is the first non-terminal to expand, producing symbols in the order t54, t33, etc., but let's see.\n\nWait, no. Each production of NT15 breaks down into more NTs, so I need to see if the entire sequence of terminals can be derived from NT15 and NT43.\n\nLet me start with NT15. The production for NT15 is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Hmm, that seems recursive. Wait, that can't be right because then it can't produce any terminals unless it's directly producing a terminal, which it's not. Wait, no, looking again, the production for NT15 is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So that's a recursive production. That would mean NT15 can only produce more NT37 and another NT15, but that doesn't help in producing a terminal.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in looking up the productions. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT15 can only produce sequences that start with NT37, followed by NT15, which itself can do the same. So that would mean NT15 can only generate strings of NT37s. But it can't produce a terminal t54 unless NT37 can produce t54, which it doesn't. Because looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t54 except NT19.\n\nTherefore, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Let's check NT43. NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0. So NT43's first symbol comes from NT27. Let's look at NT27. NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17.\n\nNT27's production is NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17.

{"custom_id":"request-212","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string we're checking.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's good because it makes parsing easier, possibly using methods like CYK or recursive descent.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The first production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the entire string should start with NT15 and NT43, each producing sequences of terminals.\n\nThe given string is: t33 t44 t16 t11 t91 t69 t33 t72 t67 t91 t91 t41 t69.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar uses several non-terminals and some terminals. My goal is to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first part of the string should match NT15 and NT43. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t33 and t44. So does NT15 produce t33 followed by t44? Let's check the grammar for NT15.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 | NT19 NT30.\n\nHmm, those look like long productions. Let me see NT37 and NT19.\n\nLooking at NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So NT37 is essentially NT19 twice. And NT19 has two options: NT12 NT38 or NT51 NT19.\n\nWait, this might be getting complicated. Maybe I should use a table-driven parser or something, but I'm doing it manually here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to match the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can construct a parse tree. Let's see:\n\nThe entire string is: t33 t44 t16 t11 t91 t69 t33 t72 t67 t91 t91 t41 t69.\n\nFirst, the start is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string must start with NT15 and end with NT43. So the start is t33 t44... Wait, t33 is the first terminal. So NT15 must produce a string that starts with t33 t44, and NT43 must produce the rest.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 | NT19 NT30.\n\nBut in the string, after t33 comes t44. Let's see what NT15 can produce. Let me see if NT37 can give t44.\n\nLooking at NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. Each NT19 is NT12 NT38 or NT51 NT19. Let's see NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10. NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. And NT43 is in the initial productions as S's, but let's check NT50: NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43.\n\nWait, NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, which is S. So if NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, then NT50 is S. But S is at the beginning; perhaps this leads to a recursive loop.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe I should look for the entire string in terms of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, after t33 is t44, which is t44. Let me check which NT productions could lead to t33 and t44. Looking at NT37, which is NT19 NT19, so each NT19 might produce t37 and t19, but in the string, we have t33 and t44. Let me check the grammar:\n\nWait, looking at NT37 in the grammar: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So NT19 must produce two sequences. The NT19 productions are NT12 NT38 or NT51 NT19.\n\nLet's see NT12 production: NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10. NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. NT43 is S's production, so S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nWait, but NT43 is a production. If NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, then NT50 is S. So S would be at the beginning, but that's a problem because S is the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong chain.\n\nWait, let's check NT37 again. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, so each NT19 must produce a terminal. But looking down, I see NT19 has productions like NT51 NT19, which suggests that NT19 could produce a sequence of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long for some non-terminals or not matching correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string doesn't have S's in the correct places.\n\nWait, let me take another approach. Let's see if each token is reachable from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at NT15, which is part of S's production, we have NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 and NT19 NT30.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, so each step would require certain tokens.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first two tokens are t33 and t44. Let's see if any NT can produce t33.\n\nLooking through the grammar terminals, I see that several non-terminals end with t. Let's see NT10: NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, and NT50 \u2192 't44', which is t44 (as per the grammar; line 10: NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. Wait, looking again, line 10 is 'NT50 -> NT41 NT43' which is S? Wait, no: line 10 shows 'NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43' which is the production for S, the start symbol.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because in line 10, it's 'NT50 -> NT41 NT43', which is the production for S: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Maybe that line is meant to represent that. So line 10 might be an older version or a mistake, because NT50 is defined elsewhere as 't41'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT44 -> 't6'\n\nNT42 -> 't5'\n\nNT13 -> 't39'\n\nNT28 -> 't67'\n\nNT0 -> 't39'\n\nNT40 -> 't65'\n\nNT46 -> 't72'\n\nNT32 -> 't83'\n\nNT24 -> 't18'\n\nNT24 -> 't55'\n\nNT5 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't48'\n\nNT29 -> 't63'\n\nNT4 -> 't88'\n\nNT9 -> 't28'\n\nNT50 -> 't33'\n\nWait, OK, so for example, NT32 \u2192 't83' which is a terminal. Similarly, NT46 \u2192 't72', etc.\n\nLooking at line 10: NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, which are S's children, so that's the production for S. But there's also an earlier line: NT50 -> 't33', which is one of the non-terminals? No, wait, NT50 is a non-terminal, and its productions are lines 10 and 9, but line 10 is 't33', so that can't be. Wait, looking back, perhaps I misread the grammar rules.\n\nWait, the grammar as given seems to have multiple entries for the same non-terminal. For example, NT50 appears multiple times with different productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\n- Line 10: NT50 -> NT41 NT43\n\n- Line 15: NT50 -> NT15 NT20\n\nWait, this would mean NT50 has two productions.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have two types of productions: A \u2192 BC and S \u2192 \u03b5. However, looking at the given grammar, it seems a bit more complex. Each production seems to have two non-terminals on the right-hand side (e.g., S \u2192 NT15 NT43). Wait, but some productions have more than two symbols on the right? No, looking again, it seems every production is of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, so two non-terminals per production. That aligns with CNF.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string. Since it's a series of tokens (t99, t39, etc.), I assume each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string starts with t99. I look through the grammar to find any production that produces t99. Scanning the right-hand sides of all productions, I see a production NT23 \u2192 NT50 NT30. Wait, but NT21 is another possibility. Let me check: NT19 \u2192 NT13 NT45, but NT21 isn't directly producing t99. Looking again, I notice NT49 \u2192 NT47 NT27, and I see NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT26, NT24\u2192... Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me look for 't99' in the production rules. Oh, wait, the productions are all non-terminals on the right side except for the 't' terms. The right-hand side of all productions except some look like NT productions, while others have 't' terms like NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. Wait, no, wait. Looking at the end of the grammar, I see several 't' terms as terminals. For example, NT47 \u2192 't6', NT15 \u2192 't39', NT37 \u2192 't12', etc.\n\nWait, but 't99' is the first token. So I need to find a production that leads to 't99'. Looking through the right-hand sides, I don't immediately see any production that produces 't99'. Let me go through the right-hand sides of all productions to check if any produce 't99'.\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar, I see that some NT productions go to 't' terms, but 't99' doesn't seem to be one. For example, NT21 \u2192 't99', but no, looking again, I see NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10, which is two NT rules. Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nWait, here's a production: NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10. And NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. NT50 is another non-terminal. So, perhaps NT21 could eventually produce two 't' terms, but not a 't99'.\n\nWait, earlier I saw a production NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10. NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. But I also see that NT10 is defined as NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. Then, NT50 \u2192 NT50 NT33? Or wait, checking the grammar again:\n\nWait, looking at the end of the grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT13 \u2192 't39', etc. But specifically, looking for 't99':\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me scan the grammar again for any 't99' token.\n\nLooking through, I see NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT26. So, that's two non-terminals. Then, NT5 is defined as \u2192 't2' (from NT5 \u2192 't2'). NT26 \u2192 't12'. So, that would produce 't2 t12', which is 't2 t12', not 't99'.\n\nAnother possibility: looking for a production that produces 't99'. Let's check each production's right-hand side:\n\nIs there any production where on the right-hand side is 't99' as a terminal?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any terminal 't99' except as a part of larger productions. Wait, perhaps in another part. Let me check:\n\nLooking through, I see NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT26. NT5 \u2192 't2', NT26 \u2192 't12' as above. So that's 't2 t12', which gives 't2 t12' which is 't2 t12', which is 't2 t12'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with 't99', which would need to come from an NT production that directly produces 't99', but I don't see that.\n\nWait, looking at the first production: S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and each NT is a non-terminal.\n\nThen, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15.\n\nWait, but NT15 also has another production: NT15 \u2192 NT0 NT20.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 can go to NT27 NT0 or to NT6 NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building a parse tree.\n\nBut given the time, maybe I should try to see if the string can derive from the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t99 t39 t91 t11 t37 t90 t16 t90 t83 t37 t33 t88 t33.\n\nBreaking it down, it's 13 tokens. Let's see how that could be structured.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which are both non-terminals. So the string starts with t99. Let's see what could be NT15 and NT43.\n\nNT15 can be NT37 NT15 or NT0 NT20. Likewise, NT43 can be NT27 NT0 or NT6 NT1.\n\nBut the string starts with t99, so maybe NT15 produces something that can start with 't99'.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10. Then, NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30.\n\nWait, NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. Then, NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31, and NT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35. NT35 has productions like \u2192 NT37 NT37, etc.\n\nBut perhaps that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, let's try to see if any NT production directly generates a 't' token. So, looking at the given grammar, several NTs have productions that go to 't' terms:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 't'...\n\nI see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't41 NT32' \u2013 no, that's a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the grammar:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT21 could \u2192 't99'? Wait, no, NT21 is defined as NT10 NT10, and NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking through, the end of the production for NT23 is NT5 NT26, and NT5 \u2192 't2', NT26 \u2192 't12'.\n\nSo NT23 \u2192 't22 t12'?\n\nWait, no, that's NT5 \u2192 't2', and NT26 \u2192 't12' as per their productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the 't' productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, several have 't' as a terminal.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't39'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't99' (Wait, does NT21 have a production that produces 't99'? Or 't99' is an NT? Let me check.)\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, the right-hand sides include:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n\nBut the production for NT21 is NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10.\n\nSo NT21 does not produce 't99' directly; it produces non-terminals. Therefore, maybe 't99' comes from another NT that eventually produces 't99'.\n\nLooking further, perhaps NT21 is not the one.

{"custom_id":"request-229","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string to check is `t4 t65 t6 t33 t83 t87 t2 t83 t84 t72 t28 t36 t18 t41`. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol. So, every step in the derivation will involve replacing a single non-terminal with two non-terminals until we reach the terminals, which in this case seem to be the 't' followed by numbers, like `t4`, `t65`, etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the grammar starts with S -> NT15 NT43. This seems like the initial expansion. So, S will expand into NT15 and NT43, each of which will further expand based on their own production rules.\n\nI'll need to see if the given string can be derived through a series of such expansions, ensuring that each step correctly replaces the non-terminals with the appropriate terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, many of the NT symbols eventually map to terminal tokens like 't' followed by a number. For example, NT9 -> NT52 NT4, and NT4 -> 't48', so combining those, NT9 would produce `t48 t52`. Wait, that might give a string like 't48t52' if both NT4 and NT52 expand to those terms, but actually, each NT production must be expanded until they become terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the string provided, all the elements are separate terms: t4, t65, etc. So each of these must be the result of terminal productions.\n\nI think a good approach is to work backwards from the string and see if each terminal can be matched by the grammar. Alternatively, maybe I can see if the entire string can be constructed by expanding S according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, it should generate a context-free language, and all the symbols on the right-hand side are non-terminals except for the start symbol. So each production results in exactly one symbol at each step.\n\nWait, let me look again at the string. It's a sequence of terminals: t4, t65, t6, etc. Each of these must stem from some non-terminal that eventually expands into them.\n\nLooking at the production rules, many NT symbols end up directly producing terminals. For example, NT4 -> 't48', NT5 -> 't2', etc. So, to get a terminal string, the grammar would have a path from S to each terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given string, each 't' is followed by a number, like t4, t65, etc. I'm trying to see if each of these can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLet me check if each of these 't{n}' exist in the grammar. For example:\n\n- t4: Looking through the rules, NT48 -> 't44' and NT4 -> 't48', so combining these, t44 comes from NT48, which comes from NT4, which comes from NT4's production. So t44 is from NT4 -> 't48' and NT48 -> 't44', which creates a t44 in the string.\n\nBut in the string, I have a t4, which is different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check: looking at the grammar, I see NT4 -> 't48', and NT48 -> 't44', so combining those, NT4 produces 't48 t44'? Or maybe I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, actually, each production is a rule that replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, for example, S -> NT15 NT43 means that S can become NT15 and NT43. Then each of these can be broken down further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nLet's try to start expanding S:\n\n1. S -> NT15 NT43\n   So, S expands into two parts: NT15 and NT43.\n\n2. Now, we need to expand each of these:\n\n   NT15: Looking at the rules, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So, this is recursive. It can expand as long as possible.\n\n   Similarly, NT43 has a production: NT43 -> NT27 NT0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe instead of trying to expand S all the way, I should see if each symbol in the string can be matched by some terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, the string is t4 t65 t6 t33 t83 t87 t2 t83 t84 t72 t28 t36 t18 t41.\n\nLooking at each symbol:\n\n- t4: Is there any NT symbol that ends up as 't4'? Looking through the rules, perhaps yes. Let's see:\n\n   NT4 -> 't48', so to get 't4', maybe through a path from another NT to NT4, then to t48, but that's 't48', not 't4'. Wait, where else do I see 't4'? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me look at the possible starting points.\n\nThe string starts with t4, which is a single symbol. In the grammar, the only way to get a single terminal symbol is if some NT directly maps to it. Let's check the NT rules to see if any rule ends in 't4'.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT4 -> 't48'\n- NT2 -> 't41'\n- NT52 -> 't6' (Wait, no, looking at the rules, it's `NT52 -> 't6' NT25`). So NT52 expands into two symbols: 't6' and NT25. Similarly, other NTs may expand into terminals.\n\nWait, let me correct that:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that NT52 -> 't6' NT25, implying NT52 becomes 't6' and NT25. So if a production ends in NT52, we get 't6' followed by what NT25 can produce.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 -> NT52 NT4, so that would make 't6' followed by NT25 and 't48' (since NT4 is 't48').\n\nBut in the string, I don't see any 't6' except as part of 't65', 't6'. Let's check for 't65'.\n\nLooking for 't65' in the grammar. Where does that come from? Is there any NT that directly expands to 't65'? Looking at the rules, I don't recall any NT ending with 't65'. So maybe 't65' is part of another NT expansion.\n\nWait, looking more closely, I notice that some NT rules produce two terminals. For example, NT10 -> NT50 NT30, and then NT50 and NT30 each have their own expansions. Let me see:\n\nNT50 -> NT41 NT43, so NT50 expands into two more non-terminals. Similarly, NT30 expands into NT32 NT8, which further expand.\n\nThis might take some time, but perhaps the string can be constructed by expanding certain paths.\n\nBut considering time constraints, maybe a better approach is to see if the length of the string corresponds to possible derivations.\n\nThe string has 14 symbols. Since each production step doubles the number of symbols (from one non-terminal to two), the number of symbols can only increase as powers of two. So starting from S, we'd have two symbols, then four, eight, sixteen, etc. But 14 is not a power of two, so it's not possible. Wait, that can't be right because you can have derivations where some productions result in more than two symbols, but in CNF, each step produces exactly two symbols. So the total number of symbols would be 2^n, where n is the number of production steps. So for example:\n\nStep 1: S -> NT15 NT43 \u2192 2 symbols\nStep 2: Each of NT15 and NT43 \u2192 2 each \u2192 total 4 symbols. But wait, in the first expansion, both NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals, so each would produce more symbols. It's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of symbols is 2^n, but the initial expansion is S being two symbols, each expansion increases the count as each symbol is replaced by two. So starting from 1 (S), then 2, then 4, 8, etc. So the number of symbols must be a power of two. But 14 is not a power of two; next is 16. So if the string is 14, it's invalid because the number of symbols must be a power of two.\n\nWait, but is that accurate?

{"custom_id":"request-234","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's in the language defined by the grammar. Hmm, okay, I need to determine whether the string `t90 t3 t44 t72 t44 t67 t67 t12 t7 t67 t69 t83 t16 t16` is generated by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That might help in parsing, but I'm not entirely sure yet.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's all in CNF because each production either has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. Okay, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, the string we're checking consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. Each token in the string seems to represent a terminal, so maybe each 'tX' is a terminal symbol. Let's list them out: t90, t3, t44, t72, t44, t67, t67, t12, t7, t67, t69, t83, t16, t16. So, 14 tokens in total.\n\nI think the approach here is to reverse-engineer the string and see if the grammar can produce it. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, we need to see if there's a derivation from the start symbol S to this string. Given that the grammar is in CNF, perhaps we can use a recursive descent or bottom-up parsing approach, but that's getting a bit complex.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a small grammar, maybe I can build a parse tree or look for patterns. Let me check if any of the production rules generate the entire string step by step.\n\nLooking at the initial production: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the top-level nodes in the parse tree would be NT15 and NT43. Each of these can be expanded further.\n\nLet's see NT15: The rule is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's a recursive rule. Or is it? Wait, looking back, I see in the grammar provided: there's NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So that's a left-recursive rule. Maybe we can eliminate left recursion by rewriting it. But hold on, in CNF, left recursion is not allowed because each production must have two non-terminals on the right. Wait, actually, the original CNF requires that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So if a production has A \u2192 AB, that's not in CNF. Therefore, in the provided grammar, perhaps some rules like NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 are not in CNF because they have recursion?\n\nWait, no, wait. In the initial list, the grammar is presented in CNF. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, looking back: the first production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. That's fine. Next, NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32. Also fine. Then, looking further, I see NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Oh, that's a left-recursive production. But wait, in standard CNF, left recursion isn't allowed because A \u2192 A B would require the production to have a non-terminal on the left. So I must have made a mistake here because the grammar is supposed to be in CNF. Maybe I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The first production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Then, looking for NT15: according to the grammar provided, there's a production NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, meaning A \u2192 BC where A is NT15, B is NT37, and C is NT15. So that's allowed in CNF, because it's two non-terminals on the right. So it's not left-recursive in the sense of A \u2192 A B because the A is followed by B, not A itself. Wait, no, the production is A \u2192 B A, which would be left-recursive. So, I think this might be a case where the grammar includes left recursion, which is handled using the left recursion elimination technique before applying the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsing.\n\nBut in this case, since the problem allows any reasoning strategy, I can proceed by looking for the string in the grammar's terminals.\n\nEach token is a terminal, except for the NTs. So to generate the string t90 t3 t44 t72 t44 t67 t67 t12 t7 t67 t69 t83 t16 t16, the derivation must start from S and replace the symbols step by step.\n\nLet's start by considering the start symbol S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the parse tree must eventually produce these two NTs.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first symbols are t90, t3, t44, t72, etc. Let's see if any NTs can generate parts of this string.\n\nLooking at NT15: One production is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (left-recursive), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, are there other productions for NT15? Wait, in the grammar, the only production for NT15 is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which is the left-recursive rule. So perhaps that one is the only way, meaning NT15 is generating an infinite loop, which would not help.\n\nWait, but in the initial grammar, perhaps the other NTs have productions that can generate t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, in the provided grammar, some rules may have non-terminals and terminals. For example, looking at NT43's production: NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0. And NT0 has a production NT0 \u2192 NT52 NT20, which then goes further.\n\nBut I think perhaps it's easier to approach this by constructing a parse tree from the string, trying to see if each terminal matches the rules.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming since the string is 14 symbols long, and each step involves replacing non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So for the string, it's a series of terminals, so perhaps each can be matched by a production that directly produces a terminal, or through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is a concatenation of terminals, so the derivation must start with S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and then each of these NTs must generate sequences that match the string.\n\nSo, the string is of even length, but perhaps that's coincidental.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string into possible chunks that match each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the first symbol in the string, t90, and see if any rule produces t90. Looking through the grammar rules for terminals, I see NT90 is not present, but specific tokens like NT10, NT12, etc., might produce certain terminals.\n\nWait, let's look for where each 't' token is generated. For example, the string starts with t90. So t90 must come from some NT \u2192 't90' rule. Looking through the grammar, let's see if any NT production ends with a terminal, or can be derived to t90.\n\nLooking through the production rules for non-terminals ending in 't':\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4 \u2192 ... eventually, perhaps leads to 't48' or 't4', but not t90.\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT48 \u2192 t18 or t24. Not t90.\n\nWait, maybe in NT52, there is NT52 \u2192 't44', right? Looking back, the rule NT52 \u2192 't44' is present. So NT52 (which could have been generated by a rule) can produce t44.\n\nWait, but how does t90 get generated? Let's look at the production rules for NT10: NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. So, from NT10, we produce NT50 and NT30.\n\nLooking at NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32. So NT50 starts production as two non-terminals, leading to t's?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to traverse the string step by step, seeing if each step can be produced by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to note that the only way to produce t90 is through some path in the grammar.\n\nBut looking through the provided rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t90. The only 't' terminals are like t4, t5, t7, etc., but I don't see t90 being generated directly or indirectly.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a production. Looking back, NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32, and NT1 has a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-254","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t5 t16 t48 t88 t44 t4 t33 t13 t55 t48 t24 t18 t36 t36 t11`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the approach I should take. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is exactly two non-terminals. That helps because the parsing can be done using a method like CYK, which iteratively checks all possible ways a part of the string can be derived from non-terminals. However, since the string is made up of terminals already, I might need to parse it to see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nBut let me first look at the grammar provided. It's quite extensive, with multiple productions. I notice that many non-terminals eventually lead to terminals, which are mostly 't' followed by numbers. For instance, NT9 -> 't28', NT28 -> 't4', etc. \n\nSo, I need to see if the provided string can be broken down using the non-terminals' productions. Each production in the grammar is of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal. So, every step of the derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols, which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string given is a series of terminals: `t5 t16 t48 t88 t44 t4 t33 t13 t55 t48 t24 t18 t36 t36 t11`.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string. Since CNF uses productions that split into two non-terminals, I should look for possible pairs that can produce the string.\n\nLet's start by looking for the longest possible matches. The string starts with `t5`. I can check which non-terminals produce 't5'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT4 -> 't48', but that's a single terminal, not 't5'. Similarly, NT5 -> 't2', which isn't 't5'. Wait, perhaps I'm looking wrong. Oh, I notice that some non-terminals like NT5: it's part of production rules like NT52 -> 't6' and NT4 -> 't48'. Wait, maybe I should list all terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I realize that many non-terminals directly produce a single terminal. For example:\n\nNT9 -> 't28'\n\nNT4 -> 't48'\n\nNT24 -> 't18'\n\nNT28 -> 't4'\n\nNT13 -> 't69'\n\nNT5 -> 't7'\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5. So I need a way to produce 't5'. Looking through all the terminal productions, I see:\n\nNT28 -> 't67'\n\nNT4 -> 't48'\n\nLooking again, I notice NT25 -> NT13 NT47. And NT13 -> 't69'. So NT13 is terminal. Similarly, NT47 -> NT6 NT16. NT6 is not terminal, but NT6 -> 't16', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct the parse tree step by step. Let's see.\n\nThe string length is 15 tokens, so the parse tree would have a depth equal to the log2 of the length, but since each step splits into two, the total number of steps would be such that 2^n is around the string length. Alternatively, the number of non-terminals would need to produce the string.\n\nGiven the string is a sequence of terminals, each step should be a production that ends with a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string starting from the start symbol S and working our way through the productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo the top-level structure is S splitting into NT15 and NT43. So the string should be the concatenation of what NT15 produces and NT43 produces.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two parts: The first part should be what NT15 can produce, and the second part what NT43 can produce. The string is `t5 t16 t48 t88 t44 t4 t33 t13 t55 t48 t24 t18 t36 t36 t11`.\n\nI need to see if the first part (let's call it part A) and the second part (part B) can be produced by NT15 and NT43 respectively, or if there are other ways.\n\nBut the problem is that NT15 and NT43 might not directly produce a terminal. Let's check the productions for NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking up the grammar: NT15 -> NT37 NT15 and also NT15 -> NT30 NT20.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, I think I saw NT15-> NT37 NT15 and NT0 -> NT30 NT20. Wait, actually, looking back:\n\nIn the user's grammar input, I see:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nAlso, later:\n\nNT15 -> NT30 NT20\n\nSo, NT15 can produce two non-terminals. So, it's not a terminal. So, that complicates things because S is NT15 NT43, which are both non-terminals. Therefore, the initial step is S -> NT15 NT43, and both NT15 and NT43 need to be expanded into terminals or other non-terminals, ultimately leading to the string.\n\nWait, maybe there's an issue here. If S splits into two non-terminals, then each of those would need to produce sequences that together form the entire string of terminals.\n\nSo, the string is a single sequence of terminals, so perhaps the parsing requires that either both NT15 and NT43 produce a single terminal each, but that seems unlikely because in the grammar, NT15 and NT43 both have productions that break them down further.\n\nWait, but maybe the productions can combine to produce a single terminal. Wait, but in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so it's not possible for a non-terminal to produce a single terminal directly except through their initial productions, but in this case, NT15 and NT43 don't produce terminals.\n\nWait, let me check: Is there any non-terminal that produces a terminal besides the ones that directly map to 't' sequences?\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT5 -> 't7' \u2192 so NT5 produces a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 -> 't48'\n\nNT28 -> 't4'\n\nNT24 -> 't18'\n\nNT24 -> 't55' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT24 -> NT48 NT35 and another production NT24 -> NT55 NT5. Wait, maybe I'm not reading it correctly.\n\nWait, looking again: the user's grammar has lines like:\n\nNT24 -> NT48 NT35\n\nand \n\nNT24 -> NT55 NT5\n\nWait, that seems off. But perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the initial list of grammar rules provided by the user is extensive, so perhaps it's more accurate to see that many non-terminals directly produce a terminal like NT4->'t48', NT5->'t2', etc.\n\nWait, but in the string given, the first token is 't5'. I need to see if any non-terminal produces 't5'. Looking through, I don't see NT5 producing 't5' directly. Instead, NT5->'t2', so that doesn't help.\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar again carefully.\n\nHere's a list of terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't48'\n\nNT5 -> 't2'\n\nNT9 -> 't28'\n\nNT50 -> 't33'\n\nNT15 -> 't69' (no, wait, no, it's NT15-> NT37 NT15)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

The end-of-string marker is usually denoted by S or something else, but here it's probably the empty string, represented implicitly by the terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, all the productions are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side (like NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15) or a terminal followed by a non-terminal (like NT44 \u2192 't6'). Some are just terminals, like NT24 \u2192 't5'. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals: t12, t18, t65, t24, t44, t38, t39, t31, t88, t28, t48, t90, t72, t3, t28. \n\nI should check if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. The derivation for a string in CNF will have a length that is 2^n -1 for a string of length n, but with n=15, that would mean a very long derivation. But perhaps I can work backwards by building a parse tree.\n\nI can try to parse the string top-down or use the Earley algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to find a possible parse tree.\n\nLet's list the string's tokens in order: t12, t18, t65, t24, t44, t38, t39, t31, t88, t28, t48, t90, t72, t3, t28.\n\nSince the start symbol is S, and the first production for S is NT15 NT15, but wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the start symbol is likely S or another non-terminal. Wait, in the grammar provided, the first production is S \u2192 NT15 NT15? No, wait, it's S \u2192 NT15 NT15? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nS -> NT15 NT15\n\nSo the start symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT15. Each NT is a non-terminal.\n\nSo to derive the string, the initial expansion would involve NT15 on both sides. So the entire string must be structured in a way that it can be broken down into pairs of NT15's and so on.\n\nBut this might get too complex. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if each terminal in the string is derived by a production rule. Since in CNF, each production is of the form NT \u2192 a or NT \u2192 NT NT.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT44 \u2192 't6' is a production, as is NT24 \u2192 't5', etc. So any terminal in the string must be derived by such a production. Let's check each terminal:\n\nLooking at the string: t12, t18, t65, t24, t44, t38, t39, t31, t88, t28, t48, t90, t72, t3, t28.\n\nI need to find for each of these terminals what production rule exists.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- t12: I don't see a production where NT \u2192 t12. Hmm. Maybe it's derived through a series of steps. Let's check the rule for NT28: NT28 \u2192 't12' is under option 't12'? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT28 is listed twice: once as NT28 \u2192 't26' and 't23'), and another time as NT28 \u2192 't67' and 't26'), etc. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, entries starting with NT28 are:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't67' and 't26'\n- NT28 \u2192 't26' and 't23'\n- NT28 \u2192 't20' and 't1'\n- NT28 \u2192 't99' and 't13'\n- NT28 \u2192 't4' and 't6')\nWait, no, wait:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see for NT28:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't26', 't23'\n- NT28 \u2192 't20', 't1'\n- NT28 \u2192 't99', 't13'\n- NT28 \u2192 't4', 't6'\n- Also, for example, NT44 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Each line is a production, so for example, the line \"NT28 \u2192 't67' and 't26'\" is one production, \"NT28 \u2192 't26' and 't23'\" is another, etc. \n\nWait, but for each NT28, the possible terminals it can produce are 't67', 't26', 't4', 't6', etc. Wait, but I'm looking for 't12' in the string. Is there a production where NT produces 't12'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, let me see. For example:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't33'\n- NT12 \u2192 't16'\n- NT51 \u2192 't90'\n- NT48 \u2192 't87'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT15 \u2192 't37' and 't15'\nWait, no, the grammar is a bit tangled. Let me try to find each terminal in the string and see if they have a production.\n\nSo for 't12', I need to find a production where NT \u2192 t12. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT24 \u2192 't5'\n- NT28 \u2192 't12' is in one of its productions? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nYes, here's one:\n\n\"NT28 \u2192 't67' and 't26'\"\n\nAnother:\n\n\"NT28 \u2192 't26' and 't23'\"\n\nWait, no, no NT28 \u2192 't12'. Checking further down:\n\nLooking through all the NT productions for terminals:\n\nLooking, perhaps in NT21: 't13'\n\nWait, I don't see any production where NT \u2192 't12'. Hmm, that's a problem because if 't12' can't be produced by any NT, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me re-examine the given grammar.\n\nLooking again, search for terminals:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 't12'\n- NT31 \u2192 't91'\n- NT28 \u2192 't99' and 't13'\n- NT51 \u2192 't90'\n- NT28 \u2192 't4' and 't6'\nWait, wait, I think I see one. Let me look through all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking for 't12' in the grammar:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNo, in the given grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't12'. The line \"NT28 \u2192 't67' and 't26'\" is one production; another is \"NT28 \u2192 't26' and 't23'\". Then \"NT28 \u2192 't20' and 't1'\", etc. But I don't see 't12'.\n\nWait, let me check the entire grammar for any production that results in 't12':\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n\"NT13 \u2192 't39'\"\n\n\"NT28 \u2192 't12' and something else?\"\n\nWait, no. Wait, the line says \"NT28 \u2192 't67' and 't26'\", so NT28 is producing 't67' and 't26'. Similarly, another line says \"NT28 \u2192 't26' and 't23'\". Another line \"NT28 \u2192 't20' and 't1'\". Another \"NT28 \u2192 't99' and 't13'\". And another \"NT28 \u2192 't4' and 't6'\". \n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nLine: NT28 \u2192 't67', 't26'\n\nLine: NT28 \u2192 't26', 't23'\n\nLine: NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-274","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t3 t41 t55 t67 t41 t3 t38 t11 t72 t2 t36 t11 t38 t41`. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) consist of variables (non-terminals) and terminals. In this case, the terminals seem to be all the words starting with 't' like t3, t41, etc., which I guess represent some kind of token or symbol in the language.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each non-terminal can generate two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nMy task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to find a derivation path that consumes all these terminals in the correct order.\n\nLet me look for the start symbol. In Chomsky normal form, the start symbol usually only appears on the left-hand side of a production. Looking at the rules, S appears as `S \u2192 NT15 NT43`. So S is the starting non-terminal, and it produces two other non-terminals, NT15 and NT43. These non-terminals will need to be expanded until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me write down the string for clarity: `t3 t41 t55 t67 t41 t3 t38 t11 t72 t2 t36 t11 t38 t41`.\n\nThat's 14 terminals. I need to see how these can be generated from S.\n\nStarting with S:\n1. S \u2192 NT15 NT43\nSo, S expands into NT15 and NT43. Now, I need to see how NT15 and NT43 can be expanded into the given terminals.\n\nLooking at NT15: `NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15`. Hmm, that's a recursive production. NT15 can produce another NT37 and itself. That seems tricky because it might lead to an infinite loop. But in practice, in the expansion, NT15 would generate a sequence of NT37 and NT15 until it hits a production that doesn't contain NT15 anymore. Wait, looking deeper, NT15's only production is NT37 NT15, which suggests it might be stuck unless it triggers a different path. Maybe this is a dead end?\n\nMoving on to NT43: `NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0`. So NT43 can generate NT27 and NT0.\n\nI need to check the productions for NT27 and NT0.\n\nLooking at NT27: `NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17`. So it's another binary production.\n\nNT0: `NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20`. So NT0 can be expanded into NT30 and NT20.\n\nNow, looking at NT30: `NT30 \u2192 NT24 NT44`. Hmm, 24 and 44.\n\nNT24: `NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT48` (Wait, but looking again, it's actually `NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35` in one rule. Wait, I need to make sure I have the correct productions. Let me scan the rules for NT24.\n\nAh, yes, NT24 has multiple productions: `NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT48` (maybe it's a typo, probably `NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT44` or something else. Wait, in the provided rules, NT24 is `NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35`, `NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT44`, and `NT24 \u2192 NT24 NT5` \u2014 so there are a few possibilities.\n\nWait, looking again: The rules for NT24 include `NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35`, `NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT44`, and `NT24 \u2192 NT24 NT5`. So multiple options. Hmm.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. Maybe it's better to construct a parse tree or try to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to work backwards from the string. Let me look for any possible splits in the string into two parts that can correspond to the left-hand side of a production.\n\nThe string is: t3 t41 t55 t67 t41 t3 t38 t11 t72 t2 t36 t11 t38 t41\n\nI need to see if this can be split into two sequences, each of which is a derived string from some non-terminals.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can see which terminals the non-terminals can produce.\n\nFor example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which eventually might terminate if NT37 has a production that doesn\u2019t include anything else. Let's look at NT37.\n\nNT37: `NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19` and another production `NT37 \u2192 NT38 NT45`.\n\nWait, `NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19` and `NT37 \u2192 NT38 NT45`. So NT37 can expand into twice NT19 or NT38 and NT45.\n\nLooking at NT19: Several productions, including `NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19`, `NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38`, and `NT19 \u2192 NT37 NT37`.\n\nWait, NT19 also has `NT19 \u2192 NT25 NT5`. So multiple options.\n\nThis seems getting too nested. Maybe I should look for leaves in the string that can be matched by the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the string, the terminals are:\n\nt3, t41, t55, t67, t41, t3, t38, t11, t72, t2, t36, t11, t38, t41.\n\nWait, the string seems to contain 't3', 't41', etc. Let me see if the grammar can generate these.\n\nLooking at the grammar's terminal productions, for example:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't16'\n- NT13 \u2192 't39'\n- NT19 \u2192 't13'\n- NT21 \u2192 't33'\n- NT22? Wait, check the rules: I see NT24 can produce 't48' etc. Let me make a list of all terminal symbols and what strings they can produce.\n\nWait, perhaps I can create a list of each terminal and which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't16'\n- NT13 \u2192 't39'\n- NT19 \u2192 't13'\n- NT24 \u2192 't48' (via one production), among others.\n- NT25 \u2192 't30'\n- NT27 \u2192 't8 NT17' \u2014 wait no, wait NT27's productions: Let me check.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier, maybe with something like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just doing it manually, I'll need to track possible derivations.\n\nThe string to check is: `t37 t69 t83 t63 t90 t2 t38 t33 t63 t84 t67 t67 t31 t88 t31 t69`.\n\nI'll list the tokens separately to work with them:\n\nt37, t69, t83, t63, t90, t2, t38, t33, t63, t84, t67, t67, t31, t88, t31, t69.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, there are several production rules that produce terminals. I'll list them out:\n\n- t16: NT17 -> NT2 NT30\n- t17: NT27 -> NT8 NT17\n- t18: NT24 -> NT4 NT44\n- t2: NT5 -> 't2' (but wait, NT5 is derived from other rules)\nWait, actually, the grammar has multiple rules that produce terminals like 't2', 't6', etc. Let me go through them:\n\nNT52 -> 't44'\nNT44 -> 't6'\nNT42 -> 't5' for the later NT42 production\nNT13 -> 't39'\nNT28 -> 't67'\nNT0 -> 't39'\nNT40 -> 't65'\nNT46 -> 't72'\nNT32 -> 't83'\nNT24 -> 't18' (from earlier, because NT24 has multiple rules)\nWait, actually, each NT can have multiple production rules, some of which are terminals.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to derive the string step by step. Maybe using the CYK algorithm approach, which involves parsing the string and checking if each substring can be derived from a rule.\n\nGiven the string has 16 tokens, I'll need to consider the grammar's structure to find possible ways the string can be built.\n\nLooking for the first token 't37'. From the grammar, where could 't37' come from? Checking the production rules:\n\nLooking for 't37' token:\n\nI see in the rules like:\n\n- NT19 -> NT37 NT19\n- NT37 -> NT17 NT45\n- NT19 -> NT51 NT19\n- NT37 -> NT19 NT19\nWait, but none of the productions directly produce 't37'. All the tokens are like 't5', 't6', etc. So maybe 't37' comes from a terminal in a production rule. Wait, looking through all the terminals:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are rules like NT37 -> 'something', like NT37 -> NT17 NT45 or NT37 -> NT19 NT19. I don't see any terminal production for 't37' directly. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if the string starts with t37, but according to the grammar, there's no rule where NT37 produces t37 directly\u2014it's always combining two non-terminals.\n\nSo that would mean the string can't be generated because the first symbol is t37, which is not directly produced by any rule. So the answer would be No.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see any rule that introduces t37 as a terminal. All the terminals are like t2, t5, t6, etc. So if the string starts with t37, it's impossible because the grammar can't produce t37 as a terminal.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to check for any production rule in the RHS that is 't37' as the only terminal. If none exist, then the string can't have t37 as the first symbol.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it makes parsing a bit more straightforward. \n\nFirst, I should note that in the grammar, several non-terminals are actually terminating with 't' values. For example, NT52 -> 't44', so whenever we see NT52, it's replaced by 't44'. Similarly, NT44 is 't6', NT42 is 't5', and so on. So the terminal symbols here are a bunch of 't' followed by numbers. The problem is to parse the string into these terminals, ensuring that each step aligns with the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't33'. So I need to find a production rule that starts with 't33'.

Wait, looking back, the grammar for NT24 has two productions:\nNT24 -> NT48 NT35\nNT24 -> NT55\nWait, in the given grammar, it's written as NT24 -> NT55? No, actually, let's check the grammar again: looking for NT24, I see two rules:\n\nNT24 -> NT25 NT47\nNT24 -> t55\n\nWait, is that correct? Because in the initial grammar, the line is:\n\nNT24 -> NT48 NT35\nNT24 -> NT55\n\nWait, actually, the grammar provided includes multiple rules, and I need to go through each NT and see their productions.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me step back. Since each NT either expands to two NTs or a single 't' symbol, the derived string should be a sequence of these 't' symbols, each corresponding to the productions.\n\nSo, the given string is a sequence of 't's and numbers. We need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S, working upwards, but since the string is linear, perhaps a recursive descent approach or using a top-down method would work.\n\nBut given that it's a context-free grammar, maybe we can use the CYK algorithm. Alternatively, we can construct a parse tree manually.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be broken down into the NT productions.\n\nWait, let's list all the 't' symbols and their corresponding NTs.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt33 t6 t12 t28 t55 t38 t3 t72 t65 t89 t37 t39 t3 t72 t36 t91 t12\n\nEach 't' followed by a number represents a terminal, so each of these corresponds to a specific NT.

But NT42 is 't5', and NT48 is 't48'. So NT36 is t5 t48\u2192 't55'? Wait, no: wait, no, the grammar rule is NT36 -> NT42 NT48, so NT42 is 't5' and NT48 is 't48'. So NT36 expands to 't5' 't48':\n\nWait, no, because in the grammar, NT42 is an NT, not a terminal? Wait, no: in the grammar, each NT is a non-terminal that can expand into other NTs or terminals. So looking at NT42: does it expand into a terminal? Let's check the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT42: the rules are:\n\nNT24 -> NT48 NT35\nNT24 -> t55\n\nWait, no. Let me check the list:\n\nLooking through, I don't see NT42; perhaps I'm missing it. Wait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT36 -> NT42 NT48\nBut in that case, NT42 is another non-terminal, which would have its own productions. Wait, so perhaps NT42 is a non-terminal that needs to expand further into terminals.\n\nBut I think I might have to go through each of the NTs and see what they produce.\n\nWait, perhaps I made this too complicated. Let me try a different approach. Let's look at the provided string and see what it looks like.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt33 t6 t12 t28 t55 t38 t3 t72 t65 t89 t37 t39 t3 t72 t36 t91 t12\n\nEach of these 't's followed by numbers is a terminal symbol. The grammar's left-hand sides are non-terminals, each with productions. So, to parse the string, each part of the string must correspond to the terminals produced by these non-terminals.\n\nSo, let's see if each symbol in the string is covered by any of the NT terminals.\n\nHere are the NT terminals and their corresponding 't's:\n\nNT4: t48\nNT5: t2\nNT6: t16\nNT12: t16\nNT13: t69\nNT17: t33\nNT19: t13\nNT21: t13\nNT23: t7\nNT24: t55\nNT26: t12\nNT27: t8 t17\nNT28: t6 t23\nNT29: t63\nNT30: t30 t20\nNT32: t83\nNT35: t37 t37\nNT36: t42 t48 \u2192 Is t42 a terminal? Let me check if NT42 is a terminal or non-terminal. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT42, so it must be a non-terminal. Therefore, NT36 expands into two NTs, both of which may expand further into terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT37 has two productions:\n\nNT37 -> t12 t19\nNT37 -> t19 t19\n\nSo NT37 can expand into 't12' 't19' or 't19' 't19'.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. Each non-terminal has either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of 't's, so we can think of it as each element in the list being a terminal, and we need to check which non-terminals can produce that sequence.\n\nBut building a parse tree from the bottom up might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a top-down approach, or think of the possible sequences each NT can produce.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the possible sequences that can be generated by the grammar, and see if the given string matches any of them.\n\nWait, let's see. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation adds either one terminal or combines two NTs into their corresponding symbols.\n\nThe given string has 17 symbols.

I've been presented with a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is: `t99 t65 t33 t38 t5 t89 t89 t5 t28 t90 t3 t37 t16 t54 t2 t83 t69`.\n\nFirst off, I remember that CNF grammars have all productions of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can have epsilon productions. But looking at the given grammar, I notice that some productions have terminals on the right-hand side, like NT15 -> NT37 NT15, but then other NTs later have 't' suffixed values, which I assume are terminal symbols.\n\nWait, but the initial grammar is in CNF, so all productions should have two non-terminals on the right. But here, many of the productions have terminals. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, perhaps the initial grammar isn't strictly in CNF because some productions have terminals. Wait, but looking again, in the grammar, I see lines like NT15 -> NT37 NT15 and others, but then later, some NTs have 't' suffixed terminals, which suggests that these are terminal symbols. So, perhaps the grammar is written in left-recursive or left-factoring form, which is common for parsing, but for the purposes of this problem, I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol, S.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals. So, the task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar. But how? Maybe I should first look at the string and see which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t99 t65 t33 t38 t5 t89 t89 t5 t28 t90 t3 t37 t16 t54 t2 t83 t69.\n\nWow, that's a lot of terminals. I need to figure out a path from S that can produce these in order.\n\nFirst, let's try to see the start symbol, S. According to the grammar, S -> NT15 NT43. So S must produce two parts: NT15 and NT43. Then, each of these can further be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT15: From the grammar, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. That seems recursive. Alternatively, is there a production for NT15 that leads to a terminal? Let's scan through all the productions for NT15.\n\nLooking at all NT15 occurrences, I see:\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n- Also, in NT52 -> NT6 NT25, but that's a different NT. Hmm, and in some other cases, like NT9 -> NT52 NT4, but that's for NT9.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I don't see any NT15 directly producing a terminal. Only NTs like NT5, NT6, etc., have terminals. So NT15 must derive a sequence of NTs that eventually lead to terminals. So, I'll need to figure out if NT15 can produce t99.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 has a production: NT43 -> NT27 NT0. Wait, NT0 -> NT30 NT20, but when I look at the productions for NT0, I see NT0 -> NT52 NT8, and then NT52 has multiple productions. Let me check NT52:\n\nNT52 -> NT6 NT25\nNT52 -> NT27 NT12\nOther NT52 production: NT52 -> 't44'\n\nWait, yes! NT52 has a production that directly leads to 't44' and another to 't67'. So NT52 can produce 't44' and 't67'.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs have terminals. For example, NT24 -> 't55', NT28 -> 't67', etc.\n\nSo, to see if NT43 can produce a terminal or a sequence that leads to the given string.\n\nBut wait, let's approach this step by step. Let's start with S -> NT15 NT43. So, S needs to generate a string that is the concatenation of what NT15 generates and what NT43 generates.\n\nLooking at the string, the first term is t99. So, the first part must be derived from NT15, which needs to produce t99. That would mean that the first part of the string, t99, must come from NT15.\n\nSo, let's focus on NT15. From the grammar, NT15 can only produce NT37 NT15, which is recursive. That suggests that NT15 can only generate an infinite sequence of NTs until it hits a terminal, but since the string starts with t99, which is a terminal, that suggests that somewhere along the derivation, NT15 must produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking through the productions for NT15, I don't see any production that directly leads to a terminal. So how can NT15 produce t99? Looking around, perhaps through some other NT that leads to t99.\n\nBut let's see if any NTs have t99 as a terminal. Looking through all productions with terminals, I see:\n\n- NT21 -> 't99'\n\nAh, yes! NT21 -> 't99'. So, if during the derivation, the NT that becomes the first part is NT21, then that can produce 't99'.\n\nSo, perhaps S can produce NT21 NT43. Wait, but S is defined as NT15 NT43. So that suggests that the first part should be generated by NT15.\n\nBut NT15 doesn't seem to produce a terminal directly. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe S can produce multiple branches, but given that S -> NT15 NT43, the entire string should be the concatenation of what NT15 produces and what NT43 produces.\n\nSo, in the string, the first few terms are t99 t65 t33 t38 t5. Let's see:\n\nt99 must come from NT15, which seems impossible since NT15's productions don't lead to terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check the productions again for NT15. NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So, it's recursive and doesn't produce a terminal directly. So, how can NT15 produce t99? It can't, unless there's some other nt involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S is only in the first part. Maybe I'm wrong in assuming that S splits into NT15 and NT43. Let's think again. The initial S produces NT15 NT43. So, to get the string starting with t99, we need that t99 comes from NT15, which suggests that NT15 can produce t99 somehow.\n\nBut looking at NT15's productions, I don't see any that produce a terminal. Hmm. That's a problem. Maybe there's a way through a chain of NTs leading to a terminal.\n\nWait, let's see: Maybe there's a chain where NT15 -> NT37 NT15, and eventually, through some recursion, this chain terminates. For example, maybe NT37 can produce a terminal, then NT15 can produce a string ending with that.\n\nLooking for NT37 in the grammar: NT37 has multiple productions. Let's see:\n\n- NT37 -> NT19 NT19\n- NT37 -> NT17 NT45\n- NT37 -> NT52 NT31\n- Wait, looking at NT37's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT37 can produce NT52 NT31 and NT17 NT45 and NT19 NT19.\n\nWait, looking for NT37's productions:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nNT37 -> NT17 NT45\nNT37 -> NT52 NT31\n\nNow, looking at NT31: NT31 -> 't91'.\n\nSo, if NT37 produces NT52 NT31, then this can lead to t91.\n\nWait, but how does NT37 get to t99?\n\nWait, in the string, the first term is t99. Hmm, perhaps I need to see if any of the NTs can produce t99.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\nNT21 -> 't99'\n\nSo, perhaps there's a way for NT21 to generate t99, but how does that connect?\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t99, which is generated by NT21, but since S starts with NT15, that might not align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in my approach, and I should instead try to see if each step in the string can be matched by"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a string is generated by the grammar if we can derive it through a series of substitutions according to the production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some non-terminals on the right-hand side of the productions. For example, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so S is the start symbol, and it's rewritten into two non-terminals. Each non-terminal eventually will break down into terminals or other non-terminals until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nThe string given is a series of terminal symbols (all the tokens like t6, t38, etc.), so I need to see if the non-terminals can expand into this sequence in the correct order.\n\nI think the approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the leaves of the tree correspond to the given string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the root of the parse tree will have two children: NT15 and NT43. Each of these will need to generate the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT15: From the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Hmm, this seems recursive. So NT15 expands into NT37 and itself again. This suggests that NT15 might produce an infinite loop unless it eventually reaches a terminal. Let's follow this path.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 \u2192 let's consider NT37 and NT15. NT37 has a production: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So this splits into two NT19s. Each NT19 can go to different things. Looking at the grammar, NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 or NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38. Let's pick one path.\n\nIf we take NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, then NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, and NT43 is 't44'. Wait, no, looking back, NT45's production was used earlier\u2014it might be better to look at the specific terminals each non-terminal expands into.\n\nWait, actually, many non-terminals are terminals. For example, NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT13 \u2192 't39', etc. So perhaps some non-terminals can immediately produce a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at NT0, it can produce 't39' and sometimes 't28', etc. Maybe we can find a path where some non-terminals produce terminals early on.\n\nBut the string begins with 't69', so maybe another path. Let's cross-reference the first part of the string with the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar has a lot of non-terminals that expand only to other non-terminals or terminals. So starting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which would produce 't69' as the first terminal? Let me check NT15 and NT43.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. NT37 can be 't12' or other combinations. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 or NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. NT19 can go to 't51' or 't12' and 't38'. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the CYK algorithm would be more efficient to parse the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm can be applied, which works by filling a table to check if the string can be generated.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by dividing the string into segments and checking which non-terminals can produce each segment.\n\nThe string is: t69 t38 t24 t99 t65 t3 t39 t83 t6 t33 t38 t99 t6 t90 t63 t7 t24 t44.\n\nFirst, the string length is 19 tokens. So we'll create a table for positions 1 to 19.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the table by checking for single symbols and seeing if any non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce single terminals:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't5'\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47, which are terminals? Wait, let me check each non-terminal that immediately expands into a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see a lot of non-terminals that produce terminals, like NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT13 \u2192 't39', NT28 \u2192 't67', etc. So we can identify all such non-terminals.\n\nNow, to reconstruct the table, for each position (i, j), we check if there's any production A \u2192 BC such that B produces from i to k and C produces from k+1 to j. We mark which non-terminals can produce each segment.\n\nBut looking through each step manually could be tedious, so maybe I can spot patterns or identify non-terminals that produce certain parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has a part that cannot be produced by any non-terminal. For example, the first token is 't69'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48, and NT13 \u2192 't39'. So 21 can produce 't39 t48'. But wait, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, looking at NT51: NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, and each of those can be terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Maybe another approach: Let's look for each symbol in the string and see if it's a terminal that any non-terminal can produce.\n\nThe string includes 't69', which I don't immediately recognize. Checking the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't69'? Looking through the productions:\n\nI see NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48; NT13 \u2192 't39', which is 't39'. So that would produce 't39' and t48. But not t69. Let me go further up.\n\nLooking at NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. NT19 can go to 't51' or 't12' and 't38'. Wait, what does NT12 produce? NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48. NT13 \u2192 't39', and NT48 \u2192 't87' or other terminals. So 't39' and 't87'.\n\nNot matching 't69'. Let me check NT21: NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48; NT13 \u2192 't39', and NT48 \u2192 't87'. So 't39 t87'.\n\nWait, let me see if any non-terminal directly produces 't69'. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT31 \u2192 't91', NT23 \u2192 NT2 NT50, NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, which have terminals and non-terminals. Maybe another route.\n\nWait, looking at NT24: NT24 \u2192 multiple options, including 't5', 't48', 't18', etc. Not seeing 't69'; so maybe NT24 is not involved in 't69'.\n\nAnother non-terminal: NT29 \u2192 't63' and 't28', etc.\n\nWait, NT23 \u2192 NT2 NT50. NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32. NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31. So expanding that, NT41 becomes 't7', 't31'. NT25 is involved in other expansions.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to check for all the non-terminals that can produce the first symbol 't69'. If none, the string isn't generated.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that immediately produces 't69' except perhaps through some chain. For example, maybe through NT15?\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Let's see NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. NT19 can split into NT12 NT38 or another path.\n\nWait, each step branches, but without knowing if any non-terminal eventually produces 't69', I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the grammar to understand the structure.

That's helpful because CNF grammars are structured in a way that makes parsing easier, but I might not need a parser here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t31 t90 t44 t65 t37 t69 t65 t67 t13 t33 t7 t5 t37 t33 t12 t54 t72 t39 t83`.\n\nI notice that all the elements in the string are terminals (they look like tokens separated by spaces). So, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the only production is S -> NT15 NT43.

{"custom_id":"request-330","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is in the language it generates. The string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't72 t65 t5 ...' up to some point. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. It's a set of rules where each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. But looking at the grammar, some rules have two terminals on the right, like NT52 -> 't6 NT25' or NT24 -> 't5'. So that might complicate things.\n\nThe string seems to be a sequence of terminal symbols. So the grammar must generate this sequence. Let me try to work backward. Start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT15 NT43. So the string needs to begin with NT15 and NT43 in some order because both are non-terminals, but since it's concatenation, the output is their concatenation. So the first part should be whatever NT15 produces and then NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't72'. Let's see which NT can produce 't72'. Looking through the productions, I see NT46 -> NT10 NT38, which then leads to NT10 being 't50 NT30'. NT46 also produces 't72' directly. Wait, looking at NT46's productions, yes, NT46 -> 't72 NT27' or 't6 NT25'. Wait, the actual productions are:\n\nLooking back, NT46: \n\n- NT46 -> NT10 NT38\n- NT46 -> NT32 NT17\n- NT46 -> NT6 NT25\nWait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT26 -> NT32 NT23, for example. Let me check for 't72'. Looking through the productions, I don't see any direct NT producing 't72', except maybe from NT52. Wait, NT52 has a production: \"NT52 -> 't6 NT25'\". Wait, actually, looking again, NT52's production is:\n\n- NT52 -> 't6 NT25' and NT52 -> 't44'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT52: \n\n- NT52 -> 't6 NT25'\n- NT52 -> 't44'\n\nWait, that can't be right because NT52 is a non-terminal, so it can't produce a terminal directly unless it's connected through other rules. Wait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me go through each production and note whether a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT24 -> 't5' directly. So NT24 can produce 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 -> NT13 NT47, so it's a non-terminal. But NT9 -> 't48' directly.\n\nWait, let me check all the NT productions:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n1. NT24 -> 't5' \u2192 Okay, NT24 can produce 't5' directly.\n2. NT25 -> NT13 NT47 \u2192 both non-terminals.\n3. NT26 -> NT34 NT17 \u2192 both non-terminals.\n4. NT27 -> NT8 NT17 \u2192 both non-terminals.\n5. NT50 -> NT41 NT33 \u2192 both non-terminals.\n6. NT19 -> NT51 NT20 \u2192 both non-terminals.\n7. NT52 -> 't6' \u00d72 (since I see two lines: NT52 -> 't6 NT25' and NT52 -> 't44') Hmm, no, that can't be, because each production can only have two symbols. Wait, looking again, maybe I misformatted the grammar. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe grammar starts with lines like NT44 -> 't6' and NT42 -> 't5'. Wait, perhaps lines have two productions each. For example:\n\n- NT24: line with 't5' and another line? Or is each line a separate rule?\n\nWait, the grammar is a list of rules, each line is a separate production. So, for example:\n\nLooking at NT44:\n\nNT44 -> 't6' (Line NT44)\n\nAlso, in line NT42: NT42 -> 't5' \u2014 so both NT42 and NT44 can directly produce 't5' and 't6', respectively.\n\nWait, but that's a bit confusing. So, each NT can have multiple rules, including rules that produce terminals.\n\nSo, to build the string, I can look for the leftmost NTs that produce the initial symbols.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't72'. Looking for which NT can produce 't72'. I see NT46 and NT52 have rules that produce 't6' or 't44', but none directly produce 't72'. Wait, no, maybe another NT can produce 't72'. Let me scan the rules:\n\nLooking for 't72' in the productions:\n\n- NT15: line NT15 -> 't33' and another line? Wait:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NTT15 has a production: NT15 -> NT37 NT15, but not a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for any production that directly produces 't72'. Hmm, perhaps I don't see any NT directly producing 't72', which suggests that maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, there's a production for NT46: 't6 NT25' and 't72' perhaps? Wait, looking again through the grammar lines:\n\nWait, line number 7: NT52 -> 't6 NT25' and line 9: NT52 -> 't44'.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. NT46 is present, but looking through all lines:\n\n- NT46: two rules? Or lines: looking at the grammar as presented:\n\nWait, the given grammar has lines like:\n\nNT50 -> NT41 NT32\n\nNT9 -> NT52 NT4\n\nWait, but it's a list, so each line is a separate rule. For example:\n\nNT50: NT50 -> NT41 NT32\n\nNT37: NT37 -> NT19 NT45\n\nWait, so perhaps in the given grammar, NT52 has two productions: NT52 -> 't6 NT25' and NT52 -> 't44' \u2014 no, wait no, the line for NT52 is followed by: NT52 -> 't6 NT25' and NT52 -> 't27 NT12'. Hmm, that can't be right because NT52 would have two productions resulting in a mix.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me list each production line:\n\n1. S -> NT15 NT43\n\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-355","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t6 t24 t4 t7 t6 t44 t54 t13 t39 t99 t4 t13 t44 t48 t2 t55 t31 t54 t84 t83`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to have various non-terminals like S, NT15, NT50, etc., and terminals like 't44', 't6', etc. \n\nThe starting symbol seems to be S, as the first production is S -> NT15 NT43. So I need to see if the string can be derived starting from S.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t6, which is a terminal. Let me see the terminal productions. The grammar has some rules where non-terminals produce terminals, like NT44 -> t6. So t6 is a terminal, and to produce it, a non-terminal must expand to it.\n\nNow, let's look for any production that starts with S and expands to this string step by step. Since all the production rules are in CNF, each step in the derivation produces two symbols. So for a string of length n, there should be n-1 steps or something similar.\n\nWait, actually, Chomsky normal form means each rule is A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So each production replaces a symbol with two symbols or a terminal. Therefore, the derivation starts with S and each step might add one token to the right side, but the total number of symbols increases by one each time.\n\nBut in our case, the string is a sequence of terminals. So each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal production. That means, starting from S, each step should generate more symbols until we end up with only terminals, which should match the given string in order.\n\nBut how do I approach this? Maybe I can try to parse the string step by step, trying to match each terminal with a production in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a parse tree for the string, but that might be complicated. Let me see if I can outline the steps.\n\nThe string is: t6, t24, t4, t7, t6, t44, t54, t13, t39, t99, t4, t13, t44, t48, t2, t55, t31, t54, t84, t83.\n\nSo, 20 terminals in sequence.\n\nLooking for the start symbol S, which can only produce NT15 NT43. So, S -> NT15 NT43. So the first two symbols should be the expansion of NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t6, which is a terminal. So, after expanding NT15 and NT43, the leftmost symbols should correspond to the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start from the top and see if the string can be built by expanding S and seeing if each terminal matches.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to look for the leftmost derivation. Let me try that.\n\n1. S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, the first symbols are NT15 and NT43. Now, in the string, it's t6 first. Let me see if NT15 can produce t6. Looking at the grammar, do any of the non-terminals produce t6? Yes, NT44 -> t6. Wait, no, NT44 is a non-terminal that directly produces t6.\n\nWait, but NT15 is a non-terminal. Let me check the productions for NT15.\n\nLooking back: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it correctly. Wait, I think I might have misread. Let me list the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nNT50 -> NT41 NT43\n...\nWait, actually, the first production is S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nBut for NT15, looking through the productions: \n\nLooking at NT15, I don't see a production that ends with t6. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, all NT rules produce two non-terminals except some. For example, NT44 -> t6.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's see.

CNF means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the start symbol is S, and it's defined as S -> NT15 NT43. That means the entire derivation starts with NT15 followed by NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15 and NT43:\n- NT15 can be NT37 NT15 or NT39.\n- NT43 can be NT6 NT1 or NT6.\n\nLet's break this down. Starting with NT43, the possible productions are NT6 NT1. So, from NT43, we get NT6 followed by NT1. NT5, I suppose, but wait\u2014no, NT43 is split into NT6 and NT1. NT1 might produce different things.\n\nLooking at NT1, the productions are NT51 NT38 and NT19 NT19. Let's see what NT51 and NT19 produce. From NT51, it goes to NT52 NT8. NT52 becomes 't44', and NT8 is something else. Wait, NT52 is the only one I see with a terminal in its production: NT52 -> 't44'. Then, NT8 goes to NT46 NT17. And NT46 is 't72', which would be one of the terminals.\n\nWait, in the string provided, I have a 't72' which could come from NT46. Let me see if that's connected in the grammar. NT46 -> 't72' directly. Okay, so perhaps a chain leading into 't72' is possible.\n\nGoing back, NT43 splits into NT6 NT1. NT6 has a production to NT50 NT27? Wait, no, NT6 is a non-terminal, its productions? Let me look. Looking through the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT6, I see that NT52 -> NT6 NT25. So NT6 is part of production NT52. NT52's other production is 't44'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I don't see NT6 being directly defined by anything else. Wait, no. Looking again: the original grammar starts with S-> NT15 NT43. Then I look for NT6. Wait, somewhere in the rules, it's more precise.\n\nWait, the grammar provided starts with S -> NT15 NT43, then a list of rules. Let me scan through the rules to see what defines NT6. Looking through each rule:\n\nLooking for NT6: \n\nYes, in the grammar, I see NT52 -> NT6 NT25. So NT6 is only inside NT52's production. But where is NT6 defined? Wait, no, NT6 is not listed as a defined NT. That's odd. So maybe I should check all the rules to see if any other NT is defined with NT6 as a left-hand side.\n\nLooking again: Other rules for NT36, NT25, etc. It seems like none of them have NT6 as a non-terminal except for NT52-> NT6 NT25. But that means NT6 might not be a terminal or a defined non-terminal because it's never on its own. Hmm, that could be a problem because in CNF, every non-terminal must have productions that expand to terminals and non-terminals, but if a non-terminal isn't defined, it's invalid. So perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar because NT6's definition is missing.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps NT6 is part of a production like NT52 as mentioned, but maybe I missed NT6 as a parent node. Let me re-scan the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT6: \n\nYes, I see NT52 -> NT6 NT25 (but NT6 isn't defined elsewhere), and NT52-> 't44'. So that's a problem. Because if NT6 isn't defined, it's like a hidden symbol. That might not have been intended, so perhaps that's incorrect. Or maybe it's a typo, and it's another NT. Alternatively, perhaps NT6 is defined as multiple terminals, but in CNF each production must have exactly one non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again. The first few rules after S-> NT15 NT43:\n\nNT50-> NT1 NT32,\nNT36-> NT42 NT48,\nNT25-> NT13 NT47,\nNT24-> NT48 NT35,\nNT32-> NT25 NT46,\nNT30-> NT32 NT8,\nNT20-> NT30 NT24,\nNT46-> NT10 NT38,\nNT35-> NT37 NT37,\nNT30-> NT24 NT44,\nNT43-> NT27 NT0,\nNT19-> NT12 NT38,\nNT0-> NT30 NT20,\nNT34-> NT32 NT2,\nNT37-> NT17 NT45,\nNT52-> NT6 NT25,\nNT19-> NT51 NT19,\nNT52-> NT27 NT12,\nNT9-> NT52 NT4,\n... and many more.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all non-terminals to make sure. Let me see: NT15, NT43, NT50, NT36, NT25, NT24, NT32, NT30, NT20, NT46, NT35, NT30, NT43, NT19, NT0, NT34, NT37, NT52, NT44, NT42, NT13, NT28, NT26, NT47, NT17, NT1, NT2, NT7, NT21, NT45, NT19, NT51, NT48, NT23, NT38, NT7, NT28, NT6, NT5, NT4, NT29, NT9, NT13, etc.\n\nLooking for NT6: Only in the production NT52-> NT6 NT25. So when I look at the rules, does NT6 appear on any left-hand side? It's in the production, but not a defined non-terminal. So perhaps the initial production of S isn't possible because NT6 isn't defined, making the grammar invalid? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed assuming that NT6 is defined in another way that I missed. Maybe I over-scan, but perhaps other NT6's?\n\nWait, let me check all the productions for NT6. Looking through each production line:\n\nNT52 is defined in two ways, one including 't44' and another as NT6 NT25.\n\nBut elsewhere, looking for NT6: Not seeing NT6 as a non-terminal on the left-hand side except in NT52's production. So NT6 is only on the left in one place. So it can't be derived further, making it impossible. So any string leading to NT6 would be invalid because it's not a terminal or can't be expanded.\n\nLooking at the string given: The first word is 't16', then 't72', 't16', 't69', etc. \n\nBut the start symbol is S-> NT15 NT43. So the derivation must start with NT15 and NT43.\n\nLet's track the possible substitutions:\n\nFrom NT15: It can be NT37 NT15 or NT39.\n\nFrom NT43: It can be NT6 NT1 or NT6.\n\nWait, but the production for NT43 is either -> NT6 NT1 or -> NT6. But in the grammar, the last production is NT43-> NT6 NT1, but then also earlier NT43-> NT27 NT0. So NT43 can be either NT6 NT1 or NT27 NT0.\n\nWait, but the original list shows NT43-> NT27 NT0 after BT43-> NT6 NT1. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial parsing. Let me look again.\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT43-> NT27 NT0\n\nand\n\nNT43-> NT6 NT1\n\nSo NT43 can be expanded into either that.\n\nSo in the string, starting with NT43, it's eventually followed by NT6. If the string has a part that resolves to NT6, but since NT6 isn't defined as anything, it can't be expanded. So in the string, every 't' that comes from NT6 would be invalid because the grammar can't produce it.\n\nWait, but looking back, the string is:\n\nt16 t72 t16 t69 t12 t41 t87 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-372","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a specific form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar has a series of productions, and eventually, some of them translate non-terminals to terminals like 't' followed by numbers. The string given is: `t36 t83 t54 t91 t54 t63 t65 t87 t28 t16 t24 t37 t33 t83 t13 t65 t4 t6 t44 t24 t11`.\n\nI notice that each part of the string is separated by spaces, so each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. Now, I'll try to map the string to the grammar.\n\nStarting with the starting symbol S in the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nSo, the string should start with the expansions of NT15 and NT43. Looking at the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which means it can expand into more NTs until it finds a terminal. Similarly, NT43 could expand. Let me see what NT43 translates to in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t36, so maybe NT36 is involved.\n\nWait, in the string, the initial part is t36 t83 t54. Let's see if t36 corresponds to any production. Checking NT36: NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48. From the grammar, NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48.\n\nNow, let's check the terminals: t36 comes first. The production for NT36 is into two non-terminals, so t36 would be the result of expanding NT36. But in the grammar, NT36 is defined as NT42 NT48, which are non-terminals. So, how does t36 get into the string? Hmm, perhaps I misassigned. Maybe I should check if any NT in the grammar directly produces t36.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46, NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37, NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45, etc. Wait, actually, the string has t36 as the second token, but looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t36. Wait, actually, I see that NT50 and NT51 are terminals. Let me check the NT26 production: NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34, which seems to go deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Maybe I should build a parse tree for the string. Alternatively, I can consider each terminal in the string and see if it can be reached by some non-terminal.\n\nBut honestly, this might take a while. Alternatively, I can check each terminal in the string and see if they correspond to productions in the grammar. Let's list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt36, t83, t54, t91, t54, t63, t65, t87, t28, t16, t24, t37, t33, t83, t13, t65, t4, t6, t44, t24, t11.\n\nThat's quite a lot. I'll go one by one.\n\nt36: I need to see if any NT produces t36. Looking at NT36's production: NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48. But in the grammar, neither NT42 nor NT48 are terminals. So NT36 is a non-terminal that doesn't produce t36. Wait, but maybe it does through deeper expansions?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar. For example, NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34. NT24 could expand further into NT25, etc., but none of these seem to directly produce t36. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT50 has a production NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. And looking at the string, the first t is t36, so maybe that's NT36.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Let's track down each terminal in the string and see if they can be produced by any NT.\n\nStarting with t36. In the grammar, does any NT produce t36? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT36: NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48. Both are non-terminals. So t36 can't directly be produced by NT36, it must be produced by expanding those further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all NTs that eventually produce a terminal. So, for each NT in the grammar, I can see if it produces a terminal eventually.\n\nBut maybe I can look at the productions where the right-hand side is terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some productions where a single NT is connected to terminals. For example:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT0 NT13\nBut NT0 \u2192 NT52 NT20, and NT52 translates to 't44' or other t's. Wait, looking at the grammar, some NTs have a direct terminal:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT52 \u2192 't44', which might not be helpful. Also, looking at the string, some terminals are letters like t33, t13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each terminal in the string and see if it's directly produced by any NT.\n\nt36: Is there an NT that directly produces t36? In the production list, I see NT24 \u2192 't35' isn't, but NT12 produces 't16', etc. Wait, actually, I see NT24 has a production NT24 \u2192 't55', but no. Alternatively, maybe looking for NTs that expand into t36.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for which NTs can produce t36 through their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48. NT42 and NT48 are non-terminals. So t36 would result from expanding NT36 into NT42 and NT48, which would then expand further. So perhaps t36 is in the string as a result of that expansion.\n\nSimilarly, t83. Looking at NT83: wait, in the grammar, is there an NT for t83? Let me check the productions. There's NT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46, NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47, etc. So t83 might come from NT36's expansion, perhaps.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to see if all the terminals in the string are covered by the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, for example, t11: looking at the grammar, one production is NT19 \u2192 NT13 NT47, and so on. The grammar includes NT1, which eventually can produce 't24', etc.\n\nWait, this is taking too long. Maybe I should try parsing the string step by step, using the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting with the first part of the string: t36 t83.\n\nLooking at the grammar: what starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, the string must start with NT15 expanded into something that produces t36, and NT43 into something that produces t83, but wait, that can't be because NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals; their expansions produce sequences of non-terminals which further expand.\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Because S expands into NT15 NT43, which are two parts. So, the first part of the string should correspond to NT15's expansion and the second part to NT43's expansion.\n\nSo, the entire string is the concatenation of the expansion of NT15 and NT43.\n\nGiven that, let's see: the first part is t36 t83 t54 t91... So, could the first part of the string be the result of expanding NT15, and the second part the result of expanding NT43.\n\nBut the string starts with t36, so if NT15 produces t36 somehow, then that's the start.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That's a recursive production. So NT15 would produce t37, followed by the expansion of NT15 again.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider that NT15 can be expanded beyond that. Wait, perhaps NT37 produces t37, and then the next NT15 would produce t37 again? That would give t37 t37, which doesn't match the first t36.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-369","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t48 t69 t48 t11 t37 t39 t6 t88 t41 t84 t67 t87 t24 t44 t7 t48 t54 t54 t90 t72 t5`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. CNF grammars have rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the initial symbol. However, looking at the provided grammar, some rules seem to have more than two non-terminals on the right side. For example, `NT24 -> NT48 NT35 NT35`, which is problematic because it's a tripling, not a binomial. Wait, no, actually, in the given grammar, each production seems to correctly follow CNF because I don't see any rules with more than two non-terminals. Let me check again. \n\nLooking more closely, each production rule seems to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which aligns with CNF. So maybe I was overcomplicating that.\n\nNext, the string to check consists of tokens like `t48`, `t69`, etc. It looks like these tokens are the terminal symbols in the grammar. So, I need to see if this string can be derived through the given productions.\n\nSince it's a bottom-up parsing approach, I would typically use the CYK algorithm, but given the complexity, I'll try a top-down approach with recursive descent.\n\nFirst, I should note that the start symbol is S. Let's see what S expands into: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, if the string starts with two non-terminals, we can consider this production. But looking at the string, the first two symbols are `t48` and `t69`. Since these are terminals, the start symbol must derive into these. However, S's production starts with NT15 NT43. So, the first two symbols should correspond to NT15 and NT43. Let me check if `t48` and `t69` match NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, and NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. Hmm, but in the terminal string, I have `t48` after the initial `t48 t69`. Wait, perhaps I should track the structure more carefully.\n\nWait, maybe the string is a sequence of terminals, and I should see if each production can break down the string step by step. So starting from the start symbol S, which is derived into NT15 NT43. So the string must be NT15's derivation ending in `t48` and NT43's derivation ending in `t69`. But wait, that might not make sense because NT43 is a non-terminal, and in the given string, `t69` is a terminal. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to parse this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CYK algorithm is more suitable here because it can efficiently determine whether a string is in the language by checking all possible ways the string can be divided into substrings matched by non-terminals.\n\nBut I'm a bit rusty on the specifics of CYK, so perhaps I can try to map the string to the grammar by breaking it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: `t48 t69 t48 t11 t37 t39 t6 t88 t41 t84 t67 t87 t24 t44 t7 t48 t54 t54 t90 t72 t5`.\n\nThe string has 21 tokens, which means it's a bit long. I'll try to see if the first few tokens can be derived from a production. Starting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string should be NT15 followed by NT43. Let's see if the first part of the string can be broken down into NT15's expansion and the second part into NT43's.\n\nLooking at NT15's rules:\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\nSo, recursively, this will expand into NT37 NT37 NT37..., but how does that lead to `t48` and `t69`? Hmm, perhaps I'm not tracking correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at what each NT production leads to in terms of terminals. Maybe some NTs directly produce a terminal when derived. For instance, let's see the NTs and their rules that end with terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't48'\nNT1 -> 't24'\nNT28 -> 't16'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT17 -> 't33'\nNT6 -> 't7'\nAnd so on. It seems that some NTs directly produce a single terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps I should look for the end symbols and see how the string can be split into parts that match these.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the string and try to split it into parts that match the productions. The first two tokens are `t48` and `t69`. Let's see if `t48` is produced by any NT, and similarly for `t69`.\n\nLooking at NT4: NT4 \u2192 't26' (Wait, no, let me check the grammar properly.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't6' (Wait, the grammar is a list of productions, so each line like `NT25 -> NT13 NT47` means NT25 can be replaced by NT13 and NT47. But some lines end with a terminal, like `NT5 -> 't2'`.\n\nSo, for example, NT44 \u2192 't6'. Similarly, NT48 \u2192 't87' when derived from certain paths. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the structure right.\n\nWait, I think I need to parse the entire string step by step, but it's going to be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can construct the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if the string starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first part is NT15, and the second is NT43.\n\nLet's look at how S is derived. So the full string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is `t48 t69 t48 t11 t37 t39 t6 t88 t41 t84 t67 t87 t24 t44 t7 t48 t54 t54 t90 t72 t5`.\n\nI need to split this into two parts: one that's the derivation of NT15 and the other that's the derivation of NT43.\n\nStarting with NT15: It expands to NT37 NT15. So, recursively, this will be NT37 NT37 NT15, which again can expand further.\n\nSo, the string starting with NT15's expansion would be a series of NT37s and NT15s derived until they match terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: `t48` is after S's first part. NT15's production goes through NT37, which may eventually produce `t48`. Let's see.\n\nNT37 has two rules:\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\nSo, it's getting a bit complicated. Each NT37 can split into two NT19s.\n\nLet me check what NT19 does. Looking through the grammar, I see NT19 \u2192 't25' and others. Wait, at the end, there's `NT28 -> 't16'`, but looking back, I don't see NT25 producing a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the rules incorrectly. The grammar rules are all in the form of left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS), and each RHS is a sequence of non-terminals. The only way to get a terminal is if somewhere along the expansion, an NT can be reduced to a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, perhaps some NTs have terminals as their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT28 \u2192 't16'\n- NT9 \u2192 't28'\n- NT28 \u2192 't4' (Wait, checking again. Let me re-examine the grammar lines.)\n\nThe grammar lines include:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't26'?\nWait, perhaps I need to scan the entire grammar and pick out any rules that result in a single terminal.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't48'\n- NT28 -> 't6' (Wait, no:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is S, and its production is S -> NT15 NT43. That means the entire string should start with NT15 and NT43. So the first token after S should correspond to NT15 and the second to NT43. Wait, though\u2014looking at the string, the first token is t33, but according to the grammar, the first symbol is NT15. So does t33 correspond to NT15?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT15 can produce NT37 NT15. So NT15 has two symbols, right? So if the string starts with t33, which is mapped to NT15, that would mean that somewhere in the derivation, NT15 must be split into two parts.

{"custom_id":"request-393","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form is a way to structure CFGs where every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for certain algorithms, like the CYK parsing algorithm, but I'm not sure if I need to use that here.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of production rules. Each rule seems to have a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right, except for the cases where it's a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, all these productions are in CNF because each step produces two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t16 t65 t63 t84 t37 t84 t4 t91 t6 t16 t5 t3 t41 t16 t36 t83 t99 t44 t13 t12 t3`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions from the start symbol. But wait, maybe it's better to think about the derivation tree. Each step in the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. So, the number of symbols in the string corresponds to 2^n, where n is the depth of the derivation.\n\nBut looking at the string, it has 22 tokens. Is 22 a power of 2? Let's see: 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. No, 22 isn't a power of 2. Wait, does that mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar? Because each production in CNF can only produce an exponential growth, not a linear one.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each step in the derivation starts with the leftmost non-terminal and replaces it with two symbols. So the number of symbols starts at 1 (the start symbol S) and each production increases the count by 1 (since A \u2192 BC adds a symbol). So after k steps, the number of symbols is 2^k. So, the total number of symbols must be a power of 2.\n\nBut in this case, the string has 22 symbols, which is not a power of 2. Therefore, the string can't be generated by any CFG in CNF. Because each production step doubles the number of symbols, so the total symbols must be 2^n.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct. The number of symbols depends on the structure. For example, starting with S, each production could be S \u2192 AB, then each A and B can produce more symbols. So the total number of symbols is 2^n, where n is the number of initial non-terminals.\n\nIn this case, the string has 22 symbols, which is 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. 22 is between 16 and 32, so it's neither a power of 2 nor does it fit the pattern. Therefore, I think the string can't be generated because the length isn't a power of 2.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check the structure more carefully. Let me look at the grammar rules again. The start symbol is S, which is replaced by NT15 and NT43. Each of these is a non-terminal that then produce other non-terminals and terminals. So the total derivation should result in 2^k symbols, where k is the number of steps.\n\nWait, no. Each production step in a CFG replaces one non-terminal with two symbols. So the number of symbols increases by one each time a production is applied. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify: each production replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. So the length after each production could vary depending on how many non-terminals are produced.\n\nBut the overall structure is that each step can increase the count by zero, one, or two symbols. However, in our case, since all productions are in the form of A \u2192 BC (left-hand side being a single non-terminal, right-hand side two non-terminals), each production of a non-terminal into two non-terminals doesn't produce a terminal. Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, some productions have terminals. For example, NT4 \u2192 't2', NT3 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nAh, yes, some non-terminals produce a single terminal. So, for example, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Then NT15 might produce something like NT37 or 't44', and similarly for NT43. So, each production can add terminals, but each step in the grammar can't be broken down because the productions can produce both non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBut the fact is that the number of symbols in the string is 22, which is not a power of 2. Therefore, it's impossible for this string to be generated by a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form because in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols (two non-terminals), leading to the number of symbols at each step doubling. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C can be non-terminals or terminals? Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, when you have a terminal, that's the end of the expansion for that non-terminal. For example, if a non-terminal NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32, then that's two non-terminals, which can further expand, but if a non-terminal like NT5 \u2192 't2', that's terminal, so that's a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nSo in this case, the number of symbols in the generated string should be of the form (2^k), where each 'k' is the number of steps in the derivation starting from S. But the string has 22 symbols, which isn't a power of 2. Therefore, regardless of the structure, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string is broken down into different parts that sum up correctly? For example, if the string is split into smaller parts each of which is a substring that can be generated in the grammar. But since the grammar's productions produce terminals and non-terminals, each terminal can only appear once, right? Or wait, no, because non-terminals can be expanded multiple times.\n\nBut in this case, the problem is the number of symbols. Since 22 is not a power of 2, it must not be generated. So my conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the given CFG.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 22 symbols, which is not a power of 2. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production step doubles the number of symbols, resulting in a total number of symbols that must be a power of 2. 22 is not a power of 2, so the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar provided shows all non-terminals on the left side and combinations on the right, mostly in the form of two non-terminals except for some that end with terminals.\n\nThe string consists entirely of terminals, which suggests that it started from the start symbol S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, the first step would be to see if the string can be broken down into the productions of these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT15 and NT43 directly produce certain terminal strings:\n- NT15 \u2192 't37' (since looking at the production NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, but from another angle, in the list, there's NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 and NT37 \u2192 various things, but in the given string, the term is 't37' is not present. Wait, no, looking at the provided grammar, there's a production NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 and another NT15 \u2192 something else? Wait no, in the provided grammar, there are multiple entries for NT15. Wait, looking back, the user provided the grammar in a list format. Let me scan through that.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see multiple entries for NT15:\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n- Also, looking through, I see that NT37 has several productions, including NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, which then eventually maybe down to terminals? Let me check the terminal productions.\n\nLooking for NT15, I notice that it doesn't have a direct terminal production. All of its productions are in the form of NT37 followed by NT15, which suggests that NT15 might eventually produce a terminal string through NT37 and other non-terminals. Similarly, NT43 is directly used in the production S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Looking at NT43, the productions are:\n- NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0 and NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. Among these, NT27 and NT0 might produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT27, it has NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17. NT8 is an NT. Checking NT8, it's in the list as NT8 \u2192 't46' in the terminals? Wait no, in the provided grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 't46' as a terminal, yes. Because in the list, NT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35, etc., but looking specifically, there's NT8 \u2192 't46'. So, NT8 can directly produce 't46'.\n\nNow, NT17 is another NT. Checking NT17's productions: NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30, and other NT17 productions. NT2's productions are NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32, etc. Wait, but NT17 also has a production NT17 \u2192 NT7 NT33? Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 NT24 NT2 or NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar: I see NT17 \u2192 't24' as a direct terminal. So, NT17 can produce 't24' and also perhaps other NT combinations.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT43's productions, one is NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. Now, NT6 is a non-terminal. Looking at NT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 't16' directly? Wait no, in the provided grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 NT16, NT16 \u2192 't3'. So, NT6 starts as a non-terminal but ultimately leads to NT16, which is a terminal. So, NT6 produces 't16' via NT16.\n\nNow, trying to reconstruct the string. The first step is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, the entire string must be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at NT14 \u2192 wait, no, looking at the provided grammar, NT15 is as such. So, let's see:\n\nNT15 can be derived as NT37 NT15 (which seems recursive). So, perhaps NT15 produces a string ending with NT37, which might ultimately produce a terminal. Alternatively, let me try to see if NT15 can eventually derive a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, each non-terminal either has a production ending with a terminal directly or through a series of non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the given string from the grammar's perspective, using top-down parsing or recursive descent.\n\nThe string is: t67 t88 t7 t41 t16 t83 t67 t6 t11 t54 t7 t84 t18 t5 t67 t3 t87 t41 t36 t72 t2 t65 t36\n\nLet me break down this string into tokens: each part is separated by spaces, so each token is a separate string. Let's list them:\n\n1. t67\n2. t88\n3. t7\n4. t41\n5. t16\n6. t83\n7. t67\n8. t6\n9. t11\n10. t54\n11. t7\n12. t84\n13. t18\n14. t5\n15. t67\n16. t3\n17. t87\n18. t41\n19. t36\n20. t72\n21. t2\n22. t65\n23. t36\n\nThat's 23 tokens.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. But in this case, each production can have two non-terminals or a terminal. So, perhaps each token in the string can be built from a single non-terminal. Let me see.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, for example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, meaning that it's a recursive production. So, each step would involve replacing NT15 with NT37 NT15, which could lead to a chain of NT37s. Eventually, NT37 might terminate.\n\nLooking at NT37's productions, I see multiple possibilities:\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n- NT37 \u2192 NT51 NT29\n- NT37 \u2192 NT27 NT13\n- NT37 \u2192 NT61 NT11 (Wait, no, looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT61. Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar list, I see NT52 \u2192 't64', but I don't see NT61. Wait, perhaps it's NT6? Let me check. Oh, in the grammar, NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17, which is in the list.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each non-terminal in the string to see if they can be generated by any of the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nLet me check each token in the string and see if there is a non-terminal that produces it.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't67'. Looking in the grammar, is there a production that directly produces 't67'? Yes, looking at NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35, but also NT46 \u2192 't72' as a terminal, and NT26 \u2192 't12' as a terminal, etc.\n\nWait, is there any NT that directly produces 't67'? Looking through, I see NT6 \u2192 NT16, which produces 't3', so t67 is a string of 't67'. Wait no, in the provided grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces 't67' as a terminal. Hmm, but maybe it's a multi-step process.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, every step appends either a terminal or two non-terminals. The terminals are the leaves. So, the string must be constructed by applying these productions step by step, with non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string 't67' might be derived from a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-414","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and ensures that the productions are in a specific structure that can be handled by certain algorithms like the CYK parser.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which expands into NT15 and NT43. I'll need to follow how these non-terminals expand to build the string.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: `t88 t37 t13 t89 t90 t67 t6 t44 t69 t24 t89 t16 t5 t39 t38 t18 t41 t88 t4` \n\nIt's a sequence of terminal symbols (since they end with 't' followed by numbers, and these correspond to specific productions). I'll need to check if these terminals can be generated by applying the given productions.\n\nI think the best way is to try to derive the string step by step. Starting from S, I can expand S into NT15 and NT43. Let me write down the expansion tree and see if I can match all the terminals.\n\n1. Start with S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nNow, NT15 expands to NT37 and NT15 (from the production NT15 -> NT37 NT15). NT43 expands into NT6 and NT1 (from NT43 -> NT6 NT1). But wait, looking at the productions, I see:\n\nWait, looking through the productions, the right-hand side of NT15 is NT37 NT15. So NT15 can generate at least one NT37 and recursively another NT15. Similarly, NT43 is NT6 NT1, but let me check: NT43 -> NT6 NT1 or maybe I've misread. Wait, looking back: NT43 -> NT6 NT1 is correct because in the given grammar, NT43 -> NT6 NT1.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of productions. Let me cross-verify. Yes, under NT43: NT43 -> NT6 NT1. So S becomes NT15 NT43.\n\nNow, let's break it down:\n\n- NT15 expands to NT37 and another NT15, so it's like NT37 NT15.\n- Then, NT43 is NT6 NT1.\n\nSo the entire expansion becomes: NT37 NT15 NT6 NT1.\n\nNow, the first symbol in the string is 't88'. But wait, what does NT37 produce? Looking through the productions, I see NT37 has several rules, but the terminal productions are limited. For example, there's NT37 -> NT19 NT19, and sometimes other non-terminals. But one production I see is NT37 -> 't12' (as per the list, under NT37: one of the productions is NT37 -> 't12'). Similarly, NT19 has a production to 't13' (under NT19: one of the productions is 't13').\n\nWait, looking through the entire grammar, each non-terminal can either produce another two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get a 't' symbol, it needs to eventually produce a terminal. So in the case of NT37, I see one production leads to a terminal 't12' and others go further into non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's go back. The string starts with 't88'. So we need to find a derivation that starts with 't88'. Let me check the productions for NT37: Yes, NT37 -> 't12' and also NT37 -> NT19 NT19. So perhaps the first NT37 can produce 't12'?\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't88', which doesn't match 't12'. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The initial rule is S -> NT15 NT43. Let me make sure I read the production correctly. Yes, S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nWait, then NT15 expands to NT37 and another NT15. So the start is NT15 NT43 becomes NT37 NT15 NT6 NT1.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't88', which corresponds to NT24? Wait, let me check. Looking through the terminals:\n\nFrom NT24: In the productions, I see NT24 -> 't55' and other non-terminals. Or perhaps I'm confusing the non-terminals with terminals here.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see several terminals like NT5 -> 't2', NT4 -> 't48', etc. So these are the terminal replacements.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a mapping: each non-terminal can be replaced by a terminal string or other non-terminals. The terminals are those with 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, for example, NT27 -> 't18' (as per the list under NT27). Similarly, NT37 -> 't12', and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial step is S -> NT15 NT43, which becomes NT37 NT15 NT6 NT1. But the first symbol is 't88', which is a terminal from NT24. So I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar and the string more carefully.\n\nWait, the string is `t88 t37 t13 t89 t90 t67 t6 t44 t69 t24 t89 t16 t5 t39 t38 t18 t41 t88 t4`. Let me count the tokens: that's 19 tokens. The structure must be such that starting from S, the expansion results in this sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting symbol S expands in a way that each NT can produce a terminal or further non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach is to build the parsing tree by looking for the leftmost derivation. Let me see.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which parses context-free grammars in CNF. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's suitable for CYK.\n\nBut I'm not very familiar with implementing CYK manually. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can track the possible non-terminals that can generate each part of the string.\n\nStarting from S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo after the first step, we have NT15 NT43.\n\nNow, NT15 can be expanded to NT37 NT15, as per production NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So, S -> NT37 NT15 NT43.\n\nNext, NT43 can be expanded to NT6 NT1. So, S becomes NT37 NT15 NT6 NT1.\n\nNow, the string so far: The first terminal is 't88', which should be generated by one of these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the expansions:\n\n- NT37 can produce 't12'\n- NT15 can produce 't39' (from NT15 -> NT24? Wait, no, NT15's production is NT37 NT15, so it's more about the terminal generated. Wait, looking at NT15's terminal productions: in the list, NT15: no terminal production directly. Because in the list, NT15's productions go into NT37 and NT15, but perhaps I'm missing a terminal production.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I need to check each non-terminal for any terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT50: no terminal\nNT51: production to NT50 NT20 and others\nWait, in the list provided, most non-terminals have productions that result in other non-terminals, except for some that go to terminals.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nFor example, under NT24, we have NT24 -> 't5' and others. Wait, under NT24: Yes, production NT24 -> 't55' and NT24 -> 't5' (Wait, no, looking again, I think under NT24, the productions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar list provided:\n\n- NT24: -> 't55' (1st line under NT24?), -> 't5'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misnumbering the rules, but wait: under NT24, I see:\n\nLooking back, the grammar list provided is:\n\nNT24 -> 't55'\n\nNT24 -> 't5'\n\nSo NT24 can produce terminal 't55' or 't5'.\n\nBut wait, according to the provided grammar:\n\n- NT24 -> 't55' (line somewhere)\n\n- NT24 -> 't5' (line later in the list)\n\nSo yes, NT24 has terminal productions 't55' and 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals have"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The provided grammar is all in CNF because each production produces two symbols on the right side. Also, some of these productions are directly to terminals, like NT24 \u2192 't55'.\n\nSo, the task is to see if the string can be split into non-terminals that match the production rules. \n\nI think the first step is to look at the string and see which terminal symbols are present. But wait, maybe it's better to reconstruct a parse tree starting from S and see if we can reach the given string.\n\nThe string has 24 tokens (since each `tX` or something like `t54` is a token). Now, in a CNF grammar, each production has exactly two symbols on the right side. So, each step of derivation splits a non-terminal into two, either two non-terminals or a terminal and another non-terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are A \u2192 BC where A is a non-terminal and B and C can be non-terminals or terminals? Wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, not terminals. But in the given grammar, some rules end with a terminal, like NT24 \u2192 't55'. Hmm, wait, perhaps the grammar isn't strictly Chomsky Normal Form because some productions have a terminal as part of the right-hand side. Oh, I think sometimes CNF allows A \u2192 a where a is a terminal, but perhaps that's a different form. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production must produce exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So, I think the given grammar is in (Extended?) Chomsky Normal Form since all rules have two symbols on the right.\n\nSo, each production, when applied, replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So, starting from S, each step doubles the number of symbols until we reach the terminals. \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to work backwards from the string and see if we can match it to the production rules. Since the given string is all terminals, we need to see if it can be generated by applying the production rules until we reach all terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t54 t13 t87 t89 t67 t90 t88 t7 t90 t24 t67 t39 t36 t72 t7 t72 t99 t87 t2 t16 t24 t38 t4 t38. That's 24 tokens.\n\nEach step of application in the grammar leads to a string with twice the number of symbols, but since the initial S starts with 1 symbol, the total number of symbols at each step would be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. However, our string has 24 symbols, which is not a power of 2. So, maybe this string can't be generated by any such grammar because 24 is not 2^n. Wait, 2^4=16, 2^5=32. So 24 is in between, which is not a power of two, so the string's length can't be built from the grammar starting from S. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let's think: Starting from S, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So the number of symbols after each step is indeed a power of two. The initial string has 1 symbol (S). After one step, two symbols. After two steps, four, then eight, then sixteen, thirty-two, etc. So the possible string lengths are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. But the given string has 24 symbols, which isn't a power of two, so it can't be generated.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it's 24 tokens, so if the grammar is indeed in CNF, the string's length would have to be a power of two, which it isn't. Therefore, the answer must be No, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem isn't as straightforward. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nFor example, if S is the start symbol, then after one production, the string would be two terminals, right? Wait, but the grammar's rules aren't all at the same level. Some start with two non-terminals. Hmm, no, initial S can produce two non-terminals, each of which can be replaced in subsequent steps. So, perhaps the string can be derived through multiple productions, and each split may involve non-terminals. \n\nBut regardless, the total number of symbols is crucial. If we have a string of length 24, then for it to be in the language, it must have been derived by a series of splits that result in exactly 24 symbols. But the initial symbol is S, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (could be terminals or non-terminals), so the total number of symbols starts at 1, then after each split, the count is multiplied by 2, but if some steps involve replacing non-terminals, then the number of non-terminals may decrease, but the total length increases as 2^n.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think again. Let's take an example: If S \u2192 A B.\n\nThen, A can be further split into, say, C D, and B into E F. Now, the string becomes C D E F, which is length 4.\n\nSimilarly, if any non-terminal is replaced, each replacement effectively adds a non-terminal or terminal, but as the process continues, the number of symbols can be variable. Wait, no, in CNF, each step doubles the number of symbols because each non-terminal produces two symbols. Wait, no, each production is A \u2192 BC, where BC could be two terminals, two non-terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but the total number of symbols increases with each step. Let me clarify:\n\n- Start with 1 symbol (S).\n\n- After one step, S is replaced by two symbols, so length 2.\n\n- Each subsequent replacement step replaces each non-terminal with two symbols, but only non-terminals, because terminals are not replaced.\n\nSo, suppose after two steps:\n\n- If after first step, the string is terminal1 terminal2.\n\nWait, no, because S can be replaced by two non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's do a small example:\n\nAssume S \u2192 A B, with A \u2192 t1 t2 and B \u2192 t3 t4.\n\nThen, the derivation would be:\n\nS \u2192 A B \u2192 t1 t2 t3 t4.\n\nSo the length is 4.\n\nAlternatively, if A is t1 t2 and B is A C, then C might produce t3 t4. Then the derivation would be S \u2192 A B \u2192 t1 t2 A C \u2192 t1 t2 (t1 t2) C \u2192 continue, resulting in a longer string.\n\nWait, but in this case, each split replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. So, for example, if we have A \u2192 B C, then B \u2192 t1 t2, and C \u2192 t3 t4.\n\nDerivation steps:\n\nS \u2192 A B \u2192 (B C) t1 t2 \u2192 t1 t2 C t1 t2 \u2192 C is replaced to t3 t4 \u2192 t1 t2 t3 t4 t1 t2. So the string becomes 6 symbols. \n\nWait, now, this seems to suggest that the total number of symbols depends on the number of terminals introduced. But in the initial example, the string length was 4. In this example, the length is 6.\n\nBut in any case, the key point is that the number of symbols can vary, but whether it can reach 24. However, 24 isn't a power of two, but earlier examples can have non-powers. So, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up. Let me try to think differently: The number of symbols after n steps is 1*2^n, but only if each step replaces a single non-terminal. However, if multiple non-terminals are present at each step, the number might be 2^n where n is the number of productions made. Wait, that seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of symbols is always a power of two because each split doubles the symbols.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S. I'll need to see how the string can be derived from S.\n\nFirst, let's look at the string. It consists of a sequence of \"t\" followed by numbers. These could be terminal symbols. Let's count the tokens:\n\nt55, t87, t12, t39, t38, t90, t90, t28, t39, t88, t55, t91, t63, t39, t31, t33, t38, t12, t63, t72, t91, t63, t36, t63.\n\nThat's 24 tokens. Each \"t\" is followed by a number, so each token is a terminal symbol. Now, looking at the grammar, I see many production rules that yield terminal symbols directly. For example:\n\n- Some rules like NT5 -> NT1 NT32 eventually resolve to 't2' (from NT4 -> 't48', NT5 -> 't5', etc.)\n- Others like NT9 -> 't4' because NT29 -> NT28 NT48, and both rules for NT28 and NT48 yield 't67' and 't4', but wait, let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some NT rules directly resolve to terminals:\n\n- NT4 -> 't2' (because NT4's production is NT6 NT48, and NT48 is 't48', which ends up as 't88' because NT48 is 't63' -> 't72'... Wait, no, NT48 directly refers to NT48 in some rules. Let me see:\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- NT4 -> NT26 NT2 and also NT34 -> NT28 NT5. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to extract all the NT rules that lead to terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, if an NT symbol's RHS is two terminal symbols, it's like NT -> a b, where a and b are terminals. Similarly, some productions are NT -> NT1 NT2, but if both NT1 and NT2 eventually resolve to terminals, then the whole production is also a terminal string.\n\nLet me first identify which NT rules produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT52 -> 't44' (but also has other rules, so sometimes it's terminal, sometimes not)\nWait, no. Wait, each rule is separate. For example, NT52 has multiple production rules:\n\n- NT52 -> NT6 NT25\n- NT52 -> NT27 NT12\n- NT9 -> NT52 NT4\nWait, no, I'm looking at the grammar rules you provided. Let me look carefully:\n\nI see NT52 has two rules:\n\n- NT52 -> NT6 NT25\n- NT52 -> NT6 NT25 is that correct? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait no, the initial grammar lists many rules. Let me parse the grammar:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see NT rules and sometimes they produce other NT rules or sometimes a terminal symbol followed by another symbol.\n\nFor example, NT42 -> 't5', which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 has a rule: NT24 -> 't55'. Yes, so for NT24, one of its production rules is NT24 -> 't55', so that NT24 can produce 't55' directly.\n\nOther NT rules produce terminals:\n\n- NT13 -> 't39'\n- NT5 -> 't7'\n- NT42 -> 't5'\n- NT28 -> 't67' but then NT67 is a terminal?\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT44 -> 't6', NT42 -> 't5', etc. Let me list all NT rules that have a terminal in their RHS:\n\nWait, looking at the provided rules:\n\n- NT52 -> 't44' (if it has this rule)\n- NT32 -> 't83'\n- NT24 -> 't55'\n- NT24 -> 't5' (from another rule)\n- NT5 -> 't7'\n- NT42 -> 't5'\n- NT48 -> 't88'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT51 -> 't90'\n- NT48 -> 't87' (multiple rules)\n- NT6 -> 't16'\n- NT36 -> 't84'\n- NT38 -> 't12'\n- NT31 -> 't91'\n- NT38 -> 't37'\n- NT30 -> 't39'\n- NT41 -> 't31' (which is a terminal)\n- NT24 -> 't55' again\n- Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all NT productions that result in a terminal. Looking through the grammar, some produce terminals, others don't.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT42 -> 't5' (terminal)\n- NT53? Wait, NT24 has a rule NT24 -> 't55', yes. So NT24 can produce 't55' directly.\n\nLooking back at the string, the first token is 't55', so it must come from NT24's production rule. So from S, which is NT15 -> NT37 NT15, but that might complicate things. Let's try to find the derivation.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by building the derivation tree step by step. But given the string length, that's 24 tokens, maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, I can build the parse tree step by step, starting from the start symbol S, and see if I can reach the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can map the string back to the NT rules. Since the string consists of \"t55 t87 t12 t39...\" etc., each token is produced by an NT symbol.\n\nLet me try to see how these tokens correspond to NT rules.\n\nFirst token is 't55', which comes from NT24. So let's see if S can produce NT24 somewhere.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S:\n\nS -> NT15 NT1\nWait, no, first look:\n\nWait, S -> NT15 NT1. So S is divided into two parts: NT15 and NT1. So if S produces NT15 followed by NT1, each of which can generate a string. So for example, if NT15 generates a string of 't55', then NT1 must generate the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't55', which is from NT24. But S is NT15 followed by NT1, so 't55' would have to come from NT15. But looking at NT15's productions, I don't see a rule that starts with NT15 -> something that includes 't55'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT15 has a rule: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. That would loop unless it terminates. There's another rule NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which could lead to a loop. Wait, is there another production for NT15?\n\nYes: NT15 -> NT25 NT47\n\nWait, so from NT15, you can go to NT25 and NT47. But NT25's rules: NT25 can go to NT13 and NT47, or NT48 and NT35.\n\nBut getting 't55' would require NT24 to be in the derivation. Unless there is a way to get from NT15 to NT24.\n\nBut looking at NT15's rules: NT15 -> NT37 NT15 or NT25 NT47. So it doesn't directly go to NT24. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can be split as NT15 NT1, and NT15 produces the first part, NT1 the second.\n\nLooking at the string: 't55 t87 t12 t39 t38 t90 t90 t28 t39 t88 t55 t91 t63 t39 t31 t33 t38 t12 t63 t72 t91 t63 t36 t63'.\n\nThe first token is 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check the production rules for NT15 and NT43.\n\nFrom thegrammar:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nBut then wait, NT19 has two productions: NT19 -> NT51 NT19 and NT19 -> NT13 NT38. So that might complicate things. But also, looking further, NT13 -> 't39', and NT38 has several productions, including some that lead to terminals and some that don't.

Let me find the production for NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nNT15's production leads into NT37 and itself, which suggests that NT15 might derive a string with 't39' (since NT13 is 't39' and maybe NT37 can lead to it).\n\nWait, but I need to see how the string starts. The first token is t12, which is part of the S production's first component, which is NT15. So does NT15 ever derive t12?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a direct production for NT15 that ends with 't12'. Wait, let me check all the NT15 productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nLooking at the other rules, where do NT37 or NT35 or others lead to 't12'? \n\nWait, I think I might need a different approach. Let's see, the start symbol S produces NT15 and NT43. So the string must start with whatever NT15 can produce followed by whatever NT43 can produce. So perhaps we can break this down into two parts, each part corresponding to NT15 and NT43.\n\nWait, no, because in the string, it's a single sequence without delimiters, so the whole string must be a single derivation starting from S, which is NT15NT43. So the entire string must be the concatenation of two parts: one derived from NT15 and another from NT43, but both are in the same string.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, S produces NT15 NT43, which is then the entire string. So the entire string is the concatenation of the two sequences generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nTherefore, the string must consist of two parts: the first part derived from NT15 and the second from NT43.\n\nLooking at the string: t12 t55 t24 t48 t12 t65 t38 t72 t2 t90 t88 t67 t4 t99 t4 t5 t99 t91 t83 t7 t55 t5 t12 t37 t83.\n\nFirst part (NT15): t12, t55, t24, t48, t12, t65, t38, t72, t2, t90, t88, t67, t4, t99, t4, t5, t99, t91, t83, t7, t55, t5, t12, t37, t83.\n\nWait, that's a lot of tokens, but I'll check if the first part can be generated by NT15 and the rest by NT43.\n\nBut let me see the productions for NT15 and NT43.\n\nStarting with NT15: the first production is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So NT15 can be broken down into NT37 followed by NT15. Since this allows for recursion, it's likely to create a long string of terminals, especially since NT37 can produce NT19 NT19, which can in turn break down further.\n\nBut to get t12, I need to find a path where a non-terminal ends with t12.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT28 has a production that can lead to t67 (e.g., NT28-> 't67' and NT24-> 't55').

{"custom_id":"request-454","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. The string is \"t12 t13 t91 t2 t18 t28 t87 t36 t12 t84 t33 t2 t24 t63 t38 t12 t87 t18 t84 t67 t41 t65 t69 t13 t44\". Hmm, that's a lot of tokens, but I need to parse through each one and see if they can be derived from the grammar rules provided.\n\nFirst, I think I should represent the grammar syntax tree or perhaps think about how each token in the string can be derived step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, all production rules produce two symbols, which makes parsing iterative and manageable.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's written with S as the start symbol, and all productions are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, actually, the grammar provided has some terminal symbols like 't44', 't6', etc., and non-terminals on the left-hand side. So it's a mixed case.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each non-terminal can produce two other non-terminals or a terminal. But looking at the provided grammar, some rules produce a non-terminal and a terminal. For example, NT44 -> 't6' and NT42 -> 't5'. So perhaps this grammar is actually left-limited or can handle some terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, but according to the standard Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So I think the given grammar actually includes both forms, with some rules producing two non-terminals and others producing a terminal. That's a bit unusual, but it's manageable.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the user presented some rules that might not follow CNF strictly. For example, NT52 \u2192 't44' is a production that produces a terminal, which is allowed in CNF. So the grammar includes both types of productions\u2014those that produce two non-terminals and those that produce a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, all the rules are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal? Or some produce two non-terminals and others produce a terminal? Let me check a few examples.\n\nLooking at NT44 \u2192 't6', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT19 \u2192 't44' is a terminal, and so on. So the grammar allows for productions where non-terminals can produce a terminal, which is necessary to generate terminal symbols in the string. That makes sense because terminal symbols are just leaves in the parse tree.\n\nSo the string consists of a series of terminal symbols, and we have to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nNow, since the string is quite long, I think the best approach is to try and work backwards, starting from the string and seeing if I can find a way to split it into the right sequence of productions. But given the string's length, I might need to try different splits to see where the grammar can apply.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that each production in the grammar splits a symbol into two, and thus each step of the derivation increases the number of symbols by one. Starting from S, after one step, we have two symbols. Then after each step, the number increases by one. The process continues until we have the same number of symbols as the input string.\n\nBut wait, the input string has 30 tokens. So the number of steps needed would be 29, which is a lot. That's impractical to check manually. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to split the string into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me look more closely at the grammar and see if I can identify any sub-strings in the given string that correspond to the terminals produced by non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nFor example, looking at NT28 \u2192 't67', so 't67' can be generated by NT28. Similarly, NT28 \u2192 't6' (from NT46?), wait, looking at NT46 \u2192 NT10 NT38, but I'm not sure. Let me go step by step.\n\nI'll try to list out the possible productions for each terminal in the string.\n\nThe string is: t12 t13 t91 t2 t18 t28 t87 t36 t12 t84 t33 t2 t24 t63 t38 t12 t87 t18 t84 t67 t41 t65 t69 t13 t44.\n\nThat's 30 tokens.\n\nFirst, let's think about which non-terminals can produce each terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, let's identify all the non-terminals that produce a terminal.\n\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47: non-terminal, not producing terminal.\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT28 NT48: non-terminal.\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT52: non-terminal.\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT23 NT44: NT23 (non-terminal) and NT44 (which is 't6', terminal).\n\nSo NT31 \u2192 NT23 (non-terminal) and 't6'.\n\nSimilarly, NT44 is a terminal, and NT52 is a terminal.\n\nSo looking at the string, whenever we have an instance of 't67', 't44', 't6', 't5', etc., these could come from specific non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT45 \u2192 't11', but that's not in the string. NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT38 \u2192 't51'\u2014wait, no, NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29. Hmm.\n\nLet me create a list of which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't44' (terminal)\n- NT42 \u2192 't5' (terminal)\n- NT40 \u2192 't65' (terminal)\n- NT47 \u2192 't16' or 't3' (looking at NT47 \u2192 NT27 NT6: NT27 can produce 't91' perhaps? Wait, NT47 \u2192 't16' perhaps not. Wait no, NT47 has two rules: NT47 \u2192 NT25 NT16, and NT47 \u2192 NT27 NT6. Wait, NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30, etc.\u2014I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should create a mapping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to see for each terminal in the string, which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't12' could come from NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48, but that would need to be part of a production. Or perhaps NT12 is a non-terminal that can produce 't12'\u2014wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT96 isn't present. Wait, looking at the grammar provided, I notice that NT51 \u2192 't90', which doesn't help. Hmm, maybe I need to trace through the possible derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a top-down approach. Starting from S, which is S \u2192 NT15 NT1 (from the first rule). So S \u2192 NT15 \u2192 then NT15 produces something.\n\nLooking at NT15's productions: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 or NT37 NT37. So NT15 expands into two NT37s. Then, each NT37 can expand further.\n\nWait, but NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 or NT19 NT19\u2014no, wait, looking back, the rules for NT37 are a bit more specific. Wait, let me check the original grammar.\n\nLooking at the user's provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 (twice?), but I think I might have misread it. Wait, looking at the grammar: the relevant lines are:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nNT37 -> NT37 NT37\n\nWait, no, actually, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nHere are the NT37 rules:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nNT37 -> NT37 NT37\n\nSo NT37 can produce two NT19s or two NT37s. But perhaps more importantly, in the string, we have terms like t12, t13, t91, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should identify for each token in the string which non-terminal it can come from.\n\nLet me list the tokens in the string:\n\n1. t12\n2. t13\n3. t91\n4. t2\n5. t18\n6. t28\n7. t87\n8. t36"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-474","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t5 t99 t12 t31 t90 t88 t84 t54 t55 t90 t11 t84 t54 t13 t6 t33 t2 t87 t87 t69 t38 t13 t41 t87 t91 t39`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar consists of several non-terminals (Ns) and terminals (tX), with S as the start symbol.\n\nThe string is made up of these terminals: t5, t99, t12, etc. My job is to see if there's a derivation path starting from S that can produce this string.\n\nStarting with the grammar, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, S splits into NT15 and NT43. Each of these will have to derive into the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5, so perhaps NT15 is responsible for generating the part before NT43. Wait, but S is split into two parts, NT15 and NT43, so the string should have two parts separated by something, but in the given string, it's all consecutive t's. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, maybe each NT production corresponds to a sequence of terminals. Let me look at the productions:\n\nFor example, NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32. Each of these is a non-terminal that will expand further until they reach terminal symbols.\n\nI think I should start by breaking down the string into possible chunks that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt5 t99 t12 t31 t90 t88 t84 t54 t55 t90 t11 t84 t54 t13 t6 t33 t2 t87 t87 t69 t38 t13 t41 t87 t91 t39.\n\nLet me consider that each pair of non-terminals from S's rule (S \u2192 NT15 NT43) should each generate a part of the string, separated by nothing since it's all tokens connected. So the string is effectively a sequence of these two parts.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the string is just a list of tokens without any split into two parts. Maybe each NT15 and NT43 generate their own sequences, which together make up the string.\n\nWait, no, because in the grammar, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which would mean that the entire string should be the concatenation of NT15's string and NT43's string.\n\nBut looking at the given string, it's a single sequence. Hmmm. Maybe I need to split the string into two parts where the first part is generated by NT15 and the second by NT43.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens.\n\nThe string has 27 tokens. So perhaps NT15 generates the first k tokens, and NT43 generates the remaining 27 - k tokens. I need to check if such a split exists.\n\nBut wait, looking at the productions, each NT production splits into two other non-terminals or terminals. So each step would produce two parts, and this can continue until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut given that, the problem becomes whether the entire string can be derived by splitting S into NT15 and NT43, each expanding into parts that together form the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long for such a grammar, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to see possible expansions for NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Oh, wait, that's a recursive production. So NT15 can keep expanding into more NT37 and NT15, which might eventually lead to terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 has several productions. Let's look at NT43:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1, which is a terminal (Wait, looking back, the productions: NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1). Wait, NT6 is another non-terminal, so then NT6 must expand into terminals.\n\nLet me see all the productions for NT50, etc., and figure out the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write down the entire parse tree or find if the string can be matched by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to track back from the string. Each token in the string must come from a non-terminal that eventually produces that token.\n\nFor example, the first token is t5. So in NT15's expansion, one of the leaves must be t5.\n\nLooking at NT5's productions, NT5 \u2192 NT52 NT4. And NT4 \u2192 t48, but that seems not matching.\n\nWait, let's look at the given string again. The string starts with t5, so the first symbol must be produced by a production that generates t5.\n\nLooking for any production that ends with t5. For example, looking at NT5's productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that some NTs end with t. Let me check the productions that end with t.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT46 NT25\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47\nNT13 \u2192 NT39\nWait, looking for where a terminal is generated, such as t5.\n\nLooking at NT52 \u2192 't44', but that's a terminal. Wait, in the given productions, I see NT52 \u2192 't44'. But I also see NT52 \u2192 NT6 NT25 (twice). Also, NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nWait, looking through the terminal productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t48\nNT42 \u2192 t5\nNT48 \u2192 t88\nWait, actually, the grammar's terminals are 'tX' as individual productions.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me first look at the grammar structure to understand how the productions work.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, the entire string should start with the result of NT15 and NT43. NT15's production is NT37 NT15, and NT43 is NT27 NT0. So, each of those NTs might further decompose.\n\nLooking at the tokens, the string starts with t7, then t65, t91, t16, t6, t31, and so on. The production NT44 is 't6' and NT42 is 't5'. Oh, wait, the NT52 has a production to 't44', and NT44 to 't6'. So maybe some of these terminals are part of the derivation.\n\nI should break down the string into parts that might match the grammar rules. Let me list the string tokens: t7, t65, t91, t16, t6, t31, t91, t63, t84, t87, t24, t99, t87, t7, t12, t90, t3, t33, t65, t38, t67, t48, t2, t91, t6, t13.\n\nWait, that's 25 tokens. Let me see how the grammar could generate this. Starting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT15 could keep expanding. NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0.\n\nNow, looking at the terminals: t37 is a terminal from NT37. For NT43, nt27 might produce something that eventually leads to t44.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Alternative approach: use a CYK algorithm? But since the grammar might be ambiguous, it's complex. Alternatively, attempt to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The first symbol is t7. Looking at the productions, NT27 can produce t44 if it's NT52. Wait, but NT27's productions include NT17 NT45, NT37 NT45, etc. Not immediately a terminal.\n\nWait, NT27 has a production to 't44' as part of NT52? Or is NT27 a different NT? Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't44' (as per NT27's production in some cases, wait, no. Wait, the grammar has several entries. For example, NT27 \u2192 't44' is under some specific production? Wait no, I need to check the provided productions.\n\nLooking at the productions provided, each line is an NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ or NTX is a terminal. So for instance, NT44 \u2192 't6' and NT42 \u2192 't5'. NT52 has a production to 't44' and another to 't6'. Wait, looking at the first part of the productions:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT6 NT25\nNT44 \u2192 NT47 NT27\nWait, no. Let me go through all the productions to see which are terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't52' \u2192 Wait no, it's NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4.\n\nLooking more carefully: the lines that end with a terminal are:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't44' (I think, because NT52 \u2192 NT6 NT25, which then may produce 't44').\nWait, actually, the productions with terminals are:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't2' (from NT42's production? Not sure. Let me see each line.\n\nList of productions ending with terminals:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't44' \u2192 Check the productions for NT52. Wait, looking through the provided grammar:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT6 NT25\nNT52 \u2192 NT27 NT12\n\nSo those are the productions for NT52. No direct 't44' from NT52. But looking for which NT is 't44' is from NT44 \u2192 't6'. Wait, so how does that fit? Or perhaps I'm mixing NTs and terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NTs have productions that are directly terminals. For example, NT44's production is NT47 NT27, but also, looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT16 \u2192 't6' \u2192 No, wait, looking through:\n\nLooking at each line, lines like:\n\nNT16 \u2192 't6' and some others.\n\nSo for example, the production NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34, so that's not a terminal. But other NTs have terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through all lines:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't35 NT35' doesn't produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no, let's look for any NT that directly produce a terminal, like in the form NTX \u2192 't#' where # is some number.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't6' (yes, line: NT16 \u2192 't6')\n- NT44 \u2192 't6' (yes)\n- NT52 \u2192 't44' (no, NT52's productions are NT6 NT25 and NT27 NT12; 't44' is from NT44)\n- Wait, let's scan again carefully.\n\nWait, some lines have 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT44 \u2192 't6' is a production.\n\nWait, line: NT16 \u2192 't6', NT44 \u2192 't6', but I also see NT37 \u2192 't12', NT28 \u2192 't4', etc. So, several NTs produce terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT7 has a production to 't35 NT35', but that's not a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-494","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of symbols, some of which are terminals and others (like 'S', 'NT15', etc.) are non-terminals. \n\nLet me start by recalling what CNF is. CNF is a form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn\u2019t appear on the right-hand side of any production. Looking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. So it\u2019s definitely in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t69 t16 t37 t11 t28 t69 t7 t90 t83 t91 t18 t67 t69 t11 t31 t13 t67 t44 t84 t83 t48 t12 t63 t54 t6 t31`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with non-terminals like t54, t69, etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, each symbol in the string (excluding the 't' ones) must be produced by a production that directly outputs it. \n\nI need to map each terminal (like 't54') to a production in the grammar. Let's go through each symbol in the string:\n\n1. t54: Looking through the grammar, I see NT52 produces 't44', but that's not t54. Wait, looking further, I see that NT52 can also produce 't6', but that's not helping. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, wait, there's a production for NT58? No, wait, the grammar doesn't have NT58. Let me look for any production where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that can produce 't54'. Looking through the productions, I see that there's a production for NT37 \u2192 't12'. So t12 would be from NT37. But I don't see a production for 't54'. That's a problem because the string starts with 't54', which isn't matched by any production in the grammar. Wait, let me check again. The string is `t54 t69 t16...`.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. The string consists of 't' followed by numbers. Let me check where 't54' comes from. Looking at the entire grammar, I go through each production to see if any non-terminal produces 't54'. \n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT37 \u2192 't12', NT34 \u2192 't87', NT1 \u2192 't24', NT4 \u2192 't48', NT29 \u2192 't63', NT5 \u2192 't2', etc. I don't see any production that produces 't54'. So that's a red flag. If the first symbol is 't54', and there's no production that can generate 't54', then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a production. Let me go through the grammar carefully. Scanning all the productions, I don't see any where the right-hand side directly produces 't54'. Each non-terminal on the right side has either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT43, which eventually might generate a string, but not sure if it can produce 't54' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't54', which would have to come from a production that directly outputs it, like NTk \u2192 't54', but I don't see any such production in the grammar. So the first symbol is impossible to derive, making the entire string invalid. \n\nI can conclude that since the string starts with 't54' and there's no production in the grammar that can generate 't54' directly, the string is not in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, ending with 't36 t38 t65 ...' etc. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive. I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, denoted by productions ending with ';', for example, NT44 \u2192 't6'. These are the leaf nodes in the parse tree. The string provided consists entirely of such terminals, which suggests that each element in the string must be derived directly from these productions.\n\nThe given string is: `t36 t38 t65 t18 t2 t91 t4 t48 t38 t65 t24 t38 t18 t16 t3 t65 t31 t87 t6 t28 t33 t55 t5 t90 t84 t7 t83`\n\nI should check if each of these terminals is directly produced by any of the non-terminals in the grammar. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst term: t36. Looking at the grammar, I see NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48. But neither NT42 nor NT48 are terminals, so t36 must be derived through a series of steps. However, looking for NT36 producing t36, I don't see NT36 \u2192 't36'. Similarly, other NTs might produce t36 through other rules. Wait, but in the grammar, NT36 is \u2192 NT42 NT48. So t36 isn't a terminal, meaning the string given can't be generated because it contains 't36', which would require NT36 to directly produce it, which it doesn't. Hmm, that might be a problem. But wait, looking back, actually, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I notice that some non-terminals end with ';', indicating terminals. For example, NT44 \u2192 't6', so t6 is a terminal. Similarly, NT42 \u2192 't5', so t5 is terminal. \n\nWait, but t36 is in the string. Is there any production rule that directly ends with t36? Looking through all the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t36. Therefore, t36 can't be derived from any rule in the grammar, which would mean the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check each non-terminal to see if it can produce the given terminals. Another approach is to see if the entire string can be derived using the given productions step by step. But that would require considering the entire string as a sequence of steps, which is quite complicated. However, since t36 is in the string and there's no production for a non-terminal that directly produces t36, this seems to indicate that the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since 't36' is in the string and there's no rule that directly produces it, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens: `t5 t24 t99 t3 t99 t67 t90 t2 t24 t12 t41 t87 t16 t4 t54 t44 t41 t11 t28 t7 t36 t89 t16 t33 t3 t18 t84 t69`. \n\nFirst, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), it only has productions of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are things like S, NT15, NT50, etc., and terminals are the 't' tokens followed by numbers. \n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT15 NT43, so the derivation begins with NT15 and NT43. Each of these non-terminals will need to be expanded into terminals or other non-terminals. \n\nThe string starts with t5, which is an early element. I'll need to see if that's generated first. Let me see which non-terminals expand to t5. Scanning the productions, NT5: I see NT5 -> 't2'. NT4: NT4 -> 't48' or NT4 -> 't88'. NT9: NT9 -> 't28'. NT1: NT1 -> 't24'. NT44: NT44 -> 't6'. So t5 is not directly produced by any production. Wait, no, looking back, NT5 might not be t5. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the list:\n\nNT5 -> 't2' \nNT4 -> 't48' or 't88'\nNT29 -> 't63'\nNT4 -> 't88' (I think I miswrote earlier)\nWait, let me go through the list carefully.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT5 -> 't2' (I might have numbered this wrong, but I'll proceed.)\n\nWait, actually, I'm looking for a production where the right side is t5. But looking through all the productions, I don't see any production that directly outputs 't5' in the right-hand side. Only one of the productions is NT52 -> 't44', NT44 -> 't6', etc. So, let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the list, is there a terminal 't5'? I see:\n\nNT2: 't7' \nNT4: 't48' or 't88'\nBut I don't see any 't5' in the productions. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the string starts with t5. But looking at the grammar, are there any productions that produce 't5'? Let me scan all the productions again for any 't5's.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see NT24: Not directly. Wait, NT24: several productions: 't5' appears in NT24's productions? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT24 appears to have several productions, including NT24 -> 't5' at one point. Wait, in the list, lines like:\n\n\"NT24 -> 't5'\" appear? Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking down the list:\n\nYes, here it is: \"NT24 -> 't5'\" is listed. So NT24 directly produces t5. Similarly, NT24 can produce other things as well, but here, the first token in the string is t5, so it's likely that the derivation starts with an NT24 that produces t5.\n\nSo, the string starts with t5, which must come from NT24 -> 't5'. Now, after t5, the next token is t24. So after t5, the next element is t24.\n\nWait, but in the string, the tokens are in order:\nt5, t24, t99, t3, t99, t67, t90, t2, t24, t12, t41, t87, t16, t4, t54, t44, t41, t11, t28, t7, t36, t89, t16, t33, t3, t18, t84, t69.\n\nWait, that's 28 tokens. Let me think about how the derivations would proceed. Let's consider that S -> NT15 NT43, so the initial production is S = NT15 NT43.\n\nBut the string is longer than two tokens; actually, each production is of the form NT X -> NT Y NT Z or NT X -> a (terminal). So, the entire string consists of 28 tokens, meaning that the initial S must expand into a sequence that is 28 tokens long.\n\nWait, no. Because each production is either a non-terminal or a terminal. But the string is a sequence of terminals. So the derivation must chain together the non-terminals, expanding them into terminals, until all are terminals.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production either generates a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, starting from S, which becomes NT15 NT43. Each step replaces a non-terminal with either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nThe string has 28 terminals, so the derivation tree must have a depth corresponding to the number of non-terminals needed to reach 28 terminals. But each non-terminal can expand into two non-terminals or a terminal. So each level of expansion can potentially double the number of nodes. Wait, but in practice, for a string of length n in a binary grammar (each rule replaces a symbol with two), the depth would be log2(n), but in this case, the grammar allows for some rules to produce two non-terminals and others to produce a single terminal. So, the number of steps is related to the string's length.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work backwards: parse the string from the end to the start, trying to find a derivation path.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can look for possible patterns or see if the string can be matched by the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t5, which comes from NT24 -> 't5'. So the first part is generated by NT24. Then the next token is t24, which implies that after NT24 produces t5, the next NT24 must produce t24. But wait, that can't be, because the same NT24 can't produce both t5 and t24 in the same derivation. So perhaps the initial production is wrong.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The string is t5 followed by t24. So the first token is t5 from NT24, and the next is t24. That implies that the next step must involve another NT24 producing t24. But that's possible if after the first NT24 produces t5, the second part is another NT24. But in the initial production, S -> NT15 NT43, so both NT15 and NT43 would each have to generate a sequence of tokens, leading up to the t5 and t24 in the string.\n\nWait, no, perhaps S -> NT15 NT43 is the start. So, the entire string is the concatenation of the strings generated by NT15 and NT43. So, the string starts with t5, which may come from NT15 or NT43. But let's check the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT15 -> NT37 NT15 (which is recursive and could lead to longer sequences), and NT15 -> NT37 NT37, but also NT15 can produce something else? Looking up:\n\nNT15's productions: \"NT15 -> NT37 NT15\" and \"NT15 -> NT37 NT37\". So NT15 can produce sequences involving NT37.\n\nLooking for where t5 comes in. But as before, t5 is only produced by NT24. So perhaps NT15 does not produce t5, so maybe the first t5 comes from NT43.\n\nLooking at NT43: \"NT43 -> NT27 NT0\" and \"NT43 -> NT0\" (I think I might have mixed the productions). Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nLooking for NT43:\n\n\"NT43 -> NT6 NT15\" [line 29]\nWait, line numbers might be off, but the provided list includes NT43: \"NT43 -> NT6 NT15\" and others.\n\nWait, actually, let's scan all NT43 productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT43: appears in two lines, \"NT43 -> FT...

{"custom_id":"request-536","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that context-free grammars are defined by a set of production rules, and they generate strings through a series of derivations. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, all the production rules are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that most of the production rules like S -> NT15 NT43 are in the form of two non-terminals. Some like NT52 -> 't44' have terminals on the right-hand side. So, this grammar uses terminals (letters like 't', numbers probably as digit-like) and non-terminals (NT followed by numbers).\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: \"t89 t54 t28 t28 t55 t3 t83 t91 t6 t6 t12 t28 t67 t41 t84 t28 t72 t48 t5 t55 t24 t24 t90 t69 t69 t99 t37 t65 t65\". It's a sequence of 33 tokens separated by spaces.\n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. The approach I think is to work backwards, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string, ensuring that each step matches the productions.\n\nChomsky normal form tells me that each production produces either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Let's see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT15 NT43\n- Now, each of NT15 and NT43 needs to be derived into some strings.\n\nLooking at NT15, the production is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 or NT15 \u2192 NT30 NT20. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nand NT15 -> NT30 NT20.\n\nWait, the second rule is NT15 \u2192 NT30 NT20. So, the first alternative is a loop, consuming more symbols. \n\nSimilarly, NT43 has production NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1 or NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0.\n\nOkay, so let's pick one. Hmm, perhaps it's better to break it down.\n\nWait, but wait... let's think of this as a recursive process. We have to replace the non-terminals step by step with their corresponding expansions until we end up with solely terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43, each of these non-terminals will produce sequences that eventually combine to form the target string.\n\nLooking at the given string, let's see how it can be split. The string is 33 tokens, but each production can contribute multiple tokens. So, perhaps the first step NT15 and NT43 can expand to parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t89, so maybe NT43 needs to expand to t89. Let's check what NT43 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT43: NT43 can be either NT6 NT1 or NT27 NT0.\n\nWait, let me see the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT43 has:\nNT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1 or NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0.\n\nSo, NT43 can produce either a sequence of two non-terminals (NT6 and NT1) or another sequence of two non-terminals (NT27 and NT0). Hmm, but how do these non-terminals connect to terminals?\n\nLooking further, NT0 can produce 't39' and 't65' as per rules NT0 -> 't39' and NT0 \u2192 't65'. Similarly, NT1 can produce 't24', NT5 can produce 't2', etc.\n\nWait, in the initial expansion, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so both NT15 and NT43 will each contribute some part of the string. Let's say that when you expand NT43, it eventually leads to t89 somewhere in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT43:\n\n- If it's NT6 NT1, then NT6 has production NT6 \u2192 't16' or other?\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through, NT6 has NT6-> 't16' as a production. So, NT6 can directly produce 't16'.\n\nSimilarly, NT1's productions:\n\nLooking back, NT1 has multiple rules like NT1 -> NT51 NT38, NT25..., but some terminals:\n\nWait, I'm seeing:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT26 NT2\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 | NT30 NT20\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1 | NT27 NT0\n\nOther non-terminals have productions leading to terminals. For example, NT52->'t44', NT51->'t90', etc.\n\nSo, let's try to map this.\n\nLet me try to represent the string as a possible expansion.\n\nGiven the string: t89 t54 t28 t28 t55 t3 t83 t91 t6 t6 t12 t28 t67 t41 t84 t28 t72 t48 t5 t55 t24 t24 t90 t69 t69 t99 t37 t65 t65.\n\nCount: 33 tokens, so 33 steps (since each non-terminal contributes at least one terminal or more non-terminals). So, perhaps the derivation would consist of 33 nodes, each corresponding to a token.\n\nBut working this out manually would be time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to see if each token can be matched by a terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo, I can check for each terminal token in the string whether it appears in the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are represented as something like 't89', 't54', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar's terminals, I have:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't16'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT29 \u2192 't63'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT9 \u2192 't28'\n- NT50 \u2192 't33'\n- NT12 \u2192 't16'\n- NT51 \u2192 't90'\n- NT48 \u2192 't87'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT34 \u2192 't87'\n- NT36 \u2192 't84'\n- NT21 \u2192 't99'\n- NT45 \u2192 't11'\n- NT19 \u2192 't13'\n- NT37 \u2192 't12'\n- NT51 \u2192 't38'\n- NT45 \u2192 't67'\n- NT36 \u2192 't41'\n- NT26 \u2192 't12'\n- NT5 \u2192 't7'\n- NT13 \u2192 't69'\n- NT21 \u2192 't13'\n- NT40 \u2192 't89'\n- NT28 \u2192 't4'\n- NT29 \u2192 't36'\n- NT1 \u2192 't37'\n- NT51 \u2192 't38'\n- NT6 \u2192 't16'\n- NT17 \u2192 't33'\n- NT19 \u2192 't54'\n- NT31 \u2192 't91'\n- NT23 \u2192 't7'\n- NT16 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, I'm looking for each token in the string and see if it's listed as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet's list the tokens:\n\nt89, t54, t28, t28, t55, t3, t83, t91, t6, t6, t12, t28, t67, t41, t84, t28, t72, t48, t5, t55, t24, t24, t90, t69, t69, t99, t37, t65, t65.\n\nNow, checking each:\n\nt89: Looking through the right-hand sides, is 't89' present?

{"custom_id":"request-532","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by that grammar. The string is a series of tokens with 't' followed by numbers. First, I need to understand how to approach this.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a single terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, I can see that the non-terminals (NTs) are producing other NTs and sometimes terminals like 't' with numbers. So, starting from the start symbol S, which is NT15, I need to see if through a series of expansions, I can derive the given string.\n\nThe string given is: t88 t37 t72 t69 t41 t6 t89 t7 t24 t13 t84 t67 t99 t24 t4 t18 t4 t83 t5 t39 t84 t84 t48 t6 t89 t89 t3 t91 t6.\n\nFirst, maybe I should identify the sequence of NTs that would expand to this string. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to try and parse the string using the grammar, checking if each part can be derived from the NTs.\n\nI'll start by looking for the initial symbol, which is S -> NT15 NT43, so the string should start with the combination of NT15 and NT43 expansions. Let me check if the first token in the string is t88 or if it can be generated from NT15 or NT43.\n\nWait, the first token is t88. Let me see which NTs expand to t88. Looking at the rules, I see NT4 -> t48, but that's not t88. Hmm, looking further, NT52 -> t44, but that's another case. Also, NT9 -> NT52 NT4, etc. Oh, actually, the last rule I see under NT4 is NT4 -> t88. So NT4 can directly produce t88.\n\nSo, if the first token is t88, it must come from NT4. Now, let's trace how NT4 can be produced. From the rules, I see NT4 -> t88, so NT4 is a terminal here. Now, looking back at the grammar, I need to see how NT4 is derived. The grammar shows NT4 -> t88, so that's a terminal. Therefore, the initial step would be to see if the string can be formed starting with NT4.\n\nWait, but S starts with NT15 NT43. So unless NT15 can produce something that leads to NT4 in the first step, which seems unlikely because NT15 is involved, perhaps the string starts with a t from NT4, which is a terminal. But S is NT15 NT43, which means S can only produce something that starts with NT15 and NT43 next.\n\nBut the string starts with NT4 \u2192 t88. That might be a problem because S can't directly start with t88 unless there's a way to expand S into something that includes a terminal at the beginning, but the way the grammar is structured, S directly expands into NT15 NT43, so the first two symbols would start with NT15 and NT43.\n\nWait, this might mean that the string doesn't start with NT15 NT43, so it's invalid. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to expand S into something that results in t88 as the first symbol. But looking at S's production, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which is two non-terminals. This would produce two strings next to each other. So the first two are what's derived from NT15 and NT43, respectively.\n\nIn the given string, the first symbol is t88, so for the string to start with that, one of the NTs (either NT15 or NT43) must directly produce t88. Let's check NT15: Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT15 directly producing t88. Let me double-check the rules for NT15. Hmm, in the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 t88, but NT15 is defined as NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which doesn't help. So NT15 can't produce t88 on its own. How about NT43? Let's see, NT43 is defined as NT43 -> NT6 NT1. NT6 might produce something, but does it include t88? Checking NT6's rules: I don't see NT6 producing any terminals except possibly elsewhere. Wait, looking earlier, I see NT1 -> t24, but that's not relevant here. Maybe in other parts, but looking specifically, I don't recall any NT producing t88.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can't start with t88 because S can't directly produce that. So that might mean that the string is invalid, so the answer is No. But I should make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nWait, looking again at the provided rules, I see that the last rules are something like NT52 -> t44, NT42 -> t5, etc. Also, NT52 -> t6 NT25, but that's another terminal.\n\nLooking at the first production, S -> NT15 NT43. Let's see what NT15 and NT43 can produce.\n\nNT15 can be expanded to NT37 NT15, and so on. Let's follow a chain:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\nNT19 can be \u2192 NT51 NT19 or -> NT19 NT19, which seems to loop. Alternatively, NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, but NT51 can be NT50 NT20, and so on. This could take a while, but it might not lead to a terminal immediately.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. Let's see what NT6 does. From the rules, NT6 is not defined as a terminal but has productions like NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT6 (wait, looking up, I see NT17 is defined elsewhere). Wait, let me see all NT rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for any NT in the production chain that can produce t88. From the rules, I see that NT24 \u2192 t55 and t5 in some cases, but that doesn't help. Oh, no, wait: Looking at NT4, it directly produces t88. So if any NT can expand to NT4, which then can produce t88, that would be a way.\n\nLooking back, what NTs can expand to NT4? Let me check the grammar rules. Maybe NT42 or something, but I see NT42 \u2192 t5. NT5 can be a non-terminal that somehow expands to NT4. Alternatively, perhaps NT4 is directly reachable from other NTs. Wait, in the given grammar, NT4 \u2192 t88. So if an NT can reduce to NT4, that would give a t88.\n\nSo, to get t88, the NT must eventually expand to NT4. But wait, S is NT15 NT43. Let's see, what's NT15? NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. NT19 can be NT51 NT19 or NT19 NT19, which doesn't seem to produce a terminal. Alternatively, NT19 \u2192 NT19 NT19, so it might loop. That might not be helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. If S is NT15 NT43, and both are non-terminals, expanding them would produce sequences that are two symbols long, not a single token. So the string's first token is t88, but S can't directly produce a single symbol t88 because it's not a terminal itself. All edges in the start symbol go to two non-terminals, which would mean the string must start with two symbols, but in this case, it starts with one symbol t88. So that suggests that the string can't be generated by this grammar, hence the answer is No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through expansion of S into NT15 NT43, and then NT15 expanding into a longer chain that eventually reaches a point where the entire expansion starts with t88. But from NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, etc., it's unclear how that would produce a single t88 without another symbol following. It might require that both NT15 and NT43 expand in such a way to somehow have their expansions' first symbols be t88, which would require each NT to produce t88, but that seems unlikely.\n\nSo, perhaps the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with a single t88 symbol, and from S, you get exactly two non-terminals that expand into sequences, not a single symbol. Therefore, I think the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-553","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what the grammar is and the string I'm supposed to evaluate.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see a bunch of NTs (non-terminals) and some terminals like 't44', 't6', etc.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So every derivation starts with NT15 and NT43.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t24 t33 t89 t72 t87 t4 t5 t87 t5 t2 t67 t39 t12 t28 t99 t54 t24 t33 t88 t33 t91 t18 t99 t37 t4 t44 t67 t88 t83 t38`.\n\nThat's a sequence of 31 tokens. Let's list them one by one for clarity:\n\n1. t24\n2. t33\n3. t89\n4. t72\n5. t87\n6. t4\n7. t5\n8. t87\n9. t5\n10. t2\n11. t67\n12. t39\n13. t12\n14. t28\n15. t99\n16. t54\n17. t24\n18. t33\n19. t88\n20. t33\n21. t91\n22. t18\n23. t99\n24. t37\n25. t4\n26. t44\n27. t67\n28. t88\n29. t83\n30. t38\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, some NTs are directly transformed into terminals. For example, NT44 \u2192 t6, NT42 \u2192 t5, NT13 \u2192 t39, etc. It seems like each NT rule eventually reduces to a terminal symbol, except for some that might have longer derivations.\n\nMy approach will be to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if it can derive the given string. Since the string is quite long, this might take a while, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string must start with the expansions of NT15 and NT43.\n\nLet's see what NT15 and NT43 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Hmm, that's a recursive rule. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the rule is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that can't be right because it would lead to infinite recursion. Wait, no, perhaps it's a typo. Wait, looking back at the grammar, the rules are:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15.\n\nWait, that's a left-recursive rule, which means it might be problematic, but in CNF, we might have to handle it with a recursive descent parser or similar. But processing this could be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the rules.\n\nWait, checking the grammar again, the user provided a long list, so I need to search for NT15. It appears in two rules:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (line 15)\n- NT15 \u2192 NT19 NT30 (line 16)\n\nWait, no: looking at lines provided:\n\nLine 15: NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nLine 16: NT15 -> NT19 NT30\n\nAh, right. So NT15 has two productions: one that's recursive (NT37 NT15) and another that's NT19 NT30.\n\nSo when expanding NT15, we can take either. Since the string starts with t24, which is a terminal, we'll see which of the NTs can produce a t. Let's look at all the NTs and their terminal productions:\n\nFrom the user's grammar, there are several NTs that directly produce a single terminal:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t6\n- NT42 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t39\n- NT28 \u2192 t4\n- NT9 \u2192 t28\n- NT50 \u2192 t33 (from NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, which eventually may produce t33)\n- NT37 \u2192 t12 (Wait, no. Wait, reviewing the rules:\n\nLooking through all the NTs and their productions, I notice some that directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT5 NT30\n- NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45\n- NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23\n- NT29 \u2192 NT28 NT48\n- NT23 \u2192 NT2 NT50\n- NT19 \u2192 NT13 NT48\n- NT34 \u2192 NT32 NT2\n- NT29 \u2192 NT28 NT48\n- NT21 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n- NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20\n- NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20\n- NT1 \u2192 NT51 NT19\n- NT19 \u2192 NT13 NT48\n- NT44 \u2192 t6\n- NT42 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t39\n- NT21 \u2192 t13 (from NT21 \u2192 NT28 NT31, but no, wait, NT21 is another NT. Wait, perhaps I need to look deeper.)\n\nWait, perhaps some NTs are further expanded. Let me look at each NT and see if they can directly produce a terminal or eventually one.\n\nLooking through the rules, here's a summary of terminals in each NT's productions:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t6\n- NT42 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t39\n- NT28 \u2192 t4 (look at line NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23, but where does NT26 and NT23 lead? Wait, line NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34. NT24 can produce NT48 (line NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35), and so on. Alternatively, perhaps NT28 has a direct terminal. Wait, looking back: Oh, wait, in the provided list, NT28 is expanded in several ways, but none directly to a terminal. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, after line NT28, there's NT28 \u2192 NT6 NT17 (line 52 maybe?), and NT28 \u2192 NT46 NT8 (line 29?), and perhaps others. Wait, the user provided lines may be numbered, but perhaps I can't rely on line numbers. Instead, I should go through each NT and see which ones have a direct terminal.\n\nLooking back through the rules, perhaps it's better to see all the NTs that directly produce a terminal:\n\nFrom the user's grammar:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t6\n- NT42 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t39\n- NT28 \u2192 t4 (Wait, no, looking again: line for NT28 is at line 52: NT28 \u2192 NT6 NT17, line 53: NT28 \u2192 NT46 NT8, line 28: NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23, line 52 again: NT28 \u2192 NT0 NT13, and line 12: NT28 \u2192 NT21 NT48.\n\nWait, none of these produce a terminal directly. So perhaps NT28 does not directly produce a terminal but requires further expansion.\n\nSimilarly, NT37 \u2192 t12 (Wait, line NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45, which may eventually produce t12?

{"custom_id":"request-574","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing and analysis a bit easier. Each rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar provided. There are a bunch of production rules, and some of them directly produce terminals marked with 't'. For example, NT44 -> 't6', so whenever NT44 appears, it can be replaced by t6. Similarly, NT52 -> 't44', so NT52 becomes t44.\n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like t69 t31 t2 t36 etc. So each element in the string is a terminal symbol starting with 't' followed by a number. The task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first rule is S -> NT15 NT43. So the string must start with NT15 producing t69 and NT43 producing t36 because the first two elements are t69 and t36.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Because NT15 and NT43 could be non-terminals, so each could expand into multiple terminals. So let's think about how the string could be broken down.\n\nThe string is: t69 t31 t2 t36 t63 t18 t6 t67 t55 t7 t16 t91 t44 t99 t12 t37 t54 t89 t16 t12 t91 t89 t37 t2 t88 t41 t7 t4 t39 t37 t48.\n\nThat's 36 tokens. Let's see how the grammar can generate this.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since our string starts with t69, which is a terminal, that must come from a direct rule. Looking through the 't' rules, NT52 -> 't44' and NT44 -> 't6'. So, the only way to get t6 is via NT44. So if NT44 is part of the start symbol's initial expansion, say S -> NT15 NT43, then one of NT15 or NT43 must produce the leading t69.\n\nWait, but S starts as NT15 NT43, so the first step is to expand NT15 and NT43. Let's see what NT15 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. That's a recursive rule. Also, NT15 can directly produce 't69' because we have NT13 -> 't39' and some other rules, but wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the 't' rules, NT13 -> 't39'. But in the NT13 rule, I'm not sure if that's a production. Let me check: The grammar has NT13 -> 't39'. Wait, no: looking through the 't' productions, yes, there's an NT13 -> 't39'. But in the non-terminals, I need to see if NT13 is a production.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT13 -> 't39' is one of the productions. So NT13 can produce t39.\n\nBut the problem is, NT15 has a rule NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which is recursive. That suggests that NT15 can produce a sequence of two or more symbols, possibly leading to a t followed by others.\n\nBut wait, S starts as NT15 NT43. So to get t69 as the first symbol, one of these must produce t69. Wait, does any non-terminal produce t69? Looking at the 't' productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT52->'t44', NT44->'t6', NT13->'t39', NT28->'t67', NT24->'t55', etc. Hmm, I don't see any production that directly gives t69. So how can the first symbol be t69 unless NT15 or NT43 can produce a string that starts with t69.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in checking the 't' productions. Let me look again:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't5' (so that's t5)\n\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n\n- NT24->'t55' (Wait, is there a rule for NT24->'t55'? Or maybe NT24 can produce 't55'? Let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT24 -> 't55' appears in the list? Wait, in the list provided, I see:\n\nNT24 -> NT2 NT48\n\nNT24 -> NT48 NT35\n\nAnd in the 't' rules, NT24: Hmm, searching through the list, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, the 't' rules are as follows:\n\nI think in the list provided, for example, NT24 is part of multiple rules, but the 't' rules like NT25 -> 't47', etc., but I don't see NT24 directly mapping to a 't' term. Wait, let me check all the 't' rules:\n\nLooking through the entire list, I see:\n\nNT12 -> 't16', NT13 -> 't39', NT19 -> 't13', NT21 -> 't13', NT28 -> 't67', NT24 -> 't55', NT40 -> 't65', etc.\n\nWait, yes, there's NT24 -> 't55'. Yes, I see: \"NT24 -> \"t55\"\"? Let me check: Yes, here it is: \"NT24 -> NT48 NT35\" and also \"NT24 -> \"t5\"\".\n\nWait, no, let me check the list again:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n\"NT24 -> NT48 NT35\"\n\n\"NT24 -> \"t5\"\" \u2014 wait, that's correct? Let me see: I think I made a mistake earlier. I need to check each production carefully.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar list, I see:\n\nNT24 rules:\n\nNT24 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT24 -> NT24\n\nWait, no, the list says:\n\n\"NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35\"\n\n\"NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35\"\n\n\"NT24 \u2192 t5\" \u2014 no, that's not correct. Let's search for \"t5\".\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT44 -> 't6'\n\nNT13 -> 't39'\n\nNT28 -> 't67'\n\nNT24? Let me search for any 't5' rule.\n\nWait, I see: NT26->'t12', NT24->'t55', so yes, there's a rule NT24 -> 't55'. So NT24 can directly produce 't55' as well as other non-terminals.\n\nSo if S starts as NT15 NT43, then the first symbols must be derived from NT15 and NT43.\n\nNow, the first symbol in the string is t69. So either NT15 or NT43 must produce t69 or a sequence starting with t69.\n\nBut looking at the 't' rules, do any non-terminals produce t69? Let's check all the 't' productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT12->'t16'\n\nNT13->'t39'\n\nNT19->'t13'\n\nNT21->'t13'\n\nNT28->'t67'\n\nNT24->'t55'\n\nNT40->'t65'\n\nNT46->'t72'\n\nNT32->'t83'\n\nNT24->'t55'\n\nWait, I don't see any direct production that leads to 't69'. So the only way to get a 't69' symbol is through a non-terminal that can produce it. Or perhaps a series of rules that indirectly expand to 't69' via various steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps there's a path where NT15 expands to produce 't69' as part of a chain. But since NT15 has a recursive rule: NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which suggests that it can't directly produce any terminal except possibly t6 because of another rule. Wait, no, looking back, NT15's rules are:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nBut wait, the list says:\n\n\"NT15 -> NT37 NT15\""}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-571","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that most of the productions are splitting non-terminals into two other non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT15 NT43), except for some that directly produce terminals ('t' strings). \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t91 t89 t28 t48 t89 t88 t41 t72 t88 t63 t41 t83 t63 t83 t4 t38 t16 t11 t69 t24 t41 t7 t13 t2 t72 t87 t89 t2 t91 t84 t89`.\n\nHmm, that's a long string with 35 tokens. Since each production in the grammar splits into two non-terminals except for the terminals, the string length should be 2^n where n is the number of splittings. Wait, let me see: the initial S is producing two non-terminals, so each step should increase the count by one, but the string length is 35, which is 2^5 + 3. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, no. Each non-terminal produces either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the number of terminals should be n+1 where n is the number of non-terminals in the derivation. For example, starting from S, which splits into two, each of those could split again, etc., until you reach terminals. So the total number of terminals would be 2^k where k is the number of steps. But in this case, the string has 35 terminals, which is probably 2^some number minus 1 or something. Let's check powers of 2: 2^5=32, 2^6=64. 35 is not a power of two, which is concerning because the grammar in CNF should only produce strings with lengths that are powers of two. But wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me see: the string has 35 tokens, which is 35 terminals. So maybe the number of productions would be such that the number of non-terminals is 34, and the total terminals would be 35, which doesn't fit the 2^n pattern. That's odd. Maybe the string isn't in the language, so the answer would be No. But I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string could be broken down into a series of productions. Let's consider that. Each non-terminal expands into two others or a terminal. So the string must be built by replacing each non-terminal step by step, leading to all terminals. Let's try to parse the string from the end or see if it fits any of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't67'\n- NT15 \u2192 't39'\n- NT52 \u2192 't44' and 't27' (wait, there are two productions for NT52: NT52 \u2192 NT6 NT25 and NT52 \u2192 NT27 NT12. Also, NT52 \u2192 't44'). So NT52 can produce both a terminal and split into two non-terminals. Similarly, NT9 can produce 't28' or split into NT4 and NT52, etc.\n\nSo the string starts with 't91'. Let's see what NT91 could produce. Wait, looking through the productions, I don't see NT91 in the grammar. In fact, the non-terminals go from NT0 to NT55 and some others like NT9, NT10, etc., but I don't see NT91. So perhaps S can't produce NT91 because there's no production rule for it. But S produces NT15 and NT43, so unless NT15 and NT43 can produce a path that includes 't91', but I need to see if 't91' can be derived.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see that NT23 \u2192 NT5, NT26, but not sure. Let me check. NT23 \u2192 NT5? Looking back: no. Wait, in the productions, I see NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT26. So that's a split. NT5 produces 't2' and perhaps others.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't91'. So somewhere in the grammar, there must be a production where a non-terminal leads to 't91'. Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly leads to 't91'. The closest is NT7 \u2192 't35' and 't35', NT13 \u2192 't69', NT21 \u2192 't13', etc. Wait, looking at the terminal productions:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't44'\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT18 \u2192 't55'\n- NT24 \u2192 't18' (twice), 't55' (twice)\n- NT15 \u2192 't39'\n- NT27 \u2192 't67'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' (appears in some NT like NT4 \u2192 't26' and NT29 \u2192 't28' and NT9 \u2192 't52', etc.)\nWait, maybe 't91' can be derived from NT9, which is a terminal 't28' or splits, but I don't see NT91 as a terminal. Hmm, but in the string, there's a 't91' which doesn't appear in any terminal production rules, which suggests that either the grammar doesn't have a path leading to 't91', or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check the productions again. Oh, wait, NT41 \u2192 't38' and other splits. No, I don't think I've seen 't91' in any terminal productions. That's a problem. If the string contains 't91' but there's no way to produce that, then the string isn't in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe 't91' comes from some non-terminal that can split. Let me check if any NT can produce 't91' through splits. Looking through the productions, the only NT that comes close is NT19, which splits into NT12 and NT38, but the terminals are 't54' and 't13' perhaps. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38. Now, NT12 produces 't16' and 't48' (from NT12 \u2192 't16' and 't48'), so 't12' could be 't16' or 't48'. NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29, which then would split further, but 't51' is NT50 \u2192 't41' and NT43. Wait, NT51 \u2192 't90', 't40', etc. Hmm, maybe 't91' can't be derived because there's no NT that leads to it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't91' is part of some derivation. But looking at the productions, I don't see any NT that produces 't91' directly or through splits. Therefore, 't91' cannot be derived from any NT, so it's impossible for it to be in the language defined by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-595","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of symbols like `t65 t83 ...` and so on, until it ends. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has productions where each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. From the given grammar, I see that all productions are either binary, producing two non-terminals, or they produce terminals. So, I'm looking at a string where each symbol is either a terminal or the result of a non-terminal.\n\nThe string is `t65 t83 t87 t13 t3 t87 t3 t38 t28 t87 t41 t87 t11 t90 t4 t87 t87 t16 t5 t67 t65 t3 t16 t99 t44 t89 t16 t55 t39 t12 t4 t72`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the grammar rules.\n\nI recall that in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the derivation tree is a binary tree where leaves are terminals, and internal nodes are non-terminals. \n\nThe first step is to analyze the structure of the string. The string starts with t65, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I find that 't44', 't6', etc., are terminals. So, each symbol in the string must be either a direct terminal production or correspond to a non-terminal that can produce that terminal.\n\nI need to see if each terminal in the string appears in the grammar. For example, 't65' appears as one of the terminals, so that's fine. Similarly, other terminals like 't83', 't16', etc., are present in the grammar.\n\nBut the issue arises when the string has a combination of terminals and non-terminals that can't be directly mapped. Wait, no, because in the string, every symbol is a terminal as per the grammar. So, each symbol in the string should correspond to a rule that directly produces a terminal. But in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT44 \u2192 't6', etc.\n\nNow, looking at each symbol in the string, I need to see if it is a terminal that exists in the grammar. The terminals present are 't44', 't6', 't5', 't2', 't88', 't7', etc. Let me check each symbol:\n\nt65: Looking through the grammar, I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly produces 't65'. Checking the production rules, I don't see any terminal with 't65' as a result. So that's a problem because 't65' is not in the terminals defined in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe 't65' is the result of a production. Looking back, the grammar has lines like NT44 \u2192 't6', NT12 \u2192 't16', but I don't see a production that results in 't65'. So, 't65' is not a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because the first symbol is a terminal that doesn't appear in any production.\n\nSo, without even looking further, I can conclude that the string is not generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-591","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see many productions where non-terminals are split into two non-terminals.

Wait, but NT13 \u2192 t39 is a production, but t39 isn't in the string. Wait, no, the string has t54, etc., so t13 is a terminal. Let me check the grammar: NTT13 \u2192 t39? Wait, no, in the grammar, I see NT13 \u2192 t69, which is a terminal. So t13 would be produced directly if NT13 is present. Wait, but t13 isn't in the string as a terminal, so it's supposed to be produced by a non-terminal.\n\nWait, wait, let's clarify. The string is a sequence of terminals, which are the result of the grammar's leftmost derivations. So each element in the string must be a terminal that is directly produced by a production rule.\n\nLooking back, t13 is in the string. So, does any production produce t13? Looking at the grammar, I see NT13 \u2192 t69. So t13 is produced by NT13. But t69 is a terminal, so if t13 is in the string, it must have been produced directly. So t13 is in the string, which is produced by NT13. So this is correct.\n\n6. t16: Yes, present in grammar.\n7. t5: Yes, present.\n8. t5: Yes.\n9. t6: Yes, but wait, looking at the grammar, t6 appears as a terminal in NT4 and NT44. Hmm. Let me check the grammar: NT44 \u2192 't6', so t6 is produced by NT44. Also, there's NT6 \u2192 t16 and NT6 \u2192 t72, etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, the 9th element is t6. Let me track the string indices:\n\n1. t54\n2. t16\n3. t63\n4. t90\n5. t13\n6. t16\n7. t5\n8. t5\n9. t6\n10. t72\n11. t41\n12. t12\n13. t28\n14. t2\n15. t69\n16. t16\n17. t2\n18. t7\n19. t38\n20. t38\n21. t24\n22. t6\n23. t24\n24. t63\n25. t6\n26. t36\n27. t91\n28. t54\n29. t87\n30. t11\n31. t99\n32. t88\n\nSo position 9 is t6. Looking at the grammar, t6 is a terminal in NT6, which has production rules: NT6 \u2192 t16 or t72, etc. Wait, no: in the grammar, NT5 \u2192 t7, NT6 \u2192 t16, etc. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, the NT6 seems to be present as part of other productions. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT6: Let me scan through. Yes, here's NT6 \u2192 t16, and also NT6 \u2192 t72. So t6 is produced by NT6 when it produces either t16 or t72. Wait, but in the string, it's t6, so does any production produce t6 directly? Looking through the grammar, I don't see a production that directly produces t6. Wait, but looking further: NT5 \u2192 t7, NT13 \u2192 t69, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any production that directly results in 't6' except where NT6 is a non-terminal. So 't6' must be derived from NT6, which in turn is derived from other rules. But since 't6' is in the string, does that mean that NT6 directly produces it? Or is it part of a longer chain?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because 't6' is not directly a terminal in any production, but maybe through some NT. Looking through the grammar, all the terminals are like t54, t16, etc., but 't6' seems to be a terminal in NT6. Let me confirm that.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't6'\n\nSo NT44 directly produces 't6'? Wait, no, NT44 \u2192 't6' is a production, but in the grammar, the production is NT44 \u2192 t6. So 't6' is a terminal. So 't6' is directly produced by NT44.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the production for NT44 is listed under NT44:\n\nNT44 -> 't6'\n\nSo 't6' is directly a terminal. Therefore, 't6' is allowed in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, position 9 is t6, which is allowed because NT44 can produce it.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 't6' was a production, but now it's clear: NT44 produces 't6'. So 't6' is allowed in the string.\n\nProceeding:\n\n10. t72: Yes, NT44 produces it.\n11. t41: Yes, in the grammar.\n12. t12: Yes, part of NT12 \u2192 t16 or t48.\n13. t28: Yes.\n14. t2: Yes, in NT2 \u2192 t41 t32, but t2 is a terminal? Wait, no. Wait, looking back, I see NT2 \u2192 t41 or t32 or other rules? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT25 \u2192 t13 t47, which is a two-symbol production. Wait, but 't2' is a terminal or a non-terminal? I think 't2' is a terminal. Looking in the grammar, I don't see a production that directly produces 't2' except maybe NT25 \u2192 t13 t47, so 't2' is not a terminal in any direct production. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps 't2' is a terminal. So checking the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal A directly goes to 't2'. So if the string has 't2', it must be produced by some NT. But perhaps 't2' is a terminal.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the grammar's productions are either non-terminals or terminals. So a terminal is any that is not a non-terminal.

The grammar is quite extensive with multiple production rules, so I need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string we're evaluating. The string is a sequence of symbols, and given the grammar in CNF, each production rule is either a terminal or a combination of two terminals or non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the non-terminals are things like S, NT15, NT50, etc. The terminals are symbols like 't16', 't11', etc. My string is composed entirely of these terminal symbols, so the goal is to find a derivation path in the grammar that starts with S and ends with the given string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parse trees for any string must be perfectly balanced and each production must split into two nodes at each step. So the length of the string must be 2^n where n is the number of production steps. Let me calculate the length of the string:\n\nThe string is: t16 t11 t87 t41 t84 t31 t63 t88 t11 t89 t28 t7 t37 t88 t33 t11 t18 t89 t36 t44 t36 t24 t6 t7 t48 t87 t31 t83 t33 t67 t13 t63 t87.\n\nCounting the number of symbols, it's 32 in total. 32 is 2^5, so it's theoretically possible since a parse tree with 5 levels would have 32 leaves. So the length is compatible.\n\nNow, I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar. Let's start by looking for the highest symbols in the string and see which production rules they can come from.\n\nLooking at the string starts with 't16' which corresponds to NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT24 has a rule to 't18' but 't16' is generated by NT17. Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30. Wait, no, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT17 -> NT2 NT30.\n\nBut that's inside the non-terminal NT17. However, looking for terminals, more importantly, what produces 't16'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30.\n\nBut that's a non-terminal. The term 't16' is generated by NT6 \u2192 T16. So 't16' is the terminal for NT6.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT6: NT6 \u2192 t16.\n\nSo to have 't16' in the string, it must come from NT6.\n\nBut how does NT6 get derived? Since the grammar is in CNF, NT6 must be produced by a rule that has NT6 as a non-terminal. But looking through the rules, I don't see any NT6 rules. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking again, in the grammar, under NT6: NT6 \u2192 t16.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, NT6 is defined as NT6 \u2192 t16. So to have t16 in the string, it must be derived directly from NT6. But in CNF, if NT6 is on the left side, it can only be derived from a production rule where it's on the left. But here, NT6 \u2192 t16 is a terminal production.\n\nWait, but in CNF, non-terminals can only produce pairs of non-terminals. Unless the non-terminal is a single character, but typically, in CNF, non-terminals are only on the left. Wait, in our case, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So, looking at the NT6, actually, in my initial scan, I may have made a mistake because earlier, when scanning the grammar, I thought that NT6 had a rule producing 't16', but looking at the grammar again:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules:\n\nI see a few lines where terminals are given. For example:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t48\n\nNT29 \u2192 t63\n\nBut I think I may have miscalculated earlier. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, do any NT have single-terminal productions? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT15 NT15\n\nLine 2: NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32\n\nLine 3: NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48\n\nLine 4: NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThen, towards the end, looking for NT rules that produce terminals:\n\nI see:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT4 NT52\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\nWait, but perhaps in the grammar, some of the non-terminals are defined to produce a single terminal, but I need to find which NT's have such rules.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see:\n\nUnder NT4: \"NT4 \u2192 t48\"\n\nWait, looking:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLine 41: NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\nLine 43: NT23 \u2192 NT2 NT50\n\nBut actually, I just realize that in the provided grammar, the last part includes \"NT4 \u2192 t48\" but wait, looking for that:\n\nWait, the user provided a list of grammar rules. Let me check each line to see if any non-terminals produce a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT2 -> NT41 NT32\n\nNT7 -> NT35 NT35\n\nNT34 -> NT32 NT2\n\n...\n\nAh, I see line 44: NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\nWait, let's find the lines where a non-terminal is immediately followed by a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the lines, I'm starting to see that some non-terminals do terminate:\n\nFor example, line 44: NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, line 49: NT46 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n\nNope.\n\nWait, looking through the entire list, I actually see:\n\nLine 54: NT20 \u2192 NT30 NT24\n\nLine 65: NT47 \u2192 NT27 NT6\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, looking for any production where a non-terminal is linked directly to a terminal.\n\nHere's what I see:\n\nLooking through the entire list, I think that there are a few NT rules that produce terminals, but upon a closer look, each production is either between two non-terminals or terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, for example:\n\nLooking at line 41: NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\nNo terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps it's a misread. Maybe some of the lines have a terminal. For example:\n\nLooking for 't' symbols in the grammar:\n\nFor example, NT16 \u2192 t16?\n\nWait, let's search the full list for any NT rules ending with 't'.\n\nLooking at the entire grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t16 (I think?), because in the provided grammar, looking for any line like NTxxxx \u2192 txxxx.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that some rules are written as NT followed by two NTs, except for some lines where a terminal is used. For example:\n\nLooking at line 8: NT4 \u2192 t48 --> Not sure if that's right.\n\nWait, perhaps in the entire grammar, none of the production rules for non-terminals produce a terminal except for:\n\nWait, let me check all of the grammar rules again to find any that produce a terminal. Upon reviewing, I realize that in the entire grammar provided, there are no production rules where a non-terminal is converted into a single terminal, such as NT6 \u2192 t16, etc. Instead, all non-terminal productions are in the form of two non-terminals. So in the provided grammar, the terminal symbols are the 't' followed by a number, but all the non-terminals are only on the left side of the production, with no cases of NT \u2192 a.\n\nWait, that can't be. If that's the case, then the string provided is composed solely of terminal symbols, but according to the grammar, since all non-terminals are on the left and only combine with other non-terminals, you can't derive any terminal from non-terminals because you can't get to a terminal directly.\n\nIf that's the case, then the given string can't be derived because there's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier, although I'm not sure if that's directly useful here. The string to check is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces:\n\n`t5 t69 t38 t63 t37 t16 t39 t13 t5 t24 t67 t48 t11 t12 t90 t4 t44 t83 t37 t65 t37 t18 t87 t65 t12 t31 t18 t4 t90 t65 t11 t7 t33`\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of symbols in the string. Let me see, counting each `t` and the numbers, there are 37 tokens here. So the input string has 37 symbols.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals expand directly into terminals. For example, NT5->'t2' and others. But the majority of the productions are two-symbol non-terminals expanding into two other non-terminals. So the structure of the derivation tree will be a series of steps expanding the start symbol S until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A->BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the leaves which directly produce terminals.\n\nThe string is quite long, with 37 symbols. So I need to see if the grammar can derive this string.\n\nWait, in CNF, each step only replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the number of symbols in the derived string grows exponentially with the number of steps. But we're given the final string, and we need to see if it's a valid derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to construct the parse tree for the given string and check if it can be derived by the grammar.\n\nBut given the time constraints, maybe I can look for any patterns or inconsistencies.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the production rules and see how they map to terminals.\n\nBut this approach might take too long. Alternatively, I can notice that the start symbol is S, which is defined as S->NT15 NT43. So the string must start with whatever NT15 and NT43 produce.\n\nLooking at NT15, one of its productions is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. That's recursive, so NT15 can produce a string that includes multiple instances, perhaps with t37s or something else.\n\nBut also, NT15 has another production, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT15 -> NT37 NT15 and NT15 -> NT30 NT20.\n\nWait, checking the given grammar:\n\nNT15 has two productions:\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nand\nNT15 -> NT30 NT20\n\nHmm, so NT15 can either produce NT37 followed by NT15, which suggests that it can generate more symbols, or it can produce NT30 and NT20.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 is defined as S->NT43->NT27 NT0. Wait, looking more closely:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT43 -> NT27 NT0\n\nAnd NT27 -> NT8 NT17\n\nNT0 -> NT30 NT20\n\nAnd looking at NT20: NT20->NT30 NT24\n\nAnd NT30 has multiple productions, one of which is NT30->NT24 NT44.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5. So maybe we can look at the first few symbols and see which non-terminals they could come from.\n\nLooking at the first symbol in the string: t5.\n\nIn the grammar, t5 appears as a terminal in several rules:\n\nNT23 -> 't5'\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT2 NT50\n\nBut also, in the terminal symbols, NT23->'t5'. So yes, NT23 can produce t5.\n\nSo the first symbol t5 could come from NT23.\n\nTherefore, the initial part of the string is t5, which is the result of NT23 expanding to 't5'.\n\nSo the first step would be to have S produce NT15 and NT43, which eventually lead to NT23 and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me think: S->NT15 NT43.\n\nSo S starts as NT15 followed by NT43.\n\nNT15 can produce either NT37 NT15 or NT30 NT20.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t5, so perhaps NT15 produces t5... but looking at NT15's productions, NT15->'t5' isn't present. Instead, NT15 has two options: recursive to itself and NT37, or NT30 and NT20.\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nNT15 -> NT30 NT20\n\nSo NT15 is either NT37 followed by NT15 or NT30 followed by NT20.\n\nIn the first case, NT15 could produce a string that starts with something from NT37.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t5. So if the first symbol is t5, then perhaps NT15 must produce a terminal that is 't5', but in the given grammar, NT23 is the only non-terminal that directly produces 't5'. So perhaps NT15 -> NT23 something?\n\nWait, no, let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check each production to see where t5 comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal symbols are:\n\nt2, t4, t5, t7, t13, t16, t18, t23, t28, t32, t37, t38, t44, t45, t46, t50, t51, t65, t67, t72, t83, t89, t90, t4, etc.\n\nWait, the terminal symbols are specific strings like 't5', 't69', etc.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the rules that directly produce terminals are:\n\nNT23 -> 't5'\n\nIs there any other rule that directly produces 't5'? Scanning through all the productions, I think only NT23 does. So in the grammar, the only way to get 't5' is via NT23.\n\nTherefore, to get 't5' as the first symbol, we must have NT15 produce a string that includes NT23, perhaps as part of a recursive expansion.\n\nWait, but S is NT15 followed by NT43. So let's say the first non-terminal is NT15, which could produce NT37 followed by NT15. So if NT15 produces NT37, which then expands further, perhaps contributing a 't5' from one of its productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production for NT15 could be NT30 followed by NT20, and NT20 might produce something else, but that might not lead to 't5' immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT15 can reach NT23 via some derivation. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT15's production:\n\nNT15 can produce NT37 followed by NT15, or NT30 followed by NT20.\n\nIf NT37 is an option, looking at NT37:\n\nNT37 can produce NT19 NT19 or NT17 NT45 or other options.\n\nIf NT37 is expanded to NT17 NT45, then:\n\nNT17 -> NT2 NT30\n\nAnd NT45 has various productions, including NT16 (t=16), NT48 (t48?), etc.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit tangled. Maybe it's easier to look for the presence of 't5' and see if it can be reached.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that the grammar is fixed, I can build the parse tree for the string step by step, starting from the root S.\n\nBut given the string's length, this approach might be laborious, but let me try to outline a possible parse.\n\nThe string begins with t5, which must come from NT23.\n\nSo the initial expansion would have S derive NT15 NT43.\n\nNow, suppose the left side NT15 produces NT23 (but wait, NT15 doesn't directly produce 't5'; NT23 does.

The string is `t13 t28 t89 t16 t87 t83 t39 t69 t63 t6 t65 t89 t16 t12 t63 t36 t13 t72 t12 t72 t65 t13 t84 t13 t28 t37 t18 t18 t36 t88 t37 t39 t13 t28`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is left-handed and has two non-terminals or a terminal. To parse the string, I might need to do a backward procedure where I split the string into chunks corresponding to non-terminals and then see if each chunk can be derived from each non-terminal.\n\nThe string starts with `t13`, and looking at the grammar, I see that `t13` is a terminal. So, I need to find which non-terminal generates `t13`. Looking at the production rules, I see that `NT13 -> t39`, but that doesn't help because `t13` isn't a terminal in the right place. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check the NT rules again.\n\nWait, the grammar's non-terminals are named like NT1, NT2, etc., and also NT0, etc. The start symbol is S, which is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. But the string starts with t13, which is generated by NT21 -> NT13 NT48. Hmm, no, wait, looking at the production rules, I notice that several NT rules are mapped to specific terminals:\n\nFor example, NT13 -> t69, NT5 -> t2, NT4 -> t48, NT15 -> t37, etc. But none of these directly produce t13. Wait, looking at the grammar, the only NT that starts with t13 is NT16 -> t33, and NT21 -> t13. So, I might have an error in my initial assumption.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again. The NT21 production is NT21 -> NT13 NT48. So, NT13 is a non-terminal that produces t69, and NT48 is a non-terminal that produces t88. So, NT21 would produce t69 t88. But in the string, the first part is t13, which isn't a terminal. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is a series of terminals. So each token in the string must be generated by a production's right-hand side (RHS). So, the first step is to split the string into a sequence of terminals and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but the string is already given as a sequence of t13, t28, etc., which are all terminals. So the string is a concatenation of terminals, so the derivation must start from the start symbol and produce this exact sequence.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should try to see if the entire string can be covered by walking through the grammar rules.\n\nLet's list the string's tokens: t13, t28, t89, t16, t87, t83, t39, t69, t63, t6, t65, t89, t16, t12, t63, t36, t13, t72, t12, t72, t65, t13, t84, t13, t28, t37, t18, t18, t36, t88, t37, t39, t13, t28.\n\nNow, considering the grammar's right-hand sides, each non-terminal must generate a pair of non-terminals or terminals. So, the entire string must be produced by a sequence of such steps.\n\nGiven that the start symbol is S, which is NT15. So S -> NT15 NT15. So first, we split the string into two parts, each derived from NT15.\n\nLet's split the string into two equal parts (or as close as possible). But 37 tokens is an odd number, but the first S production is two non-terminals, so the string must be split into two parts. Wait, 37 tokens can't be split into two equal parts, so perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe I've miscounted the number of tokens.\n\nWait, let me count:\n1. t13\n2. t28\n3. t89\n4. t16\n5. t87\n6. t83\n7. t39\n8. t69\n9. t63\n10. t6\n11. t65\n12. t89\n13. t16\n14. t12\n15. t63\n16. t36\n17. t13\n18. t72\n19. t12\n20. t72\n21. t65\n22. t13\n23. t84\n24. t13\n25. t28\n26. t37\n27. t18\n28. t18\n29. t36\n30. t88\n31. t37\n32. t39\n33. t13\n34. t28\n\nWait, that's 34 tokens, right? So 34. Let me recount:\n\nActually, let's recount:\n\n- t13 (1)\n- t28 (2)\n- t89 (3)\n- t16 (4)\n- t87 (5)\n- t83 (6)\n- t39 (7)\n- t69 (8)\n- t63 (9)\n- t6 (10)\n- t65 (11)\n- t89 (12)\n- t16 (13)\n- t12 (14)\n- t63 (15)\n- t36 (16)\n- t13 (17)\n- t72 (18)\n- t12 (19)\n- t72 (20)\n- t65 (21)\n- t13 (22)\n- t84 (23)\n- t13 (24)\n- t28 (25)\n- t37 (26)\n- t18 (27)\n- t18 (28)\n- t36 (29)\n- t88 (30)\n- t37 (31)\n- t39 (32)\n- t13 (33)\n- t28 (34)\n\nYes, 34 tokens. So S -> NT15 NT15 will split the string into two equal parts of 17 tokens each. So let's take the first 17 tokens as part A and the second 17 tokens as part B.\n\nPart A: t13, t28, t89, t16, t87, t83, t39, t69, t63, t6, t65, t89, t16, t12, t63, t36.\n\nPart B: t13, t72, t12, t72, t65, t13, t84, t13, t28, t37, t18, t18, t36, t88, t37, t39.\n\nNow, each part must be derivable from NT15.\n\nLooking at NT15's production: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So NT15 must generate Part A via NT37 and another NT15.\n\nWait, no. NT15's production is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So it's A B, where A is NT37 and B is NT15. So the split is A = NT37, B = NT15.\n\nSo Part A is generated by NT37 and Part B by NT15. Wait, but Part A has 17 tokens and Part B has 17 tokens. So each starts with their respective NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, the entire string is split into Part A (17) and Part B (17) because S produces NT15 NT15, each of which must generate their respective half.\n\nSo, Part A must be generated by NT15, which in turn is produced by NT37 and NT15 again. So perhaps Part A is split again into NT37 and NT15. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT15 can split the string into smaller chunks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by looking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-631","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens ending with 't's, like 't72 t24 t69 ... t33'. My goal is to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol of the grammar, which is 'S'.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier because each production either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol 'S', the initial production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, 'S' expands into two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43. Each of these non-terminals will likely produce more symbols, either terminals or other non-terminals, based on their respective productions.\n\nNext, I'll scan the string to see how it might align with the grammar rules. The string starts with 't72 t24 t69 ...', which suggests that the initial symbols might be matching some of the terminals in the productions.\n\nLet's break down the string token by token to see how they might fit into the grammar. I'll try to see if the first few tokens match any known productions.\n\nLooking at NT15, the production is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So, NT15 leads into another NT15 and NT37. Since NT15 is followed by NT15 again, but the string starts with 't72', I need to see if 't72' matches any terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT52 \u2192 't44'. Hmm, that's 't44', not 't72'. Wait, maybe another NT?\n\nWait, I might be mixing something up. Let me check NT15's productions again. Oh, looking carefully, I see that NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, but in the grammar, NT52 \u2192 't44' and NT44 \u2192 't6', NT15 is NT37. So, perhaps NT15 might eventually generate 't72' through a series of steps?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should start from the beginning of the string and see which non-terminals can produce 't72' and then the rest.\n\nWait, another approach could be to reverse-engineer the string. Each production in the grammar can only produce certain terminals or non-terminals. Let me look at NT24, for example, which has productions like NT24 \u2192 NT24 NT2, NT5, or NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32, and so on. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the start symbol S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so the string should be built as NT15 followed by NT43. So, the first token from NT15 and the second from NT43.\n\nBut the string starts with 't72', so I need to see if NT15 can produce 't72'. Looking at NT15's productions: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT15 must produce a string that starts with NT37. Let's look at NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So NT37 produces two NT19s.\n\nWait, NT19 is present in the grammar. NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38. So each NT19 is NT12 followed by NT38. And looking further, NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48, and NT48 \u2192 NT15 NT41.\n\nThis seems a bit recursive and might not directly lead to a terminal. Let me check the grammar for terminals generated by certain non-terminals. For example, NT24 \u2192 't5', so it can directly produce 't5'. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't41' and 't32'. Wait, looking through, some NTs directly produce terminals like t2, t48, t5, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps some NTs produce a single terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 't2', which is a direct production. Similarly, NT4 \u2192 't48', and NT29 \u2192 't63', and so on. \n\nGiven that the string starts with 't72', I need to see if any NT in the grammar directly or indirectly produces 't72'. Let's look for 't72' in the grammar. Scanning the productions, I see NT52 \u2192 't44', NT17 \u2192 't33', NT6 \u2192 't16', etc. Hmm, I don't see 't72' as a direct terminal. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't notice 't72' as a direct terminal in any of the NT productions. Wait, maybe it's produced by a series of steps. Such as NT24 \u2192 't5', but that doesn't get us to 't72'. Or maybe NT52 \u2192 't44', which is 't44' \u2192 't6'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a longer chain. Maybe from NT52, which goes to 't44', and then 't44' \u2192 't6', but I don't see 't72' anywhere. So, unless NT15 or another NT produces 't72' through a series of steps, but I don't see it in the immediate productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me double-check. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT52 -> NT6 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17\n...\nAnd in the rule NT46 \u2192 NT27 NT6. Wait, no, NT27 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any NT that eventually produces 't72'. Let me check NT7, for example. NT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35. And NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37, which as we saw, goes to NT19 and NT19 again.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's not possible to generate 't72' from any of the non-terminals in the grammar. If that's the case, then the string would not be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed a production. Let me check all the NT productions again. I don't see any NT that directly produce 't72'. So maybe 't72' is not present anywhere in the grammar's terminals.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string can't possibly be generated because the first token is 't72', but no rule produces 't72' from any non-terminal.

Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal on the left, with the right side having two symbols. So this grammar is set up in a way that each step produces two symbols until you reach the terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is rewritten as NT15 NT43. So each expansion starts with these two. Let me map out the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S becomes NT15 NT43. So the string will start with whatever NT15 and NT43 produce.\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15: Wait, that's a little strange. NT15 goes to NT37 and itself. This looks like a recursive rule. So every time NT15 is used, it produces NT37 and another NT15. That means each token generated by NT15 is part of a recursive chain until it eventually terminates. But since NT15 is recursive, it could produce an infinite string unless it's properly controlled. But in our case, we have specific terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT15, it's NT37 and NT15. So it's possible to have a chain like NT15 -> NT37 NT15, and then NT37 might produce terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 is part of the start symbol. Let me see NT43: The productions for NT43 include various other non-terminals. For example, NT43 can become NT6 NT1, which is a terminal. Or other combinations. Let me check the NT43 productions:\n\nLooking through, NT43 -> NT6 NT1, which could be NT6 and NT1. Let's see NT6: NT6 -> 't16' (a terminal). So that gives a specific token.\n\nBut going back to NT15: It can produce NT37 NT15. And NT37 has various productions, including NT19 NT19, NT19 -> NT51 NT19, etc., down to terminals. So let's see if NT15 can eventually produce a terminal.\n\nBut I'm not sure if it's possible for NT15 to ever produce a terminal because it's producing NT37 and itself. Unless there's a way for NT15 to reach a production that doesn't involve recursive expansion, but looking through, all other productions from NT15 involve other non-terminals.\n\nWait, NT15-> NT37 NT15, but it doesn't go to any terminal directly. So as the initial step, S generates NT15 and NT43. Then NT15 would expand into NT37 and another NT15. Let's say the first expansion is:\n\nS => NT15 NT43\n=> NT37 NT15 NT43 (because NT15 went to NT37 NT15)\n\nBut then, what's NT37? NT37 can produce things like NT19 NT19, NT19 produces NT51 NT19, which could go on recursively. But looking for any NT37 that goes to a terminal. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the productions for NT37: There's a production NT37 -> NT19 NT19, but that's recursive. Other NT37 productions include NT19 -> NT51 NT19, NT19->NT12 NT38, etc.\n\nLooking for a NT37 that can produce a terminal. I don't see any, because all NT37's productions are either two non-terminals or themselves. So NT37 might never produce a terminal. Wait, but are there any NT37 productions that lead to terminals? Let me look again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT37 -> NT19 NT19, NT19->NT12 NT38, NT37->NT19 NT19 again, and another NT37->NT19 NT19... And then some other NT37 productions. Wait, but I don't see any NT37 that leads to NT24 or anything else.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me recheck all NT37 productions:\n\n- NT37 -> NT19 NT19 (appears multiple times)\n- NT37 -> NT19 NT19 again\n- Other NT37 rules don't seem to produce terminals directly. So perhaps NT37 can't produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but if NT37 can't reach a terminal, then the entire process would get stuck with more non-terminals. So maybe the only way to have a reachable non-terminal is through the start symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see if any non-terminals can reach a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT15: It can produce NT37 NT15. If there's a way for NT15 to expand to a terminal, but none of its productions directly do that. So perhaps NT15 can't reach a terminal. \n\nThen, looking at NT43: Let me see NT43's productions. For example, NT43->NT6 NT1. NT6->'t16' (a terminal). And NT1->'t24'. So that path would give 't16 t24' as a possible output.\n\nWait, so if S goes to NT15 NT43, and NT15 goes to NT37 NT15, but if NT37 can't produce a terminal, maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe there's another path for NT15 that I'm missing. Let me check all NT15 productions.\n\nOther NT15 productions: None. It only goes to NT37 NT15, which seems like a dead end. So if NT15 can't produce a terminal, then maybe the entire string can't be generated unless the grammar allows for other rules.\n\nWait, but looking at S: S starts as NT15 NT43. If both NT15 and NT43 can't reach a terminal, that can't produce anything. So maybe the grammar's only way is to expand until all non-terminals are gone, possibly via different rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something because some of the non-terminals can produce a terminal. Let's look more carefully.\n\nFor example, let's look for any NT that can produce a terminal. Starting from S:\n\nS: NT15 NT43.\n\nLet's see NT43's paths:\n\nNT43 can go to NT1 NT9. NT43 can also go to NT24 NT20, etc.\n\nLooking at NT1->'t25', NT9->'t28', but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT37: Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look for NT37.\n\nWait, let's check NT37 in the list:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nWait, the user input provided the grammar and the string. So in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT52 -> 't44'\nNT44 -> 't6'\nNT24 -> 't18'\nNT24 -> 't55'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't48'\nNT29 -> 't63'\nNT4 -> 't88'\nNT9 -> 't28'\nNT50 -> 't33'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT51 -> 't90'\nNT48 -> 't87'\nNT1 -> 't24'\nNT34 -> 't87'\nNT36 -> 't84'\nNT21 -> 't99'\nNT45 -> 't11'\nNT19 -> 't13'\nNT37 -> 't12'\nNT51 -> 't31'\nNT45 -> 't67'\nNT36 -> 't41'\nNT26 -> 't12'\nNT5 -> 't7'\nNT13 -> 't69'\nNT21 -> 't13'\nNT40 -> 't89'\nNT28 -> 't4'\nNT29 -> 't36'\n\nWait, but I think this is not the correct way to parse the grammar. Looking at the entire list, I need to correctly identify all the productions.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree or see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, perhaps I can try to parse it into the grammar, step by step.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe it's easier to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-652","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is pretty complex, with a bunch of production rules. The string to evaluate is `t4 t89 t37 t65 t89 t13 t65 t90 t5 t87 t99 t39 t5 t28 t44 t72 t36 t31 t72 t83 t7 t41 t83 t48 t89 t55 t31 t65 t5 t41 t67 t5 t72 t67 t24`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar fits this structure, so that's a good start.\n\nThe approach I think of is to reverse engineer the derivation that would produce this string. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string should be a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a step in the derivation starting from the start symbol S. Each non-terminal in the string must derive a terminal or a pair of symbols that can be further broken down.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t4`. Looking at the given rules, I see that NT4 \u2192 t48. But wait, in the string, `t4` comes first. So maybe NT4 can be directly replaced by `t4`? Wait, no, because in the grammar, NT4 is an S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which then breaks down further. Wait, perhaps I should start from the start symbol S and see how the string can be derived.\n\nLet me think: S starts with NT15 and NT43 from S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S would produce a string that starts with the expansion of NT15 followed by the expansion of NT43. \n\nNT15: From the rules, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's recursive. So NT15 can expand into a long string involving NT37 and then another NT15. This seems like it could potentially terminate because in another rule, NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, and NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. NT51 is then NT50 and NT20. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. So maybe NT15 could eventually lead to a chain of terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. NT6 \u2192 t16. NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT5, but wait, looking further back, NT1 \u2192 NT51 NT38. So each step involves breaking down until we reach terminals.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe another approach: try to parse the string according to the grammar, using a top-down approach or a recursive descent method. Since the grammar is in CNF, recursive descent parsing with appropriate lookaheads might work.\n\nAnother thought: the string's length is 33. Let's see if it's a correct expansion. Each production either replaces a non-terminal with a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the string length after each step would be even if we start with two non-terminals (since each non-terminal expansion is two symbols). But starting from S \u2192 NT15 NT43, each expansion of these non-terminals would produce sequences of terminals and non-terminals. The total number of symbols should double each time they're split until all non-terminals are replaced.\n\nWait, the initial S splits into two non-terminals, so the first expansion would have two parts. But the string is 33 symbols. Let me see: each expansion step doubles the number of symbols until all are terminals. Let's see the length: 33 is an odd number. Starting from S, each non-terminal in the string can be two symbols, so the initial step (from S) would produce a string with two parts. The total number of symbols should be 2^k where k is the number of expansion steps. But 33 is not a power of two. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S produces two parts, each of which can be expanded into a certain length. If the overall string length doesn't fit the expected expansion, it might not be part of the language.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT15 and NT43 again. NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 and NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. So the expansion would branch out, each non-terminal leading to more steps. But perhaps somewhere near the end, all non-terminals get replaced by terminals, leading to a certain expected string length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string ends with `t24`, which comes from NT24 \u2192 t55 or another terminal. Looking at the string again, the last part is `t72 t67 t24`. So `t72` comes from NT72, but looking back, I don't see CT44 being expanded into t72. Wait, wait: looking at the NT24 rules, I see NT24 \u2192 t55. But in the grammar, NT24 may have other rules that lead to t24. Wait, in the given rules, there's NT24 \u2192 t55, but looking farther back, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules again. From the list provided:\n\nLooking for NT72: I don't see a production rule for NT72. So maybe t72 is a terminal that only appears in certain rules. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT25 NT16\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47\nNT13 \u2192 NT69\nAnd so on. Hmm, perhaps t72 is from a rule I'm not seeing correctly.\n\nWait, maybe t72 comes from NT72, but in the grammar provided, there's a rule NT44 \u2192 t6, NT42 \u2192 t5, NT13 \u2192 t39, etc. But I don't see NT72 in any production. So perhaps t72 isn't a terminal but a non-terminal. But in the string, it's a terminal 't72', which would be a problem if there's no production for NT72.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t72 is a result of a non-terminal expansion that isn't listed. But wait, in the given grammar, t72 isn't present as a terminal. So perhaps the string contains a terminal that's not in the grammar's terminal symbols, which would mean it's invalid.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the only terminals are those that appear as the result of certain productions. They include t2, t4, t5, etc. But t72 isn't a terminal in any production, so if the string contains it, that's a problem because we can't derive a non-terminal into a terminal in one step.\n\nSo, the string has `t72 t67 t24`. t72 is a problem because it's not a terminal. Hmm, that could be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t72 comes from a longer expansion that eventually includes NT44 \u2192 t6, but that would still not give t72.\n\nWait, let me check again: the grammar's terminals are:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the terminals are t2, t4, t5, t7, t8, t9, t13 (t39 is NT13?), t16, t17, t18, t21, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t31, t32, t35, t36, t37, t38, t41, t42, t43, t44, t45, t46, t47, t48, t49, t50, t51, t52, and others like t40, t55, etc. So t72 is not a terminal.\n\nTherefore, having `t72` in the string as a terminal is invalid because there's no production rule in the grammar that generates t72 from a non-terminal. So that immediately makes the string invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps t72 is the result of a longer expansion, but since the grammar only goes down to certain levels, perhaps that's not possible.\n\nSo, if t72 appears as a terminal, and there's no production rule that replaces a non-terminal with t72, then the string can't be derived from the grammar.\n\nIn the string, `t72` appears twice: after `t67` and before `t24`. Additionally, `t67` is a terminal. Does any rule produce t67? Looking at the grammar, I don't see a production that replaces a non-terminal with t67.\n\nWait, but some rules have `t67` as in NT52 \u2192 t67?

{"custom_id":"request-673","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and there are a bunch of other non-terminal productions. The terminals given are strings like 't5', 't16', etc., up to 't90', and some longer ones like 't72', 't83', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t28 t38 t84 t4 t91 t89 t67 t65 t6 t90 t63 t83 t54 t3 t4 t5 t65 t31 t5 t38 t63 t72 t16 t84 t18 t11 t63 t37 t24 t91 t12 t16 t44 t91 t38`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of multiple 't' terms, each with two-digit numbers. The challenge is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar starting with S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, parsing can be done using top-down methods like recursive descent or the CYK algorithm. Alternatively, I can try to trace back from the string to see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT43. Each non-terminal (like NT15, NT43) then needs to produce a sequence of terminals and possibly other non-terminals.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts to see if it can be matched by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look at the initial parts. The string starts with `t54 t28 t38 t84 t4 t91 t89 t67 t65 t6 t90 t63 t83 t54 t3 t4 t5 t65 t31 t5 t38 t63 t72 t16 t84 t18 t11 t63 t37 t24 t91 t12 t16 t44 t91 t38`.\n\nI can think of the string as a series of symbols that need to be matched by the grammar. Each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. Let's check if any of the productions directly match these terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which could eventually lead to terminals, but it's recursive and might be too long. Instead, perhaps I should look for a chain of productions that starts with S and ends with the given string by expanding each step.\n\nLet me try to model the parsing steps. Since it's a CNF grammar, each step breaks down a symbol into two non-terminals.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nNow, NT43 can produce NT24 NT0, according to the grammar. Let's expand NT43:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT24 NT0.\n\nNow, NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20. Let's expand NT0:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT24 NT30 NT20.\n\nNext, NT30 can produce multiple things, like NT24 NT44, or NT32 NT8, etc. Let's see which one fits the beginning of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t54. So, looking for a production that can lead to t54.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT5 \u2192 't2', NT2 \u2192 't41', etc. Wait, but NT5 doesn't lead to t54. Let me check NT54. Looking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT54. Wait, the string has t54, but in the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t54? Hmm, looking at the given productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t54. Or does any production eventually reduce to t54?\n\nLooking through the productions, for example, NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38, etc. Let's see if any chain leads to t54.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me list all the productions and terminals to see their possible combinations. Alternatively, perhaps I can build a leftmost derivation from S and see if it can match the string.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can start with t54. Looking at the productions, which non-terminals produce t54?\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT54 \u2192 ..., but perhaps another non-terminal can produce t54 through multiple steps.\n\nWait, looking at the string: the first symbol is t54. So I need a production that produces t54. Looking through all the productions, none of the non-terminals directly produce t54. For example, NT52 \u2192 't44', NT51 \u2192 't90', etc. So maybe there's no non-terminal that directly produces t54, meaning the string can't be generated by the grammar because t54 isn't directly produced by any rule except for maybe through some reduction steps, which in this case, I don't see.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The grammar has NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, and NT19 can produce other things. Let me see if any NT can produce t54.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are 't2', 't4', 't5', 't6', etc. Hmm, 't54' is not listed as a terminal in any production. It must be that t54 is an abbreviation or perhaps a token in the grammar? Or maybe it's a mistake. Wait, looking back, the string is a sequence of 't' terms, each with two digits. The grammar lists several of these, like 't2', 't4', 't5', etc.\n\nWait, but the string has 't54', which is not listed as a terminal in the productions. Did I miss any? Let me check the productions: there's NT5 \u2192 't2', NT4 \u2192 't48', etc. But 't54' is not directly a terminal. Hmmm.\n\nWait, perhaps 't54' is actually a combination of 't5' and 't4'. But that seems unlikely because in Chomsky Normal Form, each rule has exactly two non-terminals at the top level, not combinations of terminals and non-terminals. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misread the grammar. Let me check the productions again.\n\nUpon re-examining the grammar, I don't see any production that produces 't54' as a terminal. Terminals in the grammar are listed as 't2', 't4', 't5', 't6', etc., up to 't90', but in each production, the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait a second, let me look again. The grammar includes some NT symbols like NT52, NT51, etc., which produce 't44', 't90', etc. But I don't see any NT symbol that directly produces 't54' as a terminal.\n\nThat suggests that the production rules defined in the grammar don't include 't54' as a terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it contains a terminal that's not defined by any production.\n\nWait, but let me ensure I'm not making a mistake here. Perhaps I misread the grammar or the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production rules are all of the form NT production = NT NT or NT \u2192 't' number. So each terminal is a specific two-digit number.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is 't54'. If 't54' is indeed a terminal, then there must be a production that directly derives it. But in the provided grammar, there is no rule that defines NT54 \u2192 't54' or any equivalent.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT37 produces 't12' or 't13', but nothing leading to 't54'. Similarly, NT35 \u2192 't37', etc. So, all the terminals in the grammar are specific number strings, but none of them are 't54'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Perhaps the number strings are part of the non-terminals. But no, in context-free grammars, terminals are the symbols that can't be split further. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule has on the right-hand side either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nIn this case, 't54' is a terminal, which would come from a production rule like NTX \u2192 't54', but I don't see any such rule. All the terminals listed are different: 't2', 't4', etc., but not 't54'.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a production for an"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a series of t's followed by numbers, and I need to determine whether this sequence can be produced by the given grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The starting symbol can also have a production with the start symbol on the right-hand side. In this grammar, the starting symbol is S, and it seems to generate strings with terminals, so the grammar is in CNF because all the productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string given is: `t84 t24 t87 t33 t41 t54 t55 t24 t55 t84 t3 t31 t2 t91 t91 t89 t44 t84 t55 t69 t3 t91 t28 t31 t41 t87 t88 t48 t44 t54 t65 t87 t3 t6 t2 t72`.\n\nEach token here is a terminal symbol except 't' which seems to be part of the token. Wait, actually, all tokens start with 't', so maybe each token is just a terminal representing a single character. So the string is a concatenation of these t<something> tokens.\n\nNow, I need to parse this string according to the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree because each production has at most two non-terminals.\n\nLet me list out the production rules first to see if I can identify some key points. Looking through the grammar, I see that S is the start symbol and it's rewritten using NT15 and NT43. NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals, and each has their own productions.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Now, both NT15 and NT43 need to be derived into terminal strings.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's recursive. So NT15 can produce a string that starts with a production involving NT37 and then possibly more NT15s. But since NT15's production includes itself, maybe we can expand it further. Alternatively, looking at when a NT15 is used, perhaps it has another production elsewhere?\n\nWait, checking all NT rules:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT45, and NT37 is also used in NT15's production. But NT37\u2192NT19 NT19, which is another recursive production, leading to more NT19s.\n\nWait, looking up NT37's productions: I see NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 and NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 again. Hmm, actually, looking at the list again, here's the specific rule: NT37 -> NT19 NT19, and another rule for NT19: NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38 and NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT37 is only defined as NT37->NT19 NT19.\n\nWait, no, looking in detail:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, looking for NT37:\n- NT37 -> NT19 NT19\n- And NT19's rules:\n- NT19 -> NT12 NT38\n- NT19 -> NT51 NT19\n\nSo, from NT37, each step leads to NT19. NT19 can then branch into NT12 and NT38 or recursively into NT51 and NT19.\n\nWait, but NT12: looking through the NTs, NT12 is defined as NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48.\n\nHmm, okay, so perhaps this is getting complex. Maybe there's a more straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to analyze the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nEach token in the string is a terminal: t84, t24, etc. So, the question is whether the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI can model this as trying to build a parse tree for the given string, step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the entire string must be generated by expanding NT15 and NT43 into terminal strings.\n\nSo, the string should be a concatenation of the expansions of NT15 and NT43.\n\nTherefore, the string should be of the form E = A B, where A is the expansion of NT15 and B is the expansion of NT43.\n\nSo, first, let's look at NT15 and NT43.\n\nStarting with NT15:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (recursive). Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, let me confirm:\n\nLooking through the grammar, line by line:\n\n- S \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nNT15 is defined as NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n\nWait, yes, that's the first rule for NT15.\n\nSo NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which can be rewritten as NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15.\n\nSo to expand NT15, we can have a sequence of NT37 followed by any number of NT15. But this is recursive. So perhaps we can find a base case in the production rules.\n\nLooking further down, does NT37 have any other rules besides NT37\u2192NT19 NT19 and the NT19 rules?\n\nYes: NT37 -> NT19 NT19.\n\nWait, but that's the only production for NT37. So NT37 must eventually be replaced by two NT19s.\n\nAnd NT19 has two productions: NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38 and NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19.\n\nWait, so each NT19 can either expand into NT12 and NT38 or into NT51 and another NT19.\n\nSo to see what the generated string for NT15 would look like, let's try to expand it.\n\nSince NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, and NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, then:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 \u2192 NT19 NT19 NT15\n\nAnd this would keep going until it reaches a terminal. But the problem is, NT15 has no productions apart from those involving NT37, which in turn go to NT19. So unless there's a way for NT19 to produce a terminal, NT15 won't eventually terminate unless we have a different production.\n\nWait, looking for NT19: the rules are NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38 and NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19.\n\nSo NT19 needs to expand further. Similarly, NT12 and NT51.\n\nSo let's go step by step:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10 (from looking through the given productions: yes, NT21 is defined as NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10)\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30 (wait, let me check: NT10 is actually defined as NT10 \u2192 NT36 NT20, according to line in the grammar: NT10 \u2192 NT36 NT20)\n\nWait, I think I might be getting this wrong. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nYes, the line says: NT10 -> NT36 NT20.

In this case, the grammar seems to have productions where some rules expand into terminal symbols, and others (like NT50, NT36, etc.) expand into two non-terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to derive the string step by step using the grammar. However, given the length of the string, that might be impractical. Alternatively, perhaps I can check the leftmost derivation or rightmost derivation, or see if there's a way to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nWait, another thought: since all productions in CNF either split non-terminals into two non-terminals or into terminals, if the string can be represented as a sequence of such terminals coming from the derivation, it's possible.\n\nBut another approach is to think of this as a parse tree where each node is either a non-terminal or a terminal, and the root is the start symbol S. So, I'd need to see if the given string can be built from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. So each of these must correspond to a series of productions. Let's list them:\n\nt48, t4, t16, t3, t54, t41, t6, t55, t33, t7, t44, t89, t69, t5, t39, t88, t6, t36, t39, t89, t48, t83, t36, t65, t84, t89, t11, t11, t63, t33, t41, t88, t99, t13, t16, t48, t91.\n\nThat's 43 terminals. So, the parse tree must have a structure where each non-terminal expansion leads to these terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the production rules. For example:\n\nS -> NT15 NT43\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nNT19 -> NT12 NT38\nNT12 -> NT21 NT48\nNT21 -> NT38 NT31\nNT38 -> NT51 NT29\nNT51 -> NT50 NT20\nNT50 -> NT41 NT43\nNT43 is a terminal (t43?), but wait no\u2014in the given grammar, the NT43 is defined as 't48'? Wait, let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI see lines like:\n\nNT43 -> NT6 NT1\nNT43 -> 't48' \u2014 Oh wait, perhaps NT43 can be a terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar's rules, some non-terminals are mapped to terminals, for example:\n\nNT44 -> 't6'\nNT42 -> 't5'\nNT13 -> 't39'\nAnd so on. So, NT43 can expand to a terminal 't48' directly.\n\nWait, let me check: in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT43 -> 't48' \u2014 Yes, so NT43 can produce 't48'. So in the S rule, S is NT15 NT43, so if NT43 produces 't48', then S can produce NT15 't48'. But wait, S is two non-terminals, so S -> NT15 't48', but then NT15 can be further expanded.\n\nThis might take a while. Alternatively, maybe I can see if the string starts with t48, which is produced by NT43. So, if the string starts with t48, that corresponds to S \u2192 NT43 NT15, but wait, S is NT15 NT43.\n\nWait, no. The production S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which is NT15 followed by NT43. But the string starts with t48, which is an output of NT43. So for the string to start with t48, that would require that the NT43 part of S's production produces t48, but S is a combination of NT15 and NT43. So the first step in the derivation is to have S \u2192 NT15 NT43. But then, the NT15 would need to generate some output that combines with NT43's output.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Each non-terminal expansion step adds to the leftmost part. So S starts as NT15 NT43, but to get a string starting with t48, which is an output of NT43, that would mean that NT43 must be the rightmost non-terminal, but since S is two non-terminals, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire string as a sequence of terminals generated from the start symbol S via a series of productions where each non-terminal is expanded until only terminals remain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string using the grammar. Let's try that.\n\nThe string is: t48 t4 t16 t3 t54 t41 t6 t55 t33 t7 t44 t89 t69 t5 t39 t88 t6 t36 t39 t89 t48 t83 t36 t65 t84 t89 t11 t11 t63 t33 t41 t88 t99 t13 t16 t48 t91.\n\nThat's 43 tokens. Given the structure of the grammar (each production produces two non-terminals except some that produce terminals), each step in the derivation would increase the number of tokens by one (since each non-terminal is replaced by two tokens: another non-terminal and a terminal, or two terminals). \n\nWait, but let's think: Starting with S, which is a single non-terminal. Each production expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals decreases by one each step. If a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, that token is added to the output. So, starting from 1 non-terminal, each step reduces the non-terminals by one, until all are terminals.\n\nSo for a string of length n, the number of tokens is n, which must equal (number of leaves in the parse tree). Each production of the form A\u2192BC adds one node to the parse tree, increasing the number of tokens by 1. Each terminal terminal does not.\n\nWait, perhaps to model the number of tokens: For a leftmost derivation of the start symbol S, each application of a production that replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals increases the number of non-terminals by 1, so the number of non-terminals increases. Each terminal introduced adds a token to the string. So, perhaps the total number of tokens is 1 + the number of steps taken during the derivations where a non-terminal is split.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to see if there's a possible parse tree that could produce this string.\n\nLooking at the first token, t48. We need to see which non-terminals can produce t48. From the grammar, I see:\n\nNT42 -> 't5'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't48'\nNT6 -> 't16'\nWait, looking through:\n\nLines such as:\n\nNT48 -> 't65'\n\nNo, wait. Wait, the grammar has:\n\nNT48 -> 't65'\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nNo, NT48 is in the rules as:\n\nNT48 -> NT44 NT27\n...\nand some lines:\n\nNT48 -> 't65'\nNT4 -> 't48'\n\nWait, yes:\n\nNT4 -> 't48'\n\nAh, okay, so NT4 can produce 't48'.\n\nMeanwhile, NT42 -> 't5'\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT42 -> 't5'\n\nYes, line: NT42 -> 't5'\n\nSo, that's a rule for NT42.\n\nSimilarly, NT13 -> 't39'\n\nAnd others.\n\nNow, let me think about t48 t4 t16 t3 ... So the string starts with t48 t4 t16 t3... t48 t91.\n\nSo, the first token is t48. How does t48 get produced?\n\nLooking at NT4, which produces t48.

{"custom_id":"request-689","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A->BC or A->a. The string to check is quite long, so I'll need a systematic approach.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar and the string. The start symbol is S, which directly expands to NT15 NT43. So the derivation starts with these two elements. \n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't11 t48 t91 ...'. I notice that 't11' appears early on. Let's see if any non-terminals produce 't11'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT19 -> NT12 NT38, NT12 -> NT21 NT48, NT21 -> NT38 NT31, etc., but none of these seem to produce 't11' directly. Wait, NT21 -> NT10 NT10. NT10 has a rule NT10 -> NT50 NT30, which eventually leads to t17. Hmm, not t11. Maybe I need to track the parse tree.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each production generates two terminal symbols or two non-terminals. So starting from S, it's NT15 and NT43. Each NT has its own productions. So each step may involve expanding NT15 and NT43 into their respective components.\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15. Hmm, that's a recursive production. So NT15 would produce something like NT37 followed by NT15. But NT37 can produce NT19 NT19. Let's see what NT19 does. NT19 -> NT12 NT38. NT12 is NT21 NT48. NT48 can only produce 't12' in some cases, like NT48 -> NT44 NT21. Wait, but in the string, we have 't54', 't83', etc. Maybe I need to track each component.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string using the grammar. Let's see, the string is a series of terminals: t11, t48, t91, t4, t5, t37, t38, etc. The number of terminals can give a clue about the derivation steps. In Chomsky Normal Form, the number of symbols in the left-hand side of each production is 2, so the derivation should generate an even number of symbols if starting from S. But the string has 35 symbols, which is odd, so maybe that's an issue, but actually, S starts with two non-terminals, so each expansion doubles the count? Not sure, might not be directly helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps each production in the grammar produces either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the entire derivation would consist of a sequence of non-terminals that eventually produce the string. But it's easier to try to parse the string from the start.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't11', let's see what productions can produce t11. In the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't11'. Let's check each NT's productions and see if any can derive to 't11'.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any 't11' production. Wait, actually, some non-terminals do have terminal symbols. For example, NT48 has a rule NT44, but that's 't6' or similar. Wait, looking at the full grammar, I see many NT rules ending with 't' followed by numbers. Like NT6 -> 't16', NT5 -> 't2', etc.\n\nWait a minute, maybe some NTs can produce a terminal directly. So, for example, NT21 -> NT10 NT10, and NT10 -> NT50 NT30, but NT50 and NT30 might further expand into more NTs that eventually produce 't's. Let's see:\n\nNT50 -> NT41 NT43, which are both NTs. NT41 -> NT7 NT31, and NT7 is 't7' (from NT7 -> 't7'), so NT41 can produce t7 followed by NT31, which is NT28?\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try building a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with 't11', but none of the NTs directly produce 't11'. So perhaps the string is not possible. But that might not be the case because some combination might lead to 't11'.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't11'. So if the string starts with 't11', and no NT directly produces it, it might be impossible, so the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe through a series of expansions, a non-terminal can produce 't11'. For example, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. NT37 can be NT19 NT19, then each NT19 is NT12 NT38, then NT12 is NT21 NT48, NT48 can be 't12' or other paths. Wait, is there a way that a sequence of NTs can ultimately produce 't11'?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't11' comes from an NT that eventually produces 't11' via a series of expansions. But looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly can produce 't11'. For example:\n\nNT12 -> NT21 NT48.\n\nNT21 -> NT10 NT10. NT10 -> NT50 NT30.\n\nNT50 -> NT41 NT43. NT41 -> NT7 NT31.\n\nNT7 -> 't7', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, this gives t7. But 't11' isn't here. Let me see another path.\n\nWait, NT28 -> NT26 NT23. NT26 -> NT24 NT34. NT24 could be NT55, but looking at the rules, NT24 has multiple productions, some ending in t5, t18, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT23 can lead to something. NT23 -> NT5 NT26. NT5 -> 't2' or 't88' or other? Wait, looking at the rules, NT5 can produce 't2', but I'm not sure. Wait, in the full grammar list, I see NT50 -> 't33' and NT5 -> 't2' (yes, because in the grammar, NT50 is sometimes 't33', and NT5 is 't2'.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all NTs to see if any can produce 't11'. From the full grammar:\n\nLooking through each NT rule, let's see:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15: NT37 can produce 't12', but we're looking for 't11'.\n\nNT9 -> 't28'\n\nNT5 -> 't2'\n\nNT2 -> 't41'\n\nNT7 -> 't7'\n\nNT10 -> 't50 t30' etc., but maybe some paths down the line can reach 't11'.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules for each NT, I don't see any that produce 't11'. So perhaps the string starts with a symbol that the grammar can't produce, so the string is not in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe some NTs can produce 't11' via a combination of rules. For example, NT15 includes rules that can lead to 't11' through a chain. Let's see: NT15 can expand to NT37 NT15. NT37 can be NT19 NT19. Then each NT19 can be NT12 NT38, then NT12 as NT21 NT48, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a path where NT37 eventually leads to some t's that can chain together to make 't11'? But I can't see a direct way. Each 't' seems to be a single character, so unless there are rules that combine t's, but in the grammar, all the 't's are single terminals.\n\nWait, but maybe a non-terminal can produce two 't's, but in the grammar, looking at each production, each 't' is a single terminal. So if an NT can produce t1 followed by t10, that would form t1 t10, but the string has t11.\n\nLooking at the grammar, do any of the non-terminals have a production that combines two terminals into something like t11? Or perhaps t11 is a terminal itself.\n\nWait, in the list of non-terminals, I don't see 't11' as any terminal. All the 't's are separate. So to make 't11', the grammar would need a production like NT11 -> t11, but looking at the given grammar, there's no such"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-708","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar provided has a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' followed by numbers, like 't83 t6 ...' and so on.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF grammars have production rules where each non-terminal is transformed into exactly two non-terminals, or a terminal. So in the given grammar, each rule on the left side of the arrow (like S->NT15 NT43) has two parts, either both non-terminals or one terminal? Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So looking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the rules are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, which fits the first part of CNF. However, there are also rules where NTx produces a terminal, like some NT rules ending with 't...', such as NT24 -> 't5' or others. So that\u2019s consistent with CNF because it combines both non-terminals and terminals.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a series of these 't' sequences. Each token seems to correspond to a production's terminal output. So I think the approach is to see if the entire string can be derived by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions, ending at the given string.\n\nLet me try to visualize the process. Starting from S, which is the initial symbol. According to the grammar, S->NT15 NT43. So S splits into NT15 and NT43. Each of these needs to be derived further.\n\nLooking at NT15's production: NT15->NT37 NT15. Hmm, that's interesting because it seems recursive. So NT15 can only be derived into itself and NT37. Wait, but NT15's production is recursive, does that mean it's part of a left-recursive rule? Left recursion can complicate things because in CNF, for production rules to the left of the arrow, they should either produce non-terminals or terminals. Here, NT15 can keep producing more NT15 and NT37. But since in CNF, direct left recursion is not allowed\u2014or is it? Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. Left recursion (where a non-terminal is produced by itself and another non-terminal) is not part of CNF. Wait, actually, CNF allows left recursion if the production is of the form A\u2192A B, which is a left recursion, but I think it can be transformed into a non-left-recursive form using the standard transformation. So in this case, NT15 has a production NT15->NT37 NT15, which is left-recursive because the same non-terminal appears again.\n\nWait, but in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So this is allowed because NT15 is expanding into two non-terminals, one of which is itself. So it's a valid CNF production, just left-recursive.\n\nTo handle this, I might need to convert the left-recursive production into a right-recursive one, but maybe I can figure out the derivation process without that. Alternatively, I can treat this as a case where NT15 can be expanded any number of times, each time introducing more NT37 and the original NT15.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, and the production is A->BC where A can be any non-terminal, including if A is on the right side. So perhaps I can model the possible derivations.\n\nBut before diving into that, let me take a step back. The string is a sequence of terminals, each of which comes from some production. So I need to see if the entire string can be generated by combining these terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a long sequence of 't' followed by numbers, and I need to map these to the symbols derived from S. Each step in the derivation process produces the current string, but it's a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reconstruct the parse tree for the given string and see if it matches any possible derivation from S.\n\nBut that could take a lot of time since the string is long. So perhaps there's a pattern or a structure I can exploit.\n\nLet's think about the start symbol S, which produces NT15 and NT43. So in the derivation, the string starts with whatever NT15 produces and is followed by whatever NT43 produces.\n\nLooking at NT15's production: NT15->NT37 NT15. So NT15 can be expanded into NT37 followed by NT15. Recursively, this can lead to a series of NT37s and a terminal. But NT15 must terminate somewhere; perhaps at some point, it's expanded into NT37 and another terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that there's a production NT37->NT19 NT19. And perhaps NT19 has a production that might lead to terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nFor example, NT37->NT19 NT19. If I keep expanding NT37, each step introduces two more NT19s. Then NT19 may have a production that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a production NT19->NT12 NT38. Hmm, so NT19 can be expanded into NT12 and NT38.\n\nThen, NT38 has productions. Let's see, NT38 has a production NT38->NT51 NT29 and NT38->NT53 NT32?\n\nWait, not exactly. Let's check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT38 -> NT51 NT29\n\nand elsewhere:\n\nNT38-> NT51 NT29 \n\nWait, also NT38 has a production like NT38->NT51 NT29.\n\nAnd another production:\n\nNT38-> NT53 NT32? Or is it NT38-> NT51 NT29 and another production like NT38->NT53 NT32? No, more accurately, the grammar has:\n\nNT51 -> NT50 NT20, but I think I might need to recheck.\n\nWait, stepping through each rule:\n\nFor NT38, I see in the list:\n\nNT38-> NT51 NT29? Hmm, no. Let me check the given grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI see NT38-> NT51 NT29, and another NT38-> NT53 NT32. Wait, is that accurate?\n\nWait, the given grammar has:\n\nLooking for NT38:\n\nYes, there's NT38-> NT51 NT29 and NT38-> NT19 NT19.\n\nSo:\n\nNT38 can produce:\n\n1. NT51 NT29\n\n2. NT19 NT19\n\n3. NT51 NT29 again? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT38, it's:\n\nNT38-> NT51 NT29\n\nand also\n\nNT38 -> NT19 NT19\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo when NT38 is expanded, it can become either NT51 + NT29 or NT19 + NT19.\n\nNow, looking at NT51, it's NT51-> NT50 NT20, and NT50-> NT41 NT43, etc.\n\nThis seems a bit complex, but perhaps I can model the possible ways the string can be segmented.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is long, maybe I can attempt to segment it into parts that correspond to the productions in the grammar.\n\nWait, but that might take too long. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the structure.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each production in the grammar either connects two symbols or produces a terminal. So the string should be a concatenation of terminals that result from expanding the symbols according to the grammar.\n\nPerhaps I can model the problem by looking for the possible ways the string can be broken down.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt83 t6 t83 t83 t31 t13 t44 t89 t3 t65 t33 t99 t88 t28 t2 t44 t84 t48 t72 t87 t28 t41 t67 t63 t69 t91 t72 t5 t89 t5 t6 t16 t69 t41 t39 t24 t54 t13\n\nBreaking it down into the individual 't' parts:\n\nt83, t6, t83, t83, t31, t13, t44, t89, t3, t65, t33, t99, t88, t28, t2, t44, t84, t48, t72, t87, t28, t41, t67, t63,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-714","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) is defined by a set of production rules. The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), meaning each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This simplifies parsing because each production leads directly to a binary tree structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive with multiple non-terminals (NT1 to NT52 and S, T) and terminals (t numbers and 't44', 't48', etc.). The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t48 t31 t88 t13 t24 t18 t37 t65 t12 t12 t18 t4 t72 t54 t4 t18 t48 t18 t72 t91 t65 t37 t55 t33 t48 t55 t13 t67 t33 t65 t67 t2 t89 t99 t65 t37 t24 t44`.\n\nI notice that 'S' is the start symbol, and the production S -> NT15 NT43. So any string generated must start with whatever NT15 and NT43 produce. Looking at the grammar, let's see what NT15 and NT43 produce.\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nNT43 -> NT27 NT0\n\nSo S expands to NT37 NT15 NT27 NT0. Hmm, because NT15 is recursive (repeats NT37 NT15), this might generate a string with multiple 't12's or similar, as NT37 and NT15 have their own terminal rules.\n\nWait, I need to check the expansions for NT15 and NT43. NT15 is NT37 followed by NT15 again. NT37 in the grammar has rules like NT37 -> NT19 NT19, and NT19 eventually leads to terminals like 't54' (NT19 -> NT51 NT19 doesn't seem right; wait, let me check.\n\nLooking back: NT19 has a production NT19 -> NT51 NT19. Also, NT51 -> NT50 NT20. NT50 has a production NT50 -> NT41 NT43. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should build a parse tree or find a way to match the string to the grammar.\n\nBut parsing such a large string manually would be time-consuming. Maybe I can find patterns or look for the terminals and see if they can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me see. The string starts with 't48', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals expand directly to terminals.\n\nFor example, NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't48'. Similarly, NT28 -> 't24', NT24 -> 't55', etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the rule for NT24 is NT24 -> NT2 NT48. So NT24 would produce two non-terminals, NT2 and NT48. Then NT48 is NT48 -> NT44 NT21. Wait, let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, it's better to reconstruct the terminal part from the rules. Let's list all the rules that lead to terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT4 -> 't48'\nNT24 -> 't55' (Wait, how? Let me check. NT24's production is NT24 -> NT2 NT48. From the grammar, NT24: rule is NT24 -> NT2 NT48. But NT2 has a production NT2 -> NT41 NT32, and NT32 -> 't83'. NT48 is NT48 -> NT44 NT21. NT44 is 't16', and NT21 -> 't99'. So combining, NT24 becomes NT2 (which goes to NT41 NT32, then 't83') and NT48 (which is 't16' 't99'). Wait, but that's a terminal sequence. So NT24 would produce 't83' followed by 't16' 't99'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT24 also has a production NT24 -> NT24 NT5. Hmm, but NT5 has a production NT5 -> 't7' from the grammar line NT5: 't7'. So wait, is that correct?\n\nLooking back: The grammar includes lines like NT5: 't7'. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar is presented as a list of lines, each starting with the left-hand side, and the rest showing the production(s). So for example, the first line is S -> NT15 NT43. Then the next is NT50 -> NT1 NT32, etc.\n\nLooking at NT50 -> NT1 NT32. So NT1 is 't24' because NT1: 't24'. Similarly, NT50: NT1 is 't24' and NT32 is 't83'. So NT50 would produce 't24' and 't83'.\n\nWait, no, I think I might have misread. Each line is a production, so for example, NT50 is expanded as NT1 followed by NT32. Let me re-examine the grammar lines correctly.\n\nWait, the first line is S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nThen the second line: NT50 -> NT1 NT32.\n\nSo NT1's production is 't24', and NT32's production is 't83'. So combining, NT50 -> 't24' 't83'.\n\nBut that's just one possible expansion. NT50 could also produce other things if there are other rules, but as per the given lines, each line represents one production, so I think each NT has one production except for ones that have multiple.\n\nWait, no, that's not how it works. In CNF, a non-terminal can have multiple productions, so each line for a non-terminal represents a possible production. So for example, NT50 could have multiple rules, like NT50 -> NT1 NT32 and NT50 -> NT41 NT43, as per the lines provided? Wait, no, each line is a separate production. So for example, line 2 is NT50 -> NT1 NT32, line 20 is NT50 -> NT41 NT43.\n\nSo actually, NT50 has two productions: NT50 -> NT1 NT32 and NT50 -> NT41 NT43.\n\nWait, but I must be careful. Each production is a separate rule. So for example, the line NT50 -> NT1 NT32 is one production, and NT50 -> NT41 NT43 is another.\n\nSo in this case, when generating a string, the parser would choose one of these productions to expand NT50. So in our case, the string starts with 't48', which is from NT4 -> 't48'.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't48', so let's see which non-terminals can produce 't48'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> 't48'\n- NT20 has a production NT20 -> NT30 NT24, but I don't see a terminal for that.\n- NT48 has multiple productions, like NT48 -> NT44 NT21, both NT44 and NT21 might expand to terminals or non-terminals. Wait, checking NT44: NT44 is 't16', and NT21? Looking back, I see NT21 has NT21: NT21 -> 't99'. So NT21 produces 't99'.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought NT25 -> NT13 NT47, but perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me go back and list all the rules that lead to terminals.\n\nLet me make a list of all non-terminals and their eventual expansions to terminals:\n\n1. NT4 -> 't48'\n\n2. NT20 -> ...? Let's see. NT20: NT20 -> NT30 NT24. NT30 has two productions: NT30 -> NT32 NT8 and NT30 -> NT24 NT44.\n\n- NT32: NT32 -> 't83' (from NT32's production NT32 -> 't83')\n- NT8: What's NT8? Looking through, NT8: 't40' if I recall. Wait, let me check. Wait, actually, some lines may represent production rules, so let's check.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in how the grammar is structured. Each line starts with a non-terminal on the left, followed by its possible expansions. So each line represents a production rule.

{"custom_id":"request-737","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. In this case, the grammar uses symbols like S, NT15, NT50, etc., which I assume are non-terminals, and some are terminals represented by 't' followed by a number. So, my first step is to parse the string and see if each production can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: `t39 t44 t2 t41 t7 t16 t54 t63 t24 t48 t88 t48 t99 t90 t11 t48 t11 t2 t44 t72 t3 t99 t5 t2 t67 t3 t89 t18 t48 t83 t36 t5 t63 t91 t24 t44 t28 t84 t16`.\n\nSince the string is a series of tokens, each token is a terminal. The grammar's productions will need to correspond to these tokens. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is t39. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t39. Looking at the grammar, I notice NT13 \u2192 NT28 NT5. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar, I see that NT5 is in NT52 \u2192 NT6 NT25, but more directly, looking at the productions, for example, NT13 \u2192 t69. Hmm, let me check each non-terminal.\n\nWait, the productions for terminals are listed after NT prefixes. For example, NT4 \u2192 t48, NT5 \u2192 t7, etc. So, each time a non-terminal is followed by a specific symbol in the production, that will translate into a terminal.\n\nSo, to find if the string can be generated, I need to build a parse tree where each production is used correctly.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT15 NT15 followed by NT43. Wait, actually looking back: The first production is S \u2192 NT15 NT15 followed by NT43? Wait, let me check the original grammar. The first line is S -> NT15 NT15 NT43. No, wait, the way it's written is S -> NT15 NT15 NT43. Or is it S -> NT15 NT15, then NT43? I think it's one production: S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43. So two NT15 and one NT43 on the right.\n\nWait, the original production is S -> NT15 NT15 NT43. So the start symbol S expands into two NT15 and one NT43.\n\nNow, let's see what NT15 can produce. Looking through the grammar, I see NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That's a recursive production, so it will keep expanding until it hits a terminal. Let's see which nt15 can produce t39.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT13 \u2192 t69, which is a terminal. So NT13 produces a t with 69, which isn't t39. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t39. So perhaps NT15's production chain leads to t39. Let me see.\n\nWait, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. NT37 can produce other non-terminals. Looking at the productions for NT37: it can be NT19 NT19 or NT17 NT45. Let's take NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19.\n\nThen, each NT19: NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. Each NT51 can be NT50 NT20 or NT9 NT38. Let's pick NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20.\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, so NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. NT41 can be NT7 NT31. NT7 can be NT35 NT35. NT35 can be NT37 NT37. Oh wait, this seems like a loop. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see if any NT produces t39. Looking through all the terminal productions, I see NT13 \u2192 t69, NT21 \u2192 t13, NT28 \u2192 t67, etc. Wait, in the string, the first token is t39. So perhaps there's a non-terminal that directly produces t39, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any terminal except for those listed at the end. Let me check all the nt's that are directly terminals.\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar, I see several 't' productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t48, NT5 \u2192 t7, NT13 \u2192 t69, NT28 \u2192 t67, NT5 \u2192 t7, etc. Wait, actually, I need to look for NT productions that have 't' as their right-hand side.\n\nHere's the full list:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t48\n- NT5 \u2192 t7\n- NT13 \u2192 t69\n- NT21 \u2192 t13\n- NT28 \u2192 t67\n- NT5 \u2192 t7\n- NT15 \u2192 something?\n- Wait, NT4 \u2192 t48, NT5 \u2192 t7, NT13 \u2192 t69, NT21 \u2192 t13, NT28 \u2192 t67.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that directly produces t39. That's a problem because the first symbol in the string is t39, but all NT productions seem to lead to other NTs except for specific ones.\n\nLooking carefully, I notice that the non-terminals may sometimes produce a terminal through a chain. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT52, and NT52 could produce 't's.\n\nLooking back, let's list all the terminal productions.\n\nFrom the end of the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t48\n- NT5 \u2192 t7\n- NT13 \u2192 t69\n- NT21 \u2192 t13\n- NT28 \u2192 t67\n- NT9 \u2192 t4 NT52\n- NT52 \u2192 t44\n\nWait, NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT52. Then NT4 \u2192 t48, so that would be the sequence t48, and then NT52 can be 't44'. So NT9 can produce t48 t44. So the string could have t48 t44, for example.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t39. So I must have a non-terminal that can produce t39 or a chain leading to t39.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Is there any production that eventually produces t39?\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t39. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar, the only terminal symbols are the t's. For example:\n\n- NT52 can produce 't44'\n- NT15 can produce NT37 NT15\n- NT37 can be NT19 NT19 or NT17 NT45\n\nWait, let me see if any non-terminal can eventually produce t39. Let me think: NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30. NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32. NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31. NT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35. NT35 can be NT37 NT37. So this seems like a loop and doesn't produce a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, NT30 \u2192 NT32 NT8. NT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46. NT25 \u2192 NT48 NT35. NT48 \u2192 NT15 NT41. This also seems to loop indefinitely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look for the production that could generate t39.\n\nLooking again, the grammar doesn't seem to have any non-terminal that directly produces t39. All production steps lead to other non-terminals except for the ones listed. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT52. NT52 \u2192 t44. So NT9 can produce t48 t44.\n\nWait, wait, but in the string, the third symbol is t54. Let's look for where t54 could come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. NT51 can produce NT50 NT20 or NT9 NT38. Let's see if any NT51 produces t54.\n\nLooking at NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31, which leads to more NT's.\n\nAlternatively, NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. If NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20, then NT50 is NT41 NT43.

{"custom_id":"request-730","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with determining whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is a series of symbols separated by spaces, which I assume are terminals. The grammar consists of a set of production rules, some of which have non-terminals on both sides (like S -> NT15 NT43), and others that produce terminal symbols (like NT15 -> t15, etc.).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Context-free grammars consist of variables (non-terminals) and terminals. Here, the non-terminals seem to be various NT followed by numbers, like NT15, NT36, etc., and some symbols like 't44' which I assume are terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, its production rule is S -> NT15 NT43. So the start is a combination of NT15 and NT43. I need to trace how these non-terminals can expand to produce the given string.\n\nLet me break down the given string:\n\nt2 t91 t11 t65 t11 t13 t91 t37 t3 t39 t16 t3 t67 t48 t65 t4 t16 t39 t38 t99 t18 t72 t33 t88 t67 t28 t37 t2 t28 t24 t2 t33 t84 t3 t18 t41 t24 t90 t44.\n\nI'll start by trying to map this string to the production rules. I notice that every two non-terminals seem to produce some terminals. The production rules generate specific terminals, so each production rule can contribute to sequences of two terminals. For example, NT15 -> t15, but wait, in the grammar, NT15 is shown as having a production to NT37 NT15, and so on. Actually, looking closely, NT15 is defined as NT37 NT15, which is a left recursion, but perhaps that's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe some NTs are supposed to produce terminals directly, like NT27 -> t7, etc.\n\nWait, I need to check the grammar carefully. For example, looking at the production rules:\n\nNT52 -> 't44', which suggests that NT52 can produce the terminal t44. Similarly, NT44 -> 't6', so NT44 produces t6. I think I might have made a mistake earlier; the non-terminals can expand into terminals, but the rules with two non-terminals on the right-hand side (rhs) are like S -> NT15 NT43, meaning each non-terminal on the rhs must be expanded until they are terminals.\n\nBut I'm trying to match the entire string to the grammar, so each terminal in the string must correspond to a terminal production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to reconstruct the derivation starting from S and see if it can produce the given string. Alternatively, perhaps I can parse the string using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nThe string begins with t2. Looking through the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t2? Let's see: NT4 -> 't48', but that's not t2. NT52 -> 't44', which is t44, not t2. NT13 -> 't39'. Wait, let me check: looking at the grammar rules, the production NT4 -> 't48', that's a terminal. Also, NT13 -> 't39', that's another.\n\nWait, but where does t2 come from? Let's look for NTs that produce t2. Scanning through the production rules, I don't see any NT producing t2. Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is t2. That suggests that there must be a production that allows a non-terminal to produce t2. But looking at the grammar, all the production rules only produce t1 to t99, but I don't see any where a non-terminal produces t2. Hmm. That immediately raises a red flag.\n\nWait, checking again: in the production rules, I see NT4 -> 't48' and NT5 -> 't2'. Oh, there it is. NT5 -> 't2'. So the terminal t2 is produced by NT5. So that's good\u2014how did I miss that before. So the string starts with t2, which is produced by NT5.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t2. Then, the next symbol is t91. Let's see where that comes from. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT producing t91, but perhaps it's part of a production that leads to multiple terminals. Alternatively, perhaps t91 is produced by one of the non-terminals. Wait, let me check: looking for a production that leads to t91.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the production NT9 -> 't28' comes up, but that's not t91. NT23 -> 't7'? Hmm. Alternatively, is there a production that results in t91? I don't see any NT in the productions that directly produce t91. So maybe t91 is part of a larger production. For example, perhaps NT91 is not part of the grammar. Wait, in the provided grammar, I don't see any rules ending with t91. So if the second symbol is t91 and there's no production that leads to t91, then the string isn't possible. But that can't be right because the string is supposed to be evaluated as either Yes or No. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait a moment, looking at the production rules, did I copy them correctly? For example, each production is written as NT followed by a number, then ->, then either another NT or a terminal. So the production rules are all in the form of NTX -> NTY or NTX -> tY. So each production rule is a non-terminal followed by a number, and the rhs is either another non-terminal (like NT24 -> NT18) or a terminal like NT9 -> t28.\n\nBut in the string, I see terms like t91, t37, t11, etc. Looking through the grammar, do any of the non-terminals produce t91? Let me check:\n\n- NT28 -> 't67' (yes, that's t67)\n- NT24 -> 't55' (t55)\n- NT22 perhaps? Wait, the provided grammar may not produce t91. Looking through the list provided, the only terminals defined are from t1 to t99, but many are specific. For example, NT52 -> 't44', NT44 -> 't6', NT42 -> 't5', etc. I don't see any NT that produces t91.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string cannot be generated because the second symbol, t91, isn't produced by any of the non-terminals in the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed a production. Let me go through the grammar again to see if t91 is produced.\n\nLooking through the provided production rules:\n\n- NT2 ->'t41'\n- NT5 ->'t2'\n- NT4->'t48'\n- NT10->'t50' (I think that's correct as per the provided rules)\n- Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT producing t91. So yes, if t91 is present and not generated by any NT, then the string is not possible.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I construct the string. Let me check again.\n\nThe string is: t2 t91 t11 t65 t11 t13 t91 t37 t3 t39 t16 t3 t67 t48 t65 t4 t16 t39 t38 t99 t18 t72 t33 t88 t67 t28 t37 t2 t28 t24 t2 t33 t84 t3 t18 t41 t24 t90 t44.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t2 (produced by NT5). The next is t91, which as I can't find in the grammar, so this seems impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way that a non-terminal could produce t91 through a series of expansions. For example, if an NT could produce a t followed by another NT, which then produces more ts. But looking at the provided grammar, none of the rules directly produce t91, and there's no NT that when expanded would directly or indirectly lead to t91. All the terminals are either single t's or two-digit ts, but none I think is t91.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. If the given string starts with t2, which is produced by NT5, and the next symbol is t91, which is not produced by any NT in the grammar, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-752","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies certain analyses. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It seems to consist of several non-terminal symbols (like S, NT15, NT50, etc.) that can be rewritten into other non-terminal or terminal symbols (the 't' sequences). The start symbol is S. The goal is to see if the string can be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nThe string provided is a series of t followed by numbers: `t44 t72 t72 t41 t99 t31 t65 t18 t2 t99 t12 t39 t65 t99 t41 t87 t31 t31 t2 t18 t69 t44 t72 t24 t89 t37 t55 t90 t69 t48 t18 t41 t65 t41 t3 t44 t7 t38 t12 t3`. I notice that each 't' is followed by a number, and these numbers must correspond to the production rules of the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top-level production starting from S. The production for S is S -> NT15 NT15 NT43. Wait, no, the initial grammar is S -> NT15 NT15 NT43? Let me check the given grammar again. Oh, yes, looking back, I see that S is indeed the start symbol and its production is NT15, NT15, NT43. So S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43.\n\nEach of these NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals, so I need to see what they produce. Looking at NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT15 can derive sequences involving NT37 and itself. And NT43 has multiple productions, but one of them is NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. Let's see what NT6 and NT1 produce.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT40 NT30. NT40 is a terminal, 't40'. Wait, in the given grammar, NT40 \u2192 t65? So NT40 is just 't65'. Wait no, the grammar has NT40 \u2192 t65? Let me check. Yes, looking back, in the grammar, NT40 \u2192 t65.\n\nSimilarly, NT30 has multiple productions. One of them is NT30 \u2192 NT46 NT14, but looking through the grammar, I see NT24, NT25, etc., and NT30. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar, I see that NT30 has several productions, such as NT30 \u2192 NT24 NT44, NT30 \u2192 NT20 NT24, etc. But some of them derive into terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map each NT to their possible terminal or other NT productions. Let me go through each NT step by step.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15.\n\nWait, so NT15 can keep deriving itself with NT37. So the production could be S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43, where each NT15 can eventually resolve into some sequence ending with 't'.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT15's production is only NT37 NT15. That's recursive, so when we expand it, eventually, maybe it leads to a terminal. Let's check if NT37 has any terminal productions.\n\nLooking at NT37: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 or NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT45 or NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45 or NT37 \u2192 NT27 NT6 or others like NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, etc.\n\nHmm, but none of those produce terminals directly. Wait, in the grammar, NT37 seems to have rules that derive other non-terminals. Let me check all NT37's productions:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n- NT37 \u2192 NT27 NT6\n- NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n- NT37 \u2192 NT37 NT37\n\nWait, so NT37 can't directly produce a terminal but might produce sequences of itself, leading to an infinite loop unless it eventually leads to a production that does terminate with a 't'.\n\nLet me check further. For example, NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30. Oh, that's interesting. NT17 can produce NT2 and NT30. NT2 is another non-terminal: NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32. And NT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46. NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a complex parse tree, but perhaps each NT eventually resolves to a 't'. Alternatively, maybe some NTs resolve to a combination of 't's.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, some of these NTs do have terminal productions. For example, NT40 \u2192 t40, and NT41 \u2192 t41, NT42 \u2192 t42, etc. So if any NT eventually resolves to these, they produce a terminal.\n\nWait, in the string provided, I see 't44', 't72', etc. Let's see if any NT in the grammar can derive 't44' or 't72'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, at some point, I notice that some NTs derive into terminals like:\n\n- NT15 eventually might derive into 't38' perhaps? Let me trace:\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of the NT symbols and their possible productions, focusing on those that eventually produce terminals.\n\nLooking back, the grammar seems to have several NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT4 \u2192 t48\n- NT9 \u2192 t8\n- NT10 \u2192 t16\n- NT12 \u2192 t12\n- NT13 \u2192 t39\n- NT15 (though I'm not sure, need to check all)\n- NT18\n- NT21\n- NT28: wait, NT28 has several productions, for example, NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23, NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34, etc. But looking at the grammar, for example, NT28 \u2192 nt26 nt23, and maybe nt23 can derive into something else. Alternatively, looking back, I see that NT28 \u2192 nt6 nt17, from the grammar? Wait, no, in the given grammar, under NT28, looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT1\n- Wait, checking the grammar, under NT28, I see:\n\n\"NT28 -> NT20 NT1\"\n\nThen under NT20: \"NT20 -> NT36 NT20\"\n\nWait, NT20's production includes NT36 NT20, and NT36's production is:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT5 NT30, among others. This suggests that NT20 can go into a chain that might eventually produce something.\n\nAlternatively, looking for any NTs that produce a 't' directly.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that some entries are simply 't' followed by a number, e.g., NT5 \u2192 't2', NT4 \u2192 't48', etc. So for example:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t2\nNT4 \u2192 t48\nNT9 \u2192 t8\nNT10 \u2192 t16\nNT12 \u2192 t12\nNT13 \u2192 t39\nNT26 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT26 is in NT25: NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47, and NT13 \u2192 t39, NT47 \u2192 NT47 NT27? Wait, no, looking at the grammar for NT47: NT47 \u2192 NT27 NT6.\n\nWait, let me check each NT in the grammar that might produce a 't' when expanded deeply.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT4 \u2192 t48\n- NT26 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34. Then NT24 has several productions, one is NT24 \u2192 't5' and others are more complex. For example, NT24 \u2192 t5, and also NT24 \u2192 t55, and perhaps others.\n\nWait, NT24's productions include:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t5\n- NT24 \u2192 t55\n- NT24 \u2192 t28\n- NT24 \u2192 t4\n\nWait, for example, looking at the production for NT24: \"NT24 -> NT4 NT44\" and also \"NT24 -> 't5'\".

{"custom_id":"request-757","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t84 t11 t31 t37 t48 t11 t89 t87 t90 t84 t63 t69 t83 t28 t90 t63 t11 t6 t39 t7 t13 t89 t7 t18 t55 t4 t11 t67 t33 t89 t18 t88 t48 t39 t24 t69 t7 t7 t91 t99`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. However, I notice that some of the productions have non-terminals on both sides, like NT24 -> NT48 NT35, which is still allowed in CNF because it's B \u2192 BC style, but perhaps the formatting was a bit off.\n\nWait, looking again, I see that some productions have two NTs on the right, which are essentially the same as the non-terminals, so it's still CNF.\n\nNow, the goal is to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me write down the start symbol S. The initial production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, the string generated by S will have two parts: the first part from NT15 and the second from NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t84 t11 t31...`, which seems to correspond to the non-terminals derived from NT15 and NT43.\n\nI should probably build a parse tree, ensuring that each part of the string corresponds to the possible derivations from NT15 and NT43.\n\nStarting with NT15. The production for NT15 is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So it's a recursive production: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. This means that NT15 expands into a sequence of NT37 and NT15 repeatedly, but since it's in CNF, each step must be a single production, so it can only split into NT37 and NT15 at each step.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 has multiple productions. Let me look at NT43: NT43 -> NT6 NT1, | NT27 NT0.\n\nWait, no, the actual productions for NT43 are:\n\nNT43 -> NT6 NT1\n\nand\n\nNT43 -> NT27 NT0\n\nLooking at the string, the first part of NT43's expansion might start with `t24 t90` (since `t48` is from NT1). Wait, no, the string is a list separated by spaces, each being a terminal or a non-terminal. So `t84 t11 t31 t37 t48 t11 t89 t87 t90 t84...`.\n\nWait, actually, each component in the string represents a symbol, either a terminal or a non-terminal. The grammar has non-terminals like NT1, NT2, etc., and terminals like 't48', which are the ones mapped directly.\n\nSo, to parse the string, we can see that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. Each NT is a non-terminal that can be expanded into other symbols.\n\nThe parsing approach for a string with mixed terminals and non-terminals can be done using recursive descent parsing or other methods, but perhaps I can break it down step by step.\n\nLet me start by splitting the string into individual symbols:\n\nThe string is: `t84 t11 t31 t37 t48 t11 t89 t87 t90 t84 t63 t69 t83 t28 t90 t63 t11 t6 t39 t7 t13 t89 t7 t18 t55 t4 t11 t67 t33 t89 t18 t88 t48 t39 t24 t69 t7 t7 t91 t99`\n\nSo, the sequence is a list of 39 symbols.\n\nNow, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the entire string should consist of two parts: the first part derived from NT15 and the second from NT43.\n\nFirst, let's process NT15: S's first symbol is t84, which is a terminal. So looking for a production where the left-hand side (LHS) is NT15, which would expand to the sequence of symbols leading up to t84.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start by looking at the grammar's rules for NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the production for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So, to derive t84, we might have a series of NT37 and NT15 productions.\n\nWait, but NT37's production is NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT45, and then looking further down, NT19 \u2192 NT13 NT28, and so on. Alternatively, looking for terminals in the grammar, since NT symbols don't map to terminals except for some specific NTs.\n\nWait, actually, the terminals are all the 't' followed by numbers, but the NTs are named as NT1, NT2, etc. So for example, NT15 -> ... could eventually produce a terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar provided, some non-terminals directly expand to terminals. For example, NT45 -> 't11', NT44 -> 't6', etc.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to trace the possible symbols that each non-terminal can expand into.\n\nLet's start by trying to see if the string starts with a production of NT15 that yields 't84'...\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the productions for each NT.\n\nFirst, NT15:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n\nWait, that's a recursive production, so NT15 can only generate sequences where it leads to more NT37 and NT15.

{"custom_id":"request-769","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided seems to fit this because all the rules are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. Some rules, like NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, might look a bit different at first glance, but seeing that NT15 is a non-terminal also fits.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t89 t5 t65 t54 t63 t99 t54 t13 t33 t99 t2 t87 t88 t2 t38 t4 t89 t48 t37 t72 t83 t33 t41 t3 t91 t18 t6 t67 t2 t28 t13 t6 t65 t72 t4 t5 t24 t38 t11 t2 t33`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the string consists of several 't' words, which are terminals. The grammar has productions that produce these terminals. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me start by understanding how the start symbol S generates the string. The production for S is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S starts by splitting into NT15 and NT43. Each of these can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0. NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should parse the string step by step, trying to match the productions.\n\nThe first term in the string is 't89'. Let's see which non-terminal can directly produce 't89'. Looking through the grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4, and NT4 \u2192 NT26 NT2. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me scan the grammar for rules that produce 't89' directly. Oh, I see NT48 \u2192 't89' because one of the production rules is NT48 \u2192 't89'. So maybe we can use NT48 to produce 't89'.\n\nBut wait, how does that fit into the context? Let me see. If S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and then NT15 produces something and NT43 produces another part. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a way to produce 't89' earlier in the derivation.\n\nAnother approach is to build the parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string should be a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step. The first token is 't89'. Looking at the grammar, NT48 \u2192 't89'. So one possibility is that the first part of the string comes from NT48.\n\nLooking at NT48, it can be derived from NT44 using NT44 \u2192 't6' and NT47 \u2192 't48', but wait, that's another way. Wait, no. From the grammar, NT48 can be NT42 NT21 or NT44 NT21 or NT27 NT6, for example.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the production:\nNT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21\nNT44 \u2192 't6'\nNT21 \u2192 't33'\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't89'. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, is there a production for NT44 directly? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any direct production for NT44 except as a component in other rules. So perhaps 't89' comes from NT48, which in turn comes from other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't89' is produced directly by a non-terminal. Let me check all the rules where a terminal is on the right. I see NT48 \u2192 't89', so yes, that can produce 't89' directly. So maybe S starts with NT15 NT43, and NT43 is NT27 NT0, and NT27 is NT8 NT17, etc., but it's getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parse the entire string step by step by trying to break it down using the production rules.\n\nAnother thought: since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree should be a binary tree, so the string length should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions. Wait, but the string has 33 tokens. 2^5 is 32, so 2^6 is 64. Hmm, 33 isn't a power of two, so maybe the string isn't possible, but I'm not sure. Wait, the string length is 33 terms, which would imply that the derivation has 33 steps? Or perhaps the parse tree has a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each step in the leftmost derivation doubles the number of symbols, so from S (1 symbol), to two, four, etc. But in this case, the string has 33 symbols, which isn't a power of two. That suggests it might not be possible. However, I'm not entirely sure because some symbols might produce multiple terminals.\n\nWait, each production can result in either a terminal (which is a single symbol) or two non-terminals (which will expand further). So the total number of symbols in the string is equal to 2^k + (number of direct terminals). Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Let's consider that for each production of a non-terminal, if it results in two non-terminals, each of those could, in turn, produce more symbols. So the total number of terminals depends on how many non-terminals stop producing terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string has 33 terminals. Starting from S, which is one non-terminal, each step splits into two non-terminals, so the count of symbols grows exponentially, but with some non-terminals producing terminals, which don't split further.\n\nBut this approach is getting too complicated, and perhaps I should instead try to look for possible patterns in the string that match the grammar.\n\nLooking again, the first token is 't89', which can come from NT48. Then the next is 't5'. Let's see which non-terminal can produce 't5'. Oh, wait, looking through the grammar, some terminals are 't2', 't4', 't5', etc. Let me check NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47. Hmm, no, not directly 't5'.\n\nWait, looking at the production NT48 \u2192 NT42 NT21. Hmm, no. Alternatively, NT5 \u2192 't2', so perhaps NT5 produces 't2', but looking elsewhere, I don't see NT2 producing 't5'. Wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me go back. The grammar has several rules where terminals appear. Let me list all the direct terminal productions to make it easier:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't48' (from NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21, etc.)\n- NT48 \u2192 't89' (from one rule)\n- NT9 \u2192 't52', etc. Wait, not sure. Let me list all the rule endings:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't89'\nNT42 \u2192 't5'\nNT8 \u2192 't40' and 't49'? Wait, no. Let me check each rule that ends directly in a terminal.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- S: No terminals.\n- NT15 \u2192 't5' No, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, so that's non-terminal.\nWait, actually, NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT48, that's a non-terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT15 can produce NT48, which can produce 't89', but that's further down. Wait, perhaps NT15 can also produce other things? Let me re-examine the grammar rules.\n\nWait, the grammar as presented seems to have multiple rules, but all with NTs or 't's. Let's list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'? No, looking at the rules, I don't see NT9 \u2192 't5'. Let me scan:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43\n- NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20\n- NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 't48' (from NT24 \u2192 't5' is no, wait.)\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm missing it.

{"custom_id":"request-772","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by this context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should help because Chomsky normal form often makes parsing easier, but here I just need to check if the string can be derived.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar to see which non-terminals are connected to the terminals in the string. The string is a sequence of terminals like 't28', 't87', etc. The goal is to see if starting from the start symbol S, we can derive this string through a series of steps where each production replaces a non-terminal with terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is the start symbol, and S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So initially, the string starts with NT15 and NT43. Let's see what NT15 and NT43 can produce. From the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Oh, wait, that's recursive. So NT15 can produce NT37 followed by NT15 again. But then I look at NT37, which can go to NT19 NT19. So NT37 is producing two NT19s. Now, NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38, and NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48, and NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should break this down step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't28 t87 t28 t88 t31 t54 t67 t88 t24 t11 t11 t54 t87 t48 t33 t31 t54 t89 t16 t44 t3 t6 t38 t72 t4 t3 t63 t72 t55 t63 t41 t39 t36 t16 t54 t54 t38 t36 t12 t16 t54'. That's 44 tokens. Each production step replaces a non-terminal with others, so the length of the string should correspond to the number of steps. Each application of a production usually increases the string length by one or more, depending on the rules.\n\nWait, but since it's Chomsky normal form, each production replaces one non-terminal with two others or a terminal. So, starting from S (1 non-terminal), each step increases the count by one. The string has 44 terminals, so the number of steps needed should be 44. However, let's not get bogged down by that right now.\n\nLet me start with the beginning. S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first two symbols should be 't28' and something else. Wait, 't28' is a terminal, but according to the production, NT40 \u2192 't65', which is not 't28'. Let me see which NT produces 't28'. Looking through the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT28 NT7. Also, NT24 \u2192 NT28 NT48. Hmm. 't28' could come from NT29 \u2192 't28' if NT29 is reduced to 't28'. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, looking at the string, it starts with 't28 t87 t28 t88 t31 t54...'. So the first symbol is 't28', which must come from an NT production that can derive 't28'. Looking at the grammar, NT28 has two productions: NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23 and NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT1. Oh, and NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34, and NT24 can produce 't18' and others. Hmm, but also NT29 \u2192 NT28 NT7. So if NT29 \u2192 't28', and then NT7 produces something. Wait, NT7 \u2192 't35' and NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37, which eventually could produce terminals. That might be a way to get 't28'.\n\nWait, but stepping back, maybe I can try building the parse tree. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT13 NT17\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT21 NT48 (Wait, is that right? NT13 \u2192 NT69? Or wait, checking the grammar: NT13 \u2192 't69'? No, looking back, maybe I misread. Wait, looking at the grammar entries:\n\nLooking for 't28' and 't87' etc. So let me see, each NT's productions:\n\nFor example, NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23 or NT20 NT1. Let's check NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT2 NT50.\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31. So NT50 can go to NT7 NT31, which then can produce 't35' and other things. Hmm, maybe not the easiest path.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT43, which is part of the initial production S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So NT43 can be NT27 NT0, which then can become 't54' and 't33'? Wait, but the string starts with 't28', so maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider how each 't' in the string is generated. Let's list out where each 't' comes from:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some NTs have terminals attached:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't65'\n- NT52 \u2192 't44' or 't6' (Wait, NT52 \u2192 NT6 NT25, and then NT25 \u2192 't48', etc. Hmm, not sure.\nWait, the grammar has some NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't67' (Wait, no. Let me check: NT28's productions are in the grammar, but I don't see any. Wait, the user provided the entire grammar with all productions, but perhaps I should parse it.\n\nLooking again, the grammar entries with terminals are ones where NTs directly produce 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't44'\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT29 \u2192 't28' (Wait, no, looking at NT29: its production is NT28 NT7, not a terminal. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the user's provided grammar, I see some NTs are replaced by terminals:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't44'\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT29 \u2192 't28' (Wait, no: looking at production rules, for NT29, I see NT29 \u2192 NT28 NT7 and also NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT48. So no direct terminal. Hmm, maybe I need to look for more.\n\nWait, maybe NTs other than those listed are producing terminals elsewhere. Let me check the full list of NT productions:\n\nLooking at the full list, for example:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 and also NT15 \u2192 't36' through NT15 \u2192 NT50 NT30, but no, NT50 is another NT. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the only terminals are:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, each line is a production for a non-terminal. The lines where the production ends with a 't' are those that are directly generating terminals. So, for example, BT52 \u2192 't44' is a production that directly produces a terminal. Similarly, NT44 \u2192 't6', NT5 \u2192 't2', NT4 \u2192 't48', NT29 \u2192 't28'? Wait, no: looking at the grammar, for NT29, it's defined as NT28 NT7, not a terminal. Wait, maybe I should list all the direct terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT6 \u2192 't16'\n- NT13 \u2192 't69'? Wait, no, NT13 is \u2192 't39'? No, wait: no, in the user's provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n1. S-> NT15 NT43\n2. NT50-> NT1 NT32\n3.

For example, NT19 \u2192 NT13 NT35, and if NT35 can derive to something that gives 't54', or directly NT19 can derive it.\n\nWait, let me look for 't54':\n\nYes, NT18 \u2192 't54' and NT19 \u2192 't54'.

Also, NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19.\n\nAdditionally, NT19 can produce 't54' via NT19 \u2192 't54'.\n\nSo, that's a possibility.\n\nSimilarly, in the string, there are 't28's, which may come from certain NTs.\n\nNow, let's start building the tree step by step.\n\nThe initial expansion is S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nNT15 expands into NT37 NT15 (recursive, so it's NT37 \u2192 NT15).\n\nWait, no, S is NT15 NT43.

Wait, that leads back to higher levels, which might not help. Alternatively, if we take NT19 \u2192 't54', that would get us a 't54' into the string.\n\nSo, in this case, that part of the string could be 't54'.\n\nBut let me see if I can map the entire string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S.\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-792","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is `t88 t88 t7 t65 t54 t24 t67 t91 t6 t2 t55 t16 t54 t37 t65 t3 t48 t99 t99 t37 t24 t18 t24 t24 t48 t54 t36 t24 t3 t18 t36 t38 t90 t3 t4 t11 t4 t91 t84 t37 t18 t87`. \n\nFirst, I'll note that in CNF, each production on the left-hand side (LHS) of the grammar has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side (RHS), either two non-terminals, a terminal and a non-terminal, or a non-terminal and a terminal. But in this case, looking at the grammar, I see rules like S -> NT15 NT43, which are two non-terminals. But I also notice some rules where the RHS includes terminals, but looking closer, the grammar seems primarily to use non-terminals on the RHS, like NT15 and NT43, etc. \n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar provided, all the productions are of the form A -> BC, B -> CD, etc., meaning each production has two non-terminals as the RHS. But then why do some symbols in the grammar have RHS as terminals, like NT9-> NT52 NT4, which would mean after expanding, NT9 would produce a terminal 't4' plus another non-terminal. So the grammar is using both two non-terminals and terminals in the productions. Wait, but does that still fall under CNF? Because CNF requires each production to have exactly two symbols. So if a production has a terminal and a non-terminal, that's allowed as two symbols as well. So yes, the grammar is in CNF, with each production having exactly two symbols on the RHS, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string we need to evaluate consists entirely of terminals (all the 't' followed by numbers). So, the key is to see how the string can be derived from the grammar by successively replacing non-terminals with their productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nThe approach I think is the most practical here is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing context-free grammars in CNF. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's count the length of the string. The string is: \n\n`t88 t88 t7 t65 t54 t24 t67 t91 t6 t2 t55 t16 t54 t37 t65 t3 t48 t99 t99 t37 t24 t18 t24 t24 t48 t54 t36 t24 t3 t18 t36 t38 t90 t3 t4 t11 t4 t91 t84 t37 t18 t87`\n\nSo that's 37 tokens. Each token is a terminal. So each token corresponds to a single terminal in one of the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every production has two symbols on the RHS. So, for a string of length n, the derivation requires log2(n) levels. But with 37 symbols, that might be a bit complex, so let's see if we can find a pattern or possible structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to certain non-terminals or their productions. Let's look at the string and see if I can spot any patterns or repetitions that might correspond to non-terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt88 t88 t7 t65 t54 t24 t67 t91 t6 t2 t55 t16 t54 t37 t65 t3 t48 t99 t99 t37 t24 t18 t24 t24 t48 t54 t36 t24 t3 t18 t36 t38 t90 t3 t4 t11 t4 t91 t84 t37 t18 t87\n\nFirst, notice that t88 appears twice at the beginning. The grammar has a production NT4-> t28 t2, NT4->t48, and NT9->t28 t7, among others. Wait, but t88 is a terminal, so it must come from a production rule that includes t88. Let's check the grammar rules to see if any rule produces t88.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT38-> 't72'? Wait no, some rules have the RHS as terminals. For example:\n\n- NT4 -> t26 t2 (No, I think I'm mixing up the rules. Wait, let's look back at the rules:\n\nLooking at the list of rules, some have RHS as 't...' with numbers, others have a mix of NT and 't...'\n\nLooking again:\n\nFor example, NT52-> 't44', which is a terminal. NT44->'t6', NT42->'t5', etc. But looking for 't88' specific:\n\n- NT9-> NT52 NT4: RHS is NT52 and NT4. But NT52->'t44', so NT9->'t44' NT4.\n\n- NT50-> NT41 NT43: Both are non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking for any rule that has a terminal 't88' in RHS. Let's check all the rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT4-> NT26 NT2: both non-terminals.\n\n- NT48->t48 NT2: Or wait, no, in the grammar, the RHS could be 't88' only if some NT produces it. Wait, checking line by line:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the grammar is presented. Each line is a production A -> RHS, where RHS is a sequence of two symbols, each being either a NT (like NT15, NT43) or a terminal (the string of 't' followed by numbers). So, for example, the line NT52 -> 't44' means that NT52 can be replaced by the terminal 't44'. Similarly, NT24->'t5' means NT24 can produce 't5'.\n\nSo, in the grammar, certain non-terminals produce specific terminals. So, to produce a terminal like 't88', there must be a rule where a non-terminal is replaced by 't88'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, let's check for any RHS that is just a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT4->t26 t2: No, it's a production of two non-terminals NT26 and NT2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let's carefully parse each rule.\n\nFor example, the rule NT52 -> 't44': So, the non-terminal NT52 can be replaced by the terminal 't44'. Similarly, NT44->'t6', meaning non-terminal NT44 produces 't6'. \n\nWait, looking through all the rules:\n\n- NT52->'t44' (terminal)\n- NT44->'t6' (terminal)\n- NT42->'t5' (terminal)\n- NT24->'t5' (terminal)\n- NT28->'t4' (terminal)\n- NT23->'t7' (terminal)\n- NT9->'t7' (terminal)\n- NT12->'t16' (terminal)\n- NT51->'t90' (terminal)\n- NT48->'t87' (terminal)\n- NT1->'t24' (terminal)\n- NT34->'t87' (terminal)\n- NT37->'t12' (terminal)\n- NT36->'t84' (terminal)\n- NT17->'t33' (terminal)\n- NT27->'t83' (terminal)\n- NT15->'t69' (terminal)\n- NT10->'t36' (terminal)\n- NT21->'t99' (terminal)\n- NT50->'t33' (terminal)\n- NT19->'t13' (terminal)\n- NT37->'t13' (terminal)\n- NT38->'t37' (terminal)\n- NT45->'t11' (terminal)\n- NT24->'t55' (terminal) [I see earlier I may have misread NT24->'t5'; in the rule list, NT24 is replaced twice, perhaps: NT24->'t5' and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-808","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. \n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, most of the rules seem to be of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 something ending with a terminal. \n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of terminals: `t4 t37 t99 t41 t7 t41 t91 t38 t44 t90 t6 t37 t69 t41 t72 t11 t16 t63 t16 t91 t2 t89 t36 t6 t33 t69 t4 t83 t36 t48 t38 t63 t89 t65 t38 t38 t69 t67 t39 t4 t37 t39 t4`. \n\nFirst, I think I should parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing in CNF can be done using a top-down approach, like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, maybe I should look for a pattern or see if the grammar has certain properties.\n\nWait, I notice that many of the productions end with t followed by a number. For example, NT6 \u2192 t16, NT17 \u2192 t33, etc. So each production rule either combines two non-terminals or produces a token followed by a number, except for NT5 which seems to produce 't2'. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 tX, where X is some number.\n\nThe string starts with t4, which suggests that the first production might be from NT4 \u2192 't4'. Looking back at the grammar, NT4 is defined as: \n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT26 NT2\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34\n- NT24 \u2192 ...\nWait, but NT4 also has a production NT4 \u2192 t88, which would directly produce 't88'. But the string starts with 't4', not 't88', so perhaps the initial NT is higher up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol S is the root, so let's see what S produces. The first rule for S is:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT15\n\nWait, but let me check the grammar again. Wait, the first line is S -> NT15 NT15. But in the given grammar, looking at S, it's defined as S -> NT15 NT15. So that would mean to produce t4 from NT15, since looking for the rules where NT15 is on the left: \n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\nand \nNT15 \u2192 NT24 NT47\n\nAdditionally, there's another production for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15.\n\nWait, so it seems NT15 can produce something that eventually leads to a terminal. Let me check the NT15 rules again, perhaps it's supposed to terminate. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here because from the grammar given, NT15 is defined as:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nNT15 -> NT24 NT47\nand also, looking further:\nLooking at the initial lines, I see:\n\nLine 15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\nLine 16: NT15 \u2192 NT24 NT47\n\nWait, but I also see later (line 25) NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which is the same as line 15. So perhaps this is a recursive production for NT15.\n\nBut also, looking further, for NT37: \n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n\nAnd NT19: \n\nNT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\nNT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 (line where NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19)\nWait, that's a problem because if NT19 can produce itself, that would make the grammar left-recursive, which is not allowed in CNF. Hmm, but in the initial question, the grammar is in CNF, so perhaps that's okay because the non-terminals can have left-recursive productions, but in top-down parsing, handling that could be a bit tricky.\n\nBut perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's try to see if the initial symbol S can generate the given string.\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT15\n\nSo, S needs to produce two NT15s. Then each of those would eventually produce parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string: starts with t4, t37, t99, etc. So perhaps the first NT15 is producing t4?\n\nWait, looking at the rules for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 and NT15 \u2192 NT24 NT47. So let's see if any of these produce a terminal, or if they need to go further.\n\nLooking for any production that NT15 has that leads directly to a terminal, but in the provided grammar, I don't see NT15 \u2192 tX. Checking:\n\nLooking at the main grammar lines:\nNT15's rules: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, NT15 \u2192 NT24 NT47, and later lines where NT15 is mentioned, like line 25: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which is same as before. So no direct NT15 \u2192 tX. Hmm, then how does S generate a string that starts with t4?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the other parts. Let's see if NT6 can produce 't4'. Looking at NT6:\n\nLooking through the grammar, line 92: NT6 \u2192 t16.\nLine 44: NT4 \u2192 t88.\nBut wait, NT15 is a problem because it doesn't directly produce a terminal except in recursive ways.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me re-examine. The first rule is S \u2192 NT15 NT15. Then NT15 has two rules: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 and NT15 \u2192 NT24 NT47.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look deeper. Let me see what NT24 produces. \n\nLooking at NT24: \n\nLine 30: NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT48 (Wait, no, line 30 is NT30 \u2192 NT24 NT24. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial scan.)\n\nWait, I might be getting mixed up. Let me take a systematic approach.\n\nEach rule is in the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 terminal.\n\nSo let's list all the NTx's and their productions.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT15 NT15\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-811","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens, each starting with a 't' and then a number, except for the initial part, but looking closer, it seems all are in the form 't#'. \n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So the grammar is structured such that each step expands a non-terminal into two others, and so on, until terminals are reached. The string we're given is made up of terminal symbols, so I need to see if the entire string can be derived by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which immediately produces NT15 NT43. So the first two symbols after S must come from NT15 and NT43. Let me see how these Non-Terminals expand.\n\nNT15 produces NT37 NT15. Wait, that's recursion because NT15 is on both sides. Wait, no, the first production is NT15 -> NT37 NT15, so each time we expand NT15, it's two symbols: NT37 and NT15. Similarly, NT43 has multiple productions. For example, NT43 can produce NT6 NT1 or NT27 NT0. Let me check the NT43 production in the grammar. Oh, in the given grammar, NT43 has two productions: NT6 NT1 and NT27 NT0. Wait, so looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT43 -> NT27 NT0\nNT43 -> NT6 NT1\n\nSo when expanding S, we have NT15 NT43, which can lead to several possibilities depending on how NT43 is expanded. Let me try to break down the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't83 t5 t28 ...'. So the first step is S -> NT15 NT43. NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Then, the first token is 't83' which corresponds to NT37, so looking at the productions for NT37: I see NT37 -> NT19 NT19. So NT37 produces two NT19s. Similarly, NT15 -> NT37 NT15, so the chain continues. Wait, but hold on, let me see what NT37 does. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nNT37 -> NT38 NT37\nNT37 -> NT38 NT38\n\nSo each NT37 can expand in several ways. The first token is 't83', which is NT37. So we pick NS37's production: t83 corresponds to NT37. So how does NT37 produce 't83'? Wait, looking back, each NT37 has specific terminal productions. For example, NT37 -> NT19 NT19, which eventually would produce some tokens, but in this problem, each NT is actually mapped to a specific terminal, right? Wait no, actually NT37 can produce different non-terminals. Wait, no, in this case, each non-terminal might have specific terminal symbols attached. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each production for a non-terminal seems to be followed by specific terminal tokens. Wait, for example, NT52 -> 't44', which is a terminal token. So each non-terminal might have some productions that result in these tokens. So, when NT32 is used, it can produce 't83' because looking at the grammar:\n\nNT32 -> NT25 NT46\nAnd looking at NT25 and NT46, do they produce any terminals? Let me check:\n\nNT25 -> NT13 NT47\nNT47 -> NT25 NT16\nWait, but NT47 has a production to 't16', right? Because looking at the end of the grammar, NT47 -> 't16'. So wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each Non-Terminal is directly connected to a terminal symbol in some production. Let me see if any Non-Terminal directly produces a terminal. For example:\n\nNT44 -> 't6'\nNT42 -> 't5'\nNT13 -> 't39'\nNT28 -> 't67'\nNT0 -> 't39'\nNT40 -> 't65'\nNT46 -> 't72'\nNT32 -> 't83'\nNT24 -> 't18'\nNT24 -> 't55'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't48'\nNT29 -> 't63'\nNT4 -> 't88'\nNT9 -> 't28'\nNT50 -> 't33'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT51 -> 't90'\nNT48 -> 't87'\nNT1 -> 't24'\nNT34 -> 't87'\nNT36 -> 't84'\nNT21 -> 't99'\nNT45 -> 't11'\nNT19 -> 't13'\nNT37 -> 't12'\nNT51 -> 't31'\nNT45 -> 't67'\nNT36 -> 't41'\nNT26 -> 't12'\nNT5 -> 't7'\nNT13 -> 't69'\nNT21 -> 't13'\nNT40 -> 't89'\nNT28 -> 't4'\nNT29 -> 't36'\nNT1 -> 't37'\nNT51 -> 't38'\nNT6 -> 't16'\nNT17 -> 't33'\nNT19 -> 't54'\nNT31 -> 't91'\nNT23 -> 't7'\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nOkay, so each of these Non-Terminals directly converts to a specific terminal. For example, NT32 -> 't83', NT28 -> 't4', etc. So when a Non-Terminal is derived, it produces a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So in the given grammar, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal, B and C are non-terminals. For example, NT44 -> 't6' is a terminal production, and NT25 -> NT13 NT47 is a non-terminal production.\n\nSo, each production in the grammar results in either two non-terminals or one terminal. So to generate a string, we start at S and expand non-terminals until all non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nGiven the string: t83 t5 t28 t88 t39 t55 t4 t48 t4 t88 t36 t55 t2 t67 t33 t67 t72 t7 t37 t38 t6 t67 t87 t28 t91 t87 t44 t13 t7 t28 t4 t7 t18 t33 t63 t4 t37 t84 t55 t89 t72 t63 t6.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from S by expanding the non-terminals into terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t83, which comes from NT32. So looking at the grammar, NT32 -> NT25 NT46. Then, each of NT25 and NT46 must be expanded into terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT25 -> NT13 NT47\nNT47 -> NT25 NT16 (so NT47 is two non-terminals)\nSo, wait, this seems recursive because NT25 appears again.\n\nWait, but NT25 is NT25 -> NT13 NT47, which is NT25 on the left, so it's recursive. But then NT47 -> NT25 NT16, which again has NT25. So, if I follow NT25, it will go into an infinite loop unless there's a terminal production. Do any of these Non-Terminals have a direct terminal production?\n\nLooking back, NT44 -> 't6', NT42 -> 't5', NT13 -> 't39', NT28 -> 't4', NT29 -> 't36', NT6 -> 't16', etc.\n\nSo, to resolve NT25, I need to find its productions. NT25-> NT13 NT47.\n\nWait, but NT13 is used here, which maps to a terminal symbol. So perhaps NT25 can produce some terminals through NT47.\n\nBut NT47 can produce NT25 NT16. So does NT47 have any terminal productions? Looking at NT47: NT47-> NT25 NT16.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token corresponds to a production in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the grammar to understand how the tokens are generated. CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. So, I'm looking at the given grammar to see how each token is derived.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals (like NT15, NT50, etc.) expand into two other non-terminals, while some others like NT4 (t2), NE4 (I think), etc., directly produce a terminal. For example, NT4 \u2192 t48, which is a direct terminal production. This will be very useful because when the parser tries to derive the string, it can immediately check these.\n\nThe string given is: `t48 t11 t2 t87 t83 t31 t24 t55 t7 t65 t7 t18 t38 t6 t7 t55 t83 t13 t37 t88 t89 t72 t16 t65 t33 t33 t63 t2 t65 t11 t24 t37 t65 t38 t63 t5 t36 t41 t41 t13 t13 t87 t5 t90`.\n\nI'll need to build a parse tree for this string starting from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, I'll use a top-down approach, specifically the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars.\n\nLet me try to list the steps I would take:\n\n1. **Identify the non-terminals and terminals in the string:**\n   Each token is either NTxx (non-terminals) or 't' followed by a number (terminals). \n\n2. **Check the structure of the grammar:**\n   The start symbol is S \u2192 NT15 NT15? No, wait, looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Oh wait, I think I misread earlier. Let me check:\n   The given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S expands into two non-terminals, NT15 and NT43.\n\n3. **Check the string length:**\n   The string has 43 tokens. Since S produces two non-terminals, the parse tree will have a root with two children, each of which will split further.\n\n4. **Apply the CYK algorithm:**\n   Assign each token to positions in a table and track possible non-terminals at each step.\n\n   Alternatively, I can see if each terminal matches a production of a non-terminal in the grammar. Since each step in the grammar either substitutes a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal, I can work my way back from the string.\n\n5. **List of terminal productions:**\n   Let's list all the non-terminals that have direct terminals:\n   - NT4 \u2192 t48\n   - NT5 \u2192 t7\n   - NT13 \u2192 t39\n   - NT24 \u2192 t18, t55\n   - NT25 \u2192 t41\n   - NT26 \u2192 t12\n   - NT27 \u2192 t8, t17\n   - NT32 \u2192 t83\n   - NT35 \u2192 t57 (Wait, looking back, no, NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37, but looking at the given grammar:\n   Check the grammar: NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37. No, that's a production in the grammar. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, there's NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37. So NT35 isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal.

The grammar is provided, and the string is a series of tokens ending with 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT15 and NT43. Each of these NTs then continues to expand further.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many of the non-terminals are broken down into smaller parts. For example, NT15 expands into NT37 and NT15 again. This might indicate a recursive structure. Some NTs eventually expand into terminal symbols (those ending with 't') or other NTs.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is quite long, with 42 tokens separated by spaces. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of substitutions using the given productions.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the structure of the string. Let's list out the tokens:\n\nt16, t36, t39, t88, t65, t37, t90, t69, t90, t36, t16, t99, t87, t31, t54, t33, t69, t2, t72, t88, t2, t2, t38, t28, t12, t6, t65, t12, t33, t36, t44, t6, t87, t6, t88, t12, t5, t13, t3, t33, t54, t88, t37, t99.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t16, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, 't16' appears as a terminal in the production of NT17. Also, other 't's are present, like t72, t88, etc. I need to see if these terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nI'll break down each NT.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (wait, that's recursive. Maybe it'll terminate at some point, but let's see.)\n\nWait, another way: NT15 can expand into NT37 and NT15. That seems recursive. So perhaps it's going to keep expanding until it can't anymore, but I need to see if it's a productive path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward path. Let me see other NTs.\n\nLooking at NT39: it may not be present, but in the string, there's t39.\n\nWait, looking at the non-terminals, t39 isn't directly in the grammar as a terminal, but perhaps one of the NTs expands to 't39'. Looking back, NT13 \u2192 't39', yes. So if I can get to NT13, that would give me t39.\n\nSimilarly, 't7' appears, which is the terminal from NT16.\n\nSo let's think about the possible expansions:\n\nLooking at NT15, it's producing NT37 and NT15. This seems to loop, but perhaps that's part of a larger expansion.\n\nPerhaps I should try to find a way to reach the given string by tracing back the productions. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to see if each token can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nBut that might take a long time. Alternatively, I can build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can reach the given string.\n\nLet me attempt to parse step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nSo the string must start with the results of NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t16. Let's see where t16 comes from. Checking the grammar, NT17 \u2192 't16' (from NT17's production: NT17 \u2192 't16' t33). Actually, looking at the grammar lines, some non-terminals expand into 't...':\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT16 \u2192 't33'. Wait, no, more accurately, looking at the production for NT16 in the grammar: NT16 \u2192 't33'. So if a NT produces NT16, then it will generate t33.\n\nWait, in the string, I see t33. Let me check if that matches. Yes, the string has two t33s.\n\nNow, looking at the first token: t16 is part of the string. Let me see where that comes from.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. If NT15 expands into NT37 and itself, how does it get resolved? Maybe NT37 expands into other things. Looking at NT37's production: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19.\n\nSo NT37 becomes two NT19s. Then each NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. So this could lead to more NT19s until it can find a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm going the wrong way. Maybe I should reverse-engineer the string.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: the last tokens are t99. Let's see where t99 comes from. Looking through the grammar, perhaps the only way t99 appears is in the production of NT90 (from NT21 \u2192 NT48 NT23: wait no, maybe not. Or looking for t99 in the grammar, perhaps it's generated by NT21: NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT0. Wait, NT13 \u2192 't39' and NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20.\n\nWait, NT0 is in the grammar: NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20.\n\nWait, let me list down the NTs and their terminals.\n\nNTs that generate terminals:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT51 \u2192 't90'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't4' (several NT28s)\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Perhaps I need to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: start from the end and see if I can backtrack.\n\nThe last token is t99. Where does t99 appear? Looking at the grammar, I don't see t99 directly. But looking at NT1 \u2192 NT51 NT38. NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29. NT29 \u2192 NT64 NT something? Wait, in the list: NT29: \"\u2192 NT4 NT52\" \u2192 Wait, I'm sorry, looking back, earlier in the grammar, it's written as:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, lines like:\n\nNT21: \u2192 NT13 NT0\n\nNT51: \u2192 NT88 NT29\n\nWait, maybe t99 is generated by NT31, which in the grammar is: NT31 \u2192 't91' as a terminal? Not exactly.\n\nWait, no\u2014the given grammar has NT31 \u2192 't91'? Let me check.\n\nIn the grammar list: NT31? Let's search. Wait the provided grammar has multiple NTs with 't' prefixes. For example, NT28 \u2192 't44 NT27', but in the actual list, looking at:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines provided, NT29 \u2192 NT4 NT52.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to write down all the NTs that produce 'tXX' in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for each NT rule, if the right side includes a terminal with 't...', I'll note it.\n\nNT1: NT4 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT2: \u2192 NT32 NT24\n\nWait, no, looking for terminals, here's a list:\n\nNT5: 't2'\n\nNT13: 't39'\n\nNT6: 't48'\n\nNT16: 't33'\n\nNT17: 't33' ('No, looking at the grammar: NT17 \u2192 't33' and 't33' in another rule: NT24 \u2192 't55'? Wait, no. Wait, the grammar lines are very long.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar seems to have a lot of rules that either produce a terminal or another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is t16 t36 ... ending with t99. Since S expands into NT15 and NT43, the string must be a concatenation of two parts, one produced by NT15 and the other by NT43.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t16, then t36, etc. Let's see if"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-856","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which helps because each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. If it were not in Chomsky normal form, I might have to handle different cases, but here, each rule has exactly two non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with 't87' and ends with 't90'. The grammar has several production rules that result in terminals (strings made of letters like 't44') and non-terminals that further expand into other terminals and non-terminals. Each production rule either produces two terminals, like some 't's, or continues to break down further. The challenge is to see if the string can be derived step by step from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, I see that S -> NT15 NT43. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43. Each of these can then be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT15 and NT43 in the production rules:\n\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n- NT43 -> NT27 NT0\n\nWait, for NT15, it's producing NT37 and NT15. That seems recursive. NT15 could lead to more NT37 and NT15 pairs, but eventually, something has to break it down. Let me check NT37.\n\nNT37 has two productions: NT19 NT19 and NT30 NT45. The first one is recursive again because NT37 depends on NT19. The second option is NT30 and NT45.\n\nLet me look at NT43. It produces NT27 and NT0. NT27 is another rule: NT27 -> NT8 NT17. So NT27 can be broken down into NT8 and NT17.\n\nLooking at NT8, it's NT40 -> NT46 NT27 and NT32 -> NT25 NT46. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe string begins with 't87'. The start symbol S can produce NT15 and NT43. Let's look at NT43 because the first step after S is NT43.\n\nNT43 -> NT27 NT0. NT27 is NT27 -> NT8 NT17.\n\nSo from S, we have NT43 -> NT27 NT0. Then NT27 -> NT8 NT17.\n\nNT8 is a production rule: NT8 -> NT46 NT17. NT17 is NT2 NT30.\n\nWait, let's see NT8's expansion. NT8 can be NT46 NT17. Then NT46 is NT10 NT38.\n\nLooking at NT46: NT46 -> NT10 NT38. NT10 is NT50 NT30. Wait, no, NT10 is NT36 NT20.\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up. Let's list out the relevant terminal and non-terminal expansions.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT52 -> 't44'\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n- NT42 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't39'\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n- NT0 -> 't39'\n- NT40 -> 't65'\n- NT46 -> 't72'\n- NT32 -> 't83'\n- NT24 -> 't18'\n- NT24 -> 't55'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't48'\n- NT29 -> 't63'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT9 -> 't28'\n- NT50 -> 't33'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT51 -> 't90'\n- NT48 -> 't87'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT34 -> 't87'\n- NT36 -> 't84'\n- NT21 -> 't99'\n- NT45 -> 't11'\n- NT19 -> 't13'\n- NT37 -> 't12'\n- NT51 -> 't38'\n- NT6 -> 't16'\n- NT17 -> 't33'\n- NT19 -> 't54'\n- NT31 -> 't91'\n- NT23 -> 't7'\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n\nWait, the grammar uses 't' followed by some numbers as terminals. So, for example, NT48 -> 't87' which is a terminal. So, if a non-terminal expands to a terminal, that's fine. If it splits into two non-terminals, then each must generate symbols.\n\nThe string starts with t87 t67 t88 t72 t84 t7 t5 t99 t54 t88 t88 t5 t89 t24 t6 t2 t67 t39 t33 t54 t28 t89 t90 t18 t7 t69 t67 t88 t12 t16 t16 t63 t69 t55 t89 t54 t99 t6 t39 t4 t83 t90 t54 t12.\n\nI think I should try to follow how the string can be broken down through the grammar.\n\nStarting with S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nNT43 can be NT27 NT0. NT27 is NT8 NT17.\n\nNT8 is NT46 NT17. NT46 is NT10 NT38. NT10 is NT36 NT20. NT36 is NT42 NT48. NT42 is 't5', NT48 is 't87'.\n\nWait, NT46 is NT10 NT38. NT10 is NT36 NT20. NT36 is 't5', NT20 is NT30 NT24. Let me see NT30.\n\nNT30 appears twice: once in NT10 (NT30 NT24) and once in NT24 (NT30 NT44). Wait, no: in the list, NT30 has multiple rules: NT30 -> NT32 NT8, NT20 -> NT30 NT24, etc.\n\nSo, let me try to see:\n\nS-> NT15 NT43\n\nNT43 -> NT27 NT0\n\nNT27 -> NT8 NT17\n\nNT8 -> NT46 NT17\n\nNT46 -> NT10 NT38\n\nNT10 -> NT36 NT20\n\nNT36 -> NT42 NT48\n\nNT42 -> 't5'\n\nNT48 -> 't87'\n\nSo, from NT8, we get 't5' and 't87', which are the first two terminals in the string: t5 t87.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first two are t87 t67. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I pick the wrong path?\n\nWait, let's backtrack.\n\nS -> NT15 NT43\n\nNT43 can also be NT24 NT6 (looking at NT43's rules: NT24 is another production. Wait, no: looking back, NT43's rules are NT27 NT0 and another? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, for NT43:\n\nFrom the production rules, NT43 -> NT27 NT0. And that's it. So S -> NT15 NT43 only leads to NT15 and NT27 NT0.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed that NT43 could be another production. Let me check all NT43 rules.\n\nLooking through all production rules:\n\n- Only NT43 -> NT27 NT0. So that's fixed. So after NT43, it's NT27 and NT0.\n\nSo after S, we have NT15 and NT43, which becomes NT15, NT27, NT0.\n\nNow, NT15 -> NT37 NT15.\n\nSo that's NT37, NT15.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Maybe building the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t87. Looking at the productions, t87 comes from NT48 -> 't87', or NT37 -> 't12', or NT34 -> 't87', or NT34 again. Wait, let me look for 't87':\n\n- NT48 -> 't87'\n- NT34 -> 't87'\n- NT15 -> not producing a terminal, just two non-terminals.\n\nSo, to get t87, either NT48 or NT34 produce it.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t87.

So, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a non-terminal followed by a terminal on the left. Each rule has exactly two symbols, either both non-terminals, a symbol and a non-terminal, or a non-terminal and a symbol, but I think in CNF, it usually is just two non-terminals or a non-terminal and terminal?\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, given that, our grammar consists of productions that either produce two non-terminals or a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some rules like S \u2192 NT15 NT15, which is two non-terminals, and others like NT20 \u2192 NT30 NT24, also two non-terminals. But I also see some like NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20, so again, two non-terminals. Hmm, but there's one rule that looks different: NT52 \u2192 't44'. Wait, that's a terminal. So, in CNF, we can have productions that produce a terminal symbol. So, actually, each production can be a terminal followed by a non-terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so actually, each production has exactly two symbols: either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? Or just two non-terminals? Because 'a' is a single symbol. Maybe I confused it a bit, but moving on.\n\nNow, the given string is a series of terminals: t65, t48, t55, etc. I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI think a way to approach this is to construct a parse tree or use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for context-free grammars. But since I'm more comfortable manually checking, I'll try to see if each symbol in the string can be derived starting from S.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t65, I should look for a production rule that leads to t65. Looking through the grammar, I see NT0 produces 't39' and 't65'. So, the rule NT0 \u2192 t65 and something else? Let me check.\n\nLooking again: NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20. Hmm, no, wait, the string starts with t65, so maybe there's a rule where NT0 produces t65. Wait, scanning the list, I see NT28 \u2192 't67', NT10 \u2192 't48', etc. Wait, I'm looking for a production rule where a non-terminal directly produces t65.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46\nNT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43\nNT52 \u2192 't44'\nWait, looking more carefully, at the top:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43\nNT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20\nAt the bottom, I see:\n\nNT45 -> 't11'\nNT19 -> 't13'\n...\nWait, perhaps I need to look for any non-terminal that expands to t65. Looking through the rules, let's see:\n\nAt the end of the given rules, I see:\n\nNT40 -> 't89'\nNT29 -> 't63'\nNT48 -> 't87'\nNT6 -> 't16'\nNT17 -> 't33'\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nHmm, I don't see any non-terminal expanding to t65 directly. Wait, maybe it's produced through a series of steps?\n\nWait, let's look for NT50, which is used in several rules. NT50 is defined as NT41 NT43. And NT43 is defined as NT6 NT1. So, perhaps NT6 is a non-terminal that leads to t65? Or maybe not. Let me check.\n\nLooking for t65, I see in the string the first symbol is t65. Maybe it's derived from a production starting with NT28 \u2192 t67, and NT0 \u2192 t65. Wait, but NT0 is defined as NT30 NT20, so it would produce two non-terminals. The first symbol t65 could be derived from NT0, which would split into NT30 and NT20. Then, perhaps NT30 and NT20 produce other symbols.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for t65 in the grammar. I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly expands to t65. For example, in the given rules, NT0 can produce 't65', but only as part of a larger production like NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20. So, if the string starts with t65, it must come from NT0 expanding to t65 and t20, but that's not possible because NT0 expands to two non-terminals, not one terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nWait, wait, I think I made a mistake. In the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. So, for example, S \u2192 NT15 NT15 is two non-terminals, and NT0 \u2192 't65' is a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, for example, NT0 has multiple rules. One of them is NT0 \u2192 't65', which is a terminal production. So yes, NT0 can directly produce 't65'. Therefore, since the string starts with t65, perhaps that's a single-step production from NT0. But wait, NT0 is defined as NT30 NT20, which is two non-terminals. So wait, that can't be. Because NT0's rule is either combining non-terminals or producing a terminal.\n\nWait, I must have misread the rules. Let me look again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't89'\nNT29 \u2192 't63'\nNT48 \u2192 't87'\nNT6 \u2192 't16'\nNT17 \u2192 't33'\nNT16 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, I'm looking for any rule where a non-terminal directly expands to 't65'. I see NT52 \u2192 't44', so t44 is from NT52. Maybe not t65. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe t65 is produced by multiple rules. Looking through, I think there might be a rule that produces t65, like NT40 \u2192 't65'? No, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me search through all the rules for any that have a terminal like t65.\n\nLooking through, the rule I find is: NT28 \u2192 't67' and other t's. Wait, no, 't65' is at the end of the string. So perhaps in the rules, is 't65' being produced by any non-terminal?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to 't65'. So that's a problem. Because in the string, the first symbol is t65, which must come from some production. If there's no rule where a non-terminal expands directly to t65, then the string cannot be derived from the grammar because the starting symbol S would have to produce symbols that eventually derive to t65, but since there's no initial production that leads to t65 directly, it can't be generated.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT15. So S \u2192 NT15 NT15, meaning the first two symbols in the generated string are from NT15. But the given string starts with t65, which doesn't correspond to NT15.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: the initial symbol S \u2192 NT15 NT15, so the first two symbols must come from NT15. But the string starts with t65, which is a terminal, so if NT15 can expand to t65, that would be possible.\n\nWait, let's look at NT15. In the rules, I see NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's a recursive rule: NT15 expands to NT37 and itself. But that would mean it can't directly produce a terminal, unless during derivation, it somehow expands further to produce NT37, which then expands to another symbol, and so on, potentially reaching a terminal.\n\nWait, but does NT15 ever produce a terminal? Let me check all rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule where NT15 directly expands to a terminal. It's always either combined with another non-terminal or another NT15.\n\nHmm, so perhaps t65 cannot be directly derived from S, unless through some"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-868","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which should make parsing a bit easier. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. Context-free grammars are defined by the productions of a start symbol into other symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. The given grammar has non-terminals like S, NT15, NT50, and so on, eventually leading down to terminals like t44, t6, etc. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nThe string is: `t84 t69 t91 t6 t84 t37 t18 t90 t33 t69 t6 t83 t48 t88 t83 t6 t48 t84 t4 t99 t12 t3 t3 t11 t4 t41 t39 t7 t6 t24 t18 t99 t38 t13 t3 t36 t99 t4 t87 t72 t38 t88 t5 t84 t44`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the provided grammar. Since Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal, I can try to parse the string from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nI'll start by examining the grammar's productions to see which non-terminals produce which terminals. For example, NT27 -> 't50', NT52 -> 't44', etc. Each of these gives a direct way to produce a single terminal symbol when expanded.\n\nOne approach is to try to top-down parsing, starting from S and attempting to derive the string. Alternatively, since the string is relatively long, bottom-up parsing might be more efficient, but I think starting from the top might be better here.\n\nLooking at the initial production: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, S can be derived into two non-terminals, NT15 and NT43. Therefore, the string must start with the terminal symbols produced by NT15 and NT43 in sequence.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts: everything before the first symbol of NT43. Wait, no. Actually, S \u2192 NT15 NT43 means that the string generated by S starts with the production of NT15, followed immediately by the production of NT43. So, the first part of the string should match what NT15 can produce, and the second part should match NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15's production: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. This is recursive. Let me see what NT37 produces. From the grammar, NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38, and NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe some non-terminals can produce terminal symbols directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the first symbol of the string corresponds to what NT15 can produce. The first symbol is t84. Let me look at the productions of NT15. The production NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 is recursive, but perhaps there's a way for NT37 to produce a terminal. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT37: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38. NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10. NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. Hmm, not a terminal yet. Let's follow one path. NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. Then NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. Wait, that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe NT10 can eventually produce a terminal. Let me check:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31. NT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35. NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37. So that's a loop; I'm not getting a terminal here. Hmm, this seems like it's leading down a non-terminal chain without producing a terminal. That might indicate that maybe this grammar can't produce t84 as the first symbol from NT15.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again. Looking for any NT that directly produces t84. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT36 \u2192 NT4 NT50 and NT36 \u2192 NT5 NT30. Also, NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45, and so on. Oh, but looking for t84\u2014looking through the 't's, I see 't84' appears in several production rules like NT24 \u2192 't18', NT24 \u2192 't55', NT43 \u2192 't84', NT44 \u2192 't6', etc.\n\nWait, wait. There's a production NT43 \u2192 't84' when looking at the list. Let me find it: looking through the rules, yes, NT43 appears in a few productions. For example, NT43 \u2192 't84'\u2014specifically, in NT43 \u2192 't84' and also NT43 \u2192 't6'. So, NT43 can produce either 't84' or 't6' directly.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT15 NT43, then the first part comes from NT15, and the second part from NT43. The first symbol in the string is 't84', so let's see if NT43 can produce 't84' directly. Yes, as per NT43 \u2192 't84' is a production rule. So the second part of the string (after NT15's production) should start with 't84'.\n\nSo, let's consider that the first symbol 't84' comes from the second non-terminal NT43. So the overall string must be structured as the expansion of NT15 followed by 't84'.\n\nNow, looking at the next symbol, which is 't69' after 't84'. Wait, no: the string is 't84 t69 t91 t6 ...' So after 't84' comes 't69'. That would imply that the production of NT15 must produce something that starts with 't69'.\n\nWait, no\u2014if S \u2192 NT15 NT43, then the entire string starts with the expansion of NT15 followed by the expansion of NT43. So after the initial 't84' from NT43, the next part should be the rest of the string generated from NT15's expansion. But according to the grammar, after S, it's NT15 followed by NT43, so the string should be the concatenation of NT15's expansion and NT43's expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So let's split the string into two parts: the part generated by NT15 and the part generated by NT43. Since NT43 can produce t84 directly, let's see.\n\nSo the string can be split as [NT15's expansion] [t84 ...], and the entire string should match this.\n\nLet's take the string and remove the initial t84 (from NT43), so the first part should be generated by NT15, which is followed by t84 and the rest. Wait, actually, we need to consider that NT43 produces 't84' as the first symbol, but actually, in the grammar, S is NT15 followed by NT43, so the entire string is NT15's symbols followed directly by NT43's symbols. So, if NT43 produces 't84', then the string should start with the symbols from NT15, followed immediately by 't84' and the rest.\n\nWait, perhaps I should split the string into two parts, with the second part starting with t84. Let me try that. The string is:\n\n1: t84\n2: t69\n3: t91\n4: t6\n5: t84\n6: t37\n7: t18\n8: t90\n9: t33\n10: t69\n11: t6\n12: t83\n13: t48\n14: t88\n15: t83\n16: t6\n17: t48\n18: t84\n19: t4\n20: t99\n21: t12\n22: t3\n23: t3\n24: t11\n25: t4\n26: t41\n27: t39\n28: t7\n29: t6\n30: t24\n31: t18\n3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each of these will produce more symbols.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nBut wait, the string is quite long. Maybe I should check if the string can be broken down into parts that match the rules. Alternatively, parse it using a top-down or bottom-up approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to construct a parse tree starting from S and see if it can derive the string. Each production in the grammar splits into two non-terminals, so each step in the tree doubles the number of symbols.\n\nBut the string has 76 tokens. Since each step doubles the number, maybe the string corresponds to a derivation of a certain length. Let's see: starting from S (1), then after one step, we have two symbols. After two steps, four, and so on. The length of the string is 76, which is 2^6.4, which isn't a power of two. That might not be right, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if all the terminals in the string are covered by the grammar's terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the string, let's list some terminals: t5, t44, t39, t13, etc. The grammar has several terminal productions, such as NT24 -> t5, NT15 -> t39, NT44 -> t6, etc. So these terminals exist in the grammar.\n\nNow, I should see if the sequence can be formed by expanding from S.\n\nEach production splits into two parts, so perhaps I can split the string into pairs that fit the rule definitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me attempt a recursive descent approach.\n\nThe first two symbols should be the first part of a production from NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the grammar rule: S expands into NT15 NT43. So the first part is NT15, and the second is NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t5 and t44.\n\nCheck if t5 can come from NT15: NT15 has a rule NT15 -> NT37 NT15. That's a recursive rule. So NT15 can generate t39 (from NT15 -> t39) via another rule.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t5, it's t44. So the next symbol after t5 (from NT15) would need to be from NT43, but NT43's expansion is NT6 and t1, like looking at the grammar: NT43 -> 't6' NT27, or wait, looking back:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT43 has a rule NT43 -> 't5' and NT6?

{"custom_id":"request-891","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of tokens ending with 't' followed by numbers. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and each non-terminal seems to eventually produce a string of 't's followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the rules that directly produce terminal symbols, which are strings of 't' followed by numbers. So each production leads down to these terminal strings.\n\nThe given string is quite long and consists of a series of 't's and numbers, separated by spaces. The string is: `t54 t13 t12 t44 t65 t12 t37 t63 t4 t83 t88 t54 t89 t41 t44 t55 t83 t6 t5 t90 t24 t89 t65 t99 t41 t5 t2 t91 t6 t44 t16 t11 t3 t99 t3 t89 t84 t41 t33 t63 t54 t91 t84 t31 t3 t48 t88`.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is exactly two non-terminals, so the derivation of the string will involve breaking down each non-terminal into two parts, each eventually leading to terminal symbols.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top-level production: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S is split into two parts: NT15 and NT43. Each of these needs to derive into their respective parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT15 and NT43, from the rules, NT15 is defined as NT37 NT15. Wait, that can't be right\u2014NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15? That would create a cycle, meaning NT15 can't be directly derived into terminals. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That seems problematic because it would lead to infinite recursion. But that can't be right because the grammar is supposed to generate strings, so maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the rules.\n\nWait, let me double-check: The rules for NT15 is written as `NT15 -> NT37 NT15`. That would mean that NT15 can only be replaced by NT37 followed by NT15 again. That would lead to an infinite chain, which can't be resolved. But that can't be correct because otherwise, the grammar couldn't produce any terminal strings. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps the rule is written differently. Wait, in the rules, I see multiple entries for some NT's. For example, NT15 appears twice: once as `NT15 -> NT37 NT15` and again as `NT15 -> NT30 NT20`. Wait, no, looking carefully, the first line is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Then later, under the NT rules, it says NT15 -> NT37 NT15. But earlier, under S, it's S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So perhaps NT15 is defined in two ways? Wait, no, looking again: the rules start with S, then move down. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see after S:\n\nNT50 -> NT1 NT32\n...\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n...\nNT30 -> NT32 NT8\nNT24 -> NT48 NT35\n...\nAnd after that, under NT15 again: `NT15 -> NT30 NT20`.\n\nWait, no, looking carefully, maybe I misread it. Let me check the list again:\n\nThe rules are in a list, each line is a production. So after S \u2192 NT15 NT43, then another line is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Then further down, under NT0, it's `NT0 -> NT30 NT20`. But wait, I'm more confused now. It seems that NT15 has two productions: one is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, and another is NT15 \u2192 NT30 NT20. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps the rules for NT15 are:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n- NT15 \u2192 NT30 NT20\n\nSo that means NT15 has two possible ways to split. But in the case of NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, that seems recursive because it's NT15 on both sides. That can't be right because it would lead to infinite recursion. But then it also has another rule NT15 \u2192 NT30 NT20. So how would that work?\n\nWait, maybe the NT15 production is:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 OR NT15 \u2192 NT30 NT20\n\nSo when building the string, the parser can choose either option, but choosing the first option would lead to an infinite chain. That can't be correct, so perhaps the second production NT15 \u2192 NT30 NT20 is the correct one. But the initial rule for S is S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so when S is processed, it would split into NT15 and NT43.\n\nNow, for NT15, if we use the second production NT15 \u2192 NT30 NT20, then that would imply that NT30 and NT20 should each derive into some terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at NT30: From the rules, NT30 appears in several places. The first NT30 production is `NT30 -> NT32 NT8`, and later there's `NT30 -> NT24 NT44`. So NT30 has two options: either NT32 NT8 or NT24 NT44.\n\nSimilarly, NT20: The production is `NT20 -> NT30 NT24`. So NT20 splits into NT30 and NT24.\n\nBut wait, this seems complicated. Let me try to map this out.\n\nGiven the string starts with 't54', 't13', 't12', etc. So the entire string is a series of 't's and numbers. The question is, does this string correspond to a sequence of productions that ultimately lead to this string.\n\nBut maybe instead of getting lost in the production rules, I can try the opposite approach: try to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the top and breaking it down according to the rules.\n\nThe top-level production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string must be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t54 t13 t12 t44 t65... I wonder if that's the start of NT15 and NT43's productions.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to see if the string can be divided into two parts: the first part generated by NT15, followed by the second part generated by NT43.\n\nWait, but let's see what NT43 \u2192 ? From the rules, NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0, and NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20, and so on. That might be a long chain, but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0, and then NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30, etc. It's getting messy.\n\nMaybe the better approach is to look for each non-terminal and see how it can produce the corresponding part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string corresponds to S's production. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with 't54 t13 t12 t44 t65 t12 t37 t63 t4 t83 t88 t54 t89 t41 t44 t55 t83 t6 t5 t90 t24 t89 t65 t99 t41 t5 t2 t91 t6 t44 t16 t11 t3 t99 t3 t89 t84 t41 t33 t63 t54 t91 t84 t31 t3 t48 t88'.\n\nWait, the length is quite long, but perhaps it's better to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me try to see if 't54' appears somewhere as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see that some of the terminal strings end with certain numbers. For example, NT6 \u2192 't16', NT7 \u2192 't7', etc. So perhaps each number in the string corresponds to the right non-terminal.\n\nBut 't54' isn't directly listed as a terminal in the non-terminals except for in the NT15 production.

I notice that the start symbol is S, and the left-hand side of the first production is S -> NT15 NT43. So, the string must start with the expansions of NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't11 t36 t55 t24 t18 t31 t16...', I should check what NT15 and NT43 produce.\n\nLet's parse the string in terms of NT15 and NT43. The first part is 't11 t36 t55 t24...'. Wait, wait, NT15's production is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So, each NT15 can generate a sequence involving NT37 and itself recursively. But in the string, the first terminal is t11, so it's likely that the NT37 in NT15's production leads to t11.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Now, looking at NT37's productions: I see NT37 -> NT19 NT19, and NT19 -> NT35 NT19, etc. Let me see if NT37 leads to t11.\n\nLooking at the NT37 production: NT37 -> NT19 NT19. Then NT19->NT12 NT38, and NT12->NT21 NT48. Let's see NT21: NT21->NT10 NT10, and NT10->NT50 NT30. So, NT10 produces t50 (t33) and NT30 (which is maybe another part). NT50->NT41 NT43, and NT41->NT7 NT31. NT7 is NT52, and NT52 has multiple productions, including 't67'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t11. Maybe I should think differently. Let me check the entire string for all terminals and see how they break down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should simulate the derivation of the string step by step, ensuring each production leads to the correct terminal. That might be time-consuming, but let's try.\n\nStarting with S, according to the first production: S->NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, the string should be a combination of NT15's expansion and NT43's expansion.\n\nWait, the string starts with t11, which is a terminal. So NT15 must produce t11 at some point. Let's check how NT15 produces terminals.\n\nLooking at NT15's productions: NT15-> NT37 NT15. So, NT15 isn't directly a terminal; it's a non-terminal that expands into other non-terminals. That suggests that perhaps the initial S production might expand into non-terminals that then produce the terminals.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the terminals are being generated directly. So, perhaps each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal string. Therefore, the NT15 and NT43 must expand into sequences of terminals that form part of the string.\n\nLet me list the productions for each non-terminal step by step to see how they generate terminals.\n\nBut considering the time, this might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if all the terminals in the string are covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are multiple: 't11', 't13', 't16', 't17', 't18', 't19', 't2', 't23', 't24', 't25', 't26', 't27', 't28', 't29', 't31', 't32', 't33', 't36', 't37', 't38', 't39', 't41', 't43', 't44', 't45', 't46', 't47', 't48', 't49', 't50', 't51', 't52', 't55', 't6', 't7', 't8', 't9', 't10', etc. So if the string uses any of these terminals, it's possible.\n\nLooking at the string, all the terminals are present in the grammar's list. So, that doesn't rule it out.\n\nBut producing a string of length 73 (counting the t terms) would require the grammar to have a sufficiently complex tree. However, I think it's more error-prone to manually check each production, so perhaps I can look for patterns or see if the string follows the rules.\n\nAnother approach: The string has to be derived from S via the given productions. Maybe I can start from S and see if the string can be broken down into parts compatible with S's production.\n\nS -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, the string must be a concatenation of the expansion of NT15 and NT43.\n\nSimilarly, each of these non-terminals has their own productions.\n\nLet's attempt to split the string into two parts: the first part should come from NT15, and the second from NT43.\n\nLooking at the string: `t11 t36 t55 t24 t18 t31 t16 t16 t88 t2 t38 t67 t31 t7 t99 t33 t99 t88 t67 t48 t33 t99 t38 t69 t88 t2 t16 t11 t63 t48 t48 g44 t6 t11 t7 t3 t48 t48 t31 t38 t88 t63 t91 t36 t69 t2 t55`.\n\nWait, the string has 73 elements. Let's see how it's split. If S produces NT15 and NT43, then the entire string is NT15's expansion followed by NT43's expansion. So, perhaps the first 19 elements are from NT15, and the next 54 from NT43. I don't know; it's arbitrary, but I need to find a split point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think recursively. The start symbol S is S->NT15 NT43. So the string is the concatenation of NT15's derivation and NT43's derivation.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15->NT37 NT15, so it's a recursive production that can generate a sequence of NT37 followed by NT15, which could potentially lead to terminals. Similarly, NT37->NT19 NT19, which also is a recursive production.\n\nWait, this seems quite involved. Another approach is to model the string as nodes in a tree, starting from S and trying to derive the string, but that's too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has 't55' which appears at the beginning of NT15's possible expansion. Looking at the NT15 production: it can generate t55 via NT24->t55. So if NT15 is being derived to include t55, that would fit.\n\nSimilarly, the string starts with t11 t36 t55... So perhaps NT15 is being expanded into t11 followed by t36, etc.\n\nLet me see: NT15->NT37 NT15. So, the first expansion is NT37, followed by NT15.\n\nNT37->NT19 NT19. Then each NT19 can expand into more non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT19: NT19->NT51 NT19. So NT19 is recursive, which might lead to a loop.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Perhaps I should check if all the strings follow the right number of symbols.\n\nWait, another idea: the grammar is in CNF, so every production is of two non-terminals or a single terminal. Since the string only contains terminals, it must have a derivation where all steps are via terminals.\n\nSo, each element"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF requires each production rule to have exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. \n\nLet me parse the grammar. I notice that the start symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT43. Both NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals. So, the string must be split into two parts that can each derive NT15 and NT43 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of symbols separated by spaces. Since the string starts with `t83`, I suspect that this is a terminal symbol derived from one of the non-terminals. Let me check if `t83` can be derived from any of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT32 -> t83. So, for the string to start with `t83`, the derivation must come from NT32. So, the first part of the string, `t83`, is covered by NT32.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the rest of the string after t83. The next symbols are t48, t91, etc. I'll group the string into parts that might correspond to NT15 and NT43.\n\nNT15 is derived from which non-terminals? Looking at the rules, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. That means NT15 can be further broken down into NT37 followed by another NT15. Hmm, but this could get recursive. Alternatively, NT15 can also produce NT37 NT15, so perhaps it's a chain.\n\nWait, let me check where else NT15 appears. I see NT15 -> NT37 NT15, so that's circular. But I don't see NT15 being directly derived from another symbol except through that rule. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should consider other rules that lead into NT15.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT32 -> t83 and NT32 is also connected elsewhere. But in the initial step, S starts with NT15 NT43, so the entire string must split into two parts that derive these two non-terminals.\n\nLet me see the structure: S -> NT15 NT43, so the string should be split into two parts where the first part is derived from NT15 and the second from NT43. So, perhaps I can split the string into two parts at a point where one can derive NT15 and the other NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, after t83, the next symbols are t48, t91, t39, t65, t99, t38, t24, t83, etc. I need to see if this chain can eventually end up with NT15 and then proceed.\n\nAnother thing is that each production in CNF will split the string into a sequence of symbols leading to each non-terminal. So, the entire string is a concatenation of two sequences: one deriving NT15 and the other NT43.\n\nNow, I'll examine the grammar to see if I can find a way that the string can be split accordingly. Let's see if NT15 can produce a sequence leading to the initial part, and NT43 to the latter part.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT43: NT43 -> NT6 NT1, NT41 NT32, etc. I see NT43 can produce NT6 NT1, which leads to t6 and t1. Wait, t6 is a terminal symbol derived from NT44, which could produce 't6' or t other symbols. Wait, looking at NT44: NT44 -> t6, so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT1 could produce 't24'?\n\nWait, let me map this out step by step.\n\nFirst, S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, the string must split into two parts: Part A deriving NT15, Part B deriving NT43.\n\nWe've already used t83 as the first symbol, which is derived from NT32, but that's part of NT15's production. Wait, no\u2014actually, in NT15's production, it can be NT37 NT15, so perhaps NT15 can be broken down further.\n\nLet me see the rules for NT15:\n\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n- No other rules for NT15, except those.\n\nWait, but NT32 is another non-terminal. Let me check if NT32 can be part of NT15.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT32 -> NT25 NT46.\n\nSo, NT32 can't go to t83 directly, but perhaps through NT25 and NT46.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's try to build the string backwards.\n\nStarting from the end, the last few symbols are t18. Looking for where t18 is derived. In NT1, t18 is derived via NT4 -> NT26 NT2, and other paths.\n\nLooking deeper, t18 is part of NT4, which can be derived through NT26 or NT2.\n\nNot sure. This approach might be too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to find if the string can be split into two parts where each part can be generated by NT15 and NT43 respectively.\n\nGiven the string is 43 symbols long, it should split into two parts where one can generate 21 symbols and the other 22 or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part is NT15 and the second is NT43.\n\nWait, let's check if t83 can be part of NT15. For that, NT15 can produce NT37 and itself. So, perhaps NT15 can start with NT37 and then build up.\n\nLet me see if the string starts with NT37:\n\nNT37 can produce NT19 NT19 or NT37 NT37.\n\nSo, t83 is from NT32, but that's part of NT15's derivation. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to look for known sequences in the grammar that can generate the string.\n\nLooking for 't33' in the string, which comes up a few times. Let's see where t33 is derived. Looking at the rules, I see NT17 -> NT2 NT30, NT23 -> NT7 NT26, etc. Hmm, perhaps a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string represents a path through the grammar, starting from S.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I should use a method where I try to match the string to the grammar step by step, but that might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for patterns in the string that correspond to the productions.\n\nWait, let's consider the initial steps:\n\nS: NT15 NT43.\n\nNT15's production: NT37 NT15.\n\nSo, the first part of the string after t83 (which is from NT32) would need to derive NT37 and NT15. But I'm stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let's try to parse the string as a sequence of symbols.\n\nThe string starts with t83. Let's see where t83 comes from. The only rule that produces t83 is NT32 -> t83. So t83 must come from NT32.\n\nBut S starts with NT15 and NT43, so how does t83 fit into that?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the entire string isn't directly mapped as a single derivation. Alternatively, maybe the string is built by multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a combination of several derivations, but that's getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, I might check if the string can be divided into two parts that each correspond to NT15 and NT43.\n\nBut given the string starts with t83, which comes from NT32, I think it's part of NT15's production because NT15 is the first part after S.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see how NT15 can be derived.\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15.\n\nSo, to derive something from NT15, you start with NT37 and then add more NT15.

Each production on the left side is broken into two non-terminals on the right, except for those ending with 't' which are terminals.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t69, t90, t7, t55, t36, t54, t28, t48, t7, t88, t65, t12, t5, t67, t18, t84, t24, t12, t89, t89, t91, t84, t3, t28, t33, t67, t4, t91, t83, t41, t11, t18, t55, t2, t37, t6, t48, t28, t44, t38, t65, t24, t72.\n\nTo determine if this string is in the language, I should try to parse it using the grammar. Parsing manually can be tricky, but I'll go step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the entire string must be generated starting with NT15 and NT43.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts that might correspond to each of these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n- NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n\nSo, each of these non-terminals produces a pair of non-terminals. Let's see how the string starts.\n\nThe string starts with t69, t90, t7, t55, t36, t54, t28, t48, t7, t88, t65, t12, t5, t67, t18, t84, t24, t12, t89, t89, t91, t84, t3, t28, t33, t67, t4, t91, t83, t41, t11, t18, t55, t2, t37, t6, t48, t28, t44, t38, t65, t24, t72.\n\nBut perhaps that's too long. I should consider each production step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string must be a concatenation of two parts: one generated by NT15 and another by NT43.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols, after t69, but wait, NT15 and NT43 each produce a tree, so perhaps I should consider their structures.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string into the structure defined by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each step in the grammar leads to the correct terminals in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, I can simulate the derivation starting from S.\n\nLet me try to track the current string through each possible production.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string starts with everything generated by NT15 followed by everything generated by NT43.\n\nSo, the string is: t69 t90 t7 t55 t36 t54 t28 t48 t7 t88 t65 t12 t5 t67 t18 t84 t24 t12 t89 t89 t91 t84 t3 t28 t33 t67 t4 t91 t83 t41 t11 t18 t55 t2 t37 t6 t48 t28 t44 t38 t65 t24 t72.\n\nI need to find if this string can be split into two parts: one that starts with NT15's derivation and another that starts with NT43's.\n\nAlternatively, I can think recursively: each NT is built from smaller non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to see what NT15 and NT43 produce.\n\nLooking at NT15: According to the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So it's a recursive structure where each NT15 is made of NT37 followed by NT15.\n\nThis suggests that NT15 is a chain of NT37s. Let's see what NT37 does.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So each NT37 is NT19 followed by NT19.\n\nAnd NT19 \u2192 NT13 NT19, meaning each NT19 splits into NT13 and another NT19.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT21 NT48. So each NT13 is NT21 followed by NT48.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT38 NT31. So NT21 is NT38 followed by NT31.\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29. So NT38 is NT51 followed by NT29.\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20. Hmm, this could get complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at where the 't' terminals appear can guide us.\n\nLet's check the first few terminals: t69, t90, t7, t55, etc.\n\nLooking at NT15's definition, we can see that NT15 breaks down into NT37 and NT15. So if we can find a segment starting with t's that correspond to NT15's production, that would be a sign.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. Let's see what NT6 and NT1 produce.\n\nLooking at NT6: It's a little unclear from the initial grammar, but looking further, NT6 \u2192 t7 (wait, no, in the grammar, wait NT6 is defined as NT50 NT30 previously? Wait, I think I might have to check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I have:\n\n- NT6: Let me check. Hmm, looking through the grammar, I notice:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNo direct rule for NT6. Maybe it's derived from other rules. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar has rules like NT6 \u2192 something? Or perhaps it's inferred from other rules.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct. The grammar as given doesn't explicitly define NT6. Wait, I think I might have misread. Let me go through all the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT28 is defined as NT26 NT23, NT23 as NT5 NT26, NT5 as NT28 NT7, which seems recursive.\n\nWait, maybe some non-terminals are cycles. But perhaps that's getting too detailed.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to model the string as a series of steps and see if I can parse it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree step by step.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT15 NT43, the entire string must be NT15 NT43. So the string should be NT15's production followed by NT43's production.\n\nSo, the first part of the string should correspond to NT15's parse, and the second part to NT43's.\n\nLooking at NT15: It's a chain of NT37s, as it says NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So each time, it's NT37 followed by NT15. Since NT37 splits into NT19 NT19, this could lead to multiple NT19s deeper down.\n\nBut perhaps getting into too much recursion is complicating things. Maybe looking for specific 't' terminals can help. For example, looking for 't8' because often in grammars, 't' terminals are used for specific patterns.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT5 \u2192 't7', NT2 \u2192 't41', NT4 \u2192 't48', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for terminals like 't8' is common, as in NT4: NT4 \u2192 NT26 NT2, and so on, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first steps are too time-consuming without a clear path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to see if the string can be split into two main parts: one for NT15 and one for NT43.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so first part is NT15, then NT43.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t69 t90 t7 t55 t36...\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19.\n\nAnd NT19 \u2192 NT13 NT19"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-922","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on CNF, but I remember that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except when a terminal is the right-hand side. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, I see some rules have the same non-term on both sides, like NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4, and there are terminals appearing on the right, like 't44'. So maybe this grammar is not in CNF as I thought, or perhaps it allows for more general productions? I'm a bit confused here.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem states that the grammar is in CNF, so perhaps I should stick to that. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of a set of non-terminals and production rules. The terminals are the symbols with 't' and the rest are non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals.\n\nI remember that for a string to be generated by a grammar in CNF, its length should match the structure of the derivation. Since each production in CNF either produces one terminal or a pair of non-terminals, the derivation tree would be a binary tree where each non-terminal node has either one terminal child (if it's a single terminal) or two non-terminal children (if it's a combination). So, the length of the string should be one more than a power of two if generated by a CNF grammar, but I'm not sure if that applies here since this grammar might have rules that produce two terminals, which can change the structure.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, so each step can produce a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the length of the string is determined by how many times non-terminals are expanded into two non-terminals versus terminals.\n\nLet me think about the example string: it's a sequence of many 't's and 't's with some numbers attached, like 't37 t18 t7 ...'. So the string length here is 43 characters. Hmm, that's a bit odd for a CNF grammar, but let's not rule it out yet.\n\nNow, to check if the string can be generated, maybe I can model this as a parsing problem. I'll attempt to parse the string from the start symbol, which seems to be S. The given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so S is composed of two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15's production: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Oh, so it's a recursive rule. That means I need to somehow reduce NT15 multiple times. Wait, NT15 appears on both sides; that suggests a left-recursive rule, which typically isn't handled well in top-down parsers without some kind of transformation, like converting it into a right-recursive form. So, perhaps I need to rewrite NT15 into a non-right-recursive form.\n\nLet me try to rewrite NT15. The original rule is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. To eliminate left recursion, I can rewrite this as NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15', where NT15' \u2192 NT15 | \u03b5. Alternatively, I can express NT15 as NT37 followed by NT15, which would make the derivation process more involved.\n\nBut maybe instead of getting into the rewriting, I should look for the possible ways the string could be split from the top-level production. The string starts with 't37', which is a terminal. Looking at the productions, some non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT12 \u2192 't16', NT14 \u2192 't52', NT15 \u2192 produces other non-terminals, NT16 \u2192 't3', NT17 \u2192 't2', NT18 \u2192 't8', and so on. It seems that many non-terminals have productions that result in either a terminal or more combinations.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the start symbol S and see how it can produce the string. S is NT15 NT43, so the string should start with the result of NT15's derivation followed by NT43's derivation.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't37', which I suspect comes from NT15 because NT15's production is NT37 NT15, and perhaps upon expansion, the NT37 might produce 't39' or similar. Let me check NT37: looking at the grammar, NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 or NT37 \u2192 NT12 NT35, etc. So perhaps NT37 would eventually expand into a terminal.\n\nBut without getting too bogged down, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down according to the production rules step by step. Alternatively, maybe a recursive descent parser approach would work.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT15 NT43. So the string should be the combination of two parts: the first part is generated by NT15, and the second by NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are 't37 t18 t7 ...'. Let me assume that 't37' is the first terminal, so that would come from expanding NT15. Now, NT15's production is NT37 NT15. So I need to find a way to get 't37' as the first terminal. Let me look at NT15's rules again.\n\nWait, NT15 can produce NT37 or... Hmm, no, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (recursive production). So perhaps the first step is to have NT15 produce NT37 followed by NT15, meaning that the first part of the string would be 't37' followed by another NT15-derived string. But NT15's production seems to require another NT15, leading to more expansion.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should count the number of non-terminals and terminals in the string to see if it fits the possible structures.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't37', which we can consider as the first terminal. Then, to produce another NT15, but NT15's production is recursive, so any expansion under NT15 would produce more NT15's, which would imply a loop. But since the string is finite, perhaps the recursion resolves somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into two parts: one generated by NT15 and one by NT43. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach is to note that S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so the entire string should be the concatenation of the derivations of NT15 and NT43. Therefore, the string must be split into two parts: the first part generated by NT15 and the second by NT43.\n\nLet me try to identify where the split might occur. Looking at the string, perhaps between 't18 t7 t36' and 't38...' But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the NT15's production: It produces NT37 followed by NT15. So each NT15 must produce at least NT37. Let's see where 't37' appears in the string. The first token is 't37', so that would fit if NT15 \u2192 't37' plus more. But wait, NT37 can produce 't36' via NT37 \u2192 NT36 NT35? Or maybe there's a direct production where NT37 produces a terminal. Looking back, no, from the grammar, NT37's productions are to other NT's or combos. So perhaps NT37 must eventually produce 't36' or 't38' or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look into what each NT eventually produces as a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT9: it can produce 't2' via NT9 \u2192 't2'. NT50 \u2192 't33'. NT12 \u2192 't16'. NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which, as we saw, might produce a terminal later. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 't1'? Wait, checking NT43, the production is NT27 NT0. Then, NT27 \u2192 't23' because in the grammar, NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17 initially, but later rewritten, NT27 \u2192 't23' (from NT27 \u2192 't23'). Similarly, NT0 \u2192 't39'. So NT43 \u2192 't23' followed by 't39'.\n\nSo the second part of the string, which would come from NT43, starts with 't23 t24 t6 ...'. Hmm, 't23' is the first token of that part? No, the string after the first part starts with 't37 t18 t7 ..."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-928","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces, looking like `t2 t33 t37 ...` up to a bunch of tokens and then ending with `t38`. My job is to figure out if this string can be derived from the given grammar, and if so, output 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'. \n\nFirst off, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the application of the parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm. But since the string is given, I might need to look at it step by step, maybe using a top-down or bottom-up approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it includes a bunch of non-terminals: S, NT1 to NT52, and some terminals like 't' followed by numbers. Each production in the grammar either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to generate the string, the starting symbol S must expand, and each step must produce the correct terminals in sequence.\n\nStarting with S, the initial production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. That means the first step is to expand S into NT15 and NT43. So, the string starts with whatever NT15 can derive followed by whatever NT43 can derive.\n\nLooking at NT15 and NT43 in the grammar:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 | NT30 NT20. Hmm, so NT15 can produce further non-terminals or a terminal. Let's think about the first part, NT15. But in the string we're given, the first token is 't2', which is a terminal. So, maybe NT15 must produce a terminal here.\n\nWait, no. NT15 has productions. Let me see the productions for NT15 in the grammar: yeah, it's NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 or NT30 NT20. There's no NT15 \u2192 't...', so how can NT15 produce a terminal? That might be a problem because if the string starts with a terminal, then NT15 must be producing that terminal, but looking at NT15's productions, none seem to produce a terminal directly.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread. Let me check NT15's productions again. Oh, wait, in the grammar, the productions might have been listed, but sometimes the lines could be split. Looking back: Yes, in the productions given, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 or NT30 NT20, but earlier in the grammar, I see that NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 or NT30 NT20. Hmm, but there's no production where NT15 directly produces a terminal. So, perhaps NT15 can only produce non-terminals, which would mean that the first token 't2' can't come from NT15.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because the string starts with 't2', and S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so both NT15 and NT43 would have to produce sequences that start with 't2'. But if NT15 can't produce a terminal, how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've missed something in the grammar. Let me check again. In the list provided, I see that NT15 has two productions: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 and NT30 NT20. Wait, but what about other NT15 productions? Or is there a possibility that NT15 is also producing terminals?\n\nLooking back, the grammar seems to have many NT productions, but most of them are two non-terminals. So, perhaps NT15 is only expanding further non-terminals. Therefore, the initial step from S would expand into non-terminals, but the given string starts with a terminal 't2', which would mean that either S should produce this directly, which it doesn't, or one of the non-terminals produces 't2'. So, perhaps I need to see if the non-terminals can eventually derive 't2'.\n\nBut let's check the grammar for non-terminals that can produce 't2'. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT5 has a production NT5 \u2192 't2', which is a terminal. Similarly, other non-terminals have terminal productions like NT29 \u2192 't28', NT5 \u2192 't7', etc.\n\nSo, NT5 can produce 't2'. Therefore, if somewhere in the derivation, a non-terminal can produce NT5, which in turn can produce 't2', that's possible.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the derivation, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, then NT15 must expand into some sequence that starts with NT5, which would then derive 't2', and similarly, NT43 must derive the rest of the string.\n\nBut then, let's think about NT15. Since NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 or NT30 NT20, both of which are combinations of non-terminals, the NT15 can only produce a sequence of non-terminals. So, how can it produce something that starts with a terminal?\n\nWait, maybe the derivation after S involves multiple steps where NT15 might eventually expand into a terminal through a series of productions. Alternatively, perhaps other NTs can produce 't2' through their own paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider bottom-up parsing, starting from the given string and trying to reduce it back to S.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with 't2', then 't33', 't37', etc. So, the first token is 't2'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't2'. From the grammar, NT5 produces 't2', so maybe 't2' comes from NT5.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps in the first step, NT15 should produce something that eventually leads to NT5, which then produces 't2', or maybe another path. Similarly, the second part after 't2' is 't33', which could come from NT20 or other NTs.\n\nLet me outline the string: `t2 t33 t37 t91 t5 t16 t7 t33 t87 t39 t55 t63 t84 t91 t36 t33 t48 t41 t5 t41 t72 t67 t33 t5 t38 t13 t38 t99 t84 t72 t33 t12 t87 t72 t69 t89 t12 t91 t24 t84 t33 t99 t91 t38 t89 t33 t72 t90 t18`.\n\nFirst token is 't2' which is NT5 \u2192 t2.\n\nSo, perhaps in the derivation, one of the non-terminals after expansion produces NT5, and from there, 't2' is produced.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nStart:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nSo, we have NT15 and NT43. We need both to produce the string. Let's process NT15 first.\n\nNT15's productions are:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 or NT30 NT20\n\nNeither of these produce a terminal, so NT15 must expand into NT37 NT15.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first part is 't2', which is NT5 \u2192 't2'. So, perhaps NT15 eventually derives something that includes NT5. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps NT15 can be rewritten multiple times. Let's think recursively:\n\nNT15 can only produce NT37 NT15 or NT30 NT20. So, to get a terminal like 't2', it must eventually reach a production that terminates with a terminal. But looking at NT15's expansion, it only goes into NT37 or NT30, which may lead to other NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to track how each non-terminal can derive certain terminal sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write out the possible productions that each non-terminal can generate in the given grammar.\n\nLet me make a list of terminals that non-terminals can derive:\n\nLooking at the grammar, here are the terminals each NT can produce:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t2\nNT29 \u2192 t28\nNT4 \u2192 t48\nNT7 \u2192 t35\nNT12 \u2192 t16\nNT21 \u2192 t13\nNT22 (wait, there is no NT22; maybe I'm thinking of NT24 which is 't5' or 't18')\nWait, checking the productions:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't13' (since NT21"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-943","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. CNF means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, most of the rules are of the form XYZ (except some like NT24 has two rules, including one that expands to a terminal). However, there are a few rules like NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT48 and NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT44, which have two non-terminals each, which is in line with CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' seems to be followed by a specific number, like 't44', which is a terminal that probably represents a terminal symbol in the grammar, but in the given string, it's part of the string, so I need to see if those can be mapped to something in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand into terminals, like NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, but other rules have terminals like 't44'. Wait, some of the rules like NT24 have two options: one is two NTs and the other is a terminal 't5'. But in the string, I see 't44', 't48', 't12', etc. So maybe those 't' strings are part of the generated language. But I'm not sure how that fits into the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the grammar does have NT24 \u2192 't5' and NT44 \u2192 't6', etc. Each rule that ends with a terminal is an atomic production. So the string is a series of these terminals; the question is whether this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. To parse the string, I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe string is: t67 t48 t12 t24 t28 t91 t39 t84 t41 t18 t36 t24 t4 t28 t5 t2 t69 t31 t5 t99 t5 t89 t88 t41 t65 t37 t6 t36 t2 t41 t87 t90 t11 t69 t28 t36 t24 t72 t33 t3 t90 t65 t31 t5 t39 t63 t87 t6 t63 t16.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. The first thing S expands into is NT15 NT15 NT43. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar is S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43, and other rules, but no, wait, in the initial definition, it's written as S \u2192 NT15 NT1 NT15. Wait, let me check: Grammar: S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43? Or is it a typo? Wait, the initial lines say:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT15 NT15 NT43\nNT50 -> NT1 NT32\n... and so on.\n\nWait, no, in the initial lines, it's written as \"S -> NT15 NT15 NT43\". So S expands into two NT15s and a NT43. So the first step is S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43. Then, each of these NTs can expand.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t67 t48 t12 t24 t28 t91... and it seems quite long. Let's see if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the grammar productions.\n\nI think the first step is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. This is essentially a phrase structure tree where each node is an NT, and each leaf is a terminal from the grammar. But the given string is quite long, so I need to see if the grammar can derive this.\n\nOne approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step only expands one non-terminal, replacing it with two non-terminals. So, the derivation is sequential.\n\nLet me see the string: it's a sequence of terminals, each starting with 't' and followed by a number.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals expand into 't' followed by numbers, like NT24 can expand into 't5'. Similarly, NT28 \u2192 't67', NT48 \u2192 't87', etc.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar and see which non-terminals expand into which terminals:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15: so NT15 isn't a terminal, it's an NT.\n- NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT48 and another production: NT24 \u2192 't5' (since in the grammar, looking at the lines, I see NT24 \u2192 NT2 NB4 and NT24 \u2192 't5').\nWait, let me parse this correctly. The grammar lists for each non-terminal the rules that expand it. So looking at NT24: it has two rules: NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT48, and another rule NT24 \u2192 't5'. So NT24 can expand into either a combination of two non-terminals or the terminal 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 \u2192 't67' is a terminal. NT48 \u2192 't87' is another terminal.\n\nWait, the given grammar has a rule NT28 \u2192 't67', so that's a direct expansion to 't67'. Similarly, NT48 \u2192 't87', etc.\n\nSo, in the string, each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a terminal that can be directly derived from some NT.\n\nSo, for example, the first part of the string is t67: that suggests that somewhere in the derivation, an NT expands into 't67'. Looking at the grammar, NT28 is the one that expands into 't67': NT28 \u2192 't67'.\n\nSimilarly, 't48' is derived from NT48: NT48 \u2192 't87'\u2014Wait, no: looking at the grammar, I see NT48 \u2192 't87'. So 't48' isn't directly a terminal. Wait, no, wait, in the grammar, do any NTs expand into 't48'? Let me check all the lines:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines, I don't see any NTs that directly expand into 't48'. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's see all the terminal productions (rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal):\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't5'\n- NT28 \u2192 't67'\n- NT48 \u2192 't87'\n- NT15 \u2192 (no terminal)\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT12 \u2192 't16'\n- NT13 \u2192 't69'\n- NT21 \u2192 't13'\n- NT26 \u2192 't12'\n- NT24 \u2192 't5'\n- NT17 \u2192 't33'\n- NT6 \u2192 same as NT6\nWait, some lines have rules like 'NT52 \u2192 't44'' which expands into 't44'.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see 't48', which is a terminal. Does any non-terminal expand into 't48'? Looking through the grammar, I see that NT4 expands into 't48'. So somewhere, an NT must expand into 't48' which is the production NT4 \u2192 't48'.\n\nBut in the given grammar, looking at the lines, the rule for NT4 is: NT4 \u2192 NT26 NT2. So if NT4 is expanded, it's into two non-terminals, but to get 't48', we might need to have another expansion. Wait, no: no, I think I misread.

The start symbol is S, and the goal is to see if S can derive this string through a series of expansions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that NT52 is a non-terminal that can produce 't44'. That seems important because 't44' isn't on the right-hand side of any other non-terminals, so it must be a terminal. Similarly, other productions like NT9 -> NT52 NT4 lead to 't28' and 't4', which are terminals. \n\nThe string has several 't44's and other terminals. Since 't44' comes from NT52 -> 't44', so wherever 't44' appears, it's the terminal symbol for NT52. \n\nNow, looking at the production S -> NT15 NT43. NT15 produces NT37 and NT15 again (NT15 -> NT37 NT15) or just another terminal. Similarly, NT43 can produce 't5' or 't99'.\n\nLet me try to trace how the string could be generated. The first word is t54. Let's look at the grammar to see if any non-terminals produce t54. Scanning the productions, I don't see any non-term producing t54 directly. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, NT21 produces 't99', which is one of the terminals. So the string starts with t54, which I don't see as a direct terminal in any production. Hmm, that might be a problem. Did I miss a production for NT48?\n\nWait, looking at NT48, one of its productions is NT48 -> NT44 NT21, which then gives 't44' and 't99'. So t44 would come from NT52, as I said before, and t99 is a terminal.\n\nBut the string starts with t54, which isn't directly produced by any non-terminal. That means this string can't be generated by the grammar because S starts with NT15 and NT43, which produce t5 (from NT43: NT43 -> 't5') and NT15, which then can produce t5 as well (since NT15 can sometimes produce itself, but if not, let's see). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. NT15 can produce either NT37 NT15 or a terminal. But looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce t54? I don't see that. Hmm, that's a problem. So S would start with NT15, which might produce something that gives t54, but from the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal producing t54. So the string starts with t54, but in the grammar, there's no way to produce t54 directly from any non-terminal. That would mean the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the production rules. Scanning through all the non-terminals, I don't see any production that ends with t54, except maybe through multiple steps. Or maybe a combination that results in t54 at some point. But since t54 isn't listed as a terminal, it must have a production. Looking through all the top-level productions, I don't see NT52 as 't54' anywhere. NT52 is 't44'.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t54, which isn't a terminal in the grammar, meaning it can't be produced by any rule. Thus, the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with \"t54\", which is not a terminal in the provided grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-41","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, and the string to evaluate is `t54 t18 t6 t16 t24`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. This structure simplifies the process of parsing and makes it deterministic, often leading to parsers like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that it consists of a series of production rules.

For example, S -> NT15 NT43, and NT15 -> NT37 NT15, and so on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t54 t18 t6 t16 t24`. These are terminal symbols. My task is to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the string and try to split it into two parts according to the grammar rules, working backward. Each step should involve replacing a terminal symbol with a production that eventually leads back to the start symbol. \n\nLet me break down the string into the sequence of terminals:\nt54, t18, t6, t16, t24.\n\nI'll start by looking for the longest possible match in the grammar, moving backward. Let's see which production rules can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some terminals like t54 appear in multiple rules. For example, NT19 -> NT12 NT38, and NT45 -> NT11 NT11, etc. Wait, actually, looking at the provided rules, some terminals are directly 't' followed by numbers. So some non-terminals are defined as producing specific terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example:\nNT44 -> t6\nNT42 -> t5\nNT13 -> t39\nNT28 -> t67\nNT0 -> t39\nNT40 -> t65\nNT46 -> t72\nNT32 -> t83\nNT24 -> t18\nNT24 -> t55\nNT5 -> t2\nNT4 -> t48\nNT9 -> t28\nNT50 -> t33\nNT12 -> t16\nNT51 -> t90\nNT48 -> t87\nNT1 -> t24\nNT34 -> t87\nNT36 -> t84\nNT21 -> t99\nNT45 -> t11\nNT19 -> t13\nNT37 -> t12\nNT51 -> t31\nNT45 -> t67\nNT36 -> t41\nNT26 -> t12\nNT5 -> t7\nNT13 -> t69\nNT21 -> t13\nNT40 -> t89\nNT28 -> t4\nNT29 -> t36\nNT1 -> t37\nNT51 -> t38\nNT6 -> t16\nNT17 -> t33\nNT19 -> t54\nNT31 -> t91\nNT23 -> t7\nNT16 -> t3\n\nHmm, looking at the string, the first term is t54. In the grammar, NT19 -> t54. So perhaps the first production corresponds to NT19 producing t54. Similarly, let's see the other terms.\n\nWait, let me list the production rules for the terminals:\n\n- NT51 -> t90\n- NT9 -> t28\n- NT46 -> t72\n- NT32 -> t83\n- NT24 -> t18\n- NT55 -> t55? Wait, looking back at the grammar, NT24 has two productions: NT24 -> NT48 NT2 or NT24 -> t55. Wait, but in the string, we have t54, which is generated by NT19.\n\nWait, let me check each part:\n\nThe string is t54 t18 t6 t16 t24.\n\nLooking for each terminal production:\n\nt54 is produced by NT19, which has a production NT19 -> t54. So the first step could be replacing t54 with NT19.\n\nBut wait, NT19 can have other productions as well. In the grammar, NT19 -> NT12 NT38. So maybe it can also be split into that, but in this case, t54 is directly from NT19 -> t54, so we can take that as the first part.\n\nNext, after t54, the next part is t18, which is produced by NT24 -> t18. Also, looking at the grammar, NT24 has two productions: one that splits into NT48 and NT2, and another that produces t18. So t18 is NT24 -> t18.\n\nWait, but to derive the string, I might need to split the string into two parts at each step. Let me try to process the string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a tree. Starting from S, and trying to split the string into the components defined by S's production, which is S -> NT15 NT43. So the entire string must be split into two parts, each of which can be derived from NT15 and NT43, respectively.\n\nSo let's check the string: `t54 t18 t6 t16 t24` has 5 tokens. Wait, but each production splits into two parts, so the string must have an even number of tokens. But 5 is odd, which might immediately indicate it's invalid. Wait, that's a good point. Let me check: the string has 5 terminals. But each step in the derivation should split into two parts, which would mean that the total number of tokens should be 2^n, where n is the number of splits. So 5 is not a power of two, so that suggests that the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm not considering that after each split, each part is further split until you reach the terminals. So, for example, the string could potentially be split into two parts, each of which is itself split again until all are terminals. But in this case, 5 tokens would make it impossible because each split doubles the number of parts. So if we start with one part (5 tokens), then after first split, we have two parts, each with 2-3 tokens, but 2^2=4 isn't the same as 5. So maybe it's impossible. Therefore, the string is invalid because 5 isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, but wait: the number of production steps corresponds to the number of splits. Let me see: the initial string has 5 tokens. If we have a leftmost derivation, each step replaces a non-terminal with two parts, increasing the number of symbols by one each time. So starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, after first expansion, two non-terminals. After each step, the number of symbols increases by one each time until we reach the leaves, which are all terminals. So the total number of tokens should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of productions used. Wait, but that might not necessarily be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the length is determined by the number of splits, leading to even or odd numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to realize that in Chomsky normal form, each production either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal. So, starting from S, the first step would produce two non-terminals. To reach the terminals, we'd need to split each non-terminal into terminals until all are terminals. So, the number of terminals produced would be equal to 2^k, where k is the number of splits. Because each split after k steps would result in 2^k terminals. So, if the original string is 5 terminals, which is not a power of two, it can't be derived from S, because S's production leads to 2^k terminals.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the string, it consists of six tokens all separated by spaces. The tokens are t54, t88, t6, t6, t16, and t37. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side.\n\nI remember that in CNF, the language can be generated by a pushdown automaton, and the string's structure (like its length) gives some clues about the derivation steps.\n\nThe input string has six tokens. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, starting with the start symbol S, which has two non-terminals. Each replacement increases the count by one. For a string of length n, the number of productions needed from S is n-1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in CNF, the number of symbols (including terminals) in a derivation starts at 1 for S. Each production increases the length by one. So if the string has k symbols, the derivation from S takes k-1 steps. So a six-symbol string would require five steps from S.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial S is one symbol. Each production (since each rule in CNF is A \u2192 BC) replaces one symbol with two. So each step doubles the number of symbols, but in terms of the number of steps, for building up to a string of n symbols, the number of steps needed is n-1. Because each step adds a symbol until you have the desired number.\n\nSo for six symbols, it's five steps. But wait, no\u2014each step takes a symbol and replaces it with two, so the total number of symbols increases by one each time. So starting from 1, after one step, you have 2; after two steps, 3; up to five steps: 6 symbols. So yes, six symbols require five steps.\n\nBut looking at the given string, it's six symbols, so the derivation should require five steps.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check the possible structures and whether these tokens can appear in the right places.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the possible ways the tokens could come from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the tokens:\n\nt54, t88, t6, t6, t16, t37.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nFor example, NT27 is 't7', so if NT27 appears as a part of a production, it would produce 't7'.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I see that many non-terminals are terminals, like NT24 \u2192 't5'. So each non-terminal might derive into another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nTo see if the string is in the language, each token must correspond to a derived terminal symbol starting from S.\n\nI think it's easier to work backwards from the string and see if it can be split according to the grammar rules.\n\nGiven the tokens: t54, t88, t6, t6, t16, t37.\n\nLet me see if these can be combined in some way that follows the grammar.\n\nLooking at the possible leftmost or rightmost derivations, but since the grammar is in CNF, the structure is a binary tree with height 5 for six symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can construct the parse tree by trying to match the string to the grammar.\n\nLet me start with the string as a single unit and split it into two parts according to the grammar rules. So, for example, the first token could be from a left part of a rule.\n\nPerhaps I can try to split the string into two parts and see if any rule leads into the two parts.\n\nFor instance, the first symbol is 't54'. I need to see if any rule's right-hand side can produce 't54' as one part and the rest as another.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't54' is not a terminal directly; looking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals can produce 't54'.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe grammar ends in some cases with terminals, such as NT23 \u2192 't5'.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, let me note which non-terminals produce some 't's:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't91'\n\nNT32 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't84'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, I'm not seeing 't54' directly from any production. Hmm. Let me check all the rules again. Oh, maybe I missed some.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules again:\n\nWait, NT27 is produced as 't7', NT47 is 't16', NT24 is 't5', NT36 is 't28', NT26 is 't12', etc.\n\nWait, is there any production that leads to 't54'? Let me scan again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT19 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT51 \u2192 't90'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't26'\n\nWait, I'm not seeing 't54' as a terminal; perhaps it's not a terminal. Wait, the top-level rule S uses NT15 and NT43, and then those non-terminals may further split.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is \"t54 t88 t6 t6 t16 t37\", and each of these needs to be matched by a right-hand side of some production rule.\n\nWait, but if the string is being built from the bottom up, each token could correspond to a non-terminal that can produce that token when expanded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's built from the top down, so each part splits into two, and each part is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but I think perhaps the approach is to attempt a top-down parsing.\n\nBut perhaps the quickest way is to see for the entire string, can the parser split it into two parts such that each part can be produced by a production rule.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe entire string: t54 t88 t6 t6 t16 t37.\n\nFirst, I can check if the entire string is produced by any rule.\n\nWait, looking for S's production: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So that would split the string into two parts: the first part is the left NT15 and the second is NT43.\n\nSo let's split the string into [t54, t88, t6, t6, t16] and [t37].\n\nWait, but that would require NT15 \u2192 t54... and NT43 \u2192 t37..., but is that possible?\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That would mean it can produce a series of t37s. So can NT15 produce t54? No, because NT37 produces 't12', not 't54'. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the split is somewhere else.\n\nAnother option: the entire string could be matched by a single production rule. But looking, no rule seems to fit that length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built from another split.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial split is [t54, t88] and [t6, t6, t16, t37], but I don't know what NT51 produces.\n\nWait, maybe I should try possible splits.\n\nAnother approach: the first three symbols t54 t88 t6: perhaps they form a non-terminal NT that expands into them. So for example, a production like NT \u2192 A B where A is t54 and B is the rest.\n\nBut this might take time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for possible expansions. For instance, the last token is t37, which is NT37 \u2192 t12. Wait, t12 is the token, but the last token is t37. That's confusing because 't37' would be a terminal, but in the grammar, NT37 generates 't12' and another NT37.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: each token in the sentence is the result of expanding a non-terminal into a terminal string. So for example, if NT37 \u2192 t12 and another NT37 \u2192 t12, but perhaps I can have a production that ends in t37, but in the given grammar, NT37 produces either t12 or more NTs.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think each non-terminal in the grammar is either a terminal or produces other non-terminals. So, for example, NT37 \u2192 t12 | NT37 NT45. But that's not matching the string, because t37 is a terminal, but NT37 can only produce t12 or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Hmm, where do I start? \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar structure. It's in CNF, which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That might help in parsing or generating strings. The start symbol is S, and every production eventually leads to terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of symbols like t12, t13, etc., which in the grammar are all terminals. So, each of these must be derived from some production. \n\nLet me list the productions that directly generate these terminals. From the grammar, I can see that some non-terminals directly produce t symbols. For example, NT24 can produce t5, NT44 can produce t6, NT18 might produce t24, and so on. Wait, actually, I need to check each terminal in the string and see which NTs can produce them.\n\nBreaking down the string:\n\n- t12: Looking through the rules, NT21 and NT24 can produce t12. Wait, checking NT21: NT21 -> NT10 NT10, but in the grammar, NT21 isn't directly producing t12. Wait, no, let me check. From the grammar, looking for NT that directly produce t12. For example, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t12. Let's see:\n\n- NT21 -> NT10 NT10: Not t12.\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT23: No.\n- NT13 -> NT69: Which is t69, not t12.\nWait, actually, maybe I should look through the rules where t symbols are on the right-hand side. \n\nLooking at NT13 -> NT69, but that's t69, not t12. Hmm. Maybe I need to track back for each t symbol where they come from.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- t12 is terminal. So which non-terminal does it come from? The rules have:\n\nNT28 -> NT20 NT1 \u2192 Not producing t12.\nNT26 -> NT24 NT23 \u2192 No.\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me check all the rules that have t symbols.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT4 -> t48? No, wait, looking through the rules, e.g., NT24 -> t5, which is t5. Hmm, not t12. Let me find each production that ends in t.\n\nFrom the list, the terminals are t prefixes, e.g., t2, t3, t4, etc. So I need to find production rules where a non-terminal directly produces one of these t's.\n\nLooking through the rules, some rules have t on the RHS. For example, NT52 -> t44, NT44 -> t6, NT42 -> t5, NT28 -> t4, etc. \n\nSo, for example:\n\n- NT28 can produce t4, t6, t18, etc. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT28 -> NT26 NT23, NT28 -> NT20 NT1, NT28 -> NT0 NT13, NT28 -> NT7 NT9, etc. Wait, but looking for t symbols, I think NT28 has two rules where it directly produces t symbols: NT28 -> t4 and NT28 -> t6?\n\nWait, let me check each production:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT28 appears in several rules, but the right-hand sides include NTs and t symbols:\n\nLooking specifically:\n\n- NT28 -> NT26 NT23: No t.\n- NT28 -> NT20 NT1: No t.\n- NT28 -> NT0 NT13: No t.\n- NT28 -> NT7 NT9: No t.\n- And also, in the given grammar, there's NT28 -> t67 and NT28 -> t84? Wait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nWait, looking at the initial grammar given, I need to see if any production leads directly to t12, t13, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look at each symbol in the string and find out which NT can produce them.\n\nThe string is \"t12 t13 t18 t6 t16 t24\"\n\nSo each t is a separate symbol, which means each t must come from a production that directly generates that t.\n\nLooking at the productions, for each t symbol, check which NT can produce it.\n\nFor example:\n\nt12: Looking through the rules, any NT that generates t12. From the grammar, NT28 has two productions that produce t67 and t84, no. Wait, I'm looking for t12.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of which NTs produce which t symbols. Let me go through each production and note if a non-terminal directly produces a t.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT50 -> NT15 NT32: No t.\n- NT52 -> t44: So NT52 produces t44.\n- NT44 -> t6: So NT44 produces t6.\n- NT42 -> t5: So NT42 produces t5.\n- NT24 -> t18: No, looking back, NT24 in the rules: NT24 -> t5, yes. So NT24 produces t5 and t18.\nWait, no, checking the list:\n\nWait, looking for t in the productions:\n\n- NT24's productions are: NT24 -> t5, NT24 -> t18. So NT24 can produce t5 and t18.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT18 is in the productions, so NT18 produces t18?\nWait, maybe I'm mixing NT and t. Wait, NT is a non-terminal, and the productions sometimes produce t symbols as terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT13 -> NT69 (t69), NT21 -> NT10 NT10, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see for each t in the string, does any NT directly produce it. For example:\n\nt12: Is there any NT that directly produces t12? Looking through the production rules, I don't see NT producing t12 directly. Let me check:\n\n- NT28 has one rule: NT28 -> t67, and another: NT28 -> t84. Does it have t12? Looking through the list, I don't see it. So perhaps t12 comes from a chain of productions.\n\nSimilarly for t13, etc.\n\nSo for the string to be generated, each t must be produced by some NT in the grammar, and that NT must be derivable from the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to build the derivation step by step.\n\nGiven S -> NT15 NT15, wait, no, the first production is S -> NT15 NT15? No, the first production is S -> NT15 NT15? Wait, no: the first line is \"S -> NT15 NT15.\"\n\nWait no, looking at the initial context-free grammar, the first line is S -> NT15 NT15. Wait, that can't be right because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. Oh wait, no, each production for a non-terminal has exactly two non-terminals on the right. So in the case of S, it produces two non-terminals, each of which will be replaced eventually by strings of terminals.\n\nWait, S -> NT15 NT15. So S produces two NT15s. Then, each NT15 must eventually produce sequences ending in t symbols.\n\nLooking at NT15: from the grammar, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. That's a recursive definition.\n\nWait, this could get complicated, but let's try to see if each t in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me list the t symbols in the string and see which NTs produce them:\n\nt12: I need to find an NT that can derive t12. If I don't see any production directly for t12 in the grammar, perhaps it's derived from a chain.\n\nt13: Similarly.\n\nt18: As per the grammar, NT24 can produce t18, so maybe that's fine.\n\nt6: NT44 can produce t6.\n\nt16: Looking at the grammar, NT16 -> t3, but wait, in the productions, I see NT16 -> t3. Hmm. Or is T16 a non-terminal that can produce t16?\n\nWait, looking for T16, I see NT16 has a production NT16 -> t3. Wait, no: in the grammar, it's written as NT16 -> 't3', but wait, that's actually a terminal t3. So NT16 directly produces t3, not t16. So perhaps I'm wrong.

{"custom_id":"request-86","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is \"t54 t55 t6 t16 t31 t31 t36\". \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see that all productions fit this form, so that's a good start.\n\nI need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the production rules. The string has seven tokens, which seems like it could correspond to a derivation path with seven production steps, since each step adds one token (except for S which might not add anything). \n\nLet me start by breaking down the string. The tokens are in order: t54, t55, t6, t16, t31, t31, t36. I need to see if each of these terminals can be matched to a production rule's terminal on the right-hand side of the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals expand directly into terminals. For example, NT21 \u2192 t13, NT44 \u2192 t6, etc. But most of the productions involve other non-terminals. So, I'll have to see which parts of the string correspond to which rules.\n\nI'll start from the first token, t54. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT19 \u2192 't13' but that's not helpful here. Wait, let's search for where t54 appears. Looking at the rules, I don't see t54 directly, but maybe it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for production rules where the right-hand side includes 't54'. Looking through the rules, I see NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48. NT42 is 't5', so that's not it. Hmm. Maybe t54 is derived from a production that includes it.\n\nWait, looking at NT19: NT19 \u2192 't13' but I don't see 't54' in any production. Maybe t54 is part of a production that leads to it. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Perhaps I should work backwards from the string, trying to see if each token matches any production's terminal.\n\nLet's list the non-terminals and their possible terminal outputs. For example, NT24 \u2192 't5', NT21 \u2192 't13', NT26 \u2192 't12', NT37 \u2192 't12', NT52 \u2192 't44'. Hmm, not seeing t54. Maybe it's part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, maybe the string is \"t54 t55 t6 t16 t31 t31 t36\". Let me consider the start symbol S and how it can derive the string. The start symbol is S, which is in the first production as S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Now, I need to see how NT15 and NT43 can derive their parts of the string. Let's look at NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That's a recursive rule, so it would have to be handled as a left recursion, but since the grammar is in CNF, I think left recursion is allowed because it's transformed into a loop. Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite it to eliminate left recursion, but perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, so in order to expand, it would have to go through NT37 and then back to NT15 again, which might not make sense for the string we have.\n\nWait, maybe I should try another approach. Let's try to parse the string from the start, building up the parse tree. The first step is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string would start with the expansion of NT15 followed by NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t54. Let's see if NT15 can produce anything starting with t54. NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. The right-hand side is NT37 and NT15. So the first symbol from NT15 would come from NT37. Let's see what NT37 produces. Looking through the rules, NT37 \u2192 't12' or 't12' again. Wait, no. Looking at the rules, I see NT37 \u2192 't12' once, but then also NT37 \u2192 't12' again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the rules, under NT37 there are two entries:\nNT37 \u2192 't12'\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n\nSo, NT37 can either produce t12 or recursively break down into NT19 NT19. Since we're trying to get t54 first, this seems off. So, perhaps this approach is not leading me to t54. Maybe the initial assumption about S's first production is correct, but maybe there's another production for S that I'm not seeing.\n\nWait, checking the rules again, I see that under NT15, there's a production NT15 \u2192 't39' via another rule: wait, no. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nWait, let me re-examine that. The rules are provided in a list. I'll note the relevant parts:\n\nI see:\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\nNT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0\n\nSo S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Now, the first part is NT15, which can't produce a terminal directly; it has to go through NT37. But NT37 can produce 't12' or break down further. So, perhaps t54 isn't coming from NT15 NT43. Maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another production for S that I'm misreading. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, the first few are:\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43\nNT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32\nNT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47\nNT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35\nNT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46\n... and so on.\n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps there's another way if S is part of a different production. But in this case, the only production for S is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So perhaps the initial step must be S \u2192 NT15 NT43, starting with NT15. So, the first token should come from NT15's derivation.\n\nBut since NT15 can't produce a terminal directly, I might be stuck. That would mean that the string can't start with 't54', but that's the first token. Therefore, the answer might be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different way. Let me check if any non-terminal can derive a sequence that includes all the required tokens. For example, looking at NT15: it can derive into NT37 NT15. NT37 can produce t12, and then another NT37 could produce more t12s. But that's not matching the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT37 can have recursive productions. So perhaps NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. Then NT19 can produce 't13' or 't37'. Wait, does NT19 produce t13 or t37?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT19:\n\nNT19 \u2192 't13' (since under NT19, the third entry is 't13'), and also NT19 \u2192 't37'. So both 't13' and 't37' are possible.\n\nIn the string, the last token is 't36', which is 't36' \u2192 looking at the rules, I don't see a production for 't36' directly. But 't36' is part of NT36, which \u2192 NT42 NT48. Let's look at NT36:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48.\n\nLooking at NT42, it's 't5', which might be generated by NT42. Wait, in the grammar, NT42 is part of a production. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me try to see if any non-terminal can derive 't36'. Looking at the rules, 't36' isn't a terminal on the right-hand side of any production, except in the parts of some NTs. For example, looking at the list, none of the right-hand sides produce 't36' directly, except possibly in the parts of some non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-87","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t54 t18 t6 t16 t12 t12 t13`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a form where each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it indeed seems to be in CNF because all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe next step is to understand how the string `t54 t18 t6 t16 t12 t12 t13` is formed. Each terminal (like t54, t18, etc.) corresponds to a production rule. So, to see if the string is generated, I need to work backwards, starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the given string.\n\nThe start symbol S has the production S -> NT15 NT43. So, S can directly produce NT15 NT43. Both NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals, so I need to expand them further.\n\nLooking at NT15, it's defined as NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that's interesting because it's a recursive production. So, NT15 can produce NT37 followed by NT15. But this will keep on going recursively unless it's expanded further. Let me look at the productions for NT37. NT37 -> NT19 NT19. NT19 has two productions: one is NT19 -> NT12 NT38 and another is NT19 -> NT51 NT19. Hmm, so I can expand NT37 as NT19 NT19.\n\nNow, the other part of S is NT43, which has the production NT43 -> NT6 NT1. NT6 and NT1 are non-terminals. NT6 -> 't16' and NT1 -> 't24'. So, NT43 directly expands to 't16' 't24', giving us the string parts 't16' 't24'.\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce NT15 NT43, which is NT15 followed by 't16 t24'. Let's focus on expanding NT15 now.\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15. Let's pick the longest possible expansion. If I choose Nt37 -> NT19 NT19, then NT19 can expand in two ways. Let's pick the first option: NT19 -> NT12 NT38. Nt12 has a production NT12 -> NT21 NT48. NT21 can expand as either NT10 NT10 or NT40 NT40. NT10 -> NT50 NT30, and so on.\n\nWait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see what the string is and match the terminals.\n\nThe string we're trying to derive is t54 t18 t6 t16 t12 t12 t13. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting from S, we have S -> NT15 NT43, which gives us the end part as t16 t24. But t24 isn't part of the string, so perhaps that's the wrong path. Wait, the string has t54 as the first symbol. But in S's expansion, the first part is NT15, which seems to expand into something that might include more steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's double-check the productions for NT15 and NT43.\n\nWait, another approach: since the string begins with t54, let's see what non-terminals can produce t54. Looking through the productions, I see that NT19 has a production NT19 -> 't54' as part of the rules. Specifically, in the production NT19 -> NT51 NT19. Wait, no, that's not a terminal. Let's check the NT19 productions: \n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT19 -> NT12 NT38\nNT19 -> NT51 NT19\n\nBut NT19 also has another production? Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, I don't see a direct production for NT19 as a terminal. Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through, I see that NT51 -> 't90' etc., but checking NT19, the productions are NT19 -> NT12 NT38 and NT19 -> NT51 NT19. There's no NT19 -> 't54' directly. Hmm. Wait, no. Wait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. The initial part lists all the NT* rules, but looking through the terminals, I see 't54' in which rule?\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, for example, NT44 -> 't6', NT42 -> 't5', etc. But for NT19, I don't see a direct production. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT19 is actually part of a rule that leads to a terminal. Let me scan through the provided grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, in the section under \"NT50 -> NT41 NT43\" etc., I see that NT44 -> 't6', NT42 -> 't5', and so on. So, perhaps NT19 can produce a terminal via a longer chain.\n\nWait, maybe I should create a parse tree for the given string. Let's see.\n\nThe target string is t54 t18 t6 t16 t12 t12 t13.\n\nStart symbol S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nNT43: as above, NT43 -> 't16' 't24'. But the string has t16, but not immediately followed by t24. Wait, the string is t54 t18 t6 t16 t12 t12 t13.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S's expansion is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in focusing on the NT43 part.\n\nLet me try a different angle. Let's try to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nWe start with S.\n\nStep 1: S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nNow, derive the leftmost symbols first. So, let's expand NT15 first.\n\nNT15 can be derived as NT37 NT15.\n\nNT37 is replaced by NT19 NT19.\n\nSo, now we have Nt19 NT19 NT15, but let's see what to do next.\n\nNT19 -> NT12 NT38.\n\nWait, that's getting somewhere. So, Nt19 NT19 becomes Nt12 NT38 NT12 NT38.\n\nWait, no, each NT19 can be further expanded. Or perhaps we need to follow it all the way.\n\nThis might take a while, but let me attempt to see if the terminals can match.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I should reverse-engineer the string, trying to match each terminal with a production.\n\nThe string is t54 t18 t6 t16 t12 t12 t13.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.\n\nFirst term: t54. Which production could lead to that? Looking at the grammar, perhaps NT19 can produce t54? But above, I don't see NT19 directly giving t54. Wait, perhaps it's part of a longer chain, like NT19 -> 't54'? Wait, no, from the provided rules, NT19 has productions to NT12 NT38 and to NT51 NT19. No direct t54.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the NT51 is part of another rule. Let me check.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I missed an NT19 production. Wait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT7 -> NT35 NT35.\n\nWait, but that's a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps some other NT leads to t54.\n\nLooking again at the provided productions, perhaps the key is that some non-terminals directly expand into t54.\n\nWait, looking through, I see NT5 -> 't2', but nowhere does NT19 produce t54.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the NT19 can produce a t54 via a chain.\n\nWait, maybe NT19 -> NT12 NT38.\n\nThen Nt12 can expand as NT21 NT48.\n\nThen, Nt21 can expand as NT10 NT10 or NT40 NT40.\n\nIf NT21 becomes Nt10 NT10, then Nt10 expands as NT50 NT30.\n\nSo, NT50 -> NT41 NT43. \n\nHmm, this could lead into the S's NT15, which is NT37 NT15.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is a non-terminal leading to two non-terminals, except the terminals which are the actual tokens.\n\nFirst, I should look at the string and see how it's broken down. It's a sequence of 8 tokens. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level production is S -> NT15 NT43. So the string should start with NT15 and end with NT43, replacing each with their respective terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by examining each part of the string to see if they can match the productions.\n\nThe string starts with `t54`. Looking for NTs that can produce `t54`. Scanning the productions, I see:\n\n- NT19 -> NT12 NT38 (but this doesn't help for `t54`)\n- NT37 -> NT19 NT19 (also not helpful)\n- NT23 -> NT2 NT50 (no)\n- NT19 -> NT51 NT19 (no)\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15 (no)\n- NT51 -> NT50 NT20 (no)\n- NT41 -> NT7 NT31 (no)\n- NT28 -> NT20 NT1 (no)\n- NT45 -> NT27 NT6 (no)\n- NT36 -> NT5 NT30 (no)\n- Looking for NT that directly produce `t54`: Hmm, do any NTs produce `t54` directly? Or do they produce sequences that when resolved lead to `t54`?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way. Each NT leads to two other NTs or terminals. So perhaps the string is a sequence of terminals, and each part is determined by the productions.\n\nWait, the string is `t54 t67 t2 t83 t87 t6 t16 t37`. Let me list them:\n\n1. t54\n2. t67\n3. t2\n4. t83\n5. t87\n6. t6\n7. t16\n8. t37\n\nSo there are 8 terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals. So for a string of length n, the number of steps would be n-1. For 8 terminals, we need 7 productions.\n\nBut looking at the start symbol S, which is S -> NT15 NT43, which is two non-terminals, so each step would double the number of non-terminals until they are replaced by terminals.\n\nWait, but the number of terminals produced would be equal to the number of non-terminals that eventually produce terminals, summed up along the parsing tree. So for the S rule, S produces two NTs, each of which can produce an average of two terminals each step. So the total number of terminals would be something like 2^k.\n\nWait, but the string length here is 8. Let's see if 8 can be expressed as a power of 2. 2^3=8. So that might make sense. So perhaps each production step doubles the number, and we need 3 steps after S.\n\nLet's see: S is production 1, then after expansion, we get two NTs, then each of those produces two more, so 4, then 8.\n\nSo the depth of the parse tree would be 3, leading to 8 terminals.\n\nNow, let's see which NTs produce each terminal.\n\nFirst, let's find which NTs produce each of the terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the terminals (strings of length 1) are:\n\nNT52 -> 't44'\n\nNT5 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't48'\n\nNT29 -> 't63'\n\nNT4 -> 't88'\n\nNT9 -> 't28'\n\nNT50 -> 't33'\n\nNT12 -> 't16'\n\nNT51 -> 't90'\n\nNT48 -> 't87'\n\nNT1 -> 't24'\n\nNT34 -> 't87'\n\nNT36 -> 't84'\n\nNT21 -> 't99'\n\nNT45 -> 't11'\n\nNT19 -> 't13'\n\nNT37 -> 't12'\n\nNT51 -> 't38'\n\nNT6 -> 't16'\n\nNT17 -> 't33'\n\nNT19 -> 't54'\n\nNT31 -> 't91'\n\nNT23 -> 't7'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nSo from these, let's get the NT that produce each terminal:\n\nt54: NT19\n\nt67: Hmm, none of the terminals end with t67.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. It starts with the start symbol S, which produces NT15 NT43. So, the initial step is S => NT15 NT43. Both NT15 and NT43 can produce more symbols or terminals.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. This is a recursive production. Since it's preceded by NT, it's left-recursive. But in Chomsky Normal Form, left recursion can sometimes complicate things, so maybe I can rewrite this production. If I left-factor, perhaps I can rewrite it as NT15 -> NT37 NT15, but that might not help much. Maybe it's better to see if I can eliminate the left recursion. Alternatively, when traversing the string, I can handle this as we go.\n\nNow, NT43: NT43 -> NT6 NT1. Wait, wait, looking back, I think I misread. Let me check the productions again. Oh, NT43 appears multiple times, like NT43 -> NT27 NT0, and also NT43 -> NT6 NT1. I think the correct one for NT43 is NT43 -> NT27 NT0 and another production NT43 -> NT6 NT1. So, I should check which one is applicable.\n\nSo S starts as NT15 NT43. NT15 is recursive, NT43 can go to either NT27 NT0 or NT6 NT1.\n\nLet's consider the string: `t38 t16 t38 t36 t18 t6 t16 t24`.\n\nI think I'll parse this step by step. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each step of the grammar must replace a non-terminal with terminals and non-terminals that produce the string.\n\nStarting with S => NT15 NT43.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how NT15 and NT43 can produce the string. Let's process each non-terminal:\n\nFirst, NT15. NT15 has a production NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Since it's left-recursive, but in CNF, perhaps it's easier to handle with right recursion or left recursion handling. For the string, I need to see how NT15 can produce a terminal sequence. Looking through the productions, I don't see NT15 directly expanding to any terminals. So, maybe it can only produce something via NT37.\n\nWait, looking at NT15, it's production is only NT37 NT15, which is left-recursive. So, unless there is a terminal in NT15's expansion, it won't produce anything terminal from NT15. Hmm, this might be an issue because in the string, we have t38, t16, etc., which are terminals. So if NT37 is involved, but NT15 can't produce a terminal directly, perhaps I can proceed.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the productions for NT37. Oh, NT37 has productions like NT37 -> NT19 NT19 and NT37 -> NT17 NT45. Neither of these are terminals, so NT37 would not produce t's either. Hmm, this is a problem because the start symbol S is NT15 NT43, which both can't directly produce terminals, but the string has several t's.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check all the productions for non-terminals that can produce terminals. Looking through the productions, many of them end with 'tX' where X is some number, which are terminal symbols.\n\nFor example, NT5 -> 't2', NT4 -> 't48', etc. So some non-terminals do directly produce terminals.\n\nSo, going back, S => NT15 NT43.\n\nAssume that NT43 can produce NT6 NT1. Let's check if NT6 or NT1 can produce any terminals.\n\nLooking at NT6: The productions are NT6 -> 't16' directly. So NT6 can produce t16.\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 has a production NT1 -> NT51 NT38, and NT51 -> NT50 NT20. Then NT50 has production NT50 -> NT41 NT43, and so on. It seems NT1 can eventually produce a terminal sequence, but it's a longer path.\n\nSo, let's try building the string step by step.\n\nStart with S => NT15 NT43.\n\nNT43 can choose between several productions. One is NT43 -> NT27 NT0. NT27 -> NT8 NT17, and NT0 -> NT52 NT8. Wait, NT52 is in the productions: NT52 -> 't44', which is a terminal. But let's see if that leads us somewhere.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to see if each part of the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t38 t16 t38 t36 t18 t6 t16 t24.\n\nLet me list the sequence:\n\n1. t38\n2. t16\n3. t38\n4. t36\n5. t18\n6. t6\n7. t16\n8. t24\n\nI need to find a way to derive this string from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals can produce terminals, so perhaps the entire string is built from non-terminals that eventually derive to terminals.\n\nLet me look at each terminal in the string and see if it can be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nt38: Looking at the productions, few non-terminals produce t38. For example, NT29 -> 't36', not t38. Wait, looking for 't38' in the productions. Looking through the list, I see NT29 has NT29 -> 't63' and NT37 has no terminals except those starting with t. Wait, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce t38. Hmm, perhaps t38 is a terminal that cannot be generated by any rule, but that can't be because the string includes t38. So I must have missed something.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the productions. Looking back, I see:\n\nLooking for t38: Oh, I don't see any production where NT -> t38. Hmm, that's a problem. So if there is no production that allows a non-terminal to directly produce t38, then the string can't be generated. But that raises a flag, because the string includes t38 multiple times, but I can't produce t38 from any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check all the productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT28 -> 't67', NT24 -> 't18', NT27 -> 't12', NT17 -> 't33', NT45 -> 't11', etc. But where is t38?\n\nWait, looking at NT23's production: NT23 -> NT26 NT2. NT26 -> NT24 NT34. Wait, and looking at other productions, perhaps:\n\nLooking at NT37: NT37 -> NT17 NT45, and NT17 -> NT2 NT30. NT45 can produce t67 via NT45 -> 't67'. No, that's t67.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing t38. Is there any non-terminal that can directly produce t38?\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see any. For example, NT48 is in several productions, but none directly produce t38 except for if any of the NTs point to t38.\n\nWait, looking back at the productions, oh I see:\n\nIn the initial list, I have NT29 -> 't63', NT19 -> 't54', NT31 -> 't91', etc. But I don't see t38.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look through all the productions again carefully.\n\nLooking for any NT -> 't38':\n\n- NT37 -> NT17 NT45\n- NT17 -> NT2 NT30\n- NT45 -> 't11' (no, that's t11)\n- NT45 -> 't67'\n- NT28 -> 't4', 't67', etc.\n- NT15 -> 't30' (no, NT30 is a non-terminal that further goes on)\n\nWait, maybe I didn't see it, but perhaps none of the non-terminals produce t38.

{"custom_id":"request-126","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding what each part means. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. There are several non-terminals like S, NT15, NT50, etc., and some terminals like 't' followed by numbers. The grammar seems to have a lot of production rules, so it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is \"t31 t16 t38 t36 t88 t6 t6 t16 t37\". Since this is a series of terminals, I need to see if there's a derivation path from the start symbol S to this string using the given grammar.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. According to the first rule, S -> NT15 NT43. So S can be split into two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43. Each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded further until we reach the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me list the string's components: t31, t16, t38, t36, t88, t6, t6, t16, t37.\n\nI need each of these to be part of the left-hand side of some production rule that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that many non-terminals directly produce terminal strings. For example:\n- NT23 -> t7\n- NT28 -> t67\n- NT29 -> t63\n- NT19 -> t13\n- And others like NT4 -> t48, etc.\n\nWait, but the string has a mix of different terminals, so I need to see if each terminal can be derived from some non-terminal path.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t31. Looking at NT31, the production is NT31 -> NT15 NT5. Neither NT15 nor NT5 is an terminal. Hmm, but this might be part of a longer derivation. Alternatively, maybe it's connected to another non-terminal. Let me check if any other rules produce t31.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT6 -> t16\n- NT17 -> t33\n- NT19 -> t54\n- NT23 -> t7\n- NT28 -> t67\n- NT5 -> t2\n- NT4 -> t48\n- NT9 -> t28\n- NT10 -> t50\n- Wait, maybe I missed one. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I see:\n- NT31 -> NT23 NT9. NT23 produces t7, but NT9 produces t28. So NT31 would produce t7 t28. But the string has t31. So maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider other paths. Let me go back to the top.\n\nS is NT15 NT43. NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that seems recursive. So NT15 can produce NT37 followed by another NT15. But wait, there's also another rule: NT15 -> NT19 NT30. Hmm, so possible to choose either.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 has production rules like NT43 -> NT6 NT1, NT43 -> NT27 NT1, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the terminal symbols in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFor example, looking for t31: The production for NT31 is NT23 NT9. But as I saw, that gives t7 t28, not t31. So maybe I'm missing a production. Wait, looking at the rules again, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT31 is defined as NT23 NT9. So when you expand NT31, you get t7 t28, which are t's 7 and 28. But in the string, I have t31 in the first position. So perhaps t31 is produced elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe I misread the rules. Let me check each production rule:\n\nLooking for 't31' in the terminals:\n\nI see:\n- NT31 -> NT23 NT9\n- NT23 -> NT7 NT30 (from earlier rules, but I think I got sidetracked). Wait, let me check for NT31.\n\nWait, NT31: NT23 NT9. So expanding that, I would get NT23's production and NT9's production. Let me check what NT23 can produce.\n\nNT23's rule is NT7 NT30. So NT7 is 't52'? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT7's production is not listed as a terminal. Wait, let me check. Oh, I see:\n\nWait, looking back, I realize I might have misread some of the rules. Let me list all the terminal productions because they seem scattered in the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't48'\n- NT29 -> 't63'\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n- NT17 -> 't33'\n- NT19 -> 't13'\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n- NT31 -> 't'... Wait, no. Wait, NT31 is a non-terminal; it's defined as NT23 NT9.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me go through each rule to see if any non-terminals directly produce the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking for any rule that directly produces t31, t16, etc.\n\nWait, I realize I might have missed some. Let me list all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT4 -> 't48'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT9 -> 't28'\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n- NT17 -> 't33'\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n- NT4 -> 't48' (duplicate)\n- NT29 -> 't63'\n- NT31 -> needs to be seen\n- NT37 -> various options; e.g., NT19 NT19, which could be t13 t13, or NT12 NT38 (t12 t51)\n- Wait, maybe not. Let me re-examine each rule:\n\n1. NT5 -> 't2'\n2. NT4 -> 't48'\n3. NT29 -> 't63'\n4. NT44 -> 't6'\n5. NT17 -> 't33'\n6. NT37 -> 't12' (if it has a direct rule), wait no, NT37 has multiple rules like NT19 NT45, etc. So none of the NT37 rules directly produce a single terminal.\n\nWait, so for NT31, is there a rule that directly produces t31? I don't see it. So perhaps I need to go back. Maybe the production for NT31 is not a terminal, but perhaps through other steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built from non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals. Let me try to see if each terminal in the string can be the result of some non-terminal.\n\nFor the string `t31 t16 t38 t36 t88 t6 t6 t16 t37`, each part is separated by a space, so we need a derivation that produces these terms in order.\n\nLet me start with the first symbol, t31. Since NT31 doesn't directly produce t31, I'm stuck here. Wait, maybe I'm mislooking the rules. Let me check if any non-terminal produces t31 directly. I don't see any production rule where NTsomething is directly 't31'. So perhaps t31 cannot be derived, which would mean the entire string cannot be generated. But that can't be right because the string has t31. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps t31 is in a production of some non-terminal that's being used. Let me check NT31 again: NT31 -> NT23 NT9. So if I expand NT23 and NT9, what do they produce?\n\nNT23's production is NT7 NT30. NT7 -> 't52'?

{"custom_id":"request-140","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is `t33 t67 t12 t54 t55 t6 t16 t38 t31 t36`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. The grammar is a set of production rules where each non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, ending with terminals. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that some of the NT rules produce terminal symbols directly, e.g., NT44 \u2192 't6', NT52 \u2192 't44', etc. This suggests that the terminals are the 't' numbers. \n\nThe string has these terminals: t33, t67, t12, t54, t55, t6, t16, t38, t31, t36. So each 'tXXX' must come directly from a production rule of the form NTXXX \u2192 a, where 'a' is 'tXXX'. \n\nI notice that most of the NT rules have their left-hand side as a two-character NT followed by a number, like NT1, NT2, etc. Each of these likely leads to a specific terminal, except when they produce other non-terminals.\n\nFor example, NT44 \u2192 't6', NT52 \u2192 't44', and NT0 \u2192 't39'. But that's just the terminal part. So the string is a series of 't's attached in sequence.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t33 t67 t12 t54 t55 t6 t16 t38 t31 t36`. Let's count the number of tokens. There are 10 tokens, which is even, but the grammar's start symbol is S, which is S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so the derivation starts with two non-terminals. Each production rule applies to these.\n\nLooking more closely, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (which might loop back) and NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. So there's a recursive element here. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, which could produce t13 or something else. But more importantly, in the given grammar, each rule ends with a terminal.\n\nI think each NT rule directly produces a single 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT29 \u2192 't63'\n- Etc.\n\nBut the string has t33, t67, etc., which aren't directly in the rules. Hmm, perhaps they are combined through other NT rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a series of terminals that can be derived from the initial non-terminals. So each 'tXXX' would have to be produced by the correct NT rule.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t33. I need to find which NT rule produces 't33'. Let's scan through the rules:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't6'\nNT52 \u2192 't44'\nNT51 \u2192 NT41 NT43, which eventually would produce terminals and perhaps t51 itself, but that doesn't help us get t33. \n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck trying to manually parse each step. Maybe a better approach is to construct the derivation.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT43. So, to get the string, I need to derive a sequence of 't's by expanding NT15 and NT43.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So this can be expanded into NT37 followed by NT15. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. NT19 has rules like \u2192 NT12 NT38, \u2192 NT51 NT19, etc. Wait, NT19 can go to t13, and others. But looking at the given grammar, NT19 \u2192 t13 is not present. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules, some NT's produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT4 \u2192 t48\n- NT29 \u2192 t63\n- NT30 \u2192 t32, but not t33\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n- NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1, so NT43 would be NT6 and NT1.\n\nWait, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nThe start is S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So we can consider NT15 as NT37 followed by another NT15. But NT37 itself can be NT19 NT19.\n\nSo each NT15 can generate something that's NT37 followed by NT15, but NT37 is NT19 twice, and NT19 can expand further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to track all possible expansions.\n\nBut this seems time-consuming and error-prone. Maybe a better approach is to write down the production chain for the string.\n\nThe string is t33 t67 t12 t54 t55 t6 t16 t38 t31 t36.\n\nSince each terminal must come directly from a production rule, perhaps the string is the result of expanding the entire grammar until we get only terminals. But given the length, this might be a long chain.\n\nWait, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation increases the length by one. The start symbol S is at the top, and each derivation step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until we reach the terminals.\n\nSo the length of the string must match the number of symbols derived. Starting from S (1 non-terminal), each step doubles the number of non-terminals, but in reality, it's better to think that producing m terminals requires m production steps because each S expansion is a binary tree of height m.\n\nBut the given string has 10 terminals. So the derivation should produce 9 splits (since each split adds one more symbol). So the total number of non-terminals in the derivation would be 2^10 -1? Wait, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of splits is equal to the number of terminals minus one. Each step of replacement adds one more non-terminal, but as we're replacing non-terminals with two non-terminals, but in the end, every non-terminal must expand to a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of derivation steps. S starts as one symbol. Each production replaces a non-terminal with two. So the number of symbols increases as such:\n\nLevel 0: 1 (S)\nLevel 1: 2 (NT15, NT43)\nLevel 2: 4 (NT15 expands to two, NT43 expands to two)\n...\nUntil the leaves have 10 terminals.\n\nWait, the number of production steps is equal to the number of times non-terminals are replaced. Starting with S, each production doubles the number of symbols until we get 10 terminals.\n\nBut 2^k = 10, which isn't an integer. So perhaps it's not possible, but that's just a thought. However, in a CFG, the length can be anything as long as there's a way to derive the string.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, the number of symbols doubles each expansion, so the number of symbols must be 2^k. But our string has 10 symbols, which isn't a power of two. Wait, that would suggest that it's impossible to derive a string with 10 different non-terminals in a CFG derived from S, which is a single non-terminal. Or wait, no, because some non-terminals are same or produce same.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of symbols with the number of expansions. Each expansion of a non-terminal produces two, but if two different non-terminals expand to the same terminal, their productions can collapse into the same symbol.\n\nSo for a string of 10 different terminals, the number of symbols is 10, but because of the way the grammar is set up, each splitting could have same symbols, leading to the total count being a power of two.\n\nWait, perhaps not. It's more about the derivation path. For example, each 't' in the string must be the result of a production where the non-terminal eventually expands to that specific 't'.\n\nSo each 'tXXX' in the string must correspond to a path from S to that non-terminal, with each step expanding according to the grammar.\n\nGiven that, each 't' must be derived via a chain of productions. So for each 'tXXX' in the string, there must be a path that starts from S and leads to that NT that produces 'tXXX'.\n\nLooking at the given string, the terminals are t33, t67, t12, t54, t55, t6, t16, t38, t31, t36.

{"custom_id":"request-142","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string in question is \"t54 t48 t6 t6 t16 t12 t33 t67 t31 t13\". \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it mostly follows CNF because the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Some exceptions might exist, but mostly it seems to be in CNF.\n\nNow, the goal is to derive the given string from the start symbol S. The string provided consists of several terminals, each tagged with a number: t54, t48, t6, etc. My initial thought is to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals. \n\nLooking at the productions, many rules have RHS as either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, each terminal in the string corresponds to a production rule that directly produces it. For example, if there's a rule like NT19 \u2192 t54, and another rule like S \u2192 NT15 NT1, then I need to see if S can produce these terminals in sequence.\n\nBut wait, looking at the provided grammar, I see that many non-terminals have productions that expand into other non-terminals, not directly into terminals except for some instances. So, for the string to be generated, each terminal must be derived from a chain of productions that eventually terminate in a terminal.\n\nSo, I need to map each terminal in the string to the appropriate rule in the grammar. Let's list them out:\n\nt54: Check if there's a rule that produces t54. Looking through the grammar, I see NT37 \u2192 t12, NT19 \u2192 t54, and NT45 \u2192 t11, among others. So, NT19 can produce t54.\n\nt48: Checking for rules that produce t48. I spot NT4 \u2192 t48 directly.\n\nt6: In the grammar, NT6 has a production to t16. Wait, that's NT6 \u2192 t16. Hmm, but we have t6, so maybe another rule. Let me check again. Oh, wait, I see NT8 \u2192 t46 NT35. No, that's a non-terminal. Looking further, NT15 \u2192 t37 NT15, which might not be helpful. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for all rules where the RHS is a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production for a non-terminal either results in a terminal or two non-terminals. So, let's see:\n\nFor t6, looking in the grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 NT52 NT8, and NT8 \u2192 t40 NT49, but that might not help. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me search for rules that directly produce t6. Looking, I see NT6 \u2192 t16, which is a terminal. Oh, wait, but that's t16, not t6. Did I miss a rule for t6? Hmm.\n\nWait, I see NT6 \u2192 t16 is correct, so t6 is not directly produced. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe I need to see the production chain for each terminal. For example, t54 comes from NT19, which needs to be derived. So, S must expand into NT15 and NT1, then each of those into other non-terminals, and so on until the terminals.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible path:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT1\n\nFrom S, I need to see what NT15 and NT1 produce.\n\nFirst, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So, that's a recursive rule. To resolve this, we'll need to see what NT37 produces. From the grammar, NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45. So, NT37 expands into NT17 and NT45.\n\nThen, NT45 \u2192 NT25 NT16. So, NT45 is NT25 and NT16.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47, so NT25 becomes NT13 and NT47.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT69, which is a terminal?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT28 \u2192 t12, but NT13 is defined as \u2192 NT69. Checking the grammar, yes, NT13 \u2192 t69, which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT47 \u2192 NT25 NT6. So, NT47 is NT25 and NT6.\n\nNow, NT25 is \u2192 NT13 NT47, which we just saw, and NT47 is NT25 NT6.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's perhaps approach this step-by-step, building a parse tree.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT15 NT1.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT25 NT16.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47.\n\nNT13 is t69.\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT25 NT6.\n\nNow, we have to resolve these further. Let's take each non-terminal:\n\nNT17: Looking at grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30.\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35.\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37.\n\nThis is getting too deep. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the given string might not be in the language because some terminals can't be derived directly. For example, t6 is a terminal, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT rule producing t6 directly. There might be a mistake because the grammar might not have a rule for t6, making it impossible for the string to be generated.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the grammar more carefully. Let me look for any production that directly produces t6. I see NT6 \u2192 t16, so that's for t16, not t6. Oh, so t6 isn't directly produced by any rule. So, perhaps the string can't be generated because t6 isn't present in any rules. Therefore, the string contains t6, which can't be derived directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a chain that leads to t6, but I need to check.\n\nWait, maybe t6 is produced indirectly. For example, some non-terminal X \u2192 NTsomething \u2192 t6. Let me see if any rules have RHS as a single terminal with value t6. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any such rules except NT6 \u2192 t16, which produces t16, not t6. So, perhaps the string cannot be generated because t6 can't be derived.\n\nBut wait, I might have made a mistake. Let me check all possible productions for terminals. Looking through the entire grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t16\n\nNT8 \u2192 t46 NT35\n\nNT9 \u2192 t28\n\nNT10 \u2192 t50 NT30\n\nNT12 \u2192 t16 NT20\n\nNT15 \u2192 t37 NT15\n\nNT17 \u2192 t2 NT30\n\nNT24 \u2192 t18 NT2\n\nNT25 \u2192 t48 NT47\n\nWait, no, none of these produce t6. So, the string contains t6, which isn't present as a terminal directly in any rule. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because t6 can't be produced.\n\nSo, the answer would be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo\n\nStep-by-step explanation: \n\nThe string contains the terminal \"t6\", but reviewing the grammar, I didn't find any production rule where a non-terminal directly produces \"t6\". All production rules with terminals only produce other strings, not \"t6\". Therefore, \"t6\" cannot appear in any string derived from the given grammar, making the string invalid.\n\nStep-by-step explanation: \n\n1. Analyze the grammar to identify all terminals.\n2. Check if any production rule directly produces \"t6\".\n3. Confirm that no such rule exists in the grammar.\n4. Conclude that the string, containing \"t6\", cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t38 t54 t55 t6 t16 t69 t72 t33 t33 t16 t7`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) can be parsed using methods like CYK or recursive descent. Since I'm not a parser, I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The terminals in the string are t38, t54, etc., so I can check if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT15 and NT43: S -> NT15 NT43. \n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t38, t54, etc. I need to see if the string can be derived from S by expanding the non-terminals step by step, replacing them with their right-hand sides, translating non-terminals into terminals until I get the string.\n\nLet me look at the productions to see how they expand into terminals and non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, the string starts with t38, which is the result of some expansion.

Wait, no, looking back, the productions under NT15: NT15 -> NT37 NT15 and NT15 -> NT39. But wait, in the given grammar:\n\n- NT15: NT37 NT15 and NT15 -> NT39.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT15:\n\n- NT15: NT37 NT15\n- NT15 -> NT39.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15 and NT15 -> NT39? Or is it the other way around. Wait, looking back at the given grammar:\n\nYes, I see lines:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nand \n\nNT15 -> NT39.\n\nWait, that seems odd. So NT15 can produce either NT37 followed by NT15 or NT39 as a terminal? But wait, no, because in the productions, NT37 is a non-terminal. So NT15 -> NT37 NT15 would mean that it expands into another non-terminal, which itself can expand further.\n\nWait, but NT37 is a non-terminal. Let me check what NT37 produces.\n\nLooking in the grammar:\n\nNT37: NT19 NT19.\n\nSo NT37 -> NT19 NT19.\n\nAnd NT19 has two productions:\n\nNT19 -> NT12 NT38 and NT19 -> NT54.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT19: NT12 NT38 and NT54.\n\nSo NT19 can be NT12 NT38 or NT54.\n\nNow, let's see the string. The first token is t38. That suggests that a production must lead to t38. Looking for productions that directly produce t38.\n\nGoing through each production looking for terminal symbols:\n\nLooking for A -> t38.

Hmm.\n\nLooking for t38. Where does t38 come from? \n\nLooking at NT38: NT38 is defined as NT51 NT29.\n\nWait, no. NT38 is broken down:\n\nLooking for any production that includes t38 as a direct expansion. Scanning through the productions, I don't immediately see any A -> t38. Instead, I see NT46 -> t72, NT27 -> t83, NT24: t18 and t55, etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. Since the string is t38 t54 t55 t6 t16 t69 t72 t33 t33 t16 t7.\n\nBreaking it down: t38, t54, t55, t6, t16, t69, t72, t33, t33, t16, t7.\n\nI notice that t54 appears. Looking for where t54 comes from. Checking the grammar, I see NT54: no production, because NT19 has two productions, one of which is NT54. So NT19 can be NT54, which is a terminal.\n\nSo t54 would come from NT19 -> NT54.\n\nSimilarly, t38 comes from NT38, which is NT51 NT29. Let's see:\n\nNT38: NT51 NT29.\n\nSo t38 would be the result of NT51 and NT29 expanding into terminals.\n\nLooking at NT51: NT51 -> NT50 NT20. So NT51 is NT50 followed by NT20.\n\nNT50: NT41 NT43.\n\nNT41 -> NT45 NT5. Wait, NT41 has a production NT45 NT5, but wait, I need to check:\n\nLooking for NT41:\n\nNT41 -> NT7 NT31.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT41: NT7 NT31.\n\nSo NT41: NT7 NT31.\n\nNT7: NT5 NT35.\n\nLooking at NT35: NT37 NT37.\n\nWait, but I'm getting into a loop maybe. Alternatively, let me see where t51 comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try building the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t38. So the first symbol in the string is t38. To get t38, we need a non-terminal that produces t38. Looking through the grammar, I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly expands into t38. That's a problem. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at NT19: NT19 -> NT12 NT38 and NT19 -> NT54.\n\nSo NT19 can produce NT12 NT38 or NT54. So if a production leads to NT19, one branch could be NT12 followed by NT38, which could produce t38, or directly t54.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t38, which suggests that the initial part of the derivation starts with NT19 expanding into NT12 NT38, which then expands into t38.\n\nSo the first step would be:\n\nS -> NT15 NT43.\n\nThen NT15 needs to generate the first part of the string, which is t38. So let's see how NT15 can produce t38.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT15, I see NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So that's a recursive production. Alternatively, NT15 can produce NT39, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, NT15 -> NT39 is a direct production. Wait, the grammar given under NT15 is:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nand \n\nNT15 -> NT39.\n\nWait, that doesn't make much sense. Normally, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So in this case, NT15 can be two non-terminals or another non-terminal, which may itself be further expanded.\n\nIf NT15 can go to NT39, which is a terminal, then that could produce t39, but in our string, the first symbol is t38, so that can't be it.

{"custom_id":"request-166","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because CNF has a specific structure that makes parsing and analysis easier. The string to check is `t33 t67 t13 t87 t12 t12 t6 t16 t90 t38 t36`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. CNF productions typically have the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the case where a production can be a single terminal followed by two terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So I should check all the productions to see if they fit this structure.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n- The start symbol is S, as per the first production: S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n- All other productions are of the form NT followed by two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. For example, NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32, NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48, and so on.\n- Wait, some productions combine a terminal and a non-terminal, but in CNF, I thought all productions must have only terminals or one non-terminal on the left. Hmm, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me check: Chomsky Normal Form allows productions of the form A \u2192 BC and A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So the grammar should only have productions where a non-terminal is producing either two non-terminals or a single terminal.

NT13 -> NT7 NT30: Wait, no, looking back: The production is NT13 -> NT69? Wait, the user provided a list of productions. Let me check again. Oh wait, no, I might have made a mistake. The user provided a long list, and I need to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, looking at the provided productions:\n\nAfter NT9, it's NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45. Then, further down, there's NT52 \u2192 NT6 NT25, which is a production with a terminal. Then, for NT13: NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34, NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT48, etc.\n\nWait, I think I misread the productions earlier. Let me re-examine the given productions in detail because it's crucial for constructing the parse tree.\n\nLooking through the list, I see that many of the NT(x) have productions where a non-terminal is followed by another, e.g., NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47, so that's two non-terminals, fitting CNF. Some have a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48, which is two non-terminals, so that's okay. Others have a terminal at the end, like in NT0 \u2192 NT52 NT8, where 8 is a terminal. So it looks like each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal followed by a terminal, which is acceptable in CNF as long as the left side is a single non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, a production can only be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So if a production is A \u2192 aB, that's not CNF. So I need to check if all the productions in the given grammar are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal and A, B, C are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32: fits\n- NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48: fits\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47: fits\n- NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35: fits\n- NT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46: fits\n- NT30 \u2192 NT32 NT8: fits (8 is a terminal)\n- NT20 \u2192 NT30 NT24: fits\n- NT46 \u2192 NT10 NT38: fits\n- NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37: fits\n- NT30 \u2192 NT24 NT44: fits\n- NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0: fits\n- NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38: fits\n- NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20: fits\n- NT34 \u2192 NT32 NT2: fits (2 is a terminal)\n- NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45: fits\n- NT52 \u2192 NT6 NT25: fits\n- NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19: fits (both are non-terminals)\n- NT52 \u2192 NT27 NT12: fits\n- NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4: fits\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19: fits\n- NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17: fits\n- NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30: fits\n- NT49 \u2192 NT47 NT27: fits\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT44: fits\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT26: fits\n- NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32: fits\n- NT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35: fits\n- NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23: fits\n- NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21: fits\n- NT0 \u2192 NT52 NT8: fits (8 is a terminal)\n- NT1 \u2192 NT51 NT38: fits\n- NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT1: fits (1 is a terminal)\n- NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31: fits\n- NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT9: fits\n- NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1: fits (both terminals)\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34: fits\n- NT47 \u2192 NT25 NT16: fits\n- NT34 \u2192 NT28 NT5: fits (5 is a terminal)\n- NT29 \u2192 NT28 NT48: fits\n- NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT48: fits (2 and 48 are terminals)\n- NT13 \u2192 NT17 NT39: Wait, looking back"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-184","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's in the language. Hmm, let's see how to approach this. I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, right?\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of NT rules and some terminal symbols. The string to check is `t13 t88 t6 t6 t72 t11 t2 t83 t55 t6 t33 t39`. So I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I think I should list out all the NT rules and see how they can be broken down into terminals. Let me see:\n\nNT rules are like S -> NT15 NT43, which probably means S starts with NT15 and NT43. Each NT could break down into more NTs or terminals.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string: t13, t88, t6, and so on. I need to see if these correspond to any NT productions.\n\nWait, for example, NT13 is in one of the rules. Let me check. Oh, NT13 \u2192 't39', according to the grammar. So t13 is the terminal 't39'? Or wait, no, in the grammar, NT13 is replaced by 't39'. So in the string, 't13' would correspond to NT13, which goes to 't39'. But wait, the string has 't13', 't88', etc. So each token in the string is a terminal symbol, so when building the parse tree, each token should match an NT rule that eventually produces it.\n\nWait, maybe I should work backward. The string is a sequence of terminals, so starting from S, each step should generate more terminals until we get the string. So S starts with NT15 and NT43.\n\nSo the string should begin with NT15 and NT43's corresponding terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT15 \u2192 't39'. So the first token in the string should be 't39', but the string starts with 't13', not 't39'. So that might not match. Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed in a way that each 't' is a terminal node generated by the grammar. So 't13' should be generated by some NT that eventually produces t13. Let me look back at the grammar.\n\nWait, looking for any NT that produces t13 as a terminal. Scanning through, I see NT23 \u2192 't7', NT13 \u2192 't39', NT19 \u2192 't13', etc. So for example, NT19 \u2192 't13'. So 't13' can be used as a node in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is 't13', so it should correspond to NT19 \u2192 t13. So that could be a possibility.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S. So S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first step would generate NT15 followed by NT43. So the string should start with the first terminal generated by NT15 and then the terminal from NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15: in the grammar, NT15 \u2192 't39' (looking for production rules where NT15 is on the left). Yes, the rule is `NT15 -> 't39'`. So the first symbol should be t39, but the string starts with t13. So that suggests a conflict.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the NT15 rule. Let me check again. There's a grammar rule where NT15 \u2192 't39' is listed, so yes, NT15 directly produces 't39'. So the first step would be NT15 \u2192 t39, followed by NT43.\n\nBut the string starts with t13. So unless there's a way for NT15 to produce a different terminal or perhaps a different parse path, but in this case, each NT is either directly terminal or breaks down into other NTs. So if the first NT in S is NT15, it must produce t39 as the first symbol, but the string starts with t13, which is another NT.\n\nWait, but the problem could be that I'm considering S as two NTs, but perhaps there's a way for the string to start with another NT that's downstream. Alternatively, maybe the start is in a different order. Wait, no, in the S rule, it's NT15 and NT43. So the production is ordered: S can only start with NT15 followed by NT43. So the first terminal must be from NT15, which is t39.\n\nBut the string starts with t13, which would require that the first terminal is from NT19, which produces t13. But that would mean that the start symbol S isn't producing NT15 and NT43 in this case. Maybe I've misread the grammar. Let me check the initial productions again.\n\nLooking back, the user provided the grammar with multiple NT rules, but I think I might have missed some. The initial part was:\n\nS -> NT15 NT43\n\nNT50 -> NT1 NT32\n\nNT36 -> NT42 NT48\n\nNT25 -> NT13 NT47\n\nNT24 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT32 -> NT25 NT46\n\nNT30 -> NT32 NT8\n\nNT20 -> NT30 NT24\n\nNT46 -> NT10 NT38\n\nNT35 -> NT37 NT37\n\nNT30 -> NT24 NT44\n\nNT43 -> NT27 NT0\n\nNT19 -> NT12 NT38\n\nNT0 -> NT30 NT20\n\nNT34 -> NT32 NT2\n\nNT37 -> NT17 NT45\n\nNT52 -> NT6 NT25\n\nNT19 -> NT51 NT19\n\nNT52 -> NT27 NT12\n\nNT9 -> NT52 NT4\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nNT27 -> NT8 NT17\n\nNT17 -> NT2 NT30\n\nNT49 -> NT47 NT27\n\nNT24 -> NT4 NT44 (wait, maybe I misread this earlier; perhaps I need to check all the NT rules again.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the NT rules because some are defined in a non-sequential way.

{"custom_id":"request-179","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string \"t38 t54 t18 t6 t16 t31 t33 t18 t6 t48 t6 t63\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which makes it a bit easier to handle with specific parsing techniques like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm not very familiar with CYK, I'll try to tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me try to write down the grammar without the comments because they seem to be literals. Wait, no, looking back, the comments like NT44 -> 't6' indicate that some non-terminals can produce terminal strings, which are literals. So, each production either produces a non-terminal or a terminal. For example, NT44 produces 't6', which is a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, the string we have is a sequence of terminals: t38, t54, t18, t6, t16, t31, t33, t18, t6, t48, t6, t63. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production for S is S -> NT15 NT43. So, S can expand into two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43.\n\nLet me think about what NT15 and NT43 produce. I'll need to trace the possible derivations.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that's an interesting production. It says NT15 can produce NT37 followed by NT15. That's a recursive production because NT15 appears again. So, NT15 can generate a string where NT15 is repeating, but in the terminal symbols, so it's not directly helpful. However, looking at the terminals, perhaps NT15 can derive a sequence that eventually terminates elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT43: NT43 has two productions: NT43 -> NT6 NT1 and NT43 -> NT55 NT24. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar for NT43 shows two options: NT43 -> NT6 NT1 and NT43 -> NT55 NT24? Wait, let me check the grammar again. Oh, I think I misread; looking back, NT43 is in two places: one is NT43 -> NT6 NT1, and also later, NT43 -> NT7 NT1 and NT43 -> NT36 NT48? Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, the grammar provided has:\n\nNT43 -> NT6 NT1\nNT43 -> NT55 NT24\n\nYes, so NT43 can expand into NT6 NT1 or NT55 NT24.\n\nSo, the string starts with t38. Let's see if any non-terminals can produce t38.\n\nLooking at NT45, which has a production NT45 -> 't11', but not NT38. Wait, no. Let me look through the rules for NT38.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, NT38 has a production: NT38 -> NT51 NT29.\n\nOh, but wait, NT38 also appears as the first symbol in the string. So, t38 must come from NT38. So, the first step is that NT15 must somehow produce NT38.\n\nWait, no, the string starts with t38, so the start symbol S must derive into a string that starts with t38. So, perhaps S -> NT15 NT43, and then NT15 produces something that leads to t38, and NT43 produces something that leads to t54, etc.\n\nBut maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me approach this more systematically.\n\nStarting with S, it can only go to NT15 NT43. So, the first two non-terminals in the derivation must come from NT15 and NT43.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t38. So, one of these non-terminals (either NT15 or NT43) must produce t38.\n\nLooking at NT15's productions: NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which can be thought of as repeating, but that would produce a sequence of NT37s and NT15s, which don't lead to terminals. So, unless there's a way for NT15 to derive a terminal, but maybe not. Wait, unless somehow the recursion leads to a terminal. Hmm, that might not work.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look for the production of NT15. Yes, NT15 is defined as NT37 NT15. That is, it's recursive, so NT15 can only produce strings starting with NT37 and then NT15. So, unless NT37 can eventually produce a terminal, which it can't directly, this might not be helpful.\n\nWait, let me check NT37. From the grammar, NT37 appears in multiple places: NT37 -> NT19 NT19, NT37 -> NT17 NT45, and NT37 is in NT28's production, etc. Wait, but looking for NT37 in the string, the string has t37 as part of the terminals, but in our case, the string starts with t38, so maybe that's not involved here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT43 can lead to t38. Let me check NT43's productions: NT43 -> NT6 NT1, and NT43 -> NT55 NT24.\n\nLooking at NT55, from the grammar: NT55 -> 't2'. So, if NT43 can go to NT55 NT24, and then NT55 is 't2' and NT24 can produce something else.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t38 comes t54. So, maybe the order is T38 followed by T54. Let me try to see if there's a non-terminal that can produce t38 and t54 as part of its expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production S -> NT15 NT43 leads to NT15 producing a sequence and NT43 producing another, which when combined, form the entire string.\n\nLet me consider the string structure: \"t38 t54 t18 t6 t16 t31 t33 t18 t6 t48 t6 t63\".\n\nSo, perhaps S -> NT15 NT43, and NT15 produces the first part and NT43 produces the latter part. Let me check if there's a way for NT15 to derive a series that leads to the initial 't38', and NT43 to produce the remainder.\n\nBut wait, looking at NT15's productions: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Without a base case that produces a terminal, NT15 can't derive a terminal string. Because each expansion replaces NT15 with NT37 NT15, which then must also expand, leading to infinite recursion. So, this suggests that NT15 can't produce any terminal string on its own. Therefore, the only way S can produce a terminal string is if the expansion of NT15 somehow leads to a terminal, but NT15's production doesn't have any terminal directly.\n\nWait, unless there's another path. Looking again, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look for any NT that can directly or indirectly produce a terminal from NT15. NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Then NT37 can produce things like NT19 NT19, which can lead to other NTs, but none of these produce terminals except for specific cases.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, NT26 -> 't12', NT27 -> 't6', etc. But NT19: Wait, looking at NT19's productions, I see NT19 -> NT51 NT19, NT51 -> NT50 NT20, etc. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT37: NT37 -> NT19 NT19, which doesn't produce a terminal. NT37 also has NT37 -> NT17 NT45. NT17: NT17 -> NT2 NT30, which then can expand further.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to consider if the entire string can be constructed step by step.\n\nWait, another approach: each symbol in the string is produced by a non-terminal. So, the first symbol is t38, produced by some non-terminal. Let's look for which NTs can produce t38.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals have terminals as their productions. For example, NT42 -> 't5', NT24 -> 't55' and others. Wait, looking for any production that leads to 't38'.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, I don't see any NT directly producing t38. Hmm, that's strange. Wait, maybe I missed it.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, the string we're checking must start with NT15 and NT43. Wait, but the string starts with t54, which is a terminal. So NT15 and NT43 would presumably expand to produce these terminals. \n\nLet's see what NT15 and NT43 produce. From the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Oh wait, but that loops on itself, so I think I made a mistake. Let me correct that: NT15 has a production NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait no, looking back, I think I misread. Wait, the grammar for NT15 is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That seems recursive, but perhaps it can derive into terminals later. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1, which ends in 't1', but in our string, we have t7 at the end, so maybe that's a problem. Wait, let's clarify.\n\nWait, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. From the rules, NT6 \u2192 't16', and NT1 \u2192 't24' or other terminals. Hmm, but in the string provided, the last token is t7. So maybe NT43 should produce t7. Let's check the grammar again. Oh, NT1 \u2192 NT51 NT38. NT51 \u2192 't90' which is a terminal, but looking at NT1's productions, there's NT1 \u2192 't24'. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, the string begins with t54, which must come from NT10. Because looking at the productions, NT10 \u2192 't50' or something else? Wait, let me check. NT10's productions include NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. Oh, wait, looking back, line 11: NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. So NT10 can produce nt50 nt30, but in our string, the first token is t54, not t50. Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I misread which symbols start with NT10. Wait, looking at the productions, line 12: NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10, which suggests NT10 produces t54? No, line 12 is NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10, so NT21 would produce two t54's? Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string backward, using the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can work by expanding the start symbol step by step and see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, since some non-terminals directly produce terminals, maybe it's better to see if each t in the string corresponds to the start symbol's expansions.\n\nWait, let me look at the string again: `t54 t67 t7 t83 t88 t6 t16 t39 t72 t33 t33 t16 t7`. So we have 13 tokens. Let's consider that it's T1 T2 ... T13.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT15 NT43, the first production would generate two non-terminals. So to get t54, maybe NT15 and NT43 must each produce certain terminals.\n\nWait, NT15 has production NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That's a left recursion, so perhaps we need to see if it can terminate. But looking at NT37's productions: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 and NT37 \u2192 't12'. So sometimes NT37 can produce 't12'. Similarly, NT19 can produce 't13' or 't19's. Hmm, but in our string, the last token is t7, which might be from NT15.\n\nAlternatively, let's see NT15's production. If NT15 goes to NT37 NT15, and NT37 can produce 't12' or via recursion, but how to get to t54?\n\nWait, maybe I should instead trace all the way from each 't' token back to S.\n\nAlternatively, considering that S starts with NT15 and NT43. So perhaps each token must be derivable from either NT15 or NT43.\n\nFor example, the first token is t54. Let's see NT10 can produce t54? Looking at NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, which might further split. Wait, let me check NT10's productions: line 10: NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. Then NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, and NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I can look for a way to derive each token step by step, starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that this grammar is a context-free one with all productions going to terminals or non-terminals that can quickly expand to terminals. Maybe the string can be split into components that each are generated by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's consider each token and see if they can be generated by NT15 or NT43.\n\nLooking at t7, which is the second last token. What does NT1 generate? NT15, NT6, etc. Wait, perhaps I should make a list of the possible non-terminals and their possible terminal expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's faster to see that the string has 't54', which, according to NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, and NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. NT6 \u2192 t16. NT1 \u2192 't24' or 't51' etc. Hmm, none of these produce t54.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check NT10: NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, and NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, which would expand NT43 to NT6 NT1, which then NT6 \u2192 t16 and NT1 \u2192 t24. So NT10 from that path would be t16 t24, which isn't t54.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different path. Wait, line 4: NT4 \u2192 NT26 NT2. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at all the terminals, the string includes t54, t67, t7, t83, t88, t6, t16, t39, t72, t33, t33, t16, t7.\n\nLooking at line 5: NT4 \u2192 't48'. So NT4 can derive t48, which is t48 in the string.\n\nNT11: NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37, and NT37 \u2192 't12' or 't19' \u2192 but in string, I don't see t12 or t19, so perhaps this isn't relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to work towards the start symbol. Let's take the string and see if it can be broken into elements derived from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string is T1 T2...T13, which would have to match the expansion of NT15 and NT43.\n\nSo let's see: suppose NT15 derives T1...T? and NT43 derives T???...T13.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps T1= t54, so that would have to come from either NT15 or NT43.\n\nBut NT15 expands via NT37 NT15. Let's see NT37 can expand to 't12' or 't19'.\n\nWait, but if NT37 is producing 't12', that would match t12. Let's see if any of the tokens in the string are t12. Looking, I don't see a t12. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT. Another option is that NT43 can derive something that starts with t7. From NT43, looking at line 8: NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. So NT43 expands to NT6 NT1. NT6 is 't16', NT1 is either 't24' or other options.\n\nWait, the last token is t7. So in that case, the last part of the expansion must be t7.

{"custom_id":"request-199","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string `t99 t6 t31 t63 t91 t31 t63 t18 t6 t16 t12 t12 t13` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It starts with S -> NT15 NT43. Then, there are a series of productions for different NT non-terminals leading to terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers. Some of the NT symbols have productions with other NT symbols, and some directly produce 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate has a sequence of these 't' terms with numerical suffixes. So, I should figure out which NT symbols produce which sequences and then see if the string can be generated starting from S.\n\nI notice that the first symbol in the string is t99. Looking at the grammar, let me check where t99 comes from. Scanning through the productions, I see NT21 -> t99. So, NT21 produces t99. So, the first part of the string is t99, which is generated by NT21.\n\nNow, looking at NT21's production, in the grammar I see NT21 -> NT10 NT10. Wait, but in the given string, the next term is t6, not NT productions. That seems confusing. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong productions. Let me look at the productions again. The string starts with t99, which comes from NT21. So, the first step would be S -> NT15 NT43, and then each of those needs to be expanded into the string.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t99, so let's see if t99 can be part of the string. But looking at the grammar, NT21 is t99, and NT21 has production NT10 NT10. But in the string, after t99 comes t6. So perhaps I'm mixing up the order.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider that each 't' term in the string must come from some terminal production in the grammar. So each of these t99, t6, t31, etc., must be a direct terminal production or a result of expanding NT symbols.\n\nLet's start from the top. S is the start symbol, so it's NT15 NT43. Now, each of these NTs must be expanded into the string.\n\nLooking at NT15: from the grammar, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that would mean it's recursive. Hmm, but that's not helpful immediately. Alternatively, is there any way NT15 leads directly to a terminal? From the given productions, I don't see NT15 directly producing a 't' term. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, NT15 is defined as NT37 NT15. So it's recursive. That might mean that NT15 can't produce a terminal directly, only through other productions. Hmm, but that complicates things.\n\nNow, the string starts with t99. So perhaps the expansion starts with S -> NT15 NT43, and each of these NTs expands into parts of the string. Alternatively, maybe S is expanded into components that directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, but given that NT15 and NT43 are the first symbols after S, maybe we need to see how they can produce parts of the string. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the possible sequences in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for each 't' in the string and see if it's directly produced by some NT. For example, t6 is produced by NT24. So, t6 would come from NT24.\n\nBut in the string, after t99 comes t6, and then t31. So let me try to see how that might unfold.\n\nS -> NT15 NT43\n\nAssume NT15 expands to t99 and something else, but wait, t99 is generated by NT21, so perhaps there's a chain of productions. Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nMaybe I should consider that each NT symbol in the grammar ultimately leads to a sequence of terminals. So perhaps I can map each NT to its possible expansions and see if the string can be constructed.\n\nLet me start by mapping each NT to its direct productions. For example, NT21 -> t99, so t99 must be part of the string if NT21 is used anywhere. Similarly, NT24 -> t6 and t5, but since the string has t6, that's possible.\n\nWait, looking at the string: t99 t6 t31 t63 t91 t31 t63 t18 t6 t16 t12 t12 t13.\n\nLet me list each of the terms and see which NT they come from:\n\n- t99: NT21\n- t6: NT24, NT10, etc.\n- t31: NT31\n- t63: NT26 (since NT26 -> t12, but I might have misread; wait, let me check. Wait, no, NT26 is from the grammar as NT26 -> NT24 NT34, not directly t63. Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, let me look at each 't' in the string and see if there's an NT that directly produces it.\n\nt99: NT21\nt6: NT24, or others? Let me check the grammar for 't6' production. Looking through, I see NT26 -> t12 is incorrect. Wait, looking at the grammar, there's NT26: NT26 -> NT24 NT34. Wait, that's not a terminal. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look through the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar has several 't' terms:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT24 -> t5\nNT21 -> t99\nNT23 -> t7\nNT13 -> t39 (Wait, but in the string, there's t13, which is NT13. So if NT13 is t13, then that would correspond to where?\n\nWait, hold on. The grammar has several 't' terms:\n\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT34 -> 't87'\n- NT26 -> 't12' but wait, that's not a terminal. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT44 -> 't6'\nNT55 isn't in the grammar as a terminal, but later on, there's NT24 -> t5, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a mapping of each NT to its possible 't' terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT24: can go to t5 or t24 or t48 or t44 or t18 or t55 (looking at the expansions in the grammar). So 't5' is a direct terminal.\n- NT26: Not a terminal, as it's only involved in other productions, but in the string, I see t12, which is part of NT21 -> t10 NT10? Wait, no, NT21 is t99.\n\nWait, let me list all the NTs that directly produce 't' terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT24 -> t5\n- NT44 -> t6\n- NT10 -> t50\n- NT10 -> t36\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15 (so not a terminal)\n- NT10 -> NT50 NT30\n- NT12 -> t16\n- NT21 -> t99\n- NT21 -> NT10 NT10\n- NT23 -> t7\n- NT26 -> t12\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT34\nWait, so NT26 can produce 't12' directly? Or is that a terminal? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar, NT26 is defined as NT24 NT34. So that's a production to NTs, not terminals. Then where does 't12' come from?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT27 -> t18, NT28 -> t6, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine all NT productions to see which ones directly produce 't' terms.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT24: has a production to 't5' directly.\n- NT44: to 't6'\n- NT10: a production to 't50' and 't36' (but these are 't' followed by numbers, which might be terminals)\nWait, perhaps the grammar goes further. Let me check.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar rules, some seem to have 't' followed by numbers.

Looking through the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all non-terminals on the left side produce two non-terminals on the right or a terminal.\n\nNext, I notice that the string is a sequence of terminals, and in CNF, these terminals must be derived from non-terminals through production rules. So, I'll need to map each terminal in the string back through the productions to see if they can be derived by the initial symbol S.\n\nThe initial symbol is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, S must first produce NT15 and NT43. Each of these can further produce other non-terminals until we reach terminal symbols, which will match the string.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string step by step, trying to see if each terminal can be matched by the productions.\n\nThe string is:\nt12 t54 t33 t11 t12 t12 t54 t13 t91 t83 t48 t6 t16 t37.\n\nLet's list them in order: t12, t54, t33, t11, t12, t12, t54, t13, t91, t83, t48, t6, t16, t37.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, NT15 and NT43 need to produce the respective sequences starting with t12 and t54.\n\nLooking at NT15: The productions involving NT15 include NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So, to get t12, I need to see if NT15 can produce t12.\n\nLet me check NT15's rules. It seems NT15 can produce NT37 NT15. I'll follow NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15.\n\nNow NT37 has two productions: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 and NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT17. So, each NT37 can split into two NT19s or an NT19 and NT17.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first terminal is t12, so let's see what NT15 can produce. From the rules, we see NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So, every time it expands, it produces another NT37. But we need to get to t12 eventually.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them. For example, t12 is one of the terminals. Looking through the rules, I see NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT13, and NT13 has NT13 \u2192 't69', but that's 't69', not 't12'. Alternatively, NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23, and NT26 can produce 't12'? Wait, let me check NT26.\n\nLooking at NT26's productions: NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34, and from there, NT24 can be 't5' or produce more non-terminals, and NT34 can produce 't87', etc. I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward path. Let's check if any NT can produce a given terminal directly. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30\n- NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48\n- NT13 \u2192 't39'\n- NT17 \u2192 't16'\n- NT18 \u2192 't24'\n- NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT13, and each NT13 can produce 't39', but that's not 't12'.\n- NT23 \u2192 't7'\n- NT24 \u2192 't5' directly\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34 \u2192 't5' and NT34 \u2192 't87', or further\n- NT28 \u2192 't48' directly\n- NT32 \u2192 't83' directly\n- NT36 \u2192 't84' directly\n- NT37 \u2192 't12' directly! Wait, looking back, yes, I see NT37 has a production NT37 \u2192 't12'. So, NT37 can directly produce t12.\n\nWait, in the rules, looking for 't12', I see NT37 has a production to 't12'. So NT37 \u2192 t12.\n\nSimilarly, let's find where each terminal occurs:\n\n- t12 can come from NT37\n- t54: looking through rules, NT19 \u2192 't54' (from NT19 \u2192 't54'), so if NT19 produces t54, that's one option\n- t33: from NT6 \u2192 't16', but not directly. Wait, NT17 \u2192 't33' because NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30, and NT2 \u2192 't41', NT30 \u2192 't30'? Wait, I need to check.\n\nWait, more accurately: NT17's productions include NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30, and also NT17 \u2192 't33' through another NT. Let me look. NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT45, but I'm looking for 't33'. Let me check NT's that produce 't33'. Wait, I don't see any NT directly producing 't33', so perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT37 \u2192 't12', NT19 \u2192 't54', but where is 't33'? Looking at the production rules, I see NT33 is not a non-terminal but rather NT17 \u2192 't33' from NT17's production. Wait, looking back, I see NT17 has a production NT17 \u2192 't33' as one of its rules. So, NT17 can directly produce t33.\n\nSo, to break down the string step by step:\n\nThe string is t12, t54, t33, t11, t12, t12, t54, t13, t91, t83, t48, t6, t16, t37.\n\nEach terminal must be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet's map each terminal:\n\n1. t12: must come from NT37 \u2192 't12'\n2. t54: must come from NT19 \u2192 't54'\n3. t33: must come from NT17 \u2192 't33'\n4. t11: Hmm, I don't see any NT directly producing 't11'. So, perhaps this is a problem. If t11 cannot be produced by any NT, then the string is invalid.\n\nWait a minute, let me check for 't11'. Looking through all the rules, I see that NT6 \u2192 't16', NT17 \u2192 't33', NT37 \u2192 't12', but I don't see any NT producing 't11'. For example, checking NT28: NT28 \u2192 't48' and other combinations. Wait, is there any NT that can produce 't11'? Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT producing 't11'. So, if the string has a t11, that would make it invalid because there's no production rule for NT to produce 't11'. \n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed it.

The string is `t33 t11 t54 t54 t12 t54 t87 t12 t12 t6 t16 t31 t31 t36` and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or A \u2192 \u03b5. This makes parsing and analysis a bit easier because each step in the derivation only introduces two symbols at a time.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it starts with the start symbol S and the rules seem interconnected. Some non-terminals have multiple productions, like NT20 and NT24, each with several options. The string provided is a sequence of terminal symbols (all the 't' followed by a number), so the goal is to see if S can derive this string through a series of rule applications.\n\nI think I should start by writing down the grammar's production rules in their right-hand side form to make it clearer. Each line seems to be a production, but some are left empty or not in CNF, so I need to adjust them accordingly.

The string is `t16 t38 t36 t83 t72 t33 t72 t33 t33 t18 t6 t55 t6 t88 t6`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal (like S, NT15, NT50, etc.) can be broken down directly into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string starts with t16, which I see in the productions: NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30, NT49 \u2192 NT47 NT27, NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT44, etc. So looking for where 't16' appears as a terminal, I find it in NT17 \u2192 't16' and other places like NT15 \u2192 't69' isn't 't16', so maybe NT17 is relevant here.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t16. So in the grammar, which non-terminal directly produces t16? Looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't16'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT16 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo either NT17, NT4, or NT16 can produce t16. Since the string starts with t16, perhaps the initial non-terminal S expands to something that includes t16.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So to produce the string, S would need to generate a sequence that starts with NT15 and NT43. Each of these is a non-terminal that can expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, perhaps using a top-down approach.\n\nThe first symbol is t16. So the parser would have to derive t16 from some non-terminal. Looking at the possible productions, one way is to have NT17 \u2192 't16'. So perhaps one branch is S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and NT15 might produce some sequence, then NT43 might produce another.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the whole string can be broken down starting from S.\n\nThe given string is t16 t38 t36 t83 t72 t33 t72 t33 t33 t18 t6 t55 t6 t88 t6.\n\nLet me see how to split this into possible non-terminals.\n\nLooking for 't' symbols: each is a terminal. So each t* comes from a production rule where a non-terminal expands into a terminal. So I can try to find a derivation tree where the initial S splits into two non-terminals, each expanding into a terminal sequence.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces exactly two non-terminals, and terminals are leaves. So the string can be seen as a combination of terminals, each derived from a production with two non-terminals.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t16. So one possible approach is that the first non-terminal in S's expansion is something that produces t16, like NT17. But let's check whether S \u2192 NT15 NT43 is compatible with the rest.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be split into two parts, each derived from NT15 and NT43 respectively.\n\nLet me look at NT15 and NT43 expansions.\n\nFirst, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's recursive. Let's see: NT15's production is NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, and that's not helpful. Wait, looking at NT15, from the given productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, each NT is defined as two parts. Let me check:\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17\n- NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30\n- NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29\n- NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20\n- NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43\n- NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n\nWait, I might be complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps we can parse the string by finding matching non-terminals.\n\nGiven the string: t16 t38 t36 t83 t72 t33 t72 t33 t33 t18 t6 t55 t6 t88 t6.\n\nLet me try to break it down, starting from the beginning.\n\nt16: as above, comes from NT17 \u2192 t16.\n\nSo perhaps the first part is NT17, which produces t16.\n\nBut wait, S is NT15 and NT43. So maybe NT15 is involved in the first part. Maybe I should look downstream.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of symbols. The string has 15 symbols. Since each production in the grammar splits into two non-terminals until we get to terminals, the number of symbols should correspond to the parse tree depth. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can match the string step by step.\n\nFirst symbol: t16. It comes from NT17, so in the first expansion, one of the NT terms must be NT17, which goes to t16.\n\nBut wait, S is NT15 and NT43. Maybe one of them is NT17? Looking at the given productions:\n\nNo, the non-terminals are named NT1, NT4, NT5, etc. So maybe it's impossible for NT15 to produce t16. Therefore, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe NT15 produces a sequence that includes t16, but perhaps that's through multiple steps. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built by the NT15 producing a sequence including t16, and NT43 another sequence.\n\nWait, let me check the possible productions for NT15. The problem description shows:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nAnd also NT15 -> NT34 NT2. So NT15 can expand to either NT37 NT15 or NT34 NT2.\n\nLooking further, NT34 is -> NT32 NT5, and NT2 is -> NT41 NT32.\n\nWait, this seems to be getting too deep. Maybe it's better to look for how t16 can be produced in the grammar.\n\nLooking again, NT17 \u2192 't16', as per the productions under NT17.\n\nSo 't16' can come from NT17.\n\nBut in the initial S, S is NT15 and NT43. So either NT15 or NT43 must expand into something that can produce t16.\n\nLooking at NT15's productions:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15 or NT34 NT2.\n\nHmm, neither of those directly produce t16.\n\nWait, maybe through multiple steps. Let's see:\n\nTake NT15 \u2192 NT34 NT2.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT32 NT5.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47.\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT25 NT16.\n\nWait, that's getting somewhere. NT47 \u2192 NT25 NT16. So if I have NT47, it can produce NT25 and 't16'.\n\nBut wait, according to the productions:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47.\n\nSo, if NT25 is used, it splits into NT13 and NT47. Then NT47 can split into NT25 and 't16'.\n\nThis seems recursive and not leading anywhere. Maybe this path is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by seeing where 't16' occurs in the string and working backwards to see if it comes from a production.\n\nThe first symbol is 't16', which comes from NT17. Let me check if any non-terminal in S's expansion can produce 't16'.\n\nWait, since S is NT15 and NT43, perhaps one of these is responsible for 't16', but neither is directly producing 't16'. So maybe 't16' comes from a lower expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps NT17 is produced by NT15 or another path.\n\nWait, looking back: NT15 is defined as NT37 NT15 or NT34 NT2.

The string to evaluate is `t99 t6 t13 t38 t36 t83 t72 t11 t7 t83 t83 t72 t33 t16 t37`, and the grammar is provided with a bunch of productions.\n\nFirst, I should remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So I can look through the given grammar to confirm that it's in CNF. Looking at the productions, they all seem to be in the correct form\u2014each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions step by step. Since the grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals, I might need to trace back from the string to see if each terminal can be generated by some production.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: `t99, t6, t13, t38, t36, t83, t72, t11, t7, t83, t83, t72, t33, t16, t37`.\n\nI'll start by looking for any non-terminals that directly produce these terminals. Let's go through each terminal in the string and see where they can come from.\n\n1. **t99**: Looking for A \u2192 t99. Scanning the grammar, I see:\n   - NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n   - NT28 \u2192 NT21 NT12 (Wait, NT28 is used earlier, but in the string, it's not directly in the right place. Maybe not.)\n   - Not finding a production for t99 directly from a non-terminal. Hmm, wait. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n   \n   Oh wait, looking again, under NT28: \"NT28 -> NT26 NT23\" and \"NT26 -> NT24 NT34\", etc. I don't see any production that directly produces t99. Did I miss something? Let me check the grammar again thoroughly.\n\nLooking through the productions, the only terminal symbols I see are specific ones like t5, t7, t8, t13, t16, etc. I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly produces t99. That could be a problem because if I can't derive t99 from any non-terminal, then the string can't be generated by this grammar. But let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed any.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through all the non-terminals to see if any have a production with t99 on the RHS. Scanning the list:\n\n- NT21: NT10 NT10\n- NT28: NT26 NT23, NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34, NT34 \u2192 NT28 NT5, etc. But none of these produce t99 directly.\n\nHmm, so if there's no production that allows a non-terminal to derive t99, then the string can't be generated. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine all the productions.\n\nWait, looking at the productions under NT44 and others, I see NT44 \u2192 't6' and NT6 \u2192 't16', but nothing for t99. So, unless I'm missing a production, I can't derive t99.\n\nBut that seems odd because the string starts with t99. Maybe I should check if I misread the grammar. Let me look again at the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, under NT28: \"NT28 -> NT26 NT23\" and \"NT28 -> NT10 NT13\". So if NT28 can be derived from other non-terminals, maybe I can substitute that. But without a production that gives a terminal, like NT28 \u2192 t99, I can't get t99.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm supposed to break down each word into symbols. Let me try to parse the string as a series of symbols and see if each can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlso, maybe the string is built by applying the productions multiple times. Let's think about how t99 could come about. Since in the given grammar, t99 isn't directly produced by any non-terminal, that would mean that t99 can't be part of the language generated by this grammar. Therefore, the string contains t99, which isn't possible, so the answer must be No.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I didn't miss any production. Let me scan all the non-terminals for a production that ends with t99. Scanning all the rules:\n\nLooking through the entire list of productions, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces t99. So yes, that's a dead end.

Let's take this step by step. First, I'll try to understand the grammar structure and then see how the string can be matched against it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and from the rules, S ultimately breaks down into NT15 and NT43, which in turn are made up of other non-terminals and eventually terminals.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t33 t67 t16 t31 t36 t18 t6 t16 t38 t24 t83 t83 t72 t33 t55 t36`. \n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into its components.

Let's start by looking at the structure of S.\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S is a combination of NT15 and NT43. Each of these will need to be expanded further.\n\nLet's check what NT15 and NT43 produce. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Hmm, this is recursive. It seems like NT15 is an infinite loop unless it's broken down into a terminal symbol.

Maybe I should look for the start of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t33, t67, t16, etc. Let me see what terminals are produced by each non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the production rules, there are several terminal symbols assigned to various non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't65'\n- NT41 \u2192 't3'\n- NT52 \u2192 't44'\n- NT19 \u2192 't13'\n- NT37 \u2192 't12'\n- NT6 \u2192 't17'\n- NT7 \u2192 't35'\n- NT8 \u2192 't40' etc.\n\nWait, but for the string to match, the entire sequence has to be produced by the grammar. Let me try to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT15 NT43. So the derivation starts with NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two elements are t33 and t67. Let me see what might produce these.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't33'? Wait, is there a rule where NT33 produces 't33'? Let me check. Scanning through the production rules, I don't see NT33 \u2192 t33. But wait, maybe it's derived from a combination. For example, NT15 could produce t33 if it's broken down correctly.\n\nWait, the rule NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT15 doesn't directly produce a terminal yet. It needs to be expanded further. Let's look at NT37. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38. Let me see NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10. NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43.

From the rules:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't65', so t65 is produced by NT40, but t33 is elsewhere.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t33.

Wait, but the string doesn't have t39. Or does it? Wait, the string does have t33, t67, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT6 produces t17 eventually, but let's think about the string.\n\nThe second element is t67. Looking for terminals:\n\nLooking through rules, NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT13 \u2192 't39', NT52 \u2192 't44', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the whole string is a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be built by concatenation of various productions.\n\nAnother approach is to write down a parse tree for the string. Let's see.\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nAssume that NT15 and NT43 each expand into some sequence.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps the first part is NT15 expanding into t33 and t67, and NT43 into the rest.\n\nWait, in the string, t33 is followed by t67, then t16, etc. So S would be t33 t67, but S is NT15 NT43, so each NT corresponds to a part of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT15 NT43 is t33 t67, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT15 \u2192 t33 and NT43 \u2192 t67, but NT15 is supposed to produce NT37 and itself, so that might not directly yield t33.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the production of t33. Are there any non-terminals that produce t33? Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal whose production is directly 't33'. So maybe t33 is produced by a combination of non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the rules, some non-terminals produce multiple symbols. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That's two non-terminals.

Let me start by understanding the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each production has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll note the start symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT43. Each production here uses non-terminals, but some have terminals as well. The string given consists of terminals separated by spaces, so I'll ignore the spaces and list them as a sequence: t33, t67, t2, t83, t6, t90, t36, t91, t6, t18, t54, t83, t72, t33, t16, t24.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, I can apply a recursive descent or a shift-reduce parsing strategy. But given the complexity, I might try to break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT15 NT43. This means the start string should be the concatenation of the two sequences generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nLet me look at NT15 and NT43. From the production rules:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's NT15 producing NT37 and then NT15 again. That seems like a recursive rule. It would expand infinitely unless another rule terminates it. Looking at the production rules, NT15 also has NT19 NT30. So, it can expand into NT19 and NT30. So, NT15 might generate something like NT19 followed by NT30, but NT15 itself can keep producing more NT15, which would complicate things. Maybe I should look at NT37 and NT30 to see how they expand.\n\nWait, NT37 is a known terminal. Let me check the rules. The grammar has NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 as a production, and it also appears in NT1 \u2192 NT51 NT19 and other places. But in the given rules, NT37 has two productions: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 and NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 again? Wait, actually, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n\nHmm, maybe both are same. So, NT37 always generates t19 t19.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all the ones listed from NT15 to NT52 and the start symbol.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' number corresponds to a specific production. For example, 't44' comes from NT44, 't6' from NT44, and so on.\n\nI'll need to see if the entire string can be derived by starting from S using the productions.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string in order:\nt16, t90, t36, t55, t6, t16, t33, t67, t33, t11, t99, t6, t13, t31, t67, t6, t13.\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific NT productions. Let's note which NT each 't' comes from:\nt13: NT13 (since NT13 \u2192 't39' but in the string it's t13? Wait, no. Actually, the string has t16, t90, etc. Maybe I should cross-reference each 'tN' with the NT rules to see which production leads to them.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S is two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43. Each of these will need to produce two terminal symbols.\n\nSo I'll need to check if NT15 can produce t16 t90... Wait, no. Let me get the productions correctly.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That seems recursive because NT15 also leads to NT37 and itself. That's an issue because it would create an infinite loop unless another rule can terminate it.\n- Also, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which means production for NT15 is either this recursive one or... Wait, let me check all the NT15 rules.\n\nLooking back, NT15's rules are:\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\nAnd wait, I don't see any other rules for NT15 except that recursive one. So NT15 would have to derive another NT37 and another NT15, but no one ever terminates it. That's a problem. But perhaps I missed another rule. Looking through all the NTX rules, I don't see any other productions for NT15 besides NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 and NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 is the same? Wait, no, in the given rules, I don't see NT15 having any other rule.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the rules. Let me check again:\n\nWait, looking at NT15, the only productions listed are NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Is that correct? If that's the case, then NT15 can't produce any terminal symbols except perhaps through the recursive process. But in this case, it seems stuck because there's no rule for NT37 leading to a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, do any of the NT37 rules produce a 't' number? Let's see:\n\nLooking for 't' in NT37's rules: Yes, NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45 and NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. None of these are 't's. Wait, but in the string, there are 't13', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm looking for the reverse: each terminal in the string corresponds to a specific NT. So for each 't16', it comes from NT27 because NT27 \u2192 't16'.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Each 'tN' corresponds to a production in the grammar where the non-terminal NTx has a rule that produces 'tN'.\n\nSo for example, t16 comes from NT27 because NT27 \u2192 't16'.\n\nSimilarly:\nt90 comes from NT51 because NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20, and NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, etc., but in the given string, t90 is a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps each 'tN' in the string comes from a particular non-terminal NTx where the production rules for NTx include 'tN'. So the string is a concatenation of 'tN's, each potentially from different NTs.\n\nBut the problem is that the grammar is in CNF, so each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Thus, the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which is the result of a production rule.\n\nSo to check if the string is derived from S, we can try to parse it step by step using the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string should be derived from NT15 and NT43. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, the string starts with t16 t90 t36 t55 t6 etc. So the first part is t16 t90. If S produces NT15 NT43, then the first two symbols should be derived from NT15 and NT43.\n\nBut let's look at what NT15 and NT43 produce.\n\nFrom the rules, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (recursive). So NT15 will produce a sequence that starts with NT37. But NT37's rules are NT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45 and NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. Neither of these produce a terminal. So NT15 can't produce a terminal. That's a problem because the string starts with t16, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, this suggests that the string cannot be derived because S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and NT15's productions don't lead to terminals. Therefore, the starting symbols of the string, t16 and t90, cannot be derived from NT15 and NT43 respectively.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first two symbols must be NT15 and NT43 productions. But as NT15 can't produce a terminal, the first symbol t16 can't be derived. Thus, the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT's could produce terminals through other rules, but looking at NT15's rules, it's stuck in a loop. Therefore, the entire string cannot be generated because the first symbols can't be produced.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t16, which is 't16', so I need to see if any non-terminal leads to 't16'. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't16' (from the provided rules: NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT16 \u2192 't16'?

{"custom_id":"request-283","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem to solve where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to represent context-free grammars where each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This form is useful because many algorithms, like the CYK parser, rely on it.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems to have many non-terminals (like S, NT15, NT50, etc.) and several terminal symbols (like 't54', 't13', etc.). My goal is to check if the string `t54 t13 t33 t11 t54 t13 t54 t67 t7 t83 t6 t38 t36 t91 t6 t16 t37` can be generated by this grammar.\n\nI'll start by noting that in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So, to generate the string, each token must either be a terminal symbol directly, or it must be the result of combining the results of two non-terminals. \n\nLet me look at the string and list all the terminal symbols present: t54, t13, t33, t11, t54, t13, t54, t67, t7, t83, t6, t38, t36, t91, t6, t16, t37. \n\nNow, the grammar only has non-terminals, and the production rules are such that each non-terminal either produces a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So, the first step is to parse the string and see if each terminal can be matched step by step using the starting non-terminal S.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, the first two symbols of the string should come from NT15 and NT43. But the first terminal is t54, which is part of NT51, etc. Wait, I need to check if NT15 and NT43 can produce the initial part of the string.\n\nLooking at NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Hmm, this seems recursive because NT15 appears on both sides. That suggests that NT15 might eventually produce a terminal, but I need to see how. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. So NT43 can eventually produce t6 and t1. The first part of the string starts with t54, which isn't directly produced by S, so let me see if S can produce t54.\n\nWait, no, S produces two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43. The first terminal is t54, so the first part must come from either NT15 or NT43. Let me look at NT15's productions. It seems that NT15 can only go to NT37 NT15, which is recursive. That might not directly produce a terminal. On the other hand, NT43 has a production NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1, which produces t6 and t1. But the first token is t54, so maybe NT15 is producing t54 somehow. Wait, looking further, there's a NT43 production that leads to t1, but the first token is t54, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the non-terminals can directly produce t54. Looking through the rules, for example, NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32, and that doesn't produce t54. Let me check if any non-terminals directly produce t54. Looking back, I see that NT6 \u2192 t16, NT7 \u2192 t35, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that S produces NT15 and NT43. Let's see what NT15 can generate. NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 is recursive, so perhaps it doesn't produce a terminal directly. However, maybe NT15 eventually can produce a terminal through a series of productions. Similarly, NT43 produces NT6 and NT1, which then produce t16 and t1 respectively.\n\nBut the first token is t54, which suggests that either NT15 or NT43 must produce a terminal starting with t54. Looking at the possible productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t54. For example, NT50 produces t33, NT42 produces t5, but t54 isn't directly produced by any of the non-terminals in the initial productions.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and neither NT15 nor NT43 produce t54 directly or through any of their productions. Let me check this. Looking through all the rules, does any non-terminal directly produce t54? I don't see any such production. The closest is NT16 \u2192 t3, but that's not helpful.\n\nSo, if S can't produce t54 because neither NT15 nor NT43 can generate t54, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe through a chain of productions, NT15 or NT43 can produce t54. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. If NT37 can produce some non-terminals that eventually lead to t54, then maybe. But looking at NT37's productions, like NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, and then NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, and so on. I don't see t54 in any of those. Let me check NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, and NT19's production is NT12 NT52. NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48, etc. Doesn't seem like we get to t54.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1, which leads to t16 and t1, which doesn't include t54. So, indeed, neither side can produce t54. Therefore, the string starting with t54 is impossible, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal expands into either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is composed entirely of terminals (like t16, t90, etc.), the grammar must derive this string from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals into terminals.\n\nThe given string has 18 tokens. Since each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals, the number of steps needed to derive the string from S will be 17 (because each step can potentially add one token, but often more complex). However, with CNF, each production either contributes one terminal or two non-terminals, so the number of symbols in the derivation tree will be 2n-1 for a string of length n.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the string has length 18, the derivation must consist of 18 terminal symbols, and since each production can only add one terminal or two non-terminals, the number of steps is tricky. Each step can increase the count by one or two, depending on the production. So for a string of length k, the derivation might need to have k-1 productions, but that's getting complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this by trying to reconstruct the parse tree or look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be matched by the productions. Let me look for any terminal sequences that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some productions where terminals are directly produced. For example:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 t39\n- NT24 \u2192 t5 (produces t5)\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT38 \u2192 t38\n- NT45 \u2192 t11\n- NT52 \u2192 t44\n- NT28 \u2192 t67\n- NT48 \u2192 t87\n- NT0 \u2192 t39\n\nWait, so for a terminal like t5 to appear in the string, the non-terminal must be NT24. Similarly, t6 comes from NT27, and so on.\n\nNow, let's map each token in the string to the possible non-terminals that can produce it:\n\n- t16: Looking through the productions, is there a NT that produces t16? Looking at the productions, I see NT17 \u2192 t33, NT19 \u2192 t54, NT24 \u2192 t5, NT27 \u2192 t6, etc. Wait, I don't see a direct production for t16. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are for NT27, NT48, NT0, NT44, etc., each producing specific tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I've missed some. Let me list all terminal produce rules:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT17 \u2192 t33\n- NT19 \u2192 t54, t51 (from the grammar, I see NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 and NT19 \u2192 t13)\n- NT52 \u2192 t44\n- NT44 \u2192 t6\n- NT42 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t69\n- NT28 \u2192 t67\n- NT48 \u2192 t87\n- NT0 \u2192 t39\n- NT8 \u2192 t46, t40 (from NT8: NT9 is t4, etc.? Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT5 -> t2 (from NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43 and others)\n- NT24 \u2192 t5, t18, t55\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT48 \u2192 t15, t21, t42, t44, t48, etc.\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to check each terminal in the string and see if any production rules produce them.\n\nSo the string is `t16 t90 t36 t31 t13 t54 t16 t90 t63 t33 t11 t13 t18 t6 t72 t33 t33 t39`.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- t16: Is there a production that produces t16? Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see a production for t16. Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, no production directly produces t16 from a non-terminal. Let me check again. For example, in the list above, NT24 produces t5, t18, etc., but I don't see t16 being a direct production.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any non-terminal can derive t16. Looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t16. So if the string contains t16, then the grammar must generate it through some combination of non-terminals. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules, is there any non-terminal that may produce t16 indirectly? For example, is t16 part of a longer string that can come from the grammar?\n\nWait, maybe t16 is part of a longer production. For example, in some NT's production. Let me check NT16: wait, I don't see a line like NT16 \u2192 something. But in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n- NT16 \u2192 NT37 \u2192 but in more detailed lines, I see:\nWait, I have to check all the productions. For example:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t33\n- NT18 isn't directly a terminal. Let me check all the productions for each non-terminal and see if t16 is even a possibility.\n\nWait, going through the entire list of grammar productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT24 \u2192 t5, t18, t55\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT48 \u2192 t48... Wait, no. NT48 \u2192 t15, t21, t42, t44, t48, etc. No t16 here.\n\nLooking again, I don't see any production that directly or indirectly can produce t16. So t16 must be part of the string, but the grammar doesn't have any rule that can generate it, meaning the entire string cannot be derived from S, because the start symbol must produce t16, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I've overlooked something. Let me check each production line again systematically.\n\nLooking through each production line:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT15 NT15: Both NT15's need to be checked for producing t16.\n2.

CNF is useful because it simplifies certain parsing algorithms and can be directly translated into LR(1) parsers without lookaheads.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that the start symbol is S, which initially produces NT15 NT43. So, the first part of the string should be built from NT15 and NT43.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into components corresponding to each production:\n\nStart with S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nThe string starts with \"t13 t13 t31...\", so I'm thinking that NT15 and NT43 must eventually produce sequences that can generate these tokens.\n\nLet me look at the productions for NT15. From the grammar, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Since NT15 has a recursive production, it suggests that the expansion of NT15 might involve a cycle of rules. However, I should see if the terminals can eventually be generated.\n\nLooking at NT37: NT37 -> NT17 NT45. So, NT37 needs to break down into NT17 and NT45.\n\nNT17 -> NT2 NT30. So, NT17 expands into NT2 and NT30. NT2 is another non-terminal.\n\nNT2 -> NT41 NT32. So, NT2 again is recursive, involving NT41 and NT32.\n\nNT41 -> NT7 NT31. So, NT41 expands into NT7 and NT31.\n\nLooking at the string, one of the tokens is t31. So, NT31 must be a terminal. In the grammar, NT31 is not listed as a non-terminal; perhaps it's a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT31 as a non-terminal. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, wait, in the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions are either other non-terminals or terminals. So, if NT31 has a rule that terminates, it's a terminal. But looking through the productions, I don't see NT31 on the right-hand side as a non-terminal, which probably means it's a terminal. So when NT31 is present in the production, it must directly produce 't31' or something else. Wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals are mapped to terminals. For example, NT44 -> 't6', meaning that when NT44 is expanded, it becomes the terminal 't6'. Similarly, some other NTs like NT52 -> 't44', etc.\n\nWait, but for NT31, I don't see any production rules where NT31 is on the left and a terminal on the right. That would mean NT31 is a non-terminal and must have further expansions. But the grammar given doesn't define NT31 as a non-terminal, so maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals are mapped directly to terminals:\n\nNT44 -> 't6', NT42 -> 't5', NT13 -> 't39', etc. So, for example, when a production rule has '...' -> NTx NTy ..., the NTx and NTy must be expanded further. If they eventually reach a point where a non-terminal is mapped to a terminal, like NT52 -> 't44', that's how terminals are introduced.\n\nBut in the case of NT31, none of the rules seem to have a terminal as the result, which would mean that NT31 must be a terminal symbol. However, that's not common in most grammars unless specifically defined. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the productions.\n\nWait, looking at the productions again:\n\nI see:\n\nNT23 -> NT2 NT50\n\nNT50 -> NT41 NT43\n\nNT44 -> 't6'\n\nNT42 -> 't5'\n\nNT13 -> 't39'\n\nNT28 -> 't67'\n\nNT0 -> 't39'\n\nNT40 -> 't65'\n\nNT46 -> 't72'\n\nNT32 -> 't83'\n\nNT24 -> 't18'\n\nNT24 -> 't55'\n\nNT5 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't48'\n\nNT29 -> 't63'\n\nNT4 -> 't88'\n\nNT9 -> 't28'\n\nNT50 -> 't33'\n\nNT12 -> 't16'\n\nNT51 -> 't90'\n\nNT48 -> 't87'\n\nNT1 -> 't24'\n\nNT34 -> 't87'\n\nNT36 -> 't84'\n\nNT21 -> 't99'\n\nNT45 -> 't11'\n\nNT19 -> 't13'\n\nNT37 -> 't12'\n\nNT51 -> 't38'\n\nNT6 -> 't16'\n\nNT17 -> 't33'\n\nNT19 -> 't54'\n\nNT31 -> 't91'\n\nSo, the mappings are as such: certain non-terminals correspond to specific terminals. So, when a production has a terminal on the right, the non-terminals on the left must be able to expand to that terminal through some path.\n\nLooking at NT15 and NT43: \n\nS -> NT15 NT43\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nNT43 -> NT6 NT1\n\nSo, NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals that can be recursively expanded.

{"custom_id":"request-326","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, and the grammar consists of a bunch of production rules starting from S. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF requires that each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, except for some that have two terminals. Wait, actually, some rules have two terminals, like NT15 -> NT37 NT15 or NT28 -> NT0 NT13. Hmm, but wait, that's not right because in CNF, terminals are only on the right side as single symbols, not multiple. So maybe those rules are incorrect or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking more closely, I see rules like NT52 -> 't44' and similar, which are terminals. So perhaps the grammar includes terminals, meaning it's in extended CNF rather than the strict form. Or maybe it's a mix, but the key point is that all productions are either non-terminals expanding to two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. So it's allowed, as extended CNF allows terminals on the right side.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user says the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. So perhaps I should assume that all rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. But looking at the given rules, many have two terminals on the right side. For example, NT52 -> 't44' is a terminal, but I also see rules like S -> NT15 NT15, which fit CNF as both are non-terminals. So perhaps some productions have terminals, which might be allowed in CNF as extended versions. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the grammar allows some terminal symbols on the right side.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string `t54 t13 t54 t88 t6 t6 t16 t69 t39 t69 t69 t72 t33 t33 t16 t3 t3 t3 t2` and see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the standard way to approach this is to use a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is given in CNF, perhaps a recursive descent approach would be feasible. Alternatively, since the string is relatively short (20 symbols), maybe constructing a parse tree step by step is manageable.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, which has 52 non-terminals and a lot of production rules, manually building a parse tree would be quite time-consuming. So perhaps I can find a way to see if the string can indeed be generated by following the rules step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, S. The initial rule is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first two symbols generated must come from NT15 and NT43. Let's look at the string:\n\nThe string starts with 't54 t13 t54 ...', so the first part is t54. But according to the rules, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 or NT15 \u2192 NT19 NT30. Both of these produce NTs, not t's directly. So perhaps t54 comes from a later expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about how t54 is generated. Let's look for NTs that produce t54. Looking through the rules, I see NT19 -> t13, but that's just a single terminal. Looking further, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't54'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, in the rules, I see NT19 -> t13 and NT19 -> NT51 NT19. Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing t54. Let me check again: looking at the rules, every production either has two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or two terminals? Wait, some rules have two terminals, like NT2 -> NT41 NT32, which are non-terminals, or NT52 -> 't44', which is a terminal. But others have two terminals on the right, such as NT34 -> 't28' NT2. Wait, in that case, the production would produce 't28' followed by NT2, which is fine.\n\nWait a minute, actually, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't54'. So perhaps 't54' is part of a larger expansion, or maybe there's a mistake in the string. Because in the given rules, the terminals are things like t2, t4, t5, etc., but there's no 't54' directly as a result of any NT.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the rules more carefully. Let me go through each rule and see if any non-terminal directly relates to 't54'. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT19 -> NT51 NT19\nNT51 -> NT50 NT20\nNT50 -> NT41 NT43\nNT43 -> NT6 NT1\nNT6 -> NT48 NT17\nNT48 -> NT44 NT27\nNT44 -> 't6'\nNT47 -> 't33' and so on.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps t54 is not directly generated from a single NT, but through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the terminals. Let me list the possible terminals from the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals include: t2, t4, t5, t6, t7, t13, t16, t17, t24, t27, t28, t32, t33, t35, t36, t37, t38, t39, t40, t41, t42, t43, t44, t45, t46, t47, t48, t50, t51, t52, t69, t72, t83, t87, etc. So, t54 isn't listed as a terminal in any of the rules. That's a problem because the string has 't54', but according to the grammar, no NT produces 't54'. So that immediately suggests that the string is not generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a terminal that is 't54'. Let me go through all the rules again to check if any NT produces 't54'. I'll list all the rule right-hand sides and see if any is just 't54'. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any that produce 't54' directly or indirectly. For example, NT19 produces 't13', NT51 produces 't44', which is t44. So t54 doesn't appear as a terminal in the rules.\n\nTherefore, the presence of 't54' in the string means that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because there's no NT that can produce 't54'. So the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-343","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t12 t13 t13 t13 t38 t54 t12 t33 t67 t90 t99 t6 t16 t24`, and the grammar is a set of production rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of writing context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, all the production rules in the given grammar should conform to this.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and either has two non-terminals on the right or is directly associated with a terminal. So, it's already in CNF, which is good because it simplifies certain parsing techniques, but not sure if that's directly relevant here.\n\nThe task is to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which maps to NT15 and NT43 (S \u2192 NT15 NT43). So, the string must be broken into parts that match the sequences generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nThe string consists of a series of tokens: t12, t13, t38, etc. These look like terminal symbols, so they must be generated directly by the grammar's rules or via some chain of non-terminals that produce them.\n\nI think the approach should be to parse the string step by step, starting from S, and see if each part can be generated correctly. Let me break down the string:\n\nThe string is: t12 t13 t13 t13 t38 t54 t12 t33 t67 t90 t99 t6 t16 t24\n\nSo, we need to see if this string can be generated by S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and each part must be matched by the sequences generated by NT15 and NT43 respectively.\n\nLooking at NT15 and NT43 in the grammar:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\nNT15 can also go to 't69'\n\nWait, NT15 is a recursive non-terminal. It has a production where it goes to NT37 NT15, which suggests that it's a kind of loop. Also, NT15 has another production: NT15 \u2192 NT15 NT37. Hmm, no, wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nand another rule:\nNT15 -> NT19 NT15\nAlso, NT15 can produce 't69'? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n\nWait, no. Let me go through the rules again step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I miss some rules. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the given rules, for NT15, the rule is:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n\nAnd for NT37, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n\nWait, did I miss a production for NT15 that produces a terminal? Let me look again through the rules.\n\nAfter checking all the rules, I don't immediately see a production where NT15 directly goes to a terminal, except perhaps in the case where I may have missed it.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, in the rules:\n\nAt the bottom, I see:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nand also:\nNT15 -> NT19 NT15\n\nSo, it seems that NT15 only has those two rules, both involving other non-terminals and itself. That would mean that starting with NT15, we can't derive a terminal; it's an infinite recursion. So perhaps NT15 doesn't produce any terminal, which complicates things.\n\nWait, but maybe I've missed a production for NT15. Let me recount:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n\nNo other production for NT15. So, that would mean NT15 can't produce a terminal symbol, which is a problem because the string starts with t12, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, the string starts with t12, so to generate that, the grammar must have a way to produce t12. Looking at the grammar, I'm trying to find any non-terminal that directly produces t12.\n\nScanning through the rules, I find:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT13 NT0\nNT28 \u2192 NT6 NT9\nNT29 \u2192 NT28 NT48\n...\n\nWait, looking for 't12' specifically. Wait, in the rules, I don't see any node directly producing t12. Wait, but in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nLooking for NT or non-terminals that directly produce t12.\n\nWait, I do see some rules like:\n\nNT19 \u2192 't48' \u2192 Wait, no, wait:\n\nLooking through the rules: \n\nLooking for any rule where the right-hand side is 't12'. Scanning each line:\n\nI see, for example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't16'\nNT7 \u2192 't35'\nNT9 \u2192 't28'\nNT14 is not here; actually, in the given, do any non-terminals produce 't12'?\n\nWait, looking at all the rules' right-hand sides, do any directly produce 't12'?\n\nLooking, I see:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48\nNT21 \u2192 NT38 NT31\nNT48 \u2192 NT15 NT41\nNot directly t12.\n\nOther rules have:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT2 NT50\nNT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17\nNT44 \u2192 't6'\nWait, in the bottom part of the rules, I see:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't6'\nNT42 \u2192 't5'\nNT13 \u2192 't39'\nNT28 \u2192 't67'\nNo T12 directly. So, I'm starting to think that there's no non-terminal that produces 't12' directly. That seems like a problem because the string begins with t12, so unless the production can somehow chain to t12, which if it's not directly available, the string can't be derived.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the rules more carefully.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar rules, the non-terminals at the top include NT0, NT2, etc. Let's check if any non-terminal directly produces 't12'. For example, looking through all the rules:\n\nLooking for 't12' as a possible terminal in the rules:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n- NT22 \u2192 ?\nWait, the rules provided include:\n\nLooking more closely, I see:\n\nIn the bottom of the rules, there's:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't5'\nNT13 \u2192 't39'\nNT28 \u2192 't67'\nnt12 is in the string starting with t12, but I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't12'. Therefore, unless there's a way to derive 't12' through the productions, which may require multiple steps, this could be a problem.\n\nWait, wait, let me re-examine the grammar rules. Maybe I missed a rule.\n\nScanning the rules again, I see:\n\nIs there a rule where a non-terminal produces t12?\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n- NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35, etc.\n- Hmm, in the bottom, I see:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't44'\nNT52 \u2192 't6' ... Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nScanning the list again, I see:\n\nAt the very bottom of the rules, after NT41, I see:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't6'\nNT42 \u2192 't5'\nNT13 \u2192 't39'\nNT28 \u2192 't67'\nNo, that's in the rules but not for t12.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, perhaps I'm misreading the rules. Wait, in the initial set of rules, there's a line:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, NT42 produces t5. But I don't see t12 being produced by any non-terminal.

The string is `t33 t11 t12 t13 t18 t6 t16 t39 t69 t72 t67 t2 t83 t48 t6 t6 t33 t16 t3 t2`. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar and how it generates strings, especially focusing on the terminals and non-terminals involved. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals have productions that lead directly to terminals. For example, NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT13 \u2192 't39', etc. These produce string elements like 't5', 't6', and so on.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't33', so I need to find a production rule that can derive 't33'. Looking through the rules, I see NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, and NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, and both NT41 and NT43 produce terminals: NT41 \u2192 't48' and NT43 \u2192 't1'. Wait, no, let me check again. NT41: Oh, looking at NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31 and NT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35, which are both terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it right.\n\nWait, let me look again. NT10's rule is NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, and both NT41 and NT43 produce 't48' and 't1' respectively? Or wait, let's see the specific rules for NT41 and NT43.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules are listed in the grammar. Let's see:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35\n\nNT31 is a rule that might lead to a terminal. Also, looking back, other routes:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35\n\nAnd NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe NT37 \u2192 NT12 NT38.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a tree. Maybe the string 't33' comes from a production that starts with NT15.\n\nLooking at the first production: S \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So starting with NT15, it's recursive. Wait, NT15's rule is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So S starts with NT15, which branches into NT37 and NT15 again.\n\nWait, that might get complicated. Maybe it's better to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t33 t11 t12 t13 t18 t6 t16 t39 t69 t72 t67 t2 t83 t48 t6 t6 t33 t16 t3 t2\n\nI'll list the tokens: t33, t11, t12, t13, t18, t6, t16, t39, t69, t72, t67, t2, t83, t48, t6, t6, t33, t16, t3, t2.\n\nFirst token is t33. Let's see which non-terminal can produce 't33'. Looking at the grammar, NT33 isn't a non-terminal, but looking at the rules, I see NT52 \u2192 't44', NT44 \u2192 't6', etc. Hmm, maybe from NT28: NT28 \u2192 't67', which isn't helpful. Or perhaps from NT30: NT30 \u2192 't30' via NT24 or other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all non-terminals that can derive 't33' directly. From the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly mapping to 't33'. Instead, perhaps 't33' comes from a production that generates it through other terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking, for example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So if I can get 't33' from NT37, but looking at NT37's rules, NT37 \u2192 NT12 NT38, and NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29, etc. I don't see a direct 't33' there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check NT15's path further. NT15's first production is NT37 NT15, so from NT15, you go to NT37 and then again to NT15. That seems like a loop, maybe leading to some deeper productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first production for S is S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so starting with NT15, which gives NT37 NT15, then NT43 which is NT27 NT0. NT0 is NT30 NT20, which is 't30' and 't20'. 't30' is produced by NT24 or other paths.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to find possible derivations that produce the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into parts that correspond to different non-terminals.\n\nLet me see the string again: t33 t11 t12 t13 t18 t6 t16 t39 t69 t72 t67 t2 t83 t48 t6 t6 t33 t16 t3 t2.\n\nIt starts with t33, which I'm not sure how to get. Maybe t33 comes from NT51 or NT28? Looking at the rules, NT28 has two rules: NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23 or NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT1. Let's see: NT20 \u2192 NT30 NT24, NT24 \u2192 NT12 NT48, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the first part is t33, then t11, t12, t13, etc., but this might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that for the given grammar, certain strings must follow specific patterns, such as involving specific sequences of non-terminals that expand into the terminals.\n\nAnother approach: check if the string can be split into segments that match the possible productions. For example, 't33 t11 t12 t13 t18 t6 t16 t39 t69 t72 t67 t2 t83 t48 t6 t6 t33 t16 t3 t2' has 19 tokens. Let's count the elements: each token is a 't' followed by a number.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, many rules produce specific terminals. For example, NT4 \u2192 't48', NT5 \u2192 't2', NT9 \u2192 't28', and so on.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the string starts with t33, which is not directly produced by any non-terminal in the given rules. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't33' directly. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me make sure I read the rules correctly. The grammar includes rules like NT9 \u2192 't28', NT5 \u2192 't7', etc. But I don't see a rule that directly produces 't33'. Therefore, the first token 't33' can't be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. So, immediately, the string can't be generated by this grammar because 't33' isn't a terminal, and no non-terminal directly produces it.\n\nSo, the answer should be 'No', the string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\nThe given string contains the token 't33' at the beginning. However, in the provided grammar, no non-terminal directly produces 't33' as a terminal. All productions either generate other terminals or further non-terminals. Since 't33' is not present as a terminal production, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. \n\nThus, the answer is 'No'.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-359","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal or a terminal. That should help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, it initially goes to NT15 and NT43. So the generated string should start with the combination of derivations from these two non-terminals.\n\nThe string provided is `t54 t55 t6 t72 t67 t2 t83 t83 t72 t33 t11 t33 t67 t12 t12 t91 t83 t55 t6 t33 t39`.\n\nWait, but in CNF, the start rule is S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which in the string means it should start with something from NT15 and something from NT43. But in the given string, the first token is t54. Hmm, but in the grammar, NT15 and NT43 produce certain things, so maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nLet me list the productions and terminals to see what's going on:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\nBut wait, that seems to loop. But perhaps it doesn't necessarily loop in the derivation because we can eventually derive terminals.\n\nLooking at NT15: The production is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, but also NT19 is in multiple productions. Wait, no, looking more carefully, I see NT15 has a production: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that can't be right because you can't have a non-terminal that produces itself unless it's part of a cycle that eventually reaches a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I don't see any terminal 't15' being generated from NT15 except via NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, but that doesn't get us anywhere. Or do I? Let me check NT37: NT37 has productions to NT19 NT19 and also to NT17 NT45, and more.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by seeing which non-terminals can derive into the given string. Let me note that t15 is not present in the terminals, so I think I must have made a mistake in parsing the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, I see that each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT13 \u2192 't39', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT24 \u2192 't18', etc. So the string is composed of these terminal symbols, and the non-terminals are in the middle of the derivation process.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the entire string can be broken down into the start rule's two parts, which are NT15 and NT43. So the string should consist of the concatenation of a derivation from NT15 and a derivation from NT43.\n\nSo the first part: t54 t55 t6 t72 t67 t2 t83 t83 t72 t33 t11 t33 t67 t12 t12 t91 t83 t55 t6 t33 t39.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string, it starts with t54. Since S = NT15 NT43, I need to see if the first part is derived from NT15 and starts with t54, and the second part is derived from NT43 and starts with something else.\n\nWait, but looking at NT15's production, it has NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. That can't terminate unless there's a production that leads to a terminal. But checking all NT entries, none of them except those marked with 't' seem to be terminals. For example, NT13 \u2192 't39', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, let's look at NT15's production chain. NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So in order to terminate, NT37 must derive into a terminal, and when it does, the NT15 will keep producing NT37 until it cannot anymore. Wait, that might not make sense. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLet me consider NT15: Each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. The only production for NT15 is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. But in the context of derivation, that would mean that NT15 can only produce more NT37 NT15, which suggests that NT15 can't produce a terminal directly. So is NT15 a start non-terminal that can never derive a terminal? That can't be right because S is NT15 NT43, which must eventually produce the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing some other production for NT15. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT37 has multiple productions, including NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, which could potentially eventually break down into terminals. But NT15 only has NT37 as its production, which suggests that NT15's only way is to produce NT37 and itself again, which would loop infinitely unless it reaches a terminal, but in the provided grammar, NT37 has productions that lead to terminals through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a parsing strategy. Maybe recursive descent parsing, where for each non-terminal, I try to match the possible productions.\n\nSo, starting with S, which is NT15 followed by NT43.\n\nThe string starts with t54. So the first part must come from NT15, which produces NT37 NT15. So t54 must come from NT15's derivation chain. Wait, no, because the first production of NT15 is NT37 NT15, which when derived, will produce NT37 NT15 again, leading to an infinite loop unless one of the non-terminals in the chain derives into a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the non-terminals that have terminal productions are those marked with 't' before them. For example, NT13 \u2192 't39'.\n\nSo let me look at the productions again for all NTs:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't39'\n- NT24 \u2192 't18'\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34\n- NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17\n- NT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46\n- NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37\n- NT36 \u2192 NT5 NT30\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 | NT17 NT45\n- NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29\n- NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't5'\n- NT13 \u2192 't39'\n- NT24 \u2192 't18'\n- ... and others like NT29 \u2192 't63', etc.\n\nSo NT15's only production is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. But NT15 is a non-terminal; to eventually derive a terminal, there must be a path where NT37 eventually can derive into a terminal. So let's see: NT37 can produce NT19 NT19 or NT17 NT45. Then those non-terminals must eventually produce terminals.\n\nFor example, NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 or NT51 NT20, which would require NT51 to produce something. But wait, looking at NT19:\n\nNT19's productions are NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 and NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT20. Then where do NT51 and NT51 NT20 lead?\n\nNT51's productions: NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20 or NT50 NT20 (since NT51: NT50 NT20 is the production). Wait, no, the NT51 production is listed as:\n\nWait, looking again: the grammar says NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20. So NT51 can produce NT50 NT20. NT50 is another non-terminal, which has production NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43.\n\nHmm, and so on. So let's try to see where it all leads.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should attempt to split the string into parts that could be generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nThe entire string is: `t54 t55 t6 t72 t67 t2 t83 t83 t72 t33 t11 t33 t67 t12 t12 t91 t83 t55 t6 t33 t39`.\n\nLooking at the first token: t54.

{"custom_id":"request-367","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of tokens like 't13', 't12', etc. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that CNF has specific characteristics. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, except that the start symbol can go directly to a terminal. So, I'm going to look through the given grammar to confirm that every production is in the correct form. It looks like all the rules except for the ones starting with 'NT' and 'S' might be okay. Wait, for example, S \u2192 NT15 NT43: that's okay because it's two non-terminals. But then, some rules have more than two on the right, like NT0 \u2192 NT52 NT8: that's two, so that's fine. Actually, all the given production rules seem to be in the form of two non-terminals on the right side, except for S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which is okay. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t13 t12 t11 t7 t83 t55 t6 t11 t33 t11 t54 t16 t90 t36 t12 t91 t83 t6 t6 t16 t24`. \n\nI know that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, representing a terminal in the grammar. Our job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every step of derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. However, the terminals are generated directly when a derivation reaches them. The length of the string is 21 terminals. So, if the grammar is in CNF, the number of steps in the derivation would be log2(n), where n is the length, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about building a parse tree where each internal node (non-terminal) has exactly two children (since all productions are of the form NT \u2192 NT NT). So, the total number of non-terminals in the parse tree would be one less than the number of terminals. Given that the string has 21 terminals, the number of non-terminals would be 20.\n\nBut looking at the given grammar, each production right-hand side is two non-terminals, so each step of the derivation is doubling the number of symbols. Wait, no. Actually, each step increases the number of symbols by one because each non-terminal is replaced by two, so a sequence of length n becomes n+1. So, starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each step adds a non-terminal, so to get to 21 terminals, we need 20 steps. That's a lot.\n\nAlternatively, I might consider using a table-driven parser like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars. But since the string is given, perhaps I can try to see if each terminal can be derived by the right production.\n\nFirst, I think I should list all production rules that produce terminals because sometimes rules can have terminals on their right-hand side, but in CNF, all rules are non-terminals \u2192 non-terminals, except for the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form NT \u2192 NT NT, except for the ones that start with NT \u2192 terminal. Wait no: Wait, in CNF, the productions are either A \u2192 BC or S \u2192 w, where w is a string of terminals. Wait no, the definition in Chomsky Normal Form for context-free grammars is that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. Alternatively, if the grammar includes the empty string production, sometimes it's considered. But in the given grammar, I don't see any terminals on the left side, only on the right. So, perhaps the given grammar is a typical CNF where all productions are A \u2192 BC, and the terminals only appear as results of productions.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, all the symbols are non-terminals because they all start with 'NT' except S and some rules. Wait, no: looking at the productions, most of them have 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. But for example, NT0 \u2192 NT52 NT8: that's two non-terminals on the right. Another example, NT5 \u2192 't2', which is a terminal. So, that's a problem because in CNF, each production must have only non-terminals on the right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar provided.\n\nWait, the user said that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me check again: in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So any production that produces a terminal is not in CNF. But looking at the given grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 't2', which is a terminal. So that can't be in CNF. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't35' and others. So, perhaps the user made a mistake, or perhaps the grammar is not in CNF as I thought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CNF they're referring to is in an intermediate form where some productions may have a single non-terminal, as long as it's followed by terminals. Wait, no, in standard CNF, all productions except the start symbol must expand into two non-terminals.\n\nBut this is a confusion point. Because in the grammar provided, there are rules that produce terminals. So perhaps this is not a standard CNF. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the string is generated by a grammar that is in CNF, but it's presented in a non-standard way.\n\nWait, the initial user message says \"the given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form.\" So perhaps I should take the given grammar at face value, assuming it is in CNF, but then the production rules show that some non-terminals produce terminals, which is not possible in standard CNF. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem presentation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user confused the grammar type. Or perhaps the grammar is in a modified form where some rules can have a single non-terminal, perhaps followed by a terminal. But that's not standard CNF.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should proceed by treating the given grammar as being in CNF and only process the rule productions that are NT\u2192 NT NT. Then, any production that produces a terminal is a base case for the parsing.\n\nSo, perhaps the grammar can be processed step by step, trying to find a way to get to the given string.\n\nThe first step is to note that the start symbol is S. So the derivation starts with S.\n\nLooking at the production rules for S: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S can only be replaced by NT15 and NT43.\n\nNow, let's look at the terminals in the string: the first one is t13. So somewhere in the derivation, t13 must be produced by a production. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT7 NT48 (two non-terminals)\nNT4 \u2192 NT26 NT2 (two non-terminals)\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (two non-terminals)\nNT15 \u2192 NT19 NT30\nNT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20 (two non-terminals)\nNT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38 (two non-terminals)\nNT43 \u2192 NT25 NT4 (two non-terminals)\nETC.\n\nWait, I need to find a production rule that produces a terminal, but I don't see any in the given grammar. So perhaps the given string cannot be generated because all productions in the grammar only lead to non-terminals, and terminals are never produced in a CNF grammar as per standard.\n\nBut that seems conflicting with the problem statement because it says the string may or may not be in the language. So perhaps my misunderstanding stems from the grammar not being a proper CNF in the way I was assuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production rules shown include some that actually produce terminals, but in the way the list is presented, perhaps they are miswritten.\n\nLooking back at the given grammar, for example, NT52 \u2192 't44'\u2014that's a single terminal. So if the grammar allows such productions, then those are epsilon productions or terminals. But in standard CNF, there are no such productions because each production is two non-terminals. So perhaps the user is considering an epsilon-NF or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the productions are presented in a way that includes epsilon, but in this case, the productions seem to have either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or a terminal on the right side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar uses symbols that are a mix of terminals and non-terminals, which is not typical.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is similar to the way recursive-descent parsers are written, with some rules that can produce terminals. Maybe in this context, each rule has two parts: first, a sequence of non-terminals, then, perhaps, the ability to generate a terminal, but then this isn"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-387","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided, which is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t90 t13 t83 t72 t12 t12 t33 t67 t67 t7 t83 t55 t6 t11 t91 t83 t55 t6 t16 t31 t38 t36`. \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. Importantly, in this form, all productions are at most two symbols on the right-hand side, so trees are two-level, meaning the derivation starts from the start symbol and each step doubles the number of symbols. This makes the grammar simple but also imposes some constraints on the structure of the generated strings.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's quite extensive with a bunch of production rules. Some of the rules are directly mapping non-terminals to terminals or other non-terminals. Since all rules in CNF have either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right, this grammar is in CNF.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by numbers. So, the first step is to check if all the symbols in the string are covered by the grammar's terminals. Wait, but in the grammar provided, I notice that there are terminals, but looking closely, most of the productions are between non-terminals. Wait, no, some productions directly map to terminals. For example, the production NT44 \u2192 't6' means 't6' is a terminal, and similarly for others like NT47 \u2192 't6', NT19 \u2192 't39', and so on.\n\nSo, all the 't' terms in the string must correspond to some terminal in the grammar. Let me go through each part of the string and check if they exist as terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n`t90 t13 t83 t72 t12 t12 t33 t67 t67 t7 t83 t55 t6 t11 t91 t83 t55 t6 t16 t31 t38 t36`\n\nLet me list each 't' and see if it's present:\n\n- t90: I need to check nt50 -> t33, which is t33, so t90 is present elsewhere. Looking through the grammar, there's a production NT100 -> t90? Wait, no, let's check the provided rules. Looking through, I see NT45 \u2192 't11' (t11 is present), but wait, looking at the production rules, do any of the NT rules produce t90?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals in the grammar. Let's scan through each production:\n\n- NT10: t50\n- NT12: t16\n- NT13: t69\n- NT19: t13\n- NT21: t99\n- NT23: t7\n- NT24: t55, t18, t55, t18? Wait, looking at the grammar, let me parse each rule's right-hand side.\n\nWait, some of the rules map directly to terminals:\n\nHere's a list based on the grammar provided:\n\nNT10 \u2192 t50, which is 't50'\n\nNT12 \u2192 t16 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT13 \u2192 t69 \u2192 't69'\n\nNT19 \u2192 t39 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT21 \u2192 t99 \u2192 't99'\n\nNT23 \u2192 t7 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT24 \u2192 t55 and t18 \u2192 't55', 't18'\n\nNT28 \u2192 t67, t4?\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nThe production rules:\n\nNT52 -> 't44'\nNT44 -> 't6'\nNT42 -> 't5'\nNT13 -> 't39'\nNT28 -> 't67'\nNT24 -> 't18'\nNT24 -> 't55'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't48'\nNT29 -> 't63'\nNT4 -> 't88'\nNT9 -> 't28'\nNT50 -> 't33'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT51 -> 't90'\nNT48 -> 't87'\nNT1 -> 't24'\nNT34 -> 't87'\nNT36 -> 't84'\nNT21 -> 't99'\nNT45 -> 't11'\nNT19 -> 't13'\nNT37 -> 't12'\nNT51 -> 't38'\nNT36 -> 't41'\nNT26 -> 't12'\nNT5 -> 't7'\nNT13 -> 't69'\nNT21 -> 't13'\nNT40 -> 't89'\nNT29 -> 't36'\nNT1 -> 't37'\nNT51 -> 't38'\nNT6 -> 't16'\nNT17 -> 't33'\nNT19 -> 't54'\nNT31 -> 't91'\nNT23 -> 't7'\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nSo compiling all terminal 't' terms:\n\nLooking at the above, the terminal tokens are: t2, t5, t6, t7, t9, t10, t11, t12, t13, t16, t18, t21, t23, t24, t25 (but 25 is non-terminal?), wait, 25 is an NT in the production rules.\n\nWait, no: the terminals are those that appear directly on the right-hand side of the production as terminal symbols. So in the provided grammar, the terminals are:\n\n- t2 (from NT19 \u2192 t2)\n- t5 (NT42 \u2192 t5)\n- t6 (NT44 \u2192 t6)\n- t7 (NT23 \u2192 t7, NT16 \u2192 t3 [wait, NT16 \u2192 t3, so t3 is a terminal])\n- t9 (NT50 \u2192 t33 \u2192 t33; does that mean 33 is a terminal? Because NT10 \u2192 t50, so 50 is a terminal?)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Actually, in the given grammar, each rule that maps to a terminal is of the form NTXYZ \u2192 'tN', where N is a number. So each 'tN' is a terminal symbol, with N being the number.\n\nTherefore, the terminals present in the grammar are:\n\n- t2\n- t5\n- t6\n- t7\n- t9\n- t10\n- t11\n- t12\n- t13\n- t16\n- t18\n- t21\n- t23\n- t24\n- t25 (Wait, looking at the grammar, is there a production that maps directly to t25?

{"custom_id":"request-403","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t54 t87 t54 t54 t33 t67 t6 t16 t31 t12 t12 t33 t11 t12 t91 t16 t24 t55 t6 t87 t12 t12 t63`.\n\nFirst, I notice that each token in the string is a terminal, like 't54', 't16', etc. These must correspond to the terminals in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, I see that various non-terminals produce certain terminals, like NT15 \u2192 't37', but some terminals have multiple options, like NT52 can produce both 't12' and 't67', depending on which production is used.\n\nThe initial step in such problems is to check the overall structure of the sentence and see if it can be generated from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, the sentence should be a combination of two non-terminals generating the terminals we see.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't54'. Let's check which non-terminals can produce 't54'. Looking through the productions, I see that NT7 \u2192 NT17 NT51, but that leads to more non-terminals. Alternatively, looking at the string, 't54' might not be directly produced by any production. Wait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, I think I may have missed where 't54' is produced. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I notice that 't54' is not a terminal on the right-hand side of any production. Hmm, that's strange. Or is it? Let me scan the productions again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, but that doesn't produce 't54'. Similarly, looking for any production that results in 't54'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nAh, I see in the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30. NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32, and NT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46, and so on. This might take a while, but perhaps a better approach is to trace the string backward.\n\nWait, another approach is to use a CYK algorithm to parse the string, but since the user hasn't specified a need for it, maybe a step-by-step expansion would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into segments that correspond to the productions. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe first token is 't54'. Does any non-terminal produce 't54'? Looking at the productions, I see that NT19 \u2192 't54' because in the grammar, NT19 is defined with a production that includes 't54' in one of its outputs. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the grammar. Let me carefully go through it again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that in the grammar, some entries are shown as 't-number' terminals. For example, NT52 \u2192 't12' or 't67'. Similarly, NT1 \u2192 't24', etc.\n\nLooking specifically, I see that NT19 can produce 't54' because in the productions, NT19 \u2192 NT11 NT19 and some other path. Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, I don't see any production for NT19 that directly gives 't54'. Let me check:\n\nWait, I see that NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30, and NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT1, and others. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals. Let's do that:\n\n- t54: from NT19 (I think, but need to check grammar)\n- t87: from NT34 (since NT34 \u2192 't87' in one of the productions)\n- t54 again\n- t54 again\n- t33: from NT52 \u2192 't33' (because NT52 \u2192 't33')\n- t67: from NT52 \u2192 't67'\n- t6: from NT24 or others\n- t16: NT17 \u2192 't16'\n- t31: NT31 \u2192 't91'\nWait, no, NT31 \u2192 't91', so maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps each token in the string is the terminal part of a production. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, which must be the result of the grammar's productions.\n\nEach token must come from some production's right-hand side. For example, 't54' must come from some non-terminal that has a production ending with 't54'. Looking through the productions, I see that NT21 \u2192 NT16 NT31, but that doesn't directly give 't54', unless NT16 or NT31 do.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see each token and check what non-terminals can produce them:\n\n- 't54': Looking through the productions, I see NT19 \u2192 NT19 NT11, but no 't54' directly. Wait, perhaps NT19 can produce 't54' in another way. Alternatively, maybe NT7 \u2192 NT17 NT51, and NT17 can produce 't16', etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is structured in a way that each 't' part comes from a specific production. Let's think about the structure:\n\nThe string starts with t54, then t87, then t54, etc. Let me see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nWait, 't87' is from NT34, since in the grammar, NT34 \u2192 't87'. So the first part is 't54 t87'. So maybe the first part is a product of two non-terminals, where the first produces 't54' and the second 't87'.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, perhaps 't54' is from NT19, because in the productions, NT34 \u2192 't87' (which is part of NT34).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think step by step.\n\nThe start symbol S is NT15 \u2192 NT43. So the string should be a series of symbols from NT15 and NT43.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nSo the string starts with whatever NT15 produces and then NT43.\n\nSo let's see what NT15 \u2192 't54'? Wait, looking for NT15 productions, in the grammar I see NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So that's recursive. But that doesn't help directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire string to see if it can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated using the rightmost or leftmost derivations. But that might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to check each token to see which non-terminal can produce it, and see if the overall structure of the string makes sense.\n\nThe string is: t54 t87 t54 t54 t33 t67 t6 t16 t31 t12 t12 t33 t11 t12 t91 t16 t24 t55 t6 t87 t12 t12 t63.\n\nLet's start with the first token, t54. From the grammar, does any non-terminal X produce 't54'? Looking through:\n\nLooking through NT19's productions: I don't see 't54' directly. Wait, but perhaps NT19 can produce it through a chain. Alternatively, perhaps NT19 has a production that includes 't54' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the correct production.

The string is `t13 t67 t7 t16 t24 t55 t6 t11 t2 t83 t48 t54 t54 t6 t13 t12 t31 t13 t31 t54 t6 t16 t37`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT43. The string seems to be a sequence of terminals, so the challenge is to trace back the possible derivation steps that could produce this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite complex with many non-terminals and productions. Each NT has specific rules, and some of them directly produce 't' terms which are terminals. My approach will be to see if the given string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar productions.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Both NT15 and NT43 must eventually produce parts of the string. NT15's production is NT37 NT15. That seems recursive, but maybe it ends up producing 't13'. NT43 produces t6 and NT24, which then might produce other terms.\n\nThe string starts with t13, which could be produced by NT15 after a reduction. Then t67 is next, but I'm not sure which production leads to 't67.' Looking at the grammar, NT44 produces 't6', NT42 't5', NT28 't67' is a production I see: NT28 \u2192 't67'. So maybe one of the NTs leading up to it should produce t67.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step:\n\n1. t13: Could come from NT15, which is NT37 NT15. If NT37 reduces to t12, then NT15 might reduce to t13 via some path, possibly NT19 \u2192 t54, but I'm getting lost. Maybe t13 is a direct production of NT13, which is in the grammar as NT13 \u2192 't39', but that's 't39', not t13. Hmm, maybe another NT.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT28 \u2192 't67', so maybe that's a term. So in the string, the first t67 would come from NT28. So I need a path where one NT produces t67. \n\nLooking for the start symbol S, which is NT15 NT43. So S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nSuppose NT15 is producing parts involving 't13' and 't55'. Wait, NT24 \u2192 't55' perhaps? Because earlier in the grammar, NT24 has a production to 't55' and also to t18 and t55 again. So perhaps NT24 produces 't55'. \n\nSo let's see, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. \n\nIf NT15 is 't13' and NT43 is followed by 't55' via NT24, maybe.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me list all the NTs and see which produce 't's and how they connect.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n- NT37 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n- NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48\n- NT48 \u2192 NT15 NT41\n- NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31\n- NT31 \u2192 NT91 NT91\n  - NT91 is likely a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT91 isn't present, so maybe it's not. Alternatively, NT91 may have a production to a terminal like 't91', which isn't in the given string. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT13's production is 't39', but that's 't39', which isn't in the string.\n\nWait, let's look at the given string. The first terms are t13, t67, t7, t16, etc.\n\nt13 could come from NT21 because NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT50. If NT13 produces t13, but NT13 might not. Alternatively, NT21 could produce t13 via another path.\n\nWait, NT21's production is NT13 NT50, and NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. Then NT43 \u2192 't6' and NT24. NT24 can produce various things.\n\nThis seems too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nLet me attempt to match the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t13 t67 t7 t16 t24 t55 t6 t11 t2 t83 t48 t54 t54 t6 t13 t12 t31 t13 t31 t54 t6 t16 t37.\n\nI can break it into parts:\n\nGroup 1: t13\nGroup 2: t67\nGroup 3: t7\nGroup 4: t16\nGroup 5: t24 t55\nGroup 6: t6\nGroup 7: t11\nGroup 8: t2\nGroup 9: t83\nGroup 10: t48\nGroup 11: t54 t54\nGroup 12: t6\nGroup 13: t13\nGroup 14: t12\nGroup 15: t31\nGroup 16: t13\nGroup 17: t31\nGroup 18: t54\nGroup 19: t6\nGroup 20: t16\nGroup 21: t37.\n\nWait, but the string is a flat list of terms, not grouped. So each is a single token.\n\nLet me think in terms of the grammar:\n\nS starts as NT15 NT43.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nAssume NT15 produces t13, and NT43 produces a sequence. But how?\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15: this is recursive, but maybe it eventually reaches a terminal.\n\nBut NT37 has production NT12 NT47.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT15 NT41 (also another production).\n\nAlternatively, NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, all NTs split into two parts. Let me try to see if some of these can produce t13.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T13 is produced by NT28, as NT28 \u2192 't67', but wait, that's 't67' not t13. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the possible strings that start with NT15 and NT43.\n\nLet me consider NT15. Its production is NT37 NT15. So NT15 can only produce strings that start with NT37 followed by another NT15. This suggests that any string derived from NT15 must be a concatenation of some NT37 followed by a string from NT15.\n\nWait, but if NT37 produces another NT, maybe recursively. Let's see what NT37 does.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT12 NT47.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT15 NT41 or NT44 NT21.\n\nNT15 again leads back to itself, creating a loop. This seems to be an infinite loop unless NT37 produces a terminal. But looking through the productions, I don't see NT37 producing a terminal. Instead, NT37 produces two NTs. So perhaps the only way to get a terminal from NT37 is through some other path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT37 leads to NT12, which leads to NT21, which leads to NT13, which is a terminal? But in the grammar, NT13 \u2192 't39', which is not t13.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should check each term in the string to see if they match any of the productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n- t13: Is there any production for a NT that leads to t13? Looking at the grammar, NT13 \u2192 't39', so that's not t13. Hmm. Wait, NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT50. If NT13 could lead to t13, maybe. But NT50's productions are NT41 NT43, so maybe if NT41 \u2192 t7 and NT43 \u2192 t6, but that leads to t76.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some other pathway.\n\nWait, maybe t13 is from somewhere else.

{"custom_id":"request-419","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. It has a start symbol S, which initially expands to NT15 NT43. Each of these non-terminals further breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals. My goal is to see if the provided string can be derived from S by following these production rules.\n\nThe string given is: `t11 t2 t83 t54 t54 t33 t11 t11 t7 t83 t18 t6 t11 t12 t91 t83 t87 t6 t11 t54 t55 t6 t16 t24`.\n\nSince this is a CFG in CNF, any string in the language must be formed by a parse tree where each internal node is a production rule with exactly two children, and leaves are terminals. So, each 't' in the string could be a terminal, and the non-terminals must expand to sequences leading to these terminals.\n\nI'll start by trying to find a possible derivation. Let's consider the structure:\n\nS -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, the string must start with the expansion of NT15 followed by NT43. Let's check the string: the first 't's are t11, t2, etc. Let's see if t11 can be part of NT15 or NT43.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Hmm, that's recursive. I wonder if there's a way to derive a terminal from NT15.\n\nWait, let's look for all productions that have terminals as the right-hand side. Scanning through the grammar, I see several rules where non-terminals are replaced by 't's followed by numbers. For example, NT6 -> 't16', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT17 -> 't33', etc.\n\nSo, I think the approach here is to map each 't' in the string to the corresponding non-terminal that can produce it. Each production that leads directly to a terminal will eventually break down into those t's.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t11 t2 t83 t54 t54 t33 t11 t11 t7 t83 t18 t6 t11 t12 t91 t83 t87 t6 t11 t54 t55 t6 t16 t24.\n\nI'll start by considering that the start symbol S must expand to NT15 and NT43. So the string should be split into two parts, each corresponding to the expansions of NT15 and NT43.\n\nBut since the string is a sequence, how do I split it? The two non-terminals NT15 and NT43 would each expand into a sequence of terminals, so the string must be a concatenation of these two sequences.\n\nGiven that, I'll first try to find possible expansions for each part.\n\nFirst, let's look at NT15. From the grammar, NT15 can produce NT37 NT15, which is recursive. Alternatively, it could produce some other two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the production for NT37, it goes to NT19 NT19. Each NT19 can go to NT51 NT19 or NT19 NT19. Not sure yet. Wait, maybe I should think about how each production leads to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see that each non-terminal eventually leads to a set of terminals. For example, NT54, looking at its productions: seems like NT25, NT48, etc. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit lost.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to see each 't' in the string corresponds to some non-terminal, and trace back from the terminals to see if they can be derived.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the string is a concatenation, so each non-terminal's expansion must correspond to a certain part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to find the starting symbols, S, and see how it breaks down.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the start expansion is S = NT15 NT43. So the string should be the concatenation of NT15's expansion and NT43's expansion.\n\nTherefore, the string length must be equal to the sum of the lengths of NT15 and NT43 expansions.\n\nLet me count the number of 't's: let's see, the string is: 26 't's. So, len(string)=26.\n\nIf NT15 and NT43 expansions sum up to 26, then possible.\n\nNow, let's think of each non-terminal.\n\nNT15's productions:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nHmm, recursively produces NT37 and itself, which seems like it could generate a long string. Alternatively, perhaps I need to find a path that leads to terminals.\n\nWait, looking at NT37: NT37 can go to NT19 NT19 or NT37 NT37. But then each NT19 can produce more NT rules.\n\nLooking at NT19:\n\nNT19-> NT51 NT19 or NT19 NT19.\n\nWait, NT51 is NT50 NT20. So NT51 can expand further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is getting too complex. Maybe I can look for 't's that come from certain non-terminals.\n\nFor example, NT6 produces 't16', NT17 produces 't33', etc. So each of these can produce specific 't's.\n\nLet me see the string again:\n\nLooking at the string, the first 't's are t11, t2, etc.\n\nSuppose NT15's expansion is t11, and then the rest comes from NT43. Or, perhaps the first split is NT15 = t11, and NT43 = the rest of the string: t2 t83 t54 t54 t33 t11 ... which would be 25 't's, but that doesn't fit because 26 in total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT15's expansion is more than one 't'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT15 and NT43 each produce multiple 't's. Let me think: each non-terminal expansion could produce a number of 't's, so the number of 't's in the string should match the sum of the 't's generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to count how many 't's each production can lead to.\n\nWait, the problem is that each rule either leads to two non-terminals (e.g., A -> BC) or a terminal (A-> a), so each step appends a terminal.\n\nBut actually, in the Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A->BC or A->a, so each step adds exactly one terminal, but the length of the string is equal to the number of non-terminals in the parse tree.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, the number of terminals in a derivation is equal to the number of non-terminals plus one. So for a derivation from S, the number of terminals would be equal to the number of non-terminals plus one. But in this case, the string is a sequence of terminals, so perhaps I should think in reverse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of each non-terminal as a function that can emit some 't's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of each non-terminal deriving a certain sequence of 't's. For example, some non-terminals directly emit a single 't', while others can be expanded into sequences that eventually lead to 't's.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, many non-terminals produce terminals, such as NT6 -> 't16', NT17-> 't33', NT27-> 't83', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT54: NT54 -> NT6 NT25.

{"custom_id":"request-427","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, so I'll need to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar structure. It starts with S -> NT15 NT43. The NT symbols seem to break down into other NT symbols until they reach terminals like 't' followed by numbers. The terminals at the end are things like t12, t33, etc., which I assume are the actual string we're testing against.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t33 t67 t38 t54 t16 t31 t36 t33 t11 t91 t83 t83 t72 t33 t67 t38 t13 t18 t6 t16 t38 t90 t36`.\n\nI notice that each rule in the grammar seems to be a combination of two NT symbols, and some of them eventually reduce to terminals with specific 't' codes. For example, some rules like NT50 -> NT41 NT43, and NT41 -> NT7 NT31, which translates to 't7' and 't31'. \n\nI should try to parse the string from the start symbol S and see if I can break it down into the rules step by step. Maybe I can build a derivation tree.\n\nStarting with S:\nS -> NT15 NT43\n\nSo, the string should start with the result of NT15 and NT43. Let's see what each of those rules produce.\n\nNT15: The rule is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that's a recursive rule. That means it will produce a sequence that includes NT15 again, leading to an infinite loop unless there's a terminal. Looking deeper, NT37 has a rule NT37 -> NT19 NT19. NT19 -> NT51 NT19, which is also recursive. Finally, NT51 goes to NT50 NT20. NT50 is NT41 NT43, as per earlier. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's try to trace how NT15 eventually becomes 't12'. Looking at the rules, NT37 has a rule that leads to 't13' via NT13 -> 't13'. But wait, NT37 itself branches into NT19 NT19, which is NT51 NT19. NT51 goes to NT50 NT20, which is NT41 NT43, leading to 't7' and 't31', which don't help. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to track the derivation more carefully. Let's take the string and see if each part corresponds to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t12, t33, t67, etc. Let's see where these come from.\n\nFor example, t33 is produced by NT30: NT30 -> NT24 NT44. NT24 has a rule NT24 -> NT4 NT44, which ends in 't18' and 't44' (which is 't6'). So that could produce t18 and t6, but in the string, we have t33 early on. So perhaps I'm looking in the wrong NT nodes.\n\nWait, let me look for rules that produce t33. Checking the rules, I see NT33 isn't a starting point, so where are 't33' coming from? Looking at the grammar, I see NT24 -> 't55' and other terminals. No, that's nt24. Wait, actually, the grammar may have some rules that directly produce 't33' as a terminal. Checking the provided rules, I spot NT52 -> 't67', but that's nt52. Hmm, let's see if any terminal is 't33'.\n\nActually, checking the provided rules, I don't see a terminal being 't33' except in the string. So maybe I need to see how 't33' is generated. Looking at the grammar, does any rule lead to 't33'? Wait, in the provided rules, I see NT52 -> 't67', NT44 -> 't6', etc. Oh, but in the string, 't33' appears twice. Let me check the rules to see how 't33' is produced.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Let me go through the rules again. The rules that produce terminals are for example, NT45 -> 't11'. Let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT52 -> 't44' (nt44->'t6')\n- NT42 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't39'\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n- NT0 -> 't39'\n- NT30 -> 't30' eventually, but perhaps it's reduced by other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a list of all the rules that produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-445","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar given. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's good because it might make parsing easier, maybe even using an algorithm like CYK.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t6 t13 t12 t12 t54 t38 t90 t54 t11 t2 t83 t18 t6 t67 t12 t91 t83 t88 t6 t6 t67 t6 t16 t37`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals eventually produce terminal strings. For example, NT21 \u2192 t13, so 't13' is a terminal. Similarly, NT23 might produce a terminal, but I notice that NT23's production isn't fully provided\u2014it says NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT0, which are both non-terminals. Hmm, but in the string, I see 't13' and 't12' appearing. Let me check if those are terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT36, NT37, etc., have productions that eventually lead to terminals. So, the terminals are things like 't2', 't4', 't48', etc. But 't12' and 't13' don't seem to be terminals because their productions still have non-terminals on the right side.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the string step by step. So, let's try to apply the grammar to see if we can derive this string.\n\nThe string starts with 't54'. Looking at the grammar, where do 't54's come from? Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47, but I don't see a 't54' production directly. Wait, looking further down, I see NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37. Not helpful. Hmm, NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT45, no.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, some non-terminals have rule productions that lead to two terminals. For example, NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', etc. But I'm looking for places where a production might result in a 't54'.\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce 't54'. Let me check the rules again. The productions show NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37, and others but 't54' isn't there. Hmm, maybe 't54' is produced by NT19. Checking NT19: its productions are NT12 NT38 and NT51 NT19. Neither of these are 't54's.\n\nWait, maybe 't54' is part of a non-terminal's production. Like NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29. Let me see if that's possible. If NT38 is a non-terminal, then maybe it's produced by another non-terminal. Let's see, NT38 is derived from NT29 and NT25, but is that 't54's?\n\nI'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's start by constructing the string and trying to match the grammar steps.\n\nThe first token is 't54'. Let's see which non-terminal can produce that. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly or indirectly produces 't54'. Because the non-terminals that might produce t are ones that go through NT21 \u2192 t13, NT23 \u2192 NT2 NT50, but that's not producing t54. So perhaps 't54' is not present in any production, making the string impossible.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the rules. Oh, I see that NT21 \u2192 't13' is a terminal. So, 't13' is a terminal. Similarly, NT23 has a production, but it's to NT2 NT50, which would be further productions. So, 't54' is not a terminal in the grammar. So, the first token being 't54' can't be derived from any production because none of the right-hand sides of the rules produce 't54'.

{"custom_id":"request-441","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF and without any epsilon productions (since every production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal) can be parsed using a method similar to the CYK algorithm, which checks whether a string can be derived from the start symbol. \n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, I see that some of the productions have terminals beyond just the single 't' symbols. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4. But wait, actually, looking closer, all the productions on the right-hand side are non-terminals except for some where it says \"t2\", \"t4\", etc. So each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That's interesting because typically, in CNF, you have two non-terminals or one terminal. So this grammar is in CNF, right?\n\nWait, another thing: in the grammar, the productions for NT5 via NT5 \u2192 t2, for example, have a terminal on the right-hand side. So that means the grammar has both single terminals and two non-terminals as right-hand sides. So it's a mix of unit productions and binary productions. \n\nSo the grammar can produce terminals directly or combine two non-terminals. \n\nGiven the string we have to evaluate: `t38 t13 t54 t12 t13 t18 t6 t16 t90 t90 t33 t11 t31 t16 t31 t63 t13 t13 t99 t87 t31 t36 t12 t28 t87` \n\nThat's 25 tokens, all terminals. So we need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since the grammar is in CNF with possible unit productions, and given the Chomsky Normal Form, this might be a case where we can model it as a tree and check if the string can be derived correctly.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for possible derivations step by step, especially since the string is quite long. Alternatively, perhaps I can build a DP table as in the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar uses both non-terminals and terminals, it's a bit more involved. \n\nAlternatively, since the string is all terminals, perhaps the parse would involve reducing it from the end, looking for possible productions that fit the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals can derive which strings. Alternatively, since each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, I can construct a dependency structure where each terminal in the string must come from a production that directly produces that terminal, or the entire string is built up by combining the results of smaller substrings.\n\nBut since the string is 25 tokens, I might consider breaking it down into segments that could be derived from the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps list out all the possible terminals that non-terminals can produce, working backward from the string.\n\nLet's see, the string starts with t38, t13, etc. So each of these should be either a direct production from a non-terminal or part of a chain.\n\nLooking at the grammar, several non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nFor example, NT4 -> t48, NT5 -> t2, NT9 -> t28, etc.\n\nWait, NT4 \u2192 t48, so if in the string there's t48, it can be derived from NT4.

It's in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Since all the right-hand sides of the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal, this simplifies parsing as each step in the derivation should produce exactly one token.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S, and the first production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, to derive the string, we start with S, which splits into NT15 and NT43. Each of these non-terminals will then split according to their production rules, and so on until we reach terminals.\n\nWait, but the string provided is a series of 't' followed by numbers. I notice that in the grammar, several non-terminals are set to specific terminal symbols. For example, NT5 -> 't2', NT13 -> 't39', etc. So, each step in the derivation corresponds to replacing a non-terminal with a terminal, and each production should account for one token in the string.\n\nSo, the overall process is to perform a leftmost derivation, starting from S and expanding non-terminals until all are terminals, and check if we end up with the given string.\n\nStarting with S, let's break it down:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nSo, first, we need to expand NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15's production: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that's recursive. So, it's a loop: NT15 can only expand into more NT15 and NT37. To get a terminal, we need NT15 to eventually lead to a production where it becomes a terminal, but looking through the grammar, I don't see NT15 being a terminal. It only appears on the right-hand side of other productions. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. But NT6 \u2192 't16' so that can be a terminal, and NT1 \u2192 NT35 NT43 \u2192 ... wait, NT1's productions go into other non-terminals.\n\nWait a minute. Let me list all terminals in the string. The tokens are:\n\nt12, t54, t12, t12, t12, t12, t91, t69, t69, t39, t39, t72, t33, t33, t16, t3, t3, t3, t72, t12, t11, t7, t83, t6, t16, t24.\n\nSo, let's count them: there are 25 tokens.\n\nIn the grammar, each production step in the leftmost derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one. Starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each step should increase the count of terminals until all are terminals.\n\nWait, no. Starting from S, which is one non-terminal, each expansion replaces one non-terminal with two others or a terminal. So, in the beginning, S is one non-terminal. After first expansion: S becomes NT15 and NT43, so two non-terminals. Then each of those non-terminals is expanded, each can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So, if both NT15 and NT43 produce terminals, that's two terminals, making total of 2 tokens, but our string has 25 tokens.\n\nBut wait, maybe some non-terminals expand into multiple terminals, but considering that in CNF, each production either splits into two non-terminals or ends in a terminal. So, every time a non-terminal is replaced, it can only contribute one terminal or more, but the way to reach a string of terminals is that each non-terminal eventually leads to a single terminal through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a leftmost derivation, each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal, and each replacement can only add a terminal or another non-terminal. So, the number of non-terminals decreases as we replace them, and the process stops when all are terminals.\n\nBut with 25 terminals, how does that work?\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the start symbol S has two non-terminals, NT15 and NT43. To get 25 terminals, each production must produce a certain number of terminals, but since each step in CNF only produces one or two non-terminals, it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is designed such that each non-terminal eventually produces a specific terminal sequence. For example, NT15 might produce a certain string, NT43 another, etc. So, maybe the approach is to trace the derivation from S, replacing non-terminals step by step, and see if the resulting string matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see if all the required non-terminals can be expanded into the necessary terminals in the correct order.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t12. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t12.\n\nFrom the grammar, some non-terminals are assigned to terminals. Let's list all non-terminals and their terminal assignments:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT5 -> 't2'\n\nNT13 -> 't39'\n\nNT21 -> 't13'\n\nNT28 -> 't4'\n\nNT29 -> 't36'\n\nNT1 -> 't24'\n\nNT31 -> 't91'\n\nNT6 -> 't16'\n\nNT17 -> 't33'\n\nNT19 -> 't13'\n\nNT37 -> 't12'\n\nNT51 -> 't90'\n\nNT45 -> 't11'\n\nNT23 -> 't7'\n\nNT38 -> 't51'\n\nNT52 -> 't44'\n\nAnd others, but I think only some are terminals.\n\nSo, in the first token, t12. Looking at the grammar, NT37 -> 't12'? Wait, yes, looking at the grammar, I see NT37 -> NT19 NT19. Oh, that's a non-terminal, not a terminal. No, wait, NT37 has two productions:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nand\n\nNT37 -> NT12 NT16\n\nWait, no, looking back, lines like NT37 -> NT12 NT16, but wait, did I copy that correctly?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The user provided the grammar correctly. Looking at NT37's productions:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nand\n\nLooking at line: NT37 -> NT19 NT19 and another line: NT36 -> NT5 NT30.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, from the user's grammar, NT37 has two productions:\n\nLine: NT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nand another line: NT37 -> NT12 NT16\n\nSo, yes, NT37 can expand to either NT19 NT19 or NT12 NT16.\n\nBut wait, NT12 is also a non-terminal, right? So, for the first token, t12, which is a terminal. So, we have to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't12' as a terminal.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given with several production rules. Each non-terminal (like S, NT15, NT50, etc.) is rewritten into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, such as t38, t63, etc. The start symbol is S, and I need to see if the string can be derived from S using these rules.\n\nThe string provided is: `t38 t63 t91 t38 t13 t54 t16 t31 t36 t54 t54 t13 t54 t12 t91 t83 t48 t6 t67 t7 t90 t63 t18 t6 t16 t24`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that each rule has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-481","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Hmm, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which then breaks down into various non-terminals each expanding into pairs of NTs or terminals. The string to check is a sequence of terminal symbols like 't90', 't27', etc.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string using the grammar. Each step should reduce the string by matching the start symbol S and applying the productions. Since the string starts with 't90', I need to find where 't90' is defined in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT52, and NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. Wait, but where's 't90'? Scanning the NT productions, I notice NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. Let me check NT50's productions. Oh, I see NT50 \u2192 't33'. So NT50 is a terminal here. But wait, 't90' isn't directly a production. Maybe it's derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLet me check the NT productions again. Wait, NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20, but that's in the terminal side as well. I need to see if any NT produces 't90'. Looking at the list, I find NT50 \u2192 't33' and NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', etc. Hmm, 't90' appears as a terminal in NT51 \u2192 't90'. Yes, under NT51: NT51 \u2192 't90' and also NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20.\n\nSo, 't90' comes from NT51. Now, looking at how NT51 is derived: NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20. NT50 \u2192 't33' and NT20 \u2192 't50' (since NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT24, and NT10 \u2192 't50', as NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, and NT50 \u2192 't33', NT30 \u2192 't39', but wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me approach this step by step. The string starts with 't90', which is 't90', so the first step is to match NT51 \u2192 't90'. So, the string starts with NT51.\n\nThen, the remaining string after 't90' is 't54 t83 t33 t67 t54 t31 t54 t12 t12 t91 t16 t24 t48 t6 t6 t90 t67 t6 t31 t63 t91 t33 t16 t90 t38 t63'.\n\nWait, no, the string is a single long string. Let me make sure I'm parsing it correctly. The initial string is:\n\nt90 t54 t83 t33 t67 t54 t31 t54 t12 t12 t91 t16 t24 t48 t6 t6 t90 t67 t6 t31 t63 t91 t33 t16 t90 t38 t63.\n\nBut each NT production can only derive two symbols. So, let's see if the entire string can be generated as a leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So first, S must be split into NT15 and NT43.\n\nNow, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT15 becomes NT37 and NT15. Then, NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So NT37 is NT19 NT19. Then, NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38. So NT19 is NT12 and NT38. Continuing this, NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. So NT12 is NT21 and NT48. NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT50. So NT21 is NT13 and NT50. NT13 \u2192 NT69, which is a terminal. NT50 \u2192 't33'. So so far, NT15's expansion is leading to terminals t69 and t33.\n\nWait, but wait, each step of the grammar expansion produces two symbols. So, for NT15, which is A \u2192 BC, each step produces two symbols. So S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so S expands to two parts: NT15 and NT43.\n\nThen each part continues to expand as per their productions. Each step should double the number of parts until terminals are reached.\n\nBut this can get really long. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the string contains only the terminals present in the grammar and see if their order can fit into the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: 't90 t54 t83 t33 t67 t54 t31 t54 t12 t12 t91 t16 t24 t48 t6 t6 t90 t67 t6 t31 t63 t91 t33 t16 t90 t38 t63'.\n\nI notice 't90' appears multiple times. We saw earlier that 't90' comes from NT51 \u2192 't90'. So 't90' must be generated by NT51.\n\nSo let's track the 't90's:\n\nFirst 't90' is generated by NT51 \u2192 't90'. So then, the remaining part after 't90' would need to be 't54 t83 t33 t67 t54 t31 t54 t12 t12 t91 t16 t24 t48 t6 t6 t90 t67 t6 t31 t63 t91 t33 t16 t90 t38 t63'.\n\nWait, that's quite complex. Maybe I should look for known sequences in the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be parsed step by step using the CFG. Let's see if the string can be divided into pairs as per the productions.\n\nEach production in the grammar either terminates (A \u2192 a) or splits into two (A \u2192 BC). Since each production is two non-terminals or a terminal, each step reduces the length by one (because one non-terminal is replaced by two symbols). The length of the input string is 30, so the number of steps needed is 29. But that's a lot to do manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns in the grammar and the string. For example, looking for where 't90' appears, which is from NT51, and NT51 also leads to NT50 NT20.\n\nSo 't90' is NT51, which splits into NT50 and NT20. NT50 \u2192 't33', so we get 't90 t33', but wait, the string after 't90' includes 't54', which isn't 't33', so that might complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT50's productions. Oh, right, NT50 \u2192 't33', but also NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. Hmm, so NT50 can be either 't33' or two other non-terminals. So in NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20, it could be a mix of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, after 't90' comes 't54', not 't33'. So that suggests that maybe the NT50 is not used directly. Alternatively, perhaps 't90' comes from another pathway.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any NTs produce 't54'. Looking at the NT productions, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't54'. So that's a problem. Or perhaps 't54' comes from a combination of non-terminals.\n\nLooking deeper, 't54' must come from an NT that produces it. Checking the NT productions, I see NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38. So let's see:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\nNT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48\nNT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29\nNT51 \u2192 't90'\nWait, no, NT51 is split into NT50 and NT20, and NT50 \u2192 't33' and NT20 \u2192 't50' (since NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT24, which can be 't50'? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-480","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the rules seem to fit that form. For example, S \u2192 NT15 NT43 is a production with two non-terminals on the right side, which is allowed in CNF. There are also rules that produce terminals like NT25 \u2192 't7', which are terminals as per the rules.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t54 t88 t6 t6 t72 t33 t33 t16 t39 t72 t33 t11 t7 t83 t18 t6 t16 t37 t83 t67 t7 t83 t48 t6 t90 t63 t33`.\n\nThis string has 27 tokens, all of which seem to be terminal symbols (they end with 't' followed by a number). So, the question is whether this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me break down the approach I'll take:\n\n1. **Understand the Structure of the Grammar**: Since the grammar is CNF, each production expands a single non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, any valid string derived from this grammar will have a length that's compatible with the number of productions applied.\n\n2. **Check for Direct Derivations**: The first thing to note is that each step in the derivation increases the string length by 1. For example, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which, when expanded further, would split each of those into more symbols. The string provided has 27 symbols, so the derivation must have at least 26 steps (since the start symbol is one symbol, and each step adds one via leftmost derivation in CNF).\n\n3. **Focus on Productions that Turn Non-Terminals into Terminals**: Looking through the grammar, there are several productions that directly produce terminals. For example:\n   - NT25 \u2192 't7'\n   - NT31 \u2192 't91' etc.\n   So, any path from the start to the string must eventually use these rules to eliminate the non-terminals.\n\n4. **Construct a Possible Derivation Path**: I need to see if the given string can be built by chaining these terminal productions together in a way that mirrors the grammar's structure.\n\n5. **Examine the String Structure**: The string has several repetitions: 't72', 't33', 't83', etc. This suggests that some non-terminals produce these terminal strings, or combinations thereof.\n\n6. **Trace Backwards from the String**: Maybe starting from the end and seeing if the terminal symbols can be the results of the grammar's rules. For example, looking at the last token, `t33`, I can check all productions that produce 't33'. From the grammar, I see that NT30 \u2192 't33', so one way is if the last non-terminal before the last symbol was NT30.\n\n7. **Check Dependencies**: For each token in the string, we need to ensure that it can be produced by some non-terminal, and that the preceding symbols can be derived by the left context required.\n\n8. **Potential Challenges and Simplifications**:\n   - The string has 27 tokens, which is a lot. It might be helpful to see if the grammar produces a certain pattern or language.\n   - Considering that the grammar is a set of rules without any obvious loops or easy patterns, it might be tricky to derive a conclusion without a step-by-step expansion.\n\n9. **Alternative Approach - Attempt Leftmost Derivation**:\n   - Starting from S, each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal with a right-hand side of one of its productions. The challenge is that without knowing the exact steps, it's hard to track. However, considering the string is quite long, manually trying to trace it might not be feasible.\n\n10. **Alternative Idea - Check for Consistent Use of Productions**:\n    - Each production can be thought of as a way to generate a part of the string. For example, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so the string starts with NT15 followed by NT43. So, the first two symbols after 't' must come from NT15 and NT43.\n\n11. **Looking at the String Tokens**:\n    - The first token is 't54'. So, looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't54'. scrolling through the grammar, I see NT13 \u2192 't39', NT23 \u2192 't7', etc. Wait, 't54' isn't directly produced by any production in the given grammar. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. Let me check the provided grammar again. Did I miss the production for NT24 or NT54?\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe grammar provided has NT24 \u2192 't55' and NT24 \u2192 't5', but no production for 't54'. So, if the string starts with 't54', there's no rule in the grammar that produces 't54'. That would mean the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol is 't54' without any corresponding production rule.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the grammar provided. Because in the grammar, most of the symbols are set to specific terminals, like NT25\u2192't7', NT27\u2192't17', etc. I don't see a rule that produces 't54'.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I overlooked a rule. Let me scroll through the grammar again:\n\nLooking at the production lines, I see:\n\nNT50\u2192't33'\nNT25\u2192't7'\nNT36\u2192't84' (so t84 is from NT36)\nNT19\u2192't13' (so t13 from NT19)\nNT0\u2192't39'\nNT4\u2192't48'\nNT9\u2192't28'\nNT5\u2192't2'\nNT4\u2192't48' again\nNT29\u2192't63'\nNT4\u2192't88'\nNT9\u2192't28'\nNT7\u2192't7'\n\nWait, NT4\u2192't48' is appearing twice, but that might be a typo. Wait, let me check line by line.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe grammar lines include:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\n\n...\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT17 NT45\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT9\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 (so NT19 has another production?)\n\nWait, that's a cycle in the grammar. NT19 can be rewritten as itself and NT51. But let's check line NT19\u2192'NT12 NT38':\n\nWait, no, the specific lines:\n\nLooking for 't54', but in the grammar, the only production that creates a terminal is something like NT37\u2192't12', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't54'. So 't54' must be derived from NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, which can loop indefinitely. But for 't54' to appear, it must come from NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, then NT51 would be some other rule, but looking for NT51, we have NT51\u2192't90' (from the line NT51\u2192't90')\u2014no, wait. Let me look again:\n\nLooking for NT51 in the grammar:\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20 (line: NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20)\n\nAnd NT50 \u2192 't33' (from NT50 \u2192 't33')\n\nAnd NT20 \u2192 NT30 NT24 (looking for NT20\u2192't' something else).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in looking for the production of 't54'. Let me re-examine the given grammar:\n\nThe user provided a lot of grammar lines, but after checking:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't33'\n- NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 (cycle)\nNT24 \u2192 't55' and 't5'\nNT21 \u2192 't99'\n\nLooking for any production that results in 't54' - it doesn't seem to exist. So in the given grammar, the non-terminals that produce terminals are:\n\nNT9\u2192't28', NT4\u2192't48', NT28\u2192't4', etc.\n\nBut no non-terminal directly produces 't54'. So the first symbol in the string is 't54', but in the grammar, there's no rule where a non-terminal directly goes to 't54'.

{"custom_id":"request-499","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t67 t2 t83 t88 t6 t6 t11 t11 t7 t83 t12 t12 t13 t54 t54 t13 t91 t83 t48 t6 t11 t13 t54 t13 t18 t6 t16 t24`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. So, all rules should have two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that all the production rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal terminal (like NT52 \u2192 't44'), so it fits CNF.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. The CYK algorithm is efficient for parsing context-free grammars and works in O(n^3) time where n is the length of the string. \n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Initialize the CYK table**: The table will have dimensions (n+1) x (n+1) where n is the length of the string. Each cell will represent possible non-terminals that can generate the substring for that cell.\n\n2. **Fill in the table**: Starting with the base case where each character is in its own cell, then expanding to larger substrings.\n\n3. **Check if the start symbol (S) is in the last cell**: If the start symbol is present in the bottom-right cell of the table, the string is accepted.\n\nBut before I proceed, I have to note that the provided grammar has a lot of production rules, some leading to terminals with strings like 't44', 't6', etc., and others with two non-terminals. This means that the grammar defines a set of possible sequences of these terminals.\n\nHowever, the string provided starts with `t67 t2 t83...` and so on, ending with `t24`. So, the first step is to check which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't44'\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't5'\n- NT24 \u2192 't18'\n- NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32\n- NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31\n- NT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35\n- NT35 \u2192 NT37 NT37\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n- NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\n- NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48\n- NT8 \u2192 NT40 NT49\n- NT4 \u2192 NT26 NT2\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34\n- NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4\n- NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21\n- NT34 \u2192 NT28 NT5\n- NT5 \u2192 NT2\n- And so on... \n\nWait, I need to find the non-terminals that can produce the terminals in the string. Let's break down the string:\n\nLooking at the string: `t67 t2 t83 t88 t6 t6 t11 t11 t7 t83 t12 t12 t13 t54 t54 t13 t91 t83 t48 t6 t11 t13 t54 t13 t18 t6 t16 t24`.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals. The first terminal is `t67`. I need to find what non-terminals can derive `t67`. Looking through the rules, I see that NT52 \u2192 't44' and NT44 \u2192 't6', but there's no rule that directly gives 't67'. Wait, that's odd. So if 't67' isn't produced by any production rule in the grammar, then the entire string can't be generated. But let's check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule that produces 't67'. All terminals seem to be like 't2', 't5', 't6', etc., up to 't91', but I don't recall any 't67' being produced. So if 't67' is not in the terminal symbols of the grammar, then the string can't be generated. \n\nWait, let me check the rules again. The NT rules have the form of either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for example, NT52 \u2192 't44', which is a direct terminal, and other rules go through non-terminals.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is `t67`, which would only be possible if there's a production rule where NTx \u2192 't67'. Since I don't see any such rule, the immediate conclusion is that the string cannot be generated because the first symbol is 't67', which isn't present in any production of the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe 't67' can be derived via multiple steps. For example, maybe a non-terminal that can produce 't6' could lead to 't67' if combined with another. But looking at the rules, the only way to produce 't6' is through NT44 \u2192 't6', and there's no rule that directly uses 't6' as a terminal in any production except NT44.

{"custom_id":"request-503","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens like t16, t38, etc., and the grammar seems to be in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where B, C, A are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is quite large with many non-terminals, each expanding into pairs of non-terminals or terminals. The string starts with t16, which suggests that the starting symbol S must derive the beginning of the string, starting with t16. Looking at the grammar, S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if S can produce the sequence starting with t16. Let's start by looking at the productions for NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, that seems like it's recursive. So NT15 could expand into NT37 followed by more NT15s. But NT37 has productions like NT37 -> NT19 NT19. So that would produce t19 twice. Hmm, but the string starts with t16, so maybe I'm going down the wrong path here.\n\nWait, hold on. NT15's production is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So each expansion of NT15 adds another NT15 after NT37. So NT15 would be NT37 NT37 NT37... and so on, since NT37 -> NT19 NT19, each NT19 -> t13 (from NT19's production: NT19 -> 't13'). So NT15 would expand to a sequence of t13's. But the string starts with t16, not t13. That doesn't match, so maybe NT15 isn't the right path. Alternatively, perhaps the NT43 part is where the t16 token comes from.\n\nWait, the string starts with t16, so let's see how t16 is produced. Looking at the grammar, NT28 has a production NT28 -> 't67'. But that's t67, not t16. However, NT6 -> 't16' (from NT4 -> 't48', but no, looking through the productions for terminals, I see NT16 -> 't16'. Oh, wait, in the terminal productions, there's NT16 -> 't16'. So if a non-terminal can expand directly to t16, then that's a possibility.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT16, it's directly defined as NT16 -> 't16'. So if the string starts with t16, perhaps that non-terminal is used. So perhaps S starts with NT16 NT43, but wait, the initial S is NT15 NT43. Maybe I'm confused. Wait, no, the first symbol is S, which goes to NT15 NT43. So S -> NT15 NT43. So the first symbols would be the expansions of NT15 and NT43.\n\nSo let's try to see how NT15 can lead to the first token t16. But from above, NT15 expands to NT37 NT15, so NT37 is next. Wait, no, wait: S -> NT15 NT43. So the expansion is in two parts: the left side (NT15) and the right side (NT43). So for the string to start with t16, perhaps one of these NTs produces t16, but looking at the productions, only NT16 directly produces t16. So that suggests that either NT15 or NT43 must expand to t16.\n\nBut NT15 itself can't produce t16 directly. Let me check the productions for NT15: it's only NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So it's recursive and can't terminate without producing terminals. Similarly, NT43: from the grammar, NT43 -> NT6 NT1 and NT43 -> 't44'.\n\nWait, I see in the grammar: NT43 -> 't44' (from line NT49 -> NT47 NT27, but wait, looking more carefully, no\u2014looking at the provided grammar, in the list of productions, I see NT43 -> 't44' as a separate production. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I see lines like NT15 -> NT37 NT15; then, later, NT43 has two productions: NT43 -> NT6 NT1 and NT43 -> 't44'. So NT43 can produce 't44' directly.\n\nSo S -> NT15 NT43, so the first part is NT15 and the second is NT43. So the right part, NT43, can expand to 't44'. But in the string, the first token is 't16'. So perhaps I've made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT43 part can't be 't44' because the string starts with 't16', so maybe I must find another way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting confused with the initial step. Let me trace it again.\n\nThe string starts with t16, so the entire expansion must produce this token. Since S starts with NT15 and NT43, perhaps NT43 is the one that produces t16.\n\nWait, looking back, yes, NT43 can produce 't44' directly, but that's not t16. So maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the starting point. Let me check if NT43 can produce t16. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT43 -> 't16'. Only NT16 -> 't16'. So that suggests that neither NT15 nor NT43 directly produce t16. So the initial expansion of S leads to something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the NTs. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking for a way that t16 appears in the expansion. The string is t16 t38 t63 t12 t13 t90 t54 t33 t67 t12 t33 t11 t33 t11 t33 t67 t91 t83 t48 t6 t6 t67 t91 t83 t48 t6 t16 t24.\n\nWait, the last part is t16, followed by t24. t24 is the result of NT24 producing 't55' directly, as in the grammar line NT24 -> 't55'.\n\nSo perhaps the expansion leads to t16 in the end. But how? Since the initial S leads to NT15 and NT43, perhaps NT43 is the one that eventually produces t16. But earlier, I thought NT43 can produce 't44', but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps NT43 can produce t16 through a series of expansions. Let's see. NT43 has two options: it can go to NT6 NT1 or 't44'. The 't44' is a terminal, so that's a possible end.\n\nSo, if we take the 't44' option for NT43, the second symbol would be t44, but the string starts with t16, not t44. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the initial expansion isn't using the 't44' production.\n\nSo, the first symbol after S would be NT15, which must expand to something. Let's see. NT15 can only expand to NT37 NT15, recursively, which would generate a series of t13s. Because NT37 is NT19 NT19, and NT19 is 't13', so each NT37 would produce t13 t13. So, NT15 would produce t13s and another NT15, which in turn would produce more t13s and more NT15s.\n\nThus, the string starting with t16 can't be derived from this path because NT15 would lead to t13s. So, the initial assumption is that the string can't be derived from S -> NT15 NT43 because NT15 would produce t13, not t16.\n\nBut then, that would mean the answer is 'No'. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the other options.\n\nLooking at the other non-terminals, perhaps NT28 can produce 't67' (NT28 -> 't67'), and NT28 is in the grammar. But the string starts with t16, so that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, there's a production where NT44 -> 't16'. Let me check that. Yes, in the list of terminal productions, I see NT16 -> 't16'. Wait, does any NT eventually lead to NT16?\n\nWait, looking further,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need a better approach.\n\nInstead of looking for all 'tX' productions, maybe I should track the string and see which parts can be derived.\n\nThe string starts with t67. So, in the grammar, which production generates 't67'? Looking through all the production rules, I see:\n\nLooking for 't67' in any production, it seems that:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't67' (line 23): NT28 \u2192 t67\n\nSo, t67 can be derived from NT28. So, the first token in the string is t67, which would correspond to NT28. Now, the rest of the string must be generated from the other part of S's production, which is NT43.\n\nSo, the next part after t67 is t2 t83 t12 t16 t38 t36 t99 t6 t13 t38 t36 t33 t67 t12 t91 t83 t88 t6 t11 t12 t16 t31 t63 t88 t6 t6 t16 t24.\n\nWait, no. The entire string is S's expansion, so it's two parts: the first part is derived from NT15, and the second from NT43.\n\nWait, S produces NT15 NT43, so in the string, it should be a sequence where first part is generated by NT15, and then the next part by NT43. So the string is divided into two segments: the first is derived from NT15, the second from NT43.\n\nSo the entire string is structured as [NT15-derived string] [NT43-derived string].\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t67. So, I need to see if t67 is part of NT15 or NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15's production: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (line 17). That suggests that NT15 is left-recursive, so it can be expanded indefinitely, producing more NT15s. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for the breakdown.\n\nAlternatively, since NT15 produces NT37 NT15, which can go on, maybe it's not directly producing a terminal. So, perhaps the first part starts with NT15, but how would it derive t67? Because if NT15 cannot produce t67 directly, then the first part must come from another route.\n\nBut the string starts with t67, which is from NT28. So, perhaps NT15 somehow produces a string that includes t67 as part of it. But not directly.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the grammar, step by step.\n\nThe string is: t67 t2 t83 t12 t16 t38 t36 t99 t6 t13 t38 t36 t33 t67 t12 t91 t83 t88 t6 t11 t12 t16 t31 t63 t88 t6 t6 t16 t24.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t67. From the grammar, t67 can only come from NT28 \u2192 t67 (line 23).\n\nSo the first token is derived from NT28, so the next part must be part of the same NT28 expansion. Wait, but NT28 can produce t67, but once t67 is produced, the rest of the string must be part of that same NT28.\n\nWait, no, because in the grammar, each production is a split. So, the entire string should be the concatenation of two parts: one derived from NT15 and the other from NT43.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so the string is [NT15-derived] [NT43-derived].\n\nThus, the string should be split into two parts, each part being derived from either NT15 or NT43.\n\nLet me check if the entire string can be divided into two such parts.\n\nThe total length is 32 tokens. Maybe the first part is up to a certain point, and the second continues from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with some part generated by NT15 and ends with some part generated by NT43.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can try to split the string into two parts where each part can be generated by a respective non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each production leads to a certain number of tokens, and I can see if the counts add up.\n\nBut this is time-consuming.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky normal form means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, all the productions indeed fit this structure. That's helpful because it makes parsing easier, maybe with a CYK algorithm or something similar.\n\nBut honestly, parsing such a long string with a context-free grammar in CNF might be tedious manually. Maybe I can look for patterns or see which rules generate certain terminals. Alternatively, see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the rules.\n\nLet me look at the string: it starts with `t54`, `t83`, `t89`, and so on. The string has a lot of 't's with numbers as subscripts. Let me see if these correspond to any production rules. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice some terminals are mentioned in the productions. For example:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't44'\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't5'\n- NT13 \u2192 't39'\n- NT28 \u2192 't67'\n- NT0 \u2192 't39', 't30' perhaps from multiple rules?\n  \nWait, checking NT0: its productions include NT52 NT20, and NT30 NT20 as well. Also, looking at the string, I see multiple 't39's. Let me see if 't39' is generated by any non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT13 \u2192 't39' and NT0 \u2192 't39' via both of its productions. So both NT13 and NT0 can generate t39.\n\nIn the string, there are several 't39's. Let me try to see if they are connected.\n\nAlso, looking for other terminals:\n\n- 't83' is in NT32 \u2192 a production, but wait, let's check the grammar. Wait, I think in the grammar, NT32 has a production: NT32 \u2192 NT25 NT46, and another one NT32 \u2192 't83'. So yes, NT32 can generate 't83' directly. Similarly, NT30 has some terminal rules like 't40' via NT40 \u2192 t65, but wait, looking again, NT30 appears in some productions that lead to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t54, t83, t89, t39, t39, t72, t67, t2, t83, t67, t2, t83, t48, t6, t11, t2, t83, t55, t6, t16, t3, t3, t72, t33, t33, t16, t31, t31, t36.\n\nLet's try to break it down into chunks based on the grammar. Since in CNF, each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals, the string should be parsed as a sequence of such steps.\n\nBut considering the string is about 30 tokens long, it's difficult without a systematic approach. Maybe I can look for specific sequences.\n\nFirst, t54: does any non-terminal produce 't54'? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces t54. Let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, NT23 \u2192 't50' is a production, but that's t50, not t54. Similarly, NT19 \u2192 't13' and 't38', but again, not t54. Could 't54' come from a combination? Wait, perhaps via a non-terminal that leads to another non-terminal that produces 't54'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't54' is part of a two-step production, like A \u2192 B C, where B is another non-terminal and C is also another, perhaps generating 't50', and then 't50' would be part of another production.\n\nWait, NT52 \u2192 't44', and NT44 \u2192 't6', so 't44' followed by 't6'? But in the string, we have 't54', which isn't either of these.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Or perhaps 't54' is part of a non-terminal that's involved in a chain.\n\nWait, looking for 't54' in the productions. Let me scan through the grammar:\n\nYes, the production NT23 \u2192 't50' is there, but 't54' isn't directly produced. Wait, is 't54' produced by any rule? Let me check all the 'a's.\n\nLooking again: the only terminals are t2, t5, t6, t11, t13, t16, t17, t23, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t31, t32, t33, t36, t37, t38, t39, t40, t41, t42, t43, t44, t45, t46, t47, t48, t49, t50, t51, t52, t53, t54, t55, t56, t57, t58, t59, t60, t61, t62, t63, t64, t65, t66, t67, t68, t69, t70, t71, t72, t73, t74, t75, t76, t77, t78, t79, t80, t81, t82, t83, t84, t85, t86, t87, t88, t89, t90.\n\nWait, there's no direct production for t54. So perhaps 't54' must be part of a two-step production. Let me see if any non-terminal produces a form that includes 't54'.\n\nLooking through all production rules, I see NT23 \u2192 't50'. NT50 has a production to 't33', which comes from NT10 \u2192 't50' via NT23 \u2192 't50' again.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for sequences where two non-terminals produce the required terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't54' is part of a rule that isn't directly a terminal but combines two non-terminals. For example, one non-terminal could produce 't54'... but I don't see any such rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the start symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT15 with some terminal. Let me check the grammar: S \u2192 NT15 NT15 \u2192 something? Wait no, looking back, the grammar says S -> NT15 NT15? Wait, in the provided grammar, the first line is S -> NT15 NT15. Wait, no, the first line is S -> NT15 NT15, but wait, actually, looking back:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nGrammar: \nS -> NT15 NT15 \nNT50 -> NT1 NT32 \n... [many more rules] ...\n\nSo S produces NT15 followed by NT15. But in the provided grammar, each production is A -> BC or A -> a. Looking at NT15:\n\nFrom the full grammar list, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that doesn't terminate with a terminal. So NT15 might be a recursive non-terminal that could produce t39. That could be a possibility.\n\nWait, let me look at NT15 in the grammar. The user didn't provide it. Wait, let me go back.\n\nWait, the grammar starts as:\n\nS -> NT15 NT15\nNT50 -> NT1 NT32\nNT52 -> NT6 NT25\n...\nLooking further down:\n\nWait, the user's full grammar is a bit jumbled, but I think the rest includes, for example, NT15 has a production NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT15 can't directly produce a terminal, but perhaps via other steps.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm miscounting.

{"custom_id":"request-541","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the left with two non-terminals on the right. The string to check is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token is either a string or a number, but from the grammar, it looks like terminals are either single-character tokens or multi-character combinations. Wait, no, in the grammar, the rules have two non-terminals on the right side, except when a terminal occurs as a single token. Looking at the grammar, some rules produce single terminals, like NT44 -> 't6', so the terminals are strings like 't16', 't24', etc. So each of these is a terminal in the string.\n\nThe string is: `t16 t31 t54 t38 t13 t33 t11 t12 t12 t88 t44 t6 t99 t87 t38 t31 t13 t13 t87 t90 t67 t6 t38 t63 t91 t33 t67 t6 t16 t24`\n\nSo the string is a series of these 't' followed by numbers, each separated by a space. Now, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nFirst, the grammar's start symbol is S. The first production for S is S -> NT15 NT43. So S can be split into two parts: NT15 and NT43. Therefore, the first symbols of the string must be generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t16. So I need to see if t16 is in the left-hand side (LHS) of any production for NT15 or NT43. Wait, no, the LHS is a non-terminal, and the RHS is a combination of other non-terminals. The terminals are the 't' strings.\n\nWait, no, wait. In the grammar, the terminals are represented as 't' followed by numbers. So for example, NT24 can produce 't5', or other combinations. So the string starts with t16. So I need to see if NT15 can produce t16, but looking at the grammar, NT15 is a non-terminal. Let's see which productions end with t16. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT16 -> t3\n- NT31 -> t91\n- NT6 -> t16\n- Also, NT50 -> t33, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see that NT6 produces t16. So if a production rule has NT6, it can be replaced by t16. So in the string, t16 could be the result of NT6.\n\nBut looking back, the first two symbols are t16 and t31. Since S -> NT15 NT43, I need to see what NT15 and NT43 can produce. So the first symbol must be generated by NT15, and the second by NT43, or they can be in any order, but in the context of the grammar, since it's a CFG in CNF, each production of the starting non-terminal will generate the string in a tree structure.\n\nWait, no, S is a single start symbol that expands into NT15 and NT43, so the string is the concatenation of the two sequences generated by NT15 and NT43. So the first part, t16, must come from NT15, and the second part, t31, must come from NT43? Or can it be in any order?\n\nWait, no, the entire string is a single expansion of S. But S is NT15 NT43. So the entire string is the concatenation of the expansion of NT15 and the expansion of NT43. So the entire string is two parts: first from NT15, then from NT43.\n\nSo first, the string must start with the expansion of NT15, then the expansion of NT43.\n\nLooking at the first symbol t16, it's part of NT15's expansion. So I need to see if NT15 can produce a sequence that starts with t16.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT15: NT15 can produce t6 (I think). Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Wait, no, let me list all NT15:\n\nFrom the given grammar, looking for NT15:\n\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n- Also, any others?\n\nWait, actually, looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT15:\n\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n- And also, perhaps others? No, maybe just this.\n\nWait, but how do we get a terminal like t16 or t31 from NT15? Because if NT15 only has NT rules, then to get a terminal, we must have a production of NT15 that directly outputs a terminal. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any production where NT15 directly becomes a terminal. It seems that NT15 is a non-terminal that continues expanding. So unless there's a way to derive a terminal from NT15, which would mean that NT15 must ultimately derive a terminal string, but in the grammar, NT15 only seems to have rules that produce more non-terminals. For example, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So it can't directly produce t16.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT15 has a production: NT15 -> NT37 NT15.\n\nIs there any other rule for NT15? Let me check the list:\n\nLooking for NT15: The given rules are:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nSo it's a recursive rule, meaning that NT15 can only produce more NT15, which loops. So unless there's another production for NT15 that produces a terminal, it can't generate a terminal string. Therefore, NT15 can only generate strings that are expansions of recursive NT15, leading to an infinite loop, not a finite string.\n\nTherefore, the initial assumption that S can generate a string starting with t16, which must be part of NT15's expansion, is impossible because NT15 can't produce a terminal string. This would imply that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's another rule for NT15 that I didn't look at correctly. Let me go through the entire grammar list.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT15 has: NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nNo other rules for NT15. So NT15 can only expand into more NT15, which would make it impossible to reach a terminal. Therefore, the string can't start with t16 because NT15 can't produce t16.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps NT15 can produce through a series of rules that eventually lead to a terminal. Let me see.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the entire string is a sequence of symbols that are part of the grammar's productions, but perhaps each part comes from different non-terminals.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me parse the string step by step. The string starts with t16, then t31, etc. Since S is NT15 NT43, the string is split into two: the first part from NT15 and the second from NT43.\n\nLet's see: t16 is the start of the first part from NT15. But since NT15 only has NT37 and NT15 as its own rule, it can never produce a terminal, so t16 can't be part of NT15's expansion. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try to see if any NT15 has a terminal production. Looking again at the provided rules:\n\nLooking for NT15's productions:\n\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nNo other NT15 productions except that one. So no, it can't produce a terminal. Therefore, the entire string can't be generated because the first part from NT15 can't produce t16.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is part of NT43. Let me check.\n\nWait, no. S -> NT15 NT43, so the entire string must be the expansion of NT15 followed by the expansion of NT43. So t16 must come from NT15, which can't produce any terminal, hence the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but the user's grammar might have a different structure. Let me check all the production rules again for NT15.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar rules:\n\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nNo, that's the only production for NT15.

{"custom_id":"request-538","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I notice that the string is a sequence of tens. Each \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So the string is a series of these terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying productions according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the first production is S -> NT15 NT43. So S must be split into NT15 and NT43, each of which must generate a part of the string. \n\nI should check each of these non-terminals to see how they can expand. NT15 and NT43 will each produce sequences that, when combined, form the entire string. \n\nLet me look at NT15. The production for NT15 is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. That looks like it can be rewritten as NT37 NT15, which suggests that this non-terminal can keep producing more NT37s through repeated application. Since NT15 appears on both sides, it's a recursive rule. \n\nWait, but the string starts with t54, which corresponds to the starting string. Let me see what NT15 and NT43 can produce.\n\nLooking further, NT15's production is NT37 NT15. So each time this is applied, we add an NT37 to the front. How does NT37 expand? \n\nNT37 has two productions: NT37 -> NT19 NT19 and NT37 -> NT19 NT19. Wait, no, looking back, NT37 actually has two different productions:\n1. NT37 -> NT19 NT19\n2. NT37 -> NT19 NT19 (Wait, no, in the grammar, NT37's productions are NT37 -> NT19 NT19 and NT37 -> NT19 NT19? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nand\nNT37 -> NT37 NT37\n\nWait, no, correction: Let me scan the grammar for NT37. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT37 has two rules: \n- NT37 -> NT19 NT19\n- NT37 -> NT37 NT37 \n\nWait, no. Let me look again. \n\nIn the grammar, under NT37, I have:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nNT37 -> NT37 NT37\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, checking the provided grammar:\n\nNT37: two productions? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT37, I see:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nand\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19 (Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I copied it wrong. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, in the user's provided grammar, under NT37, the productions are:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar:\n\n\"NT37 -> NT19 NT19\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\"\n\nWait, that seems to be a mistake because it's duplicated. That's unlikely. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nWhich can't be right. Maybe I'm misreading. Let me search for NT37.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT37 appears under NT37-> NT19 NT19 and another line: \"NT37 -> NT37 NT37\".\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT37 has two rules:\n\n1. NT37 -> NT19 NT19\n2. NT37 -> NT37 NT37\n\nSo, initially, I thought it's produced by two NT19s, but it can also split into two more NT37s recursively.\n\nBut since the string starts with t54, let's see what NT15 and NT43 can produce.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by tracing back from the string to the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t54 t83 t72 t33 t65 t39 t69 t39 t39 t72 t33 t67 t7 t83 t6 t99 t33 t67 t12 t6 t16 t3 t3 t3 t3 t72 t33 t33 t33 t39.\n\nLet me count the tokens. That's 34 tokens. Since the grammar uses Chomsky normal form, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So the derivation could be a tree structure leading to 34 terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to try to split the string into chunks that correspond to the productions of the grammar.\n\nBut that might get complicated. Another way is to use the pumping lemma or other methods for CFGs, but since the string is specific, maybe I can try to derive it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the first few symbols and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t54. Looking in the grammar, the terminals are mapped as:\n\nFor example, NT50 -> 't33', NT10 -> 't50', etc. Wait, no, the grammar ends with rules that map NT and other non-terminals to 't' followed by some number.\n\nLooking for t54, let's see which non-terminal can produce 't54'.\n\nLooking in the grammar:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT19 has NT19 -> 't19' (Wait, no, let me parse the grammar lines correctly.\n\nWait, here's the list of grammar rules:\n\nNT52 -> 't44'\nNT19 -> 't48' (Wait, no, wait. Let me find the lines where NT leads to 't'... For example:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines, I find several where NT or other non-terminals map to 't' followed by a number.

{"custom_id":"request-567","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). This seems a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF looks like. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided starts with S and has various non-terminals on the left side, each pointing to other non-terminals and terminals on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which breaks down into NT15 and NT43. Each of these NTs might have their own productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t13 t6 t99 t12 t12 t12 t38 t31 t54 t16 t38 t67 t6 t38 t63 t91 t91 t83 t55 t6 t11 t13 t38 t54 t6 t16 t33 t11 t12 t54`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived starting from S using the given rules. \n\nOne approach is to parse the string using the grammar, but manually doing that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look at the grammar and see if each terminal in the string can be derived by the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, some NTs directly produce terminals. For example, NT24 \u2192 't5', NT5 \u2192 't2', etc. So, each terminal in the string must come from one of these productions.\n\nI should check each terminal in the string to see if it's covered by any production rule.\n\nLet's go through the string step by step:\n\n1. `t12` - Is there a production for NT12? Looking at the grammar, I see NT12 \u2192 't16'. So, wait, t16, not t12. Hmm, so maybe that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misreading. The NT12's production is NT12 \u2192 't16'. But the string has t12, which is not directly produced by any NT.\n\nWait, did I miss any productions for t12? Let me check the grammar again. I see NT13 \u2192 't39', NT21 \u2192 't99', etc. But nowhere does a NT directly produce t12. Wait, maybe through a chain?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the string. Let me check the string again: It starts with t12, so that's the first token. So if NT12 \u2192 t16, then that means t12 can't be produced by any rule. So the string starts with t12, which can't be derived from any NT in the grammar. That would immediately make the answer No, because the string contains a terminal that's not allowed by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing a production. Let me check the NTs again. NT12 \u2192 't67' as well as NT12 \u2192 't16'. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't16'\nWait, maybe I missed another production. Wait, no, the grammar shows NT12 has two productions: one to 't16' and another to some other NT.\n\nBut t12 is the terminal in the string, so unless there's a production rule that can produce t12 from a non-terminal, t12 can't be part of the language. Looking through all the NTs, it seems none of them directly produce t12. So t12 is not in the terminal set of the grammar. Therefore, the string contains a terminal that the grammar can't produce, making the string invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me double-check. Looking through all the productions, I don't see any NTs that directly produce t12.

{"custom_id":"request-565","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand what each part does. The grammar has rules that start from S and go through various non-terminals until they reach terminals, which are the 't' followed by a number. The string I need to evaluate is a series of these terminals. So the task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's all in CNF, meaning each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That makes things a bit easier because each production only generates at most two symbols, and the derivation process can be thought of as expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals like t13, t54, and so on. My approach should be to see if there's a way to reduce this string back to the start symbol S using the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me write down the string for clarity:\n\nt13 t54 t38 t90 t16 t38 t63 t12 t11 t2 t83 t6 t6 t16 t39 t39 t41 t48 t6 t6 t67 t7 t83 t88 t31 t36 t33 t33 t16 t3 t2.\n\nWait, that's a long string with 37 tokens. Since each rule in the grammar produces either two non-terminals or a terminal, the length of the string must be a power of 2 times the starting number of symbols. But looking at the starting production, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which gives S as NT15 NT43. So, the initial expansion is two symbols, which are themselves non-terminals. Each of these can expand further.\n\nWait, but when I'm reducing, the string is built from the bottom up. So to see if the string is in the language, I should try to find a way to break it down into the corresponding non-terminals, working my way back to S.\n\nLooking at the rules, I can see that each non-terminal eventually breaks down into terminals and other non-terminals. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, which has a recursive rule. The same goes for NT37 and others.\n\nGiven the string, I need to pick the first symbol and see what non-terminal it's derived from. Let's start with the first token, t13. Looking at the grammar, t13 is derived from NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48. So the first token t13 comes from NT13, and the second symbol after NT13 would be NT48.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string, the first two tokens are t13 and t54. So if t13 is from NT13 \u2192 t13 followed by something, but in the production, NT13 \u2192 t69 and t91. Wait no, the actual production for NT21 is NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48, which when expanded gives t13 followed by t91 (but t91 isn't in the string...). Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar rules, I see that several non-terminals map directly to terminals. For example, NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48, which then in another rule, NT13 is mapped to t69, and NT48 to t41. But in the string, the first two symbols are t13 and t54. So t13 isn't directly a terminal unless there's a rule for that. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, I don't see t13 as a terminal. The terminals are labeled up to t90, etc., but I need to check if any production leads directly to t13.\n\nWait, under the productions, I see NT28 \u2192 t4, but perhaps that's different. Wait no, the way the productions are listed, each is in the form NPT, so I'll have to check which non-terminals map directly to terminals.\n\nWait, let me list the terminals:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see certain rules that lead to terminals. For example, NT52 \u2192 't44', which I think refers to t44. But perhaps I should list all the direct terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t5\n- NT25 \u2192 t39\n- NT30 \u2192 t30 \u2192 but not sure\nWait no, the rules have some that end with t:\n\nWait, the rules have NT13 \u2192 t39, but that's a terminal. Wait, no, looking carefully:\n\nActually, in the productions, some non-terminals map directly to terminals:\n\nFor example:\n- NT21 \u2192 t48\nWait, no, let me go through all the rules.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nThe rules that have 't' as a terminal are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT4 \u2192 t48\n- NT29 \u2192 t63\n- NT9 \u2192 t28\n- NT50 \u2192 t33\n- NT48 \u2192 t87\n- NT36 \u2192 t84\n- NT24 \u2192 t6\n- NT24 \u2192 t5 (wait, there are two productions for NT24: ?)\n\nWait, actually, the rules are a bit hard to parse. Let me look for any NT that directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT2 \u2192 t41.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 \u2192 t48.\n\nNT5 \u2192 t2.\n\nNT9 \u2192 t28.\n\nNT28 \u2192 t6.\n\nNT24 \u2192 t5.\n\nNT13 \u2192 t69.\n\nBut in the string, I see t13 as the first symbol. Wait, t13 is in the string, but is there a rule for NT13?\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLooking for NT13: I see NT23 \u2192 NT2 NT50, NT28 \u2192 t6, but I don't see NT13 anywhere in the left-hand side of a production except perhaps in one rule: wait the rules provided include:\n\nWait, under NT21, it's NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48. So NT13 is on the right-hand side, but not on the left. So perhaps NT13 is a non-terminal, but does any production for NT13 exist?\n\nLooking through the rules, no. So that means that NT13 must be derived from some other non-terminals, perhaps recursively. So if the string starts with t13, that might come from a rule where a non-terminal expands into t13 and something else.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules again, perhaps NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48. If NT13 maps to t13 and NT48 maps to another symbol.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t13, so that must come from a rule where the first symbol is a terminal, and the non-terminal that produces it must have a production that starts with that terminal.\n\nWait, let me consider if any of the non-terminals directly produce t13. Looking through the list, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce t13 as a terminal. So t13 must be coming from a non-terminal that can produce t13 in a single step, but since it's not present, it must be produced by a chain of productions expanding into it.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because t13 is in the string, so perhaps t13 is a terminal? But according to the rules, t13 is a terminal, but wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules provided, I see that the right-hand sides have 't' followed by numbers, so each of these represents a literal terminal in the string. For example, NT24 \u2192 t5, so that's t5 as a terminal.\n\nWait, then in the string, I see t13 as the first token, so there must be a production for a non-terminal that produces t13.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I don't see any NPT where a non-terminal produces t13 directly. So that suggests that either the string is invalid because t13 can't be produced, or perhaps my parsing is off.\n\nWait, looking more closely, perhaps in the rules, there's an NT that produces t13. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all the productions provided:\n\n- I see NT28 \u2192 t6\n- NT26 \u2192 t12\n- NT24 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t28\n- NT29 \u2192 t63\n- NT28 \u2192 t4\nWait, maybe I'm missing some. Let me check.\n\nWait, under NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48, so if NT13 expands into t13 and something else, then the string starts with t13, which would require that NT13 expands directly to t13. So does any production exist for NT13"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The string to evaluate is a sequence of t's with numbers, so I'm assuming each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see how it structure. Starting from the start symbol S, it seems to be broken down into two parts: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, each expansion from S will involve these two NT terminals, which themselves have their own productions.\n\nLooking at NT15 and NT43, I see they each have production rules. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, but wait, there's also another option for NT15 \u2192 NT19 NT30 I think. Let me check. Oh, I see under NT15: it has two options, one with NT37 and another with NT19 NT30. Wait, no, looking again: actually, under NT15, it says NT15 -> NT37 NT15.

Or wait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list, so for example:\n\nNT50 -> NT1 NT32, and so on. For NT15, the options are:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15 | NT24 NT47.\n\nWait no, looking back, the user's grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT15 NT43.\n\nThen, looking through the rules:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nWait, no, the user's list says:\n\nLooking for NT15: \n\nEntire list:\n\nNT15 appears here: \n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nAnother rule for NT15?\n\nNo, scrolling through, I don't see another production for NT15 except for that one that goes to NT37 NT15. Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nNT19: appears in a few rules, like NT19 -> NT12 NT38, etc.\n\nBut for NT15, only that one rule exists.\n\nWait, no, looking again, here are some parts:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nAnd then later, under NT15 again, another rule: no, it doesn't appear. So perhaps NT15 only has one production. Wait, no, looking through the list:\n\nWait, here's a part of the grammar:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nAlso:\n\nLooking through all lines, it's clear that NT15 only has that one rule. So for NT15, it's NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Hmm, that seems like a recursive rule, which might lead to an infinite loop unless another production terminates it.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 has two options:\n\nNT43 -> NT27 NT0 | NT6 NT1.\n\nWait, let me find where NT43 is listed:\n\nLooking through the list, for NT43:\n\nYes, it says:\n\nNT43 -> NT27 NT0 | NT6 NT1.\n\nSo, two options: NT43 can become NT27 NT0 or NT6 NT1.\n\nNow, the string given is a series of t's with numbers. Each t followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So for the grammar to generate the string, each 'tX' must be derived from the appropriate rules.\n\nThe string is: t13 t13 t13 t54 t33 t67 t12 t12 t33 t11 t91 t83 t48 t6 t16 t90 t36 t54 t12 t33 t67 t12 t91 t54 t16 t31 t36 t13 t54 t6 t16 t37.\n\nThat's a lot of terminals. To figure out if the grammar can generate this, I need to see if each t number corresponds to a valid terminal production.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the t terminals in the string: 13,13,13,54,33,67,12,12,33,11,91,83,48,6,16,90,36,54,12,33,67,12,91,54,16,31,36,13,54,6,16,37.\n\nSo all these terminals must be produced by the grammar rules.\n\nNow, the grammar's terminals (look at the '->' ends) include 't's followed by numbers: for example, NT44 \u2192 t6, NT42\u2192t5, NT13\u2192t39, etc. So each terminal 'tX' must correspond to a rule in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminals in the string and see if there's a '->' rule that can produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the terminals are:\n\n- t5: from NT42\n- t6: NT44\n- t7: NT35\n- t12: NT51\n- t19: NT19 (but is that t or NT production? Wait, wait, looking for 'tX' as terminal: each 'tX' must be the result of a production where the RHS is some 'tX' in the start symbol's decomposition.\n\nWait no, each NT's production rules either produce other NTs or terminals. So for example, NT42 \u2192 t5, so whenever NT42 is on the stack, it can be replaced by t5.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, every 'tX' must appear as a terminal in the grammar. Let me list all the terminals in the string and check if they exist in the grammar.\n\nThe terminals in the string are:\n\n13,13,13,54,33,67,12,12,33,11,91,83,48,6,16,90,36,54,12,33,67,12,91,54,16,31,36,13,54,6,16,37.\n\nLet me check each one against the grammar's terminal replacements:\n\nt13: Is there a rule NT13 \u2192 t13?

{"custom_id":"request-580","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars work by starting with a start symbol (usually S) and applying production rules until all symbols are terminals. Each production replaces a non-terminal with other non-terminals or terminals. The process continues until all non-terminals are resolved.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is helpful because it simplifies the structure, making it easier to analyze the derivation steps.\n\nThe given string is: `t13 t13 t16 t90 t12 t7 t33 t11 t13 t18 t6 t67 t7 t87 t33 t11 t12 t6 t67 t2 t38 t36 t33 t11 t13 t67 t2 t83 t48 t6 t16 t24`.\n\nI notice that all the tokens in the string are terminals, which correspond to specific symbols in the grammar. My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol S in the grammar is followed by NT15 and NT43 according to the production S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, the first two symbols after S should be derived from NT15 and NT43, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t13, which corresponds to the terminal derived from NT15. From the grammar, I see that NT15 has a production rule of NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. This is interesting because it's recursive, so it might lead to a repeated structure.\n\nThe second token is t13, which is the terminal derived from NT43. NT43 has a production rule that directly goes to t6 and NT1. Wait, no, looking again, NT43's production is NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. But in the string, the second token is t13. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I need to check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT43's production is NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. But in the string, the second token is t13. That suggests that maybe the second symbol is derived from something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's go back. The first symbol is t13, which comes from NT15. NT15's production is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So, the first token t13 is actually from NT37, because NT15's first part is NT37. So, the t13 would be derived from NT37. Let's check: NT37's production is NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, right? So, t19 would be from NT19. Now, NT19 has two rules: one is NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, and the other is NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38.\n\nSo, the first t13 in the string must be from NT37, which itself is from NT19. Let me see: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So, each t13 here would be the result of NT19 \u2192 NT19 NT19, leading to two t19s. But in the string, it's just t13, which might actually be NT37's first part. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here because of the recursive rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work backwards. Each terminal in the string is a result of a production step. Let me list all the terminals in the string and map them to their non-terminals.\n\nList of terminals in the string:\nt13, t13, t16, t90, t12, t7, t33, t11, t13, t18, t6, t67, t7, t87, t33, t11, t12, t6, t67, t2, t38, t36, t33, t11, t13, t67, t2, t83, t48, t6, t16, t24.\n\nNow, mapping each of these to their non-terminals:\n- t13: NT37\n- t16: NT17\n- t90: NT36\n- t12: NT21\n- t7: NT27\n- t33: NT45\n- t11: NT24\n- t13 again: NT37\n- t18: NT24\n- t6: NT10\n- t67: NT25\n- t7 again: NT27\n- t87: NT26\n- t33 again: NT45\n- t11 again: NT24\n- t12 again: NT21\n- t6 again: NT10\n- t67 again: NT25\n- t2: NT6\n- t38: NT52 (since in the grammar, NT52 \u2192 't44' and also NT52 \u2192 't6 NT25', among others)\n- t36: NT36\n- t33 again: NT45\n- t11 again: NT24\n- t13 again: NT37\n- t67 again: NT25\n- t2 again: NT6\n- t83: NT24 (since NT24 \u2192 't83')\n- t48: NT4 (since NT4 \u2192 't48')\n- t6 again: NT10\n- t16 again: NT17\n- t24: NT24\n\nWait, I might have misassigned some terminals. For example, t36 is mapped to NT36, and from the grammar, NT36 \u2192 NT5 NT30. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.\n\nLet's start constructing the derivation step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nSo, the first expansion is NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first term is t13, which comes from NT37, which is part of NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15.\n\nSo, the first two symbols (t13, t13) might come from NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, expanding into two NT19s. Then, each NT19 could be t13, but let me check: Wait, in the grammar, NT19 has two productions: one leads to t19, and the other leads to something else. So perhaps the first t13 is from NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, and then each NT19 is t13, leading to t19 t19. But in the string, it's just t13, which might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe I need to break it down more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first t13 is from NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, and then NT37 is expanded as t13, followed by another NT15. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string in reverse, starting from the end. Maybe using the CYK algorithm or some form of recursive descent parsing.\n\nLet me try that. Starting from the last symbol, t24, which comes from NT24. Looking at the grammar, NT24 has several productions: NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35, NT24 \u2192 NT8, NT48, etc. Wait, in the grammar, NT24's production includes NT24 \u2192 't83' (from NT24 \u2192 t83). So, the last t24 (t83) is from NT24.\n\nThen, the previous symbol is t48, which is t48 \u2192 NT4 \u2192 't48'. So, t48 comes from NT4.\n\nBefore that, t6 comes from NT10 \u2192 't6'. So, t6 is from NT10.\n\nBefore that, t16 is t16 \u2192 NT17.\n\nSo, let me try to build a parse tree from the end:\n\nt24 (NT24) -> t83 (NT24)\nt48 (NT4) -> t48 (NT4)\nt6 (NT10) -> t6 (NT10)\nt16 (NT17) -> t17 (NT17)\n\nNow, the structure would be t16 is from NT17, t48 from NT4, t6 from NT10, and t24 from NT24. So, these four symbols at the end could be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me see: the third token is t13, then t12, t54, etc. So the second part of the string has 't11' several times. Let me check where t11 could come from. \n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t11. So perhaps the production must come from a longer chain. For example, maybe a combination of NTs leading to t11. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that ends with t11 directly. \n\nSo if 't11' is not present in any production, then any occurrence of 't11' in the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it includes t11, which is not in the terminal productions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing some derivation that leads to t11. Let me try to think: for example, is there a chain of productions that can derive t11? Let's see. \n\nIf 't11' is produced by a non-terminal, say X \u2192 Y \u2192 't11'. But looking at the grammar, every non-terminal's production either goes to another non-terminal or a terminal. So unless there's a non-terminal that can produce 't11', which there isn't, it's impossible. \n\nTherefore, the string contains 't11', which cannot be produced by the given grammar. So the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-607","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is quite long with a series of 't' terms. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal. That should help because I can analyze the grammar structure more systematically.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's a bit complex with many non-terminals (S, NT15, NT50, ..., etc.) and terminals like 't' followed by numbers. The string provided starts with 't13 t12 t12 t12 t12 t91...' and ends with 't3 t72 t6 t16 t37'. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of derivations using the given productions.\n\nThe key idea is to see if each 't' in the string can be generated by the non-terminals defined in the grammar. Each non-terminal might eventually resolve into a sequence of terminals or other non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either an NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 terminal. So, the derivation process will build the string by breaking it down into smaller parts that the grammar can handle.\n\nTo approach this, I think I'll try to see which non-terminals can generate each terminal in the string. For example, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't67'\n- NT19 \u2192 't13' and 't38' (from NT19's productions)\n- NT23 \u2192 't7' and 't30' (but wait, NT23 is a non-terminal, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure)\nWait, no, in the grammar rules, I have to look for 'NTx' productions. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17\n- NT8 \u2192 NT40 NT49\n- NT40 \u2192 NT46 NT27\n- NT49 \u2192 NT47 NT26\n- NT27 \u2192 NT28 NT35 from other rules, like NT0 \u2192 NT52 NT8, but I'm probably overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, looking for direct terminals, like:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT2 \u2192 't41 NT32' Wait, no, some have 't' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT rules and see which produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15 (and also NT15 \u2192 't37'?

But looking deeper, perhaps some NT rules end with 't':\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29\n- NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT4 (wait, NT9 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal? Wait, no, NT9 is a non-terminal because it has rules. Wait, no\u2014 grammar rules all have the left side as NTx, which are non-terminals. The terminals are the 't' strings, like 't13', 't12', etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, I think some rules have 't' as a terminal. For example, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT19 rules: NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38, but wait, 't13' comes from NT19, I think. Wait, I need to look for all rules where the right side can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let's go through each production rule to see which ones are terminals:\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\nLooking for NTx rules where one of the parts is a terminal or leads directly to a terminal:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT6 \u2192 't16'\n- NT17 \u2192 't33'\n- NT19 \u2192 't13' (from NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19? Wait, not directly. Wait, I think I need to list all productions and see which ones are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me approach this differently. For each 't' in the string, I need to find a path in the grammar from the start symbol S to that 't' via production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backwards, reconstructing the possible structure that the string could have.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt13 t12 t12 t12 t12 t91 t83 t12 t12 t38 t38 t54 t13 t13 t16 t90 t36 t33 t67 t91 t69 t69 t69 t72 t33 t33 t16 t3 t3 t72 t6 t16 t37\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Let me see if I can parse this by grouping possible non-terminals.\n\nFirst, 't13' could be produced by NT19, because somewhere in the rules, NT19 produces a terminal. Looking back, NT19 has:\n\nNT19 -> NT51 NT19 and NT19-> NT12 NT38. Wait, but I don't see NT19 directly leading to a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 't13' is produced by NT21: NT21 \u2192 NT38 NT31 or NT21\u2192 NT11, but I don't see NT11. Wait, looking again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me list all the terminals in the grammar by looking at the right-hand sides that are 't' followed by numbers. I'll scan through each production to see which NTs directly produce 't' something.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT29 \u2192 't63'\n- NT50 \u2192 't33'\n- NT12 \u2192 't16' (from NT12 -> NT21 NT48, but wait, NT12's productions are: NT12\u2192 NT21 NT48, NT12\u2192 NT48 NT7, etc. Hmm, so perhaps terminals for NT12 include 't16' in NT12's own production?\n\nWait, actually, no. Because in NT12's productions, are there any 't's? Let me check:\n\n- NT12 ->NT21 NT48 is a production. NT21 also has a production to 't38' and other rules. But in NT12's productions, do any of them directly produce 't's? Looking through the list:\n\nYes, some NT productions might have 't's as part of their right-hand side. For example:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules again:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't67' (wait, is that right? Let me check: NT28 \u2192 't67' is in the third set of rules, near the end: 'NT28 -> 't67''. So NT28 can produce 't67'.\n\nAdditionally, looking through the rules, other NTs might produce 't's:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't13' (is there a direct production where NT19 -> 't13'? Looking at the rules, no. The production NT19 has:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19\n- NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\n\nSo no direct 't13' from NT19.\n\nBut wait, perhaps NT21 can produce 't38' as per NT21's production?\n\nYes, looking at NT21:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n- NT21 \u2192 NT11 (but I don't think NT11 is defined as a terminal or another NT.

{"custom_id":"request-623","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I should remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means that each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols on the right or a single terminal symbol. That helps because it structures the derivation in a way that can be matched by a pushdown automaton.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice a few things. The start symbol is S, and the rules are a bit dense, so I might need to see if there are any immediate patterns or simplifications. The given string is pretty long with a series of 't' tokens, like 't33', 't11', etc. Each of these seems to correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. \n\nWait, the grammar is mostly about combining non-terminals, which get expanded into more non-terminals, and eventually into terminals like 't' followed by numbers. So the process starts with S and applies rules until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nI should probably try expanding the string token by token and see if each 'tXXX' can be derived from some non-terminal. But doing this manually for a string of 38 tokens seems tough. Maybe I can find some patterns or see if there are any non-terminals that directly produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT44 -> 't6', NT42 -> 't5', etc. So maybe the 't' values in the string correspond to these. For example, 't33' might come from NT15, since NT15 -> NT37 NT15, but wait, that's a recursive rule. Hmm, maybe I need to trace back from the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 'tXXX' is produced by a specific non-terminal. For example, 't33' could come from NT10 because NT10 -> NT50 NT30, and maybe NT50 -> NT41 NT43, and NT41 and NT43 may produce 't's. Wait, NT41 -> NT7 NT31, and NT7 is 't35', right? Looking back, NT7 is 't35' in the grammar.\n\nWait, let's check that. In the grammar, NT7 -> NT35 NT35, and NT35 has two options: one is NT37 NT37, and another is NT28 NT7. Hmm, not sure. Maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in CNF, a string of length n must have a derivation of depth n-1. Here, the string has 38 tokens, so the derivation should have 37 steps. Checking if each step is possible is time-consuming, but maybe I can look for any contradictions or see if the terminals are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't33'. Is there any non-terminal that directly produces 't33'? Let me scan the grammar. I see NT10 -> NT50 NT30, NT50 -> NT41 NT43, NT30 -> NT24 NT44, and so on. Hmm, perhaps the 't33' comes from NT17, but NT17 -> NT2 NT30, which is 't40' 't49'? Wait, no, NT2 is 't41' NT32, which is 't16'. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's check if any of the 't' values are directly in the grammar. Looking again, NT44 is 't6', NT42 is 't5', NT13 is 't39', NT28 is 't67', etc. So 't33' is probably not directly produced by any non-terminal. So maybe 't33' comes from a combination of non-terminals that eventually result in 't33'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for any non-terminals that can derive into a sequence that includes all these 't's. But this seems too broad.\n\nWait, maybe the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's production rules. For example, the first few 't's: 't33 t11 t54 t13 t16 t90 t63 t48 t6 t6 t16 t12 t38 t54 t13 t31 t38 t13 t6 t11 t7 t16 t24 t18 t6 t55 t63 t91 t31 t67 t6 t38 t63 t91'.\n\nI notice that 't11' appears twice. Looking back at the grammar, NT11 isn't defined; wait, actually, in the grammar, there's NT52 -> 't44', but that's a leaf node. Maybe some non-terminal like NT15 -> NT37 NT15 could produce 't11' through recursion. Hmm, but NT15's first production is recursive, which might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the presence of certain terminals. For example, 't48' appears multiple times. NT24 -> 't55', so if there's a path leading to NT24, it could produce 't55'. But I'm not sure if 't48' is present.\n\nWait, maybe some of these 't's are part of larger non-terminals. For example, NT45 -> 't11', so if I have NT45 somewhere, it can produce 't11'. Looking back, NT37 -> NT19 NT19, and NT19 has options, one of which is NT51 NT19, which then may lead to something else. Hmm, not sure.\n\nThis seems too tangled. Maybe instead, I can note that the grammar starts with S -> NT15 NT10. So the derivation starts with NT15 and NT10. NT10 may expand into NT50 and NT30, which then expand further.\n\nBut given that the string has 38 tokens, and each step produces a fixed number of tokens, maybe I can check if the number of steps matches. Each production rule either increases the number of symbols by 1 (if it's a non-terminal split into two non-terminals) or keeps it the same (if a non-terminal splits into terminals). Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the derivation tree's leaves will be the terminals, and each internal node represents a non-terminal split.\n\nThe string length is 38, so the number of terminals is 38. The start symbol S splits into two non-terminals. Each time a non-terminal appears, it either splits into two non-terminals (increasing the count by 1) or a terminal (leaving the count the same). The total number of steps needed to reach 38 terminals would be the number of non-terminals in the derivation, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is whether the grammar can generate a string of 't's with certain patterns. But without knowing the exact derivation, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal, like NT44->t6, NT42->t5, etc. So if somewhere in the string, there's a 't5', that could come from NT42. Similarly, 't6' from NT44, etc. So looking through the string for any of these, I can see 't5', 't6' etc.\n\nBut the string provided is the one to evaluate. So the question is, does the grammar have a derivation that results in this string? Alternatively, can the string be parsed according to the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother thought: since the grammar is in CNF, it's similar to a pushdown automaton, and if the string can be matched by the grammar, then it's generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has a pattern that can be broken down into the grammar's terms. For example, starting from S -> NT15 NT10. Then NT10 -> NT50 NT30. NT50 -> NT41 NT43. NT41 -> NT7 NT31. NT7 is 't35', NT31 is 't91'. Hmm, that gives 't35 t91' which isn't part of the string.\n\nWait, maybe I need to follow a different path. Let's try to see if the 't's in the string correspond to the start symbol's expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has tokens that are not present in the grammar. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are things like t1, t2, etc., but wait, in the grammar, the terminals are things like t33, t11, etc. Because in the grammar, for example, NT52 -> 't44', which is t44.\n\nSo if the string contains any of these, like t44, then it can be produced.

{"custom_id":"request-622","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me walk through how I approached this.\n\nFirst, I looked at the grammar provided. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal on the left side expands into two non-terminals on the right. This fits the definition of CNF since each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals, and there are no other terms except the right-hand side being two symbols. Notably, the start symbol is S, and it initially expands into NT15 NT43.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers: `t12 t12 t54 t83 t72 t12 t12 t12 t12 t91 t83 t12 t38 t13 t90 t13 t16 t31 t36 t13 t12 t33 t11 t91 t83 t6 t6 t16 t39 t72 t33 t33 t16 t2`. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nI started by analyzing the production rules to identify the terminals and non-terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by a number, while the non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT12, NT54, etc. Initially, S produces NT15 and NT43, which are two non-terminals. So any string generated must start with the combination of what NT15 and NT43 can produce.\n\nNext, I checked the string's first two tokens: t12 and t12. Since S starts with NT15 NT43, I needed to see what can produce t12. Looking at the production rules, many have terminals like t5, t6, t7, etc. But 't12' isn't directly listed. However, some non-terminals might produce 't12' through their own production rules.\n\nWait, looking at the rules: for example, NT12 is defined with `NT12 -> NT21 NT48` and `NT21 -> NT13 NT20` and so on. But I don't see any direct or indirect production for 't12' from NT12 or NT21. Hmm, maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nWait, let's check if any non-terminals produce 't12'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT24 and NT21 have 't12' as a terminal. For example, NT24 has productions like `NT24 -> 't5' NT48` and `NT21 -> 't12' NT9` etc. Oh, so NT21 can produce 't12' because one of its productions is `NT21 -> NT10 NT10`. Wait, but NT10's productions are `NT10 -> NT50 NT30` and `NT50 -> NT41 NT43`. Hmm, maybe this path isn't leading to 't12'. Alternatively, NT24 can produce 't12' because of `NT24 -> 't5' NT48` which isn't t12. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again: NT28 has a production `NT28 -> NT26 NT23` and `NT26 -> NT24 NT34`, `NT24 -> NT2 NT48`, `NT23 -> NT5 NT26`. I don't see 't12' directly there. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about how the string starts with t12 t12.\n\nEach 't12' must come from some non-terminal. So, in the grammar, are there any NTs that produce 't12'? Looking through the production rules:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal is replaced by 't12' or where a path ends in 't12'. For example, NT21 has `NT21 -> 't12' NT9`, so NT21 can produce 't12'. Similarly, NT24's production is `NT24 -> 't5' NT48` which isn't 't12', but perhaps NT28 can produce 't12' via some path. Wait, no, from the given rules, I don't see any NTs that directly produce 't12' except for possibly NT21.\n\nWait, let's go step by step. The first two tokens are t12 and t12. So, each of these must come from separate non-terminals that expand to 't12'. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others until we reach terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, the first step would generate NT15 NT43, which are two non-terminals. Then, each non-terminal would need to derive into the respective 't12's.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t12 t12, which must come from NT15 producing 't12' and NT43 producing 't12'. Or vice versa; perhaps NT15 produces t12 and NT43 also produces t12.\n\nLet me check the production rules for NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15's production: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Hmm, not directly. Or NT15 -> NT19 NT30, and so on. Wait, actually, looking back, I see:\n\nNT15: `NT15 -> NT37 NT15` and `NT15 -> NT29 NT10`. Wait, no, looking at the given rules, I think I might have misread. Wait, let me recheck the rules:\n\nLooking back at the given rules, I see NT15: `NT15 -> NT37 NT15` and `NT15 -> NT30 NT20`. So, NT15 can produce two NTs, and those can be further expanded. Similarly for NT43: `NT43 -> NT6 NT1` and `NT43 -> NT27 NT0`.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nFrom the provided rules:\n\nNT15: \n- `NT15 -> NT37 NT15`\n- `NT15 -> NT29 NT10`\n\nWait, no: looking at the given rules, it's `NT15 -> NT37 NT15` and `NT15 -> NT30 NT20`? Wait, no, looking further down, it's actually:\n\nUnder the grammar, NT15 has:\n- `NT15 -> NT37 NT15`\n- `NT15 -> NT29 NT10`\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, I think I miscalculated.

{"custom_id":"request-642","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: `t54 t39 t69 t41 t83 t72 t33 t55 t90 t63 t67 t2 t39 t72 t33 t33 t16 t72 t18 t6 t33 t16 t3 t72 t33 t11 t7 t83 t87 t6 t31 t36 t33 t16 t24`.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal produces two non-terminals. The given grammar seems to follow that structure, with rules like S -> NT15 NT43 and so on. Each non-terminal on the left is replaced by two on the right.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, most of the terminals are directly produced by NT rules, like t2, t4, t7, etc. There are some longer rules, like NT44 -> 't6' and NT42 -> 't5'. Wait, but in the string I see a mix of both.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't54'. Looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals except perhaps some NT rules have direct terminals. Wait, the NT rules only go to other NT rules, not to the terminals directly except in the cases like NT44 -> 't6', NT42 -> 't5', etc. So it seems like the terminals only appear at the very bottom of the derivation.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some of the NT rules like NT15 produce 't39' or others. So a production like NT15 -> 't39' would mean that NT15 can directly produce that terminal. Similarly, NT24-> 't5', etc.\n\nSo to parse the string, I need to see if it can be derived from the top-level non-terminal S.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, and the entire string will have a length that's a power of two based on the number of steps. Wait, no, that's when you expand each non-terminal to two, but since we have a specific string, the number of tokens (34 in this case) should match the length based on the derivation.\n\nWait, S starts by producing two non-terminals, and each of those can be another two, so the string length would have to be a power of two. Let me check: 34 is not a power of two (2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64). That could be a problem. Wait, maybe it's because some of the non-terminals produce terminals, so the string length doesn't have to be exactly a power of two? Or perhaps the grammar allows some non-terminals to produce terminals at any level.\n\nWait, no. In standard CNF, each production is non-terminals only, so the only way terminals appear is as leaves in the parse tree. Therefore, the length of the string must be a power of two, starting from the number of symbols at the top level. For example, S \u2192 NT15 NT43, each of those can be split further, so the total number of symbols would be 2^k for some k.\n\nBut in this case, the string has 34 symbols, which is not a power of two. Hmm, that could mean that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because 34 is not a power of two. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the possible string lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Let me think again. Each production in CNF either produces two terminals or two non-terminals. If a non-terminal produces a terminal, it adds one to the count. So the derivation starts with one symbol (S), then at each step, each existing symbol is expanded into two, so the total length doubles each time. Therefore, the length of the derived string must be 2^n, for some n, because each step multiplies the number by two.\n\nIn the given string, the length is 34, which is 2*17; but 34 is not a power of two. The nearest powers of two are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). Since 34 is not a power of two, it's impossible to derive a string of length 34 from S using CNF rules, as each step doubles the length.\n\nWait, but this depends on whether the non-terminals can produce terminals in some way. For example, in the production rules, some non-terminals produce a terminal in one step. For example, NT44 -> 't6', which is a terminal. So perhaps S can derive 't6 t6' in one step, which is length 2. Then each of those can produce more, but if we have a non-terminal that produces a terminal, then that's a single symbol in the string.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar is fully in CNF, so all productions are two non-terminals except when they produce terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals. Therefore, in the given grammar, every production is A -> BC. Therefore, the terminals only appear at the leaves, so the total length of any derived string must be a power of two.\n\nTherefore, if S is the start symbol and we derive S, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, each of which eventually expands further until we reach the leaves, which are terminals. So the total length of the string will be a power of two. So 34 is not a power of two, hence it's impossible for the grammar to generate this string. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has a length of 34, which is not a power of two. In a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, each derivation step doubles the number of symbols, resulting in a final string length that is a power of two.

{"custom_id":"request-643","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, this grammar seems to be in CNF because all the rules on the left side are single non-terminals, and the right sides consist of two non-terminals or terminals. \n\nThe string to check is: `t54 t13 t38 t54 t83 t72 t67 t2 t83 t33 t67 t12 t11 t7 t83 t87 t12 t33 t11 t6 t67 t31 t16 t38 t36 t54 t91 t83 t87 t6 t16 t12 t54 t54 t54`\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it's a sequence of terminals, mostly 't' followed by numbers. My task is to see if this string can be produced by the given grammar.\n\nThe grammar includes both non-terminals and terminals. The terminals are 't' followed by numbers, except for the non-terminals like S, NT15, NT50, etc.\n\nI should perhaps start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The rule for S is: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, to derive the string, the first two symbols should correspond to NT15 and NT43. Looking at the string, the first term is 't54', which should correspond to either NT15 or NT43.\n\nWait, let's clarify: in Chomsky Normal Form, terminals can't be on the left side of the production, but they can be on the right side. So, when we start the derivation, we might generate non-terminals which then produce terminals through other productions. So, the initial symbol S is a non-terminal, and each step replaces a non-terminal with the productions on the right.\n\nBut in the string, each symbol is a terminal except for the initial S, which is a non-terminal. Wait, no, in the string, it's a sequence of terminals. So, each symbol in the string must be a terminal, which means each step of the derivation must produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the grammar's structure. The non-terminals are the NT followed by a number, and terminals are 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, the first step: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Since both NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals, we must replace each of them with their productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT15 has a production: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Hmm, that's a recursive production. So, to resolve this, we might have to go deeper.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions for each non-terminal to see how they can produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the string and see if each part can be broken down into the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see: the first token is 't54'. Let's see if any non-terminal produces 't54'. Looking through the productions:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't63', NT26 \u2192 't12', NT47 \u2192 't16', NT35 \u2192 't52', etc. But I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't54'. So, perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, in the productions, I see NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, let me check the productions properly.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see some productions that directly output terminals:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't11', NT29 \u2192 't63', NT36 \u2192 't84', NT43 \u2192 't1' (Wait, no, looking again, I see some rules like:\n\nLooking through all productions, I see NT29 \u2192 't63', NT45 \u2192 't11', NT23 \u2192 't7', etc. Wait, does any NT produce 't54'?\n\nLooking back, the productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't28', NT4 \u2192 't48', NT29 \u2192 't63', NT7 \u2192 't35', etc. I don't see any NT directly producing 't54'. Hmm.\n\nBut the first token is 't54', which must come from some non-terminal. Let me check the productions for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, this is a recursive production. Does this mean that NT15 could produce a string that eventually results in 't54'? Or perhaps there's a production I missed.\n\nWait, let's see. NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. NT37 can produce 't12' or 't19', but not directly 't54'. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 't54' comes from another NT. Let's look for any NT that produces 't54'.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT34 \u2192 't28', NT24 \u2192 't55' (from NT24 \u2192 't55'), which might help. So, let me track back.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the first NT15 expands, and then the next NT43.\n\nWait, NT43 has a production: NT43 \u2192 't6 NT1'. So, NT43 can produce 't6' followed by NT1. But NT1's production: NT1 \u2192 NT51 NT38. NT51 \u2192 't90', and NT38 might produce something.\n\nWait, this seems too vague. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t54 t13 t38 t54 t83 t72 t67 t2 t83 t33 t67 t12 t11 t7 t83 t87 t12 t33 t11 t6 t67 t31 t16 t38 t36 t54 t91 t83 t87 t6 t16 t12 t54 t54 t54.\n\nWait, the string is a list of terminals, each being 't' followed by numbers. Each of these must be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, it's in CNF, so each step produces exactly two symbols: either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every expansion is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut in this case, the string is a sequence of terminals. So, to get the string, each non-terminal must eventually produce a terminal. Therefore, each symbol in the string must be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the first symbol, 't54'. Let's see if any non-terminal produces 't54'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. NT43 has a production to 't6 NT1'. But 't54' doesn't appear directly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at the reverse. Maybe some NT can produce 't54' through a series of productions.\n\nWait, let me check all rules where a terminal is produced. For example, NT29 \u2192 't63'; NT43 \u2192 't6 NT1'; NT42 \u2192 't5'; NT12 \u2192 't16'; NT28 \u2192 't4'; and so on.\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't54'. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me go through all the rules:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't37' and 't37'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, looking for 't54'... Hmm, maybe NT30 has some production that could lead to 't54'? Let's check:\n\nNT30: \u2192 NT32 NT8, \u2192 NT24 NT44, \u2192 NT20 NT24, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps through multiple steps. Let me try to find a path that could produce 't54'.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the last part ends with 't54 t54 t54'. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, 't54' as a terminal. If any non-terminal produces 't54', that would be the end of the derivation. But I can't find such a production.\n\nWait, perhaps the first 't5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-664","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to check is \"t33 t11 t12 t38 t54 t39 t69 t69 t72 t33 t33 t16 t3 t3 t33 t11 t33 t67 t33 t67 t54 t31 t13 t91 t16 t12 t12 t54 t55 t6 t90 t36 t72 t33 t16 t24\".\n\nFirst, I notice that in the grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial production for S is S -> NT15 NT43. I'll start by breaking down the string based on this production. The first part should be NT15, which becomes t33, and then NT43, which becomes t6.\n\nNext, I need to check the rest of the string after \"t33 t6\" to see if it can be generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at NT15's production, it's NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So, starting with NT15, it's replacing into NT37 and another NT15. The \"t11\" in the string must correspond to NT37. Let's see the production for NT37: NT37 can be either NT19 NT19 or NT30 NT30.\n\nOption 1: NT37 -> NT19 NT19. NT19 is \"t54\" and \"t54\" is indeed two \"t54\"s in the string: \"t54 t54\".\n\nOption 2: NT37 -> NT30 NT30. I need to check if NT30 can produce \"t33\". Looking at the NT30 productions, one of them is NT30 -> NT32 NT8, and another is NT30 -> NT24 NT44. Neither of these directly becomes \"t33\". Wait, but let me check the NT30 productions:\n\nLooking back, NT30 is present multiple times. One production is NT30 -> NT30 NT20, but that's recursive. Another is NT30 -> NT24 NT44, which would be \"t55 t44\". But that's not relevant here.\n\nHmm, maybe the first option is better because \"t54 t54\" matches NT19 NT19, which is \"t54 t54\".\n\nNow, moving on, the next part after \"t54 t54\" should be another NT19 and then another NT15 in NT15's production.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The production is S -> NT15 NT43. So after the initial NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which became \"t54 t54\", we still have another NT15 to process, which in this case is the next NT15 after NT37. So, that NT15 would again produce NT37 and NT15.\n\nSo, after \"t54 t54\", we have another NT15 which again becomes \"t54\" and \"t11\" (since NT15 starts as NT37 NT15, and the second NT15 is breaking into \"t11\"). Wait, but the string after \"t54 t54\" is \"t69 t69 t72 t33 t33\". Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's step through the string step by step.\n\nThe string after S's production is \"t33 t6\". Then, the next step is NT15, which is \"t37\". So, looking for NT15's production: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So the first \"t37\" would produce \"t37 t37\". But in the string, it's \"t11\" next, not \"t37\". Hmm, maybe I'm wrong in the initial breakdown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after S -> NT15 NT43, NT15's production is NT37 NT15, which is \"t37 t37\", and then the next part is NT43 -> NT6 NT1. Let me check where \"t6\" is in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: after S's initial \"t33 t6\", the next symbol is \"t11\", which could be a problem because NT15's production starts with NT37, which in our case was \"t54\". So maybe I need to consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider NT43 production: NT43 -> NT6 NT1. So after NT43, we have \"t6 t1\". Looking in the string, after \"t33 t6\", we have \"t11\", which doesn't directly match. Hmm, perhaps the initial step is correct, but I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's try to consider the string more systematically. The entire string is:\n\nt33 t11 t12 t38 t54 t39 t69 t69 t72 t33 t33 t16 t3 t3 t33 t11 t33 t67 t33 t67 t54 t31 t13 t91 t16 t12 t12 t54 t55 t6 t90 t36 t72 t33 t16 t24.\n\nI think the approach should be to parse the string by trying to match the grammar step by step. Starting from S, which is \"t33 t6\". Then, for each part, see if it can be broken down into the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to verify whether the entire string can be generated by replacing non-terminals in the grammar. Starting from S:\n\n1. S -> NT15 NT43. So, the string starts with \"t33 t6\" which corresponds to NT15 (t33) and NT43 (t6). Wait, no, because NT15 is \"t37\", and NT43 is \"t6\". So, the string starts with \"t33\", which is NT15, and \"t6\" is NT43. But wait, that's a problem because S's production requires NT15 NT43, which in terms of the grammar would require NT15 to be t37, not t33. Wait, no, the start symbol S is S -> NT15 NT43, which in the string is \"t33 t6\". But according to the grammar, NT15 is NT37 NT15, which starts with \"t37\". So that's a mismatch.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The production S -> NT15 NT43 means the start symbol S becomes the concatenation of NT15 and NT43. Looking up the productions for NT15 and NT43, we see that NT15 is NT37 NT15, and NT43 is NT6 NT1.\n\nSo, S produces \"t37 t37 ... t6 t1\". But in the string, after S's initial \"t33\", the next symbol is \"t11\", which doesn't match \"t37\", so this seems contradictory.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the grammar and the string.\n\nWait, the grammar's production S is S -> NT15 NT43. So each of these NT15 and NT43 need to be expanded.\n\nLooking up NT15: it's NT37 NT15. So each NT15 expands into \"t37\" followed by another NT15, which is \"t37\".\n\nSo when S is expanded, it's \"t37\" \"t37\" ... and then \"t6\" \"t1\".\n\nLooking at the string, S would be \"t33 t6\" which is not matching the initial NT15 and NT43. So this suggests that the initial expansion doesn't align with the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the mapping. Let me check the mappings of the grammar's symbols to terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT15 -> t37\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, NT15's production is NT37 NT15, which produces \"t37 t37\" etc. But in the string, the initial few symbols are t33, t11, etc. So perhaps the mapping is different.

{"custom_id":"request-663","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is produced by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t33 t11 t33 t11 t12 t67 t7 t83 t39 t72 t33 t33 t16 t72 t33 t6 t99 t12 t33 t11 t6 t31 t36 t33 t11 t12 t13 t54 t13 t67 t7 t83 t87 t6 t16 t37`.\n\nFirst, I think I need to understand how the grammar works. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar starts from S and applies these productions until only terminals are left.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the top-level production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So, the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43. Each of these will eventually expand into a series of terminals (strings of 't' followed by numbers) based on the production rules.\n\nI notice that each NT production branches out into two other NT productions or terminals. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. This suggests that NT15 can produce a sequence involving NT37 and itself, leading to recursive expansion. However, since NT15 is in the start symbol, and the string starts with t33, which must come from one of the NT productions.\n\nI also spot that many NTs directly produce a terminal. For instance, NT52 \u2192 't44', and NT46 \u2192 't72', etc. These are easy to map because they directly produce specific 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string starts with t33. So I need to see which NT production starts with t33. Looking at the grammar, NT34 \u2192 t87 and NT33 is not present, but NT33 is part of some productions. Wait, no, the terminals are things like t33, t11, etc., so each terminal is a separate 't' followed by a number. So 't33 t11' would be two separate productions, perhaps.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the string, it's a sequence of these tX tokens, so each token like t33 is a single terminal, not a digit. So for example, if a production like NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, then the expansion of NT15 would produce tokens from its two children.\n\nSo the string starts with t33, which must be produced by one of the NTs. Looking through the grammar, the terminals are things like t33, t11, t67, etc. I need to find NTs that produce these.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n- NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43\n- NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20\n- NT8 \u2192 NT46 NT17\n- And so on.\n\nAlso, looking at the terminals, I see t33 appears multiple times. So perhaps the grammar has a path that leads to t33.\n\nWait, let's try to parse the string step by step. Each step in the derivation should generate a terminal.\n\nThe string is t33 t11 t33 t11 t12 t67 t7 t83 t39 t72 t33 t33 t16 t72 t33 t6 t99 t12 t33 t11 t6 t31 t36 t33 t11 t12 t13 t54 t13 t67 t7 t83 t87 t6 t16 t37.\n\nEach token is a separate entity, so each step in the derivation should produce a single terminal. The grammar is CNF, so each expansion must produce two non-terminals, which then expand further until terminals are produced.\n\nWait, but in the string, there are 39 tokens, which must correspond to 39 steps where each step produces one terminal. However, since each production in CNF produces two non-terminals, the number of steps is not straightforward because the parse tree could be a derivation of certain length.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check if each token in the string is present in the grammar as an terminal. Let me scan through the grammar entries to see which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the definitions:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't44'\n- NT46 \u2192 't72'\n- NT35 \u2192 't37'\n- NT37 \u2192 't12'\n- NT36 \u2192 't84'\n- NT19 \u2192 't54'\n- NT28 \u2192 't4'\n- NT29 \u2192 't36'\n- NT45 \u2192 't11'\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't5'\n- NT21 \u2192 't99'\n- NT11 \u2192 't16' (Wait, NT11 is not present, but looking at NT44 \u2192 NT16. Wait, no, NT16 is 't16', so maybe NT44 produces t16.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT44's production is NT44 \u2192 't6'.\n\nWait no, looking back:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't6' is the production. So NT44 directly produces t6. Similarly, NT16 is an NT that produces 't16'.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT44 as a node. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar definitions:\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't11'\nBut NT44 \u2192 't6'\n\nYes, so NT44 produces t6, and NT45 produces t11.\n\nSo looking back at the string, the first token is t33. So is there any NT that directly produces t33? Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT with a production NTxyz \u2192 't33'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT37 \u2192 't12'\nNT36 \u2192 't84'\nNT34 \u2192 't87'\nNT35 \u2192 't37'\nNT30 \u2192 't32' (via NT32 in another rule?)\n\nWait, maybe we need to see if t33 is produced directly or indirectly.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals in the string: t33, t11, t33, t11, t12, t67, t7, t83, t39, t72, t33, t33, t16, t72, t33, t6, t99, t12, t33, t11, t6, t31, t36, t33, t11, t12, t13, t54, t13, t67, t7, t83, t87, t6, t16, t37.\n\nLooking through the grammar productions, I can see NT52 produces t44, which is not in the string, but let's check for t33.\n\nLooking through the grammar, is there any NT that directly produces t33? It doesn't seem so. So t33 must be produced by an NT that eventually produces t33 through other productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 NT24 NT46\n- NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35\nAh, wait, NT24 in one of the productions is \u2192 NT48 NT35.

Or other?\n\nWait, I think not. Let me check the full grammar:\n\nThe grammar provided lists multiple lines for some NTs. For example:\n\nNT30 has multiple productions:\nNT30 \u2192 NT32 NT8\nNT30 \u2192 NT24 NT44\n\nWait, so for NT30, it can branch into NT32 and NT8, or NT24 and NT44.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 has:\nNT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35\nNT24 also has another production: looking in the grammar lines:\n\nHmm, the grammar provided is quite extensive.

{"custom_id":"request-678","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are individual symbols. My job is to parse through the grammar and see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF looks like. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The advantage is that it can be efficiently parsed with algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, since this grammar seems quite complex with many non-terminals and rules, I might not want to use an algorithm directly. Instead, I'll try to see if I can break down the string step by step, matching it against the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all non-terminals eventually produce strings of terminals or other non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. The start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S generates two non-terminals, NT15 and NT43. Therefore, the string must be the concatenation of strings derived from NT15 and NT43.\n\nNow, let's look at NT15 and NT43.\n\nStarting with NT15: Its production is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's a recursive production because NT15 appears on both sides. Hmm, that might be a bit tricky. Let me think. NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So each time, it's producing NT37 followed by another NT15. So this must mean that NT15 produces a string of NT37 repeated some number of times. Specifically, since it's NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, it's recursive, so the production for NT15 would be something like NT37* (NT37 repeated any number of times, including zero). But in our string, I see 't13' multiple times, so maybe that's connected to NT37.\n\nWait, let's see the production for NT37. Looking through the rules, I see NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So NT37 produces two NT19s. Then each NT19, looking at their rules: NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38 and also NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. Oh, this seems like another recursive case. So NT19 can be expanded in two ways. One is producing NT12 and NT38, which are specific non-terminals, and the other is producing NT51 followed by another NT19. Hmm, so it's possible that NT19 can produce a string that might get long.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, I see 't13', 't31', 't54', etc. Let me check the production rules for NT31 and NT54, as they might appear.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice NT31 \u2192 NT91 NT1. NT91 isn't in the provided list, which makes me think maybe I misread or the list was incomplete. Alternatively, maybe I should check the provided grammar again. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see NT31 \u2192 NT91 NT1, but NT91 doesn't appear in the given productions. That could be a problem because if NT31 is used, but it's not defined, that might mean it's not part of the valid grammar, and thus the string might be invalid. Alternatively, maybe NT91 is a typo or misrepresentation.\n\nWait, looking back, it says:\n\nHere is the string: `t31 t54 t67 t69 t67 t67 t67 t69...` Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the string is: `t31 t54 t6 t13 t31 t38 t13 t13 t33 t11 t6 t16 t39 t39 t39 t39 t69 t69 t39 t72 t33 t11 t7 t83 t67 t7 t83 t87 t6 t16 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t2`.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice t31, t54, etc. So perhaps I should check if these correspond to any non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see a bunch of non-terminals like NT5, NT24, etc. Each production eventually terminates with terminals (a, b, t, etc.) except for the non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, the only terminal symbols I see are 't' followed by numbers, like t44, t6, t5, etc., and 't' followed by letters? Wait, actually, I need to check. The grammar is provided as a series of production rules, each starting with a non-terminal on the left and producing a combination of non-terminals and possibly terminal symbols. For example, one rule is NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. Another is NT24 \u2192 NT48 NT35, and so on.\n\nAt the bottom of the grammar, I see rules like:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT13 \u2192 't39', etc. So each rule either produces a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nSo for each non-terminal, its production is either a terminal (like 't5', 't6') or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nThe string given is: `t31 t54 t6 t13 t31 t38 t13 t13 t33 t11 t6 t16 t39 t39 t39 t39 t69 t69 t39 t72 t33 t11 t7 t83 t67 t7 t83 t87 t6 t16 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t2`.\n\nI notice that 't31' appears, so I should look for a rule that produces 't31'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any terminal 't31' directly. Wait, maybe it's produced by a non-terminal that isn't shown here, but I need to check.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that the only terminals are 't2', 't48', 't5', etc., but not 't31'. So if I can't find a production rule that results in 't31', that could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe 't31' is the result of NT31's production. Looking up NT31, I see:\n\nWait, the rules provided don't go all the way to 't31', but I see NT31 \u2192 NT91 NT1. NT91 isn't present in the rules, which suggests that perhaps there's a typo or that 't31' isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in looking. Let me scan the provided grammar for 't31'.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar lines:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT91 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 NT26 NT2\n... and so on.\n\nI don't see any terminal 't31' being produced.

{"custom_id":"request-686","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with the problem of determining whether a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite extensive with multiple non-terminal symbols and productions. The string in question is a sequence of tokens, each presumably corresponding to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the initial productions which may involve terminals. However, looking at the grammar provided, I notice a mix of two different types of productions, some of which seem to define non-terminals in terms of other non-terminals (which might indicate it's in CNF), but there are also productions where a non-terminal is immediately followed by a terminal, like \"S -> NT15 NT43\" \u2013 wait, that's actually followed by non-terminals, but in the user's grammar, I see that all productions have only non-terminals on the right side, except for the ones where the right-hand side is a single terminal. Wait, no, looking again, all the productions in the grammar are of the form NT... \u2192 NT... NT..., except for some like \"NT44 -> 't6'\", which are productions to terminals. But in CNF, all productions should be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So this grammar seems to be in CNF because all right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, the productions like \"NT5 -> NT52 NT4\" are two non-terminals, and \"NT50 -> NT41 NT43\" is similar. So it seems that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form since each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t31 t16 t33 t83 t65 t69 t39 t72 t33 t33 t16 t3 t3 t84 t55 t6 t87 t54 t38 t13 t33 t11 t31 t4 t87 t33 t33 t48 t6 t63 t18 t6 t16 t13 t13 t12 t54`.\n\nEach \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So I need to parse this string according to the given grammar. The approach is to perform a top-down or bottom-up parsing, but given the complexity of the grammar, perhaps a top-down approach using the CYK algorithm would be effective. However, implementing CYK might be cumbersome here. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be built by starting from the start symbol and expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the start would produce two non-terminals, NT15 and NT43. Each of these needs to be expanded until terminals are reached.\n\nLooking at NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's an interesting recursion. So NT15 can be expanded as NT37 followed by NT15. But then NT15 itself might produce other things. So that could lead to an infinite loop unless it eventually expands to a terminal. Let me check NT37. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. NT19 has two productions: one is NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, which is also recursive, and the other is NT19 \u2192 't13'. So NT19 can eventually produce a terminal 't13' if the recursion stops. So, for example, if we have NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, but NT51 can produce terminals, then we can break the recursion.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. If both NT19s expand to 't13', then NT37 would produce 't13 t13', perhaps.\n\nLet me try to break down the string. The string starts with 't31', which I need to see which non-terminal can produce it. Looking through the grammar, I see NT31 \u2192 't91', but I don't see any production that leads to 't31'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all productions for NT... that produce terminals: I see NT31 \u2192 't91', NT6 \u2192 't16', NT17 \u2192 't33', NT19 \u2192 't13', etc. Hmm, I don't see any terminal 't31' being produced directly. Wait, perhaps 't31' comes from a non-terminal that isn't directly in the productions. Alternatively, maybe there's a path through the grammar where 't31' is generated.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT28 \u2192 't6', NT44 \u2192 't16', NT17 \u2192 't33', NT19 \u2192 't13', but no production for 't31' is immediately obvious. Wait, maybe 't31' comes from a combination of other expansions. Let me check NT23 \u2192 't7' and other productions. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is provided with multiple 't's, and I need to see which sequence can connect through the grammar. Let's list the entire string:\n\nt31, t16, t33, t83, t65, t69, t39, t72, t33, t33, t16, t3, t3, t84, t55, t6, t87, t54, t38, t13, t33, t11, t31, t4, t87, t33, t33, t48, t6, t63, t18, t6, t16, t13, t13, t12, t54.\n\nI think it's better to approach this by building a parse tree or checking each step. Since S \u2192 NT15 NT43, the entire string must be the concatenation of two parts: one generated by NT15 and the other by NT43.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two parts, but where? The separation point is unknown. Perhaps the first part ends at 't31' and the second at 't6'? Wait, but it's unclear where to split. Alternatively, the entire string must be covered by the expansion of NT15 and NT43.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe a better approach is to use the fact that in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, for each non-terminal in the string, it must be able to derive that terminal symbol through some sequence of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a parsing problem where the string is broken down step by step, but given the time, perhaps it's better to check if all the terminals in the string are covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, all the terminals are derived from 't' followed by a number. So, in the given string, every terminal is 'tX' where X is a number. Now, looking at the grammar's terminal productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't48'\nNT29 \u2192 't63'\nNT4 \u2192 't88'\nNT9 \u2192 't28'\nNT50 \u2192 't33'\nNT12 \u2192 't16'\nNT51 \u2192 't90'\nNT48 \u2192 't87'\nNT1 \u2192 't24'\nNT34 \u2192 't87'\nNT36 \u2192 't84'\nNT21 \u2192 't99'\nNT45 \u2192 't11'\nNT19 \u2192 't13'\nNT37 \u2192 't12'\nNT51 \u2192 't31'  Wait, no, looking back, I don't see NT51 \u2192 't31'. Wait, maybe I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the grammar includes:\n\nNT52 -> 't44'\nNT44 -> 't6'\nNT42 -> 't5'\nNT13 -> 't39'\nNT28 -> 't67'\nNT0 -> 't39'\nNT40 -> 't65'\nNT46 -> 't72'\nNT32 -> 't83'\nNT24 -> 't18'\nNT24 -> 't55'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't48'\nNT29 -> 't63'\nNT4 -> 't88'\nNT9 -> 't28'\nNT50 -> 't33'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT51 -> 't90'\nNT48 -> 't87'\nNT1 -> 't24'\nNT34 -> 't87'\nNT36 -> 't84'\nNT21 -> 't99'\nNT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-700","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I can see multiple rules, some of which produce terminals and others non-terminals. The production rules that produce terminals are when a symbol is immediately followed by a 't' with a number, like NT24 \u2192 't5', NT37 \u2192 't12', etc. These are leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t16 t90 t36 t88 t6 t6 t33 t83 t72 t33 t90 t33 t67 t12 t33 t11 t12 t67 t33 t67 t33 t67 t13 t6 t31 t63 t91 t38 t36 t16 t38 t36 t12 t6 t13 t33 t33 t39`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't16', which corresponds to a production rule like NT17 \u2192 't33', or looking at the rules, perhaps NT17 \u2192 t17. Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 't17'. So, the first token is 't16', which I don't see directly. Hmm. Wait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT6 \u2192 't16', but that's when NT6 \u2192 't16'. So, that means the first token is 't16', which would have to come from NT6. So, the string starts with t16, which is from NT6.\n\nWait, but NT6's production is only 't16', right? So, at the top level, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43. Wait, no. Let me check again. The initial rule is S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43. Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, it's written as S -> NT15 NT15 NT43. Wait, but in the list provided, it's S -> NT15 NT15 NT43. Wait, that's the first line. So, S is the start symbol and it produces NT15 NT15 NT43. So, the parse tree must start with S, which splits into three NT15s? Wait, no, it's NT15 followed by NT15 followed by NT43. Wait, no, that's actually NT15, NT15, and NT43. So, the top level is S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43. So, the string starts with NT15, then another NT15, then NT43.\n\nWait, but the string begins with t16, which is the first token. So, that would have to come from NT15, because the only production of NT15 is 't33' or is there another? No, looking back, the productions for NT15 are: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 and NT15 \u2192 NT41 NT5. So, the initial NT15's might produce other non-terminals, which then will produce terminals.\n\nWait, but wait, the first token is t16, which is an output of NT6. So, let's think about this. The string's first token is t16, which suggests that the leftmost symbol in the string is a terminal, so in the parse tree, it must be the result of a production that directly ends in a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, I see that NT24 can produce 't5', NT13 \u2192 't39', etc. But where does t16 come from?\n\nLooking back, I see that NT17 \u2192 't17', which is 't17'. Also, NT6 \u2192 't16', and NT17 is another non-terminal that can produce other non-terminals. So, if the string starts with t16, that would have to come from NT6. But the top-level symbol is S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43, which doesn't produce NT6. So, how can the string start with t16 if the initial symbols at the top are NT15, NT15, NT43?\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the initial production. Let me check again: the initial rule is S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43. So, the top-level is three NT15s. NT15 can go to NT37 NT15 or NT41 NT5. So, let's see if the string could be derived starting from S.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol, so the entire parse tree starts with S. However, the string is a sequence of terminals, so for the string to be generated, S must derive this sequence. Wait, but S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43, which are three non-terminals. So, each of these NT15s must derive parts of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the parse tree bottom-up, starting from the top symbol S and seeing if the string can be generated through the productions.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be represented as a series of productions starting from S. Alternatively, given the length of the string, maybe we can parse it using the grammar.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens in the string. The string is:\n\nt16 t90 t36 t88 t6 t6 t33 t83 t72 t33 t90 t33 t67 t12 t33 t11 t12 t67 t33 t67 t33 t67 t13 t6 t31 t63 t91 t38 t36 t16 t38 t36 t12 t6 t13 t33 t33 t39.\n\nThat's 34 tokens. Since each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals, the number of symbols at each step would determine the length. For the initial S, it's NT15 NT15 NT43. Each of these NTs can either be a terminal or split into more non-terminals. So, the derivation can be done as S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43 \u2192 ... eventually leading to the terminals.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can check for consistency in the productions. For example, looking at each token and seeing if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nTake the first token, t16. That comes from NT6, which is defined as NT6 \u2192 't16'. So, t16 can only come from NT6. But in the initial S \u2192 NT15 NT15 NT43, we don't have any NT6. So, how can the string start with NT6 if S does not produce NT6? Unless the NT15 or NT43 productions can lead to NT6 later.\n\nLet me see where NT6 is defined. NT6 is defined as 't16', which is a terminal, so it cannot produce anything else. So, for the string to start with t16, there must be a way to derive t16 from S.\n\nBut S is NT15 NT15 NT43. So, each of these NT15s and NT43 must generate the first parts of the string.\n\nLet me think about how t16 can be part of the derivation. Since t16 is a terminal, the NT that produces it must be a leaf in the parse tree. So, in the parse tree, t16 must be a child of an NT that directly produces it.\n\nThe only NT that directly produces t16 is NT6 \u2192 't16'. So, in the parse tree, t16 must be a child of NT6.\n\nNow, in the parse tree, how does NT6 get involved in the derivation starting from S? Since S starts with NT15, NT15, and NT43, perhaps one of these NTs will produce NT6 during the derivation.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT15 can produce itself followed by NT15 or other NTs. Let me see if there's a path from NT15 to NT6.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 (applying this production)\n- NT37 can produce either NT19 NT19 or NT37 NT37.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

{"custom_id":"request-705","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form. That means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, each rule on the left is a non-terminal, and on the right, either two non-terminals or a terminal (like 't' followed by numbers). I think some terminals might be multi-character if they are more than one letter, but in this case, looking at the production rules, they all seem to have single terminals starting with 't' and followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t11 t7 t83 t83 t33 t55 t6 t90 t63 t33 t67 t90 t16 t38 t36 t54 t33 t11 t33 t67 t91 t83 t18 t6 t67 t38 t54 t87 t33 t67 t12 t6 t16 t54 t13 t33 t11 t13.\n\nSo the string has 39 tokens separated by spaces. Each token starts with 't' followed by a number. So maybe each token is a single terminal, which makes sense because in the grammar, the right-hand sides consist of terminals (like 't11', 't7', etc.) or pairs of non-terminals.\n\nThe goal is to parse this string according to the given grammar. If the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions, then the answer is Yes; otherwise, No.\n\nLet me first look at the grammar structure. Starting from S, it's S \u2192 NT15 NT43. This means S must produce two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43, in that order, but both must be immediately followed or preceded by others as per their definitions.\n\nLooking at NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT15 is defined as NT37 followed by itself. This is a right-recursive rule, which can potentially lead to infinite loops unless it's balanced. Alternatively, it's similar to a loop where NT15 depends on NT37 and itself. Wait, but NT15 appears only on the left of this rule, so it's a recursive rule, but perhaps it's being used in this way.\n\nAnother thing: the terminals are 't' followed by numbers. Each is a single token, so each step in the reduction should match exactly one of these tokens, followed by the next non-terminal.\n\nSo the approach is to try to parse the string step by step, starting from S, and see if each part of the string can be matched accordingly.\n\nLet me list all the terminals present in the string:\n\nt11, t7, t83, t83, t33, t55, t6, t90, t63, t33, t67, t90, t16, t38, t36, t54, t33, t11, t33, t67, t91, t83, t18, t6, t67, t38, t54, t87, t33, t67, t12, t6, t16, t54, t13, t33, t11, t13.\n\nNow, the string is quite long, so I need an efficient way. Maybe I can try to construct a parse tree or use a reduction approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the grammar as a set of production rules and see if there's a way to apply the productions in reverse, breaking down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the top-down approach: starting from S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string should start with NT15 followed by NT43. Wait, but NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals, so the actual tokens would have to be the terminals produced by NT15 and NT43 respectively.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the string starts with the terminal sequence matched by NT15 and then NT43.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens:\n\nt11 t7 t83 t83 t33 t55 t6 t90 t63 t33 t67 t90 t16 t38 t36 t54 t33 t11 t33 t67 t91 t83 t18 t6 t67 t38 t54 t87 t33 t67 t12 t6 t16 t54 t13 t33 t11 t13.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT15 NT43 means the string is broken into two parts: the first part must match NT15's terminal sequence, and the second part must match NT43's sequence.\n\nLet me look up what NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT0, and NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20. Then NT30 \u2192 NT32 NT8, NT8 \u2192 NT40 NT49, NT40 \u2192 NT46 NT27, NT46 \u2192 NT10 NT38, NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, and so on. This seems like a deep recursion, so I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the string, after the initial S, the next non-terminal is NT15, which might produce t11, t7, etc.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should first make a list of all the possible terminal sequences for each NT.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that the grammar uses leftmost or rightmost derivations, but since it's Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So for any non-terminal, the only way to match a terminal is by directly producing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some non-terminals are unit productions, which would directly match a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that some non-terminals produce a terminal directly, like NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT13 \u2192 't39', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT44's production is 't6', a single terminal. Similarly, NT42 \u2192 't5', and so on.\n\nSo, whenever a non-terminal like NT44 comes up, it must be replaced by exactly 't6'.\n\nSo, looking at the string, perhaps starting from the top, we can see if it can be split into two non-terminals, NT15 and NT43.\n\nWait, but the string is long, and the first element is 't11'. So we need to see which non-terminals can produce 't11'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT33 \u2192 NT11 NT19. So NT33 can produce 't11' followed by 't19'. Then NT19 \u2192 't13' or NT51 NT19. Wait, but in the given productions, I see NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 and NT19 \u2192 't13', so NT19 can produce either 't13' or 't51 followed by NT19'.\n\nWait, but each production for a non-terminal must result in a terminal or a sequence that can be derived. So, for example, if NT19 can produce 't13' directly, then 't19' can come from NT19 \u2192 't13'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the string, 't11 t7' appears early on. Let me see if any non-terminals can produce 't11' as the first terminal.\n\nLooking at NT33: NT33 \u2192 NT11 NT19. So to produce 't11', we'd need to have NT11 \u2192 't11' and then NT19 as the next part. But looking at the grammar, is there a rule for NT11?\n\nLooking at all the productions, I don't see an explicit NT11 production, except perhaps in another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I've missed some production rules. Let me check if NT11 is mentioned in any right-hand side. Looking at the provided grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. The productions for NTs are listed next.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT11 being a starting point for any other production, except maybe as part of another rule.\n\nWait, let me see: some NTs have productions with terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 't28', etc. But looking for NT11: looking through the rules, NT11 \u2192 't11' is not present, but looking at the list, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any directly producing 't11'. But earlier, I thought NT33 \u2192 NT11 NT19, so 't11 t19' can come from NT33. So if somewhere in the string, 't11' is followed by 't19', then"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-725","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with all the production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols ending with 't's. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I notice that most productions are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTuv NTwz, where NTxy are non-terminals, and the right-hand side are other non-terminals or terminals. Some productions directly end with terminals like 't44' or 't8'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t12 t16 t31 t36 t54 t33 t67 t13 t54 t91 t83 t87 t33 t67 t12 t6 t11 t16 t90 t4 t87 t12 t67 t2 t83 t6 t6 t16 t38 t90 t12 t12 t33 t11 t13 t38 t13 t28 t87.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol S is defined as S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the initial step would be to see if the string can be broken down into two parts that correspond to NT15 and NT43.\n\nLet's look at the grammar's production for NT15. From the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So, NT15 produces NT37 followed by NT15. This suggests a recursive production, so any string that comes from NT15 will have a structure that includes NT37 followed by the same NT15 rule. \n\nAdditionally, looking at NT43, from the grammar, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. NT6 is a production that directly becomes 't6', and NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT5. Wait, NT15's production is NT37 NT15, and in the string, I see t37 later on. That might be significant. \n\nWait, I think I might be getting ahead of myself. Let me approach this methodically. \n\nThe string starts with t12, then t16, etc. The first two terminals are t12 and t16. Let's see if these can be produced by some non-terminals. From the grammar, the non-terminals include NT12, NT16, etc. For example, NT12 \u2192 NT28 NT7, and NT28 can produce t67, t24, etc. But this seems a bit complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the derivation path. Starting from S, which produces NT15 NT43. So any valid string must be the concatenation of what NT15 produces and what NT43 produces. So the string must be split into two parts: the first part from NT15 and the second from NT43.\n\nLooking at the given string, let's see if I can split it into two parts somewhere. The string is 39 terms long. Let's try splitting it after the first, second, etc., terms to see if the first part can be generated by NT15 and the second by NT43.\n\nWait, but NT15 is recursive, so the first part may consist of multiple applications of NT15's production. Let's see the initial production for NT15 is NT37 NT15. So NT15 can produce NT37 followed by NT15, which can in turn produce another NT37 and so on. This suggests that any string generated by NT15 would consist of a sequence of t37's followed by something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the entire string can be generated by S, which requires that the string is the concatenation of what NT15 and NT43 produce. So the string must be t followed by t, where t is a terminal, or a non-terminal, but in this case, it's all terminals.\n\nLet me check NT15 and NT43's productions. NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, so it's recursive. The termination would be when NT37 produces something. Looking at NT37's production: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So NT37 produces NT19 twice. Then, looking at NT19, it has two productions: NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 and NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT19 has two rules: one is NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 and another is NT19 \u2192 NT19 NT19. Or maybe I misread. Wait, looking again: NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38 and NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, under the grammar, I see:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19\n\nSo NT19 can produce either NT12 and NT38 or NT51 and NT19. And NT51 is defined as NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20. NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, and NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. \n\nWait, let me try to trace this. Let's suppose I have a string generated by S: it starts with NT15 and NT43. So S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which must each derive into a terminal string. \n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So, this is a recursive rule. To terminate, eventually, it must produce NT37 that doesn't lead to another NT15. But from NT37, it's NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So that would produce two NT19's, each of which can further produce other things.\n\nLet's try to see if any of the terminals from NT15's productions fit into the string. From NT15, each step gives a NT37, which is two NT19's. Each NT19 can either produce NT51 NT19 or NT12 NT38. Wait, actually, looking back, I think I misread that. Let me correct:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19\n\nand\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38.\n\nWait, so NT19 has two productions: N19 can become NT51 NT19 or NT12 NT38. So each NT19 may produce a non-terminal combination that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20.\n\nThen NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. And NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT5. But looking at NT5's productions, I don't see any terminals for NT5. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT5 \u2192 NT26 NT2.\n\nWait, then NT26 can be NT24 NT34 or NT26 NT6? Let me look:\n\nUnder the grammar, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34\n\nand\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT24 NT34 (duplicate, I think it might be a typo, but anyway, only one rule?

The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember has specific characteristics: each production rule has a single non-terminal on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. \n\nThe string to evaluate is `t12 t12 t38 t99 t87 t33 t87 t13 t16 t38 t36 t54 t38 t13 t6 t13 t54 t12 t12 t33 t67 t91 t83 t6 t99 t63 t55 t6 t16 t54 t16 t33 t88 t6 t6 t55 t63 t12 t13`. \n\nFirst, I should parse the grammar to understand how the rules work and see which terminals can be derived from the non-terminals. Let's look at the grammar provided. It's a bit extensive, but I notice that many of the rules produce terminals. For example, `NT5`: `t2`, and `NT4`: `t48`, etc.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it consists of a series of t's followed by numbers. I'm wondering if these are the terminals in the grammar. So, each `tN` is a terminal symbol, right? \n\nStarting with the start symbol S: `S-> NT15 NT43`. So S produces NT15 and NT43. Now, each NT is a non-terminal that eventually produces a sequence of terminals.\n\nI think I need to simulate the parsing process. Since it's in CNF, we can perform a recursive descent parser. But since I'm just determining if the string is generated, maybe I can follow the possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S is NT15 and NT43. So each of these will produce sequences that, when combined, form the entire string.\n\nLet's break down NT15: `NT15 -> NT37 NT15`. Wait, but I think that's a typo or perhaps a loop? Wait, looking again, perhaps I misread. Let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT15 NT43.\n\nThen, NT15 is defined as NT37 NT15. Wait, that's NT15 -> NT37 NT15.

The terminals are the 'tN' parts, with N being a number. Each production rule for a non-terminal has two parts on the right, which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSince this is in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So, to parse the string, we need to see if it can be built bottom-up by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: it's a series of t's with numbers, each separated by a space. The first two t's are t12, t12, then t38, etc.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, I need to see if any of the production rules can derive a sequence that includes these t's in the correct order.\n\nFor example, looking at NT28 -> 't4' (from grammar rule NT28 -> 't4'), but I think more accurately, NT28 is a non-terminal that can produce certain sequences. Wait, no, wait: looking again, the grammar rules for the non-terminals end with some terminals. For example:\n\nNT52 -> 't44' (a terminal)\n\nNT44 -> 't6'\n\nNT42 -> 't5'\n\nNT13 -> 't39'\n\nNT28 -> 't67'\n\nSo I can see that some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal. Others produce two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, the parsing will involve substituting non-terminals with their right-hand sides until we have all terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with t12 t12 t38 t99 t87 t33 t87 t13 t16 t38 t36 t54 t38 t13 t6 t13 t54 t12 t12 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-738","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar seems pretty complex with a lot of non-terminals, each expanding into other non-terminals or terminals marked with 'tX'. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I think are terminals.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Here, a is a terminal. The given grammar has rules where some non-terminals expand into other non-terminals and sometimes directly into terminals. For example, NT44 directly becomes 't6', and NT1 becomes 't24'.\n\nThe string is: t12 t12 t33 t11 t90 t31 t54 t55 t6 t33 t12 t13 t16 t90 t63 t33 t11 t38 t54 t13 t91 t39 t39 t39 t69 t72 t33 t33 t16 t3 t3 t3 t72 t87 t6 t31 t36 t33 t33 t39.\n\nI notice that some of the terminals are repeated, like t12, t33, etc. Since the grammar may generate repeated values through different paths, I need to see if it's possible to derive this string step by step.\n\nI think the approach should be to try to parse the string from left to right using the given productions. Each non-terminal in the grammar can generate certain terminals or other non-terminals. So, I'll start by looking at the first few symbols and see if they can be generated by any rule.\n\nLet's break down the string into smaller segments. The string starts with t12 t12. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT24 and NT25 can produce t5 or t55. Wait, looking closely, NT24 and NT25 have rules that sometimes generate terminals:\n\nLooking at the NT24 rules:\nNT24 -> NT48 NT5\nNT24 -> NT4 NT44\nNT24 -> NT44 NT21\nNT24 -> NT25 NT0\nNT24 -> NT24 NT24\nAnd for NT25:\nNT25 -> NT13 NT47\nNT25 -> NT47 NT45\nNT25 -> NT50 NT30\nNT25 -> NT52 NT24\n...\nBut the terminals are in other rules. For example, NT5 is 't2', NT44 is 't6', NT4 is 't48', etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT24: I see that some rules produce terminals. For example, NT52 -> 't44' and NT44 -> 't6', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all the non-terminals that can produce each terminal. For example:\n\nLooking for 't12', I'll scan through the grammar to find rules that produce t12.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT51 -> NT50 NT20: No terminals here.\nNT28 -> NT6 NT9: NT6 and NT9 are still non-terminals, but NT9 has some rules that go to terminals, like NT9 -> NT4 NT52 and NT52 -> 't44', so NT9 can produce t44, but that doesn't help with t12.\n\nLooking through all the rules, perhaps NT28 is involved? Wait, NT28 -> NT26 NT23; NT26 can produce t12, based on NT26 rules: NT26 -> NT24 NT34. NT24 can produce t2 if any of its rules hit a terminal. Wait, NT24 can produce 't5' from NT1? Or perhaps NT45, no.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list out all the terminals and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking at the NT50 rules: NT50 can produce 't33' and 't20' via NT15 and NT47, which eventually lead to 't33' in some cases.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for specific terminals and see how they can be produced.\n\nLet's take the first token, t12. Looking for any non-terminal rule that produces 't12'. I see that NT13 -> 't39' and NT6 -> 't17', but t12 is tricky.\n\nWait, wait, in the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT27 rules: NT27 -> NT8 NT17. Then NT8 is 't40 NT49, and NT49 is 't47' and 't27'. Doesn't help for t12.\n\nLooking at rule NT21 -> NT10 NT10, which leads to NT10 -> NT50 NT30, which in turn leads to 't33' and 't33', so no t12.\n\nLooking at NT28 -> NT26 NT23. NT26 can go to 't12' via NT26 -> NT24 NT34 and NT24 can go to NT44 NT21, which can go to 't6 NT31, which is 't6' and 't31', which is 't6' and something else. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to see which non-terminal can produce t12. Looking through the rules, I see NT21 can produce 't33' and 't36' via other branches. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, looking at NT23: NT23 -> NT2 NT50. NT2 is 't41' and NT41 -> 't7' and 't31', which doesn't help. Maybe I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps NT28 can produce 't12' via some path.\n\nWait, let's see: NT28 -> NT26 NT23.\n\nIf NT26 produces 't12', then that would be good. Looking at NT26 rules: NT26 -> NT24 NT34.\n\nSo, for NT26 to produce 't12', either NT24 or NT34 must produce 't12'.\n\nLooking at NT24 rules: NT24 can produce 't5' from NT1, but that gets 't5' and 't44'? Not directly 't12'.\n\nWait, looking for all rules that can produce 't12':\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules:\n\n- NT16 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT17 -> 't33' (no)\n- NT21 -> 't36' (no)\n- NT24: Does any rule produce 't12' for NT24? From the list, NT24's rules don't directly produce 't12'.

{"custom_id":"request-747","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's see. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string has a series of tokens like t38, t31, etc. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know about CNF. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a string of terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, all productions except the start symbol must be non-terminals producing two non-terminals. The start symbol can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S, with the production S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S is a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals, NT15 and NT43. Then each of those NTs have their own productions, many of which are two non-terminals, but some are terminals, like 't48'.\n\nSo, the string we're given consists of several 't' terms, which are likely terminals, and some NTs. The string starts with t38 t31 t31... and so on. My task is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S following the productions.\n\nSince this is a CNF grammar, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others. So the process generates a parse tree where each internal node has exactly two children. Therefore, the string should have a length that is 2^k + 1, where k is the number of productions applied, but since the string can be built incrementally, it's more about checking if each 't' in the string can be reached through the productions.\n\nBut in this case, the string is quite long, so doing a full parse might be tedious. Maybe I can approach this by checking the possible derivations step by step, but that might not be feasible manually. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the grammar's start symbol and see how the string could be built.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar more carefully. The start symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT43. So, S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nThen, NT15 can produce NT37 NT15, and NT43 can produce NT6 NT1, but I need to check the exact productions. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT52 is the only terminal production, with NT52 \u2192 't44'. Hmm, maybe I need to look for all the possible ways the non-terminals can produce terminals.\n\nWait, another approach: to determine if the given string is in the language generated by the grammar, I can build a parse tree from the top down, using the productions in reverse. Starting from the leftmost terminal and see if it can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nBut given the length of the string, that might take a while. Alternatively, I can check if each terminal in the string can be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string: t38, t31, t31, t16, t31, t63, t48, t6, t6, t16, t69, t39, t39, t89, t69, t39, t69, t33, t18, t6, t90, t63, t67, t2, t83, t18, t6, t33, t16, t3, t3, t3, t72, t33, t33, t33, t16, t3, t3, t7.\n\nWow, that's a lot. Maybe I can check for some terminals that appear in the grammar. Let's see, for example, 't44' is produced by NT52. But looking at the string, 't38' appears, which isn't present as a terminal production in the grammar. Wait, does the grammar have any productions that produce 't38'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production that ends with 't38'. The only productions with 't's are:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't44'\n- NT9 \u2192 't28'\n- NT12 \u2192 't16'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT24 \u2192 't18' and 't55'\n- NT29 \u2192 't63'\n- NT31 \u2192 't91'\n- NT41 \u2192 't31'\n- NT51 \u2192 't38' and 't...'\n\nWait, looking closer, in the grammar, NT51 can produce 't38' and also NT40, etc. Wait, actually, no, let me check each production:\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have a mix of NT productions and terminal productions. Let me check each line:\n\nFor instance, the production NT45 \u2192 't67' is present. Similarly, NT44 \u2192 't6', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, so for example, NT51 can produce 't38', 't50', etc. Let me check the lines.\n\nLooking for NT51:\n\nThe relevant lines are:\n\nNT51 -> NT50 NT20\nNT51 -> NT50 NT20 (there's a duplicate)\nWait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I read it wrong.\n\nHmm, let me list all the lines as rules:\n\nWait, no, actually, each production line starts with NT followed by two other NTs, except for the ones that end with 't'.\n\nWait, so the grammar has a mix.

{"custom_id":"request-767","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has multiple production rules, and the string provided has a series of 't' tokens, which probably correspond to terminals in the grammar. \n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. A grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form if each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this because all the productions on the left side of the arrow have two non-terminals on the right, except for the ones that have a single terminal like 't' or something else. Wait, actually looking at some of the rules, like NT24 -> 't5', that's a production with just a terminal. So the grammar includes both types, but since it's given in CNF, probably it's structured with two non-terminals per production for non-terminals, and terminals are treated as their own productions.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' tokens. So my goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces NT15 and NT43, which are non-terminals. So the first step is to see how the string starts with 't13 t6 t99 t38...' which might correspond to a derivation from S.\n\nWait, but the initial productions are S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which are two non-terminals. That means the string should start with the terminals resulting from these non-terminals. So perhaps NT15 and NT43 must produce sequences that start with 't13 t6 t99...' etc.\n\nI need to check each rule to see which non-terminals produce which terminals. Let's look at the rules:\n\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15: Hmm, circular, might need to find a path from NT15 to a terminal.\n- NT37 -> NT19 NT19: Again, another non-terminal. So NT37 needs to resolve further.\n- NT19 -> NT12 NT38: Now, I need to see what NT12 and NT38 produce.\n- NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48\n- NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n- NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30\n- NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43\nWait, this seems to be getting more nested. Maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals they belong to. For example, 't13' appears multiple times. Let's check which non-terminals produce 't13'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT13 -> 't39' (but that's a single terminal)\nWait, no, some of the rules have terminals. For example:\n- NT13 -> 't39'\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n- NT48 -> 't87'\n- NT2 -> 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't48'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT6 -> 't16'\n- NT7 -> 't35'\n- NT8 -> 't40'\n- NT9 -> 't28'\n- NT10 -> 't50'\nWait, so there are several non-terminals that directly produce terminals. For example, NT28 produces 't67' and 't4' from NT52.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT24 has two productions: NT24 -> 't5' and NT24 -> 't18'. So depending on which production is used, it can produce either 't5' or 't18'. Similarly, NT23 -> 't7' or 't55', and so on.\n\nBut looking at the given string, the first token is 't13', which is a terminal. So I need to see which non-terminals can produce 't13'. Looking through the rules, I see NT13 -> 't39', but 't39' is another terminal. So that might not help. Alternatively, NT21 can produce 't10' via NT10, but that's a long way down.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building a parse tree or using a top-down parsing method like the CYK algorithm, but considering the size of the string, that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can check each production rule step by step to see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nLet's start with the first token 't13'. Looking for a production that leads to 't13'. From the rules, perhaps NT13 -> 't39' doesn't give 't13', but maybe NT21 or NT52 produce 't13'?\n\nLooking at NT52 -> 't44' and NT9 -> 't52', so NT9 can produce 't44'. NT44 -> 't6', so NT9 can produce 't6's. But we have 't13' in the string. Let's see other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Looking through all productions for terminals, perhaps NT28 can produce 't67' and 't4', and NT12 can produce 't21 t48'. Alternatively, NT8 -> 't40' and 't49'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't in the language because one of the terminals doesn't have a corresponding production path leading back to the start symbol.\n\nWait, another approach: each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is a series of terminals, each step must be producing a terminal. So we need to see if each token in the string can be traced back through the productions from the start symbol.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol S produces NT15 and NT43. So any string generated will have to be entirely produced by alternating these non-terminals' terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t13 t6 t99 t38 t63 t13 t12 t12 t12 t91 t83 t83 t41 t18 t6 t18 t90 t67 t13 t12 t67 t7 t83 t6 t6 t11 t7 t11 t7 t83 t18 t6 t67 t13 t54 t13 t83 t72 t33 t16 t24.\n\nThis seems like a very long string, and each 't' is a terminal, so each of these must come from a production.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, some non-terminals have multiple terminals as possible outputs. For example, NT24 can produce 't5' or 't18', which could explain multiple uses of similar 't's.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that not all tokens in the string are covered by the productions in the grammar. Let me check each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string contains a terminal that isn't present in any production's right-hand side. Looking at the productions, all terminals are t2, t5, t7, t9, t11, t12, t13, t16, t17, t18, t24, t28, t33, t35, t36, etc. Hmm, but the string has tokens like t13, t6 (if any?), t99, etc. Wait, looking again:\n\nThe string is: `t13 t6 t99 t38 t63 t13 t12 t12 t12 t91 t83 t83 t41 t18 t6 t18 t90 t67 t13 t12 t67 t7 t83 t6 t6 t11 t7 t11 t7 t83 t18 t6 t67 t13 t54 t13 t83 t72 t33 t16 t24.\n\nWait, I notice that t6 appears once, but looking back, the productions don't have a non-terminal that produces 't6'. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, is there any non-terminal that can produce 't6'? Let's see:\n\n- NT17 -> 't33' (from NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30, and NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32, NT30 \u2192 NT32 NT8, etc. Not directly t6).\n\nWait, let me look at all the rules to see if any right-hand side includes 't6'. For example:\n\n- NT47 -> NT25 NT16: Does any of these non-terminals produce t6? NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47, etc.\n\nWait, NT44 -> 't6', so NT44 is a terminal. So if any rule produces NT44, that can produce 't6'. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-758","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see various non-terminals (like S, NT15, NT50, etc.) on the left side, and combinations of non-terminals on the right, sometimes with terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t13 t83 t72 t67 t7 t83 t55 t6 t16 t69 t39 t39 t39 t69 t69 t72 t11 t2 t83 t6 t13 t12 t12 t6 t67 t2 t39 t72 t33 t33 t16 t72 t18 t6 t16 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t2`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with t13, t83, t72, etc. So I need to see if the grammar can produce such a sequence starting from S.\n\nThe top-level production is S \u2192 NT15 NT15. Wait, no, looking back, S \u2192 NT15 NT15? No, actually, looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Wait, no. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the first line is S \u2192 NT15 NT15. No, no, let me look closely. The user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar: S -> NT15 NT43. NT50 -> NT1 NT32, NT36 -> NT42 NT48, etc.\"\n\nWait, the first line is S -> NT15 NT43. That seems a bit off. Let me verify: Yes, first line is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S starts with NT15 NT43. But in the grammar provided, S seems to be the start symbol, but the production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Wait, that can't be right because in CNF, S would be a single non-terminal, but if NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals, this production would lead to two non-terminals, which might complicate things.\n\nBut let me check the rest of the grammar. For example, NT50 is produced by NT1 NT32, etc. So each Nt production is a combination of two non-terminals except for some that produce terminals like NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT30, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the grammar, I see some NTs produce terminals:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t2, NT4 \u2192 t48, NT12 \u2192 t16, etc. So each terminal is either a single non-terminal or generated by a production that directly produces a terminal.\n\nSo, the initial string starts with t13, which is a terminal. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t13.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48, and NT31 \u2192 NT40 NT49, but no, wait, checking the grammar entries:\n\nLooking for t13: Let's see the productions:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48, but that's non-terminals. But NT48 \u2192 NT15 NT41, etc. Then maybe NT21 can eventually produce t13?\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me look for any terminal production that results in t13. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, let's search the productions for any that produce t13.\n\nLooking through the end of the grammar:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT40 NT49, but that's non-terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check each non-terminal's productions:\n\nLooking for 't13' in the productions:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t69: So NT13 produces t69.\n- NT12 \u2192 t16: So t12 produces t16.\n- NT23 \u2192 t7: So NT23 produces t7.\n- NT24 \u2192 t5: t24 produces t5.\n- NT26 \u2192 t12: so t26 produces t12, which then becomes t16.\n- NT28 \u2192 t16: so t28 becomes t16.\n- NT29 \u2192 t63: t29 becomes t63 (but that's a dead end? Wait, no, t63 isn't a terminal. Wait, no, the grammar entries are either non-terminals or terminals. Wait, no, looking again, the grammar seems to have some branches that directly terminate.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar correctly. Let me list all the NT's and their immediate productions:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't44' (produces t44)\n- NT44 \u2192 't6' (t6)\n- NT42 \u2192 't5' (t5)\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47\n- NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT48, NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21, NT44 \u2192 t6, NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48, which leads to t6, etc.\n- Hmm, but it's getting too nested. Let me instead try to build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can derive the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check each step. Let's start with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string is derived from NT15 and NT43.\n\nNow, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, so NT15 can be expanded as NT37 NT15. Then, NT37 can expand further. Let's see: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 (from the given grammar).\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, I notice that NT37 has two productions: \n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 and NT19 NT19. Wait, let me check: Looking through the grammar, NT37 appears twice: once as NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, and another as NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. Wait, no, actually, wait, in the provided grammar, NT37 is written twice: \n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n\nand later,\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Let me check the given grammar entries again. In the user's provided grammar, the lines are:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n\nand\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT5 NT30\n\n...\n\nLooking further, the user wrote:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT45\nNT45 -> NT16 NT3\nNT19 -> NT... etc.\n\nSo from the grammar, NT37 has two productions: \n\n1. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT45\n2. NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 (Is that correct? Or is there a duplication in the user's question?)\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nWait, that can't be right. Perhaps it's a typo. Let me look.\n\nActually, checking the user's grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\nNT36 -> NT5 NT30\n...\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo and the same production appears twice, but it's more likely that the real NT37 has one production.\n\nWait, the user list:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nand then later\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nWait, that suggests duplication. But that's not possible in a standard grammar. So perhaps that's a typo, but in any case, I need to extract it correctly.\n\nWait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT52 -> 't44' NT44...\", but perhaps that's not relevant. Let me just focus on the NT37.\n\nSo, in any case, assuming NT37 can expand to 'something' that can lead to t13.\n\nBut wait, t13 appears at the beginning of the string as t13, which is a terminal. So to start with, t13 must be produced by a non-terminal NT13 or some other way.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT13 \u2192 t69, which is a non-terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps starting from S \u2192 NT15 NT43. NT15 can be NT37 NT15, and NT43 is a production that may eventually lead to t13.\n\nWait, this is getting very confusing. Maybe a better approach is to try to match the string step by step, building a parse tree.\n\nLet me start building the string:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt13 t83 t72 t67 t7 t83 t55 t6 t16 t69 t39 t39 t39 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-781","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The starting symbol is S, which produces NT15 and NT43. NT15 in turn produces NT37 and NT15 again, and NT43 produces NT27 and 't0'. Wait, that 't0' seems a terminal, but maybe that's part of the derivation.\n\nLooking further, I see NT9 and NT1 are part of the rules. For example, NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which suggests recursion. But how does that translate into the string we have?\n\nThe string to check is: `t90 t54 t16 t90 t36 t13 t13 t6 t31 t4 t87 t91 t90 t36 t11 t7 t83 t18 t6 t67 t16 t33 t55 t6 t48 t6 t36 t90 t54 t12 t90 t16 t38 t63 t11 t2 t83 t6 t13 t6 t16 t37`.\n\nLet me parse some of these terminal symbols to see if they match the grammar. For instance, 't90' appears several times. Looking at the grammar, NT51 can produce 't90' via NT51 -> NT50 NT20, and NT50 -> NT41 NT43, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Alternatively, looking at other NT rules, I see NT9 -> NT52 NT4, but NT4 -> 't48', which is a terminal. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nWait, starting from the beginning: S -> NT15 NT43. So the string should start with the concatenation of the expansion of NT15 and NT43. Let me see what NT15 produces. From the rules, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So that would mean it's recursive, perhaps producing a sequence that can be t37 followed by more of NT15. But in the string, after S, it starts with 't90'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me list all the NT rules and their terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some NT symbols directly produce terminal strings. For example:\n\nNT52 -> 't44'\n\nNT19 -> 't38'\n\nNT5 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't48'\n\nNT29 -> 't63'\n\nNT9 -> 't28'\n\nSo these are terminal symbols. So any NT rule that produces just a single terminal is a leaf.\n\nWait, but many rules produce two NTs. So the string is a series of these terminal symbols, so for the string to be generated, each terminal must correspond to a derivation path ending with that symbol.\n\nSo let's consider the structure.\n\nThe string starts with 't90'. Looking at possible NTs that produce 't90'. From the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT41 -> NT7 NT31. But where does 7 come from? NT7 -> NT52 NT4, so that would produce 't46 t4'. Not 't90'.\n\nLooking further, NT51 -> NT50 NT20. NT50 -> NT41 NT43. NT41 -> NT7 NT31. So NT50 would produce 't46 t4' followed by NT43. NT43 -> NT27 't0'. Wait, NT27 is 't16' but then 't0' would be from NT0, which is NT30 NT20. So 't16' followed by 't41' which is NT41 -> NT7 NT31. Hmm, not matching 't90'.\n\nAlternatively, looking for NTs that produce 't90'. Wait, from the rules, is there any NT that directly produces 't90'? I don't see that. All seem to go through various NT rules.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think about the overall structure. The string starts with 't90', which must come from an NT production.\n\nLooking at NT9 -> NT52 NT4. NT52 -> 't44', and NT4 -> 't48'. So that gives 't44 t48', but that's 't4448', which is different from 't90'.\n\nAnother option: NT51 -> NT50 NT20. NT50 -> NT41 NT43. NT43 -> NT6 NT1. NT6 -> 't16' and NT1 -> 't24'. So the right side of NT50 would be 't16 t24', which would contribute 't1624' as a substring. But the string starts with 't90', so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the string doesn't start with S's left-hand side, because S is NT15 NT43. So the expansion would start with NT15 NT43, which if NT15 is NT37 NT15 (recursive), and each NT37 might expand into something.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at the string and see which terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it contains 't90', 't54', 't16', etc. Let me check if any NT rule produces 't54'. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT31 -> 't91', not helpful. NT91 isn't a terminal. Maybe 't54' comes from NT29: NT29 -> NT28 NT48. NT28 can be NT26 or NT7. NT26 -> NT24 NT34. NT24 appears multiple times, some rules produce 't5' or 't35', etc.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if any NT rule produces 't54' directly. I don't see it. Each NT seems to expand into other NTs except for some that directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the string includes 't90' as part of a larger expansion. Maybe from NT28 -> NT20 NT1, but then I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated by the grammar, but I'm not seeing it. But given the structure, it's possible that some of these terminals don't fit the grammar. For example, 't90' isn't directly produced by any NT, so perhaps the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the rules to see if any NT produces 't90'. Checking each rule:\n\n- NT52 -> 't44' (terminal)\n- NT19 -> 't38' (terminal)\n- NT5 -> 't2' (terminal)\n- NT4 -> 't48' (terminal)\n- NT29 -> 't63' (terminal)\n- NT9 -> 't28' (terminal)\n- NT4 -> 't48' (terminal)\n- NT50 -> 't33' (terminal)\nWait, NT50: according to the rules, NT50 -> NT41 NT43, but NT41 and NT43 might expand into other NTs, but do they ever produce a terminal? Not directly. So the only way to get a terminal is through some expansion that eventually leads to a rule that produces a single terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. If NT37 can expand into something that eventually leads to a terminal, then NT15 can produce a string starting with whatever NT37 produces, followed by more expansions.\n\nBut in the string, after 't90' comes 't54', which might come from NT29's expansion: NT29 -> NT28 NT48. If NT28 can expand into 't16', since NT28 -> NT26 or NT7, and NT7 -> 't35' or 't4'. Hmm, but 't54' isn't matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't54' is from NT29: 't28 t48'. But NT28 could produce 't16' or 't13'. Wait, NT28 has rules: NT28 -> NT26 NT23 or NT7 NT9. So if NT26 -> 't6' (from NT26 -> 't6'), and NT23 -> NT2 NT50. NT2 is NT41 NT32, NT41 -> NT7 NT31, etc. It's getting too deep.\n\nI'm getting stuck, so maybe it's easier to say that the string isn't generated because some terminals don't match the grammar's rules. For example, looking for 't90' in the string, if no NT rule directly produces 't90', then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me check the rules again."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is on the left, and the right side has either two non-terminals or a terminal. That helps because it simplifies the parsing process, so I can use techniques like CYK parsing or look for specific patterns.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's quite extensive with many production rules. Some of the rules are for terminals like 't44', 't6', 't5', 't2', etc. So each rule that ends with a string of terminals is a terminal production, and the rest are non-terminal productions.\n\nThe string to check is: `t13 t13 t16 t31 t36 t12 t67 t7 t83 t6 t6 t16 t33 t11 t38 t54 t38 t54 t12 t33 t67 t91 t83 t87 t16 t38 t39 t69 t6 t99 t13 t12 t6 t11 t54 t16 t33 t55 t6 t55 t36 t54`.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these terms are single terminals, so the string is a sequence of these terminal symbols. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production is S -> NT15 NT43. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43.\n\nI need to find a derivation starting from S and see if it can produce the given string.\n\nLet me try to break down the string. It starts with 't13' and ends with 't54'. Let's see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nFrom the grammar, 't13' is in NT23's production because NT23 -> 't7' and also NT23 -> NT8 NT17. But NT23 also has a production NT23 -> 't39'? Wait, no, looking back, NT23 is defined as NT23 -> NT15 -> is that correct? Wait no, checking the grammar: I see NT23 -> NT31 NT50 NT5...

The user provided:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT26\n\nWait no, looking back, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT26, which is a production into other non-terminals. So maybe I need to trace through how each terminal appears.\n\nLet me list all the production rules for each non-terminal, especially those that eventually produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT0 -> NT30 NT20 and also NT0 -> NT52 NT8. NT30 and NT20 have their own productions. NT52 has a terminal string, I think.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT52 is defined as NT52 -> 't44' but that's not the case. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT52 -> NT6 NT25\nNT52 -> 't44'\nWait, no, let me check: the grammar has several entries.

The first part is 't13 t13 t16 t31 t36 t12 t67 t7 t83 t6 t6 t16 t33 t11 t38 t54 t38 t54 t12 t33 t67 t91 t83 t87 t16 t38 t39 t69 t6 t99 t13 t12 t6 t11 t54 t16 t33 t55 t6 t55 t36 t54'.\n\nI can start by trying to match the initial symbols to see which non-terminals they come from.\n\nThe start symbol S -> NT15 NT43. So NT15 and NT43 must derive sequences that, when combined, form the string.\n\nWait, actually, S is NT15 NT43, but since the string starts with 't13', I need to see if either NT15 or NT43 can derive a 't13' symbol.\n\nLooking at NT15: It has a production rule NT15 -> NT37 NT15 and also NT15 -> NT30 NT20. Let's see what NT15 can generate.\n\nWait, wait, according to the grammar:\n\nNT15 -> NT30 NT20 or NT37 NT15.\n\nBut I'm more interested in NT15's terminal productions if any, which I don't see. So perhaps NT15 is a non-terminal that only produces sequences of other non-terminals, so it doesn't directly produce terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT43's production is in the start symbol. Looking at NT43:\n\nNT43 -> NT6 NT1 and also other non-terminals. NT43 might be a non-terminal that doesn't directly produce terminals. So perhaps the initial NT15 and NT43 will derive sequences of non-terminals that eventually produce terminals.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string, the first term is 't13', which comes from NT13 -> 't39'. But I'm getting a bit muddled here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to approach this with a tree-like structure, seeing"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-803","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens ending with 't' followed by numbers, so it's definitely a series of terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar structure to see how the string could be derived. The start symbol is S, which produces NT15 NT43. Let me note the terminals and non-terminals in the string. The string starts with 't12', 't99', etc. So I need to see if these can be derived from the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT30 NT20\n- NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43\n- NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20\n- NT6 \u2192 t6, etc.\n\nWait, but the string has t12, which I need to check if any production ends with t12.

Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t12. Looking through the production rules, I don't see any production like NT12 \u2192 t12. The rule is NT12 \u2192 t16, I think. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking back, under NT12, the rule is NT12 \u2192 t16. So that's producing t16, not t12. Hmm, so perhaps t12 is a terminal, and I need to see if any production rules have it. Wait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at NT1 \u2192 NT51 NT38, which eventually could produce t24. Not sure. Let me think about all the rules and see which terminals they produce.\n\nThe terminals in the grammar seem to be t12, t99, t31, etc. I need to see if these are directly produced by any non-terminal. For example, looking for t12:\n\nI see NT23 has a production NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT26, but that's two non-terminals, so it's a bit deeper. Wait, but do any non-terminals directly produce t12? Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT12 \u2192 t16\n\nNT6 \u2192 t6\n\nNT7 \u2192 t7\n\nNT13 \u2192 t69\n\nNT17 \u2192 t33\n\nNT19 \u2192 t54\n\nNT21 \u2192 t99\n\nNT22? Wait, I don't see NT22 in the rules. So 't22' might not be produced by the grammar.\n\nWait, the string includes t12, t99, t31, etc. Let's see:\n\nt99 is present. Does any non-terminal directly produce t99? I don't see that. Maybe through a chain of productions.\n\nBut since this is a CNF grammar, every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So to reach a terminal, you have to go through a chain of productions that eventually lead to a terminal. For example, to reach t99, perhaps through NT1 \u2192 NT51 NT38, and then NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29, etc., until reaching a terminal.\n\nBut this could get complex. Since the grammar has a lot of non-terminal productions, it might be error-prone to track each step. Alternatively, perhaps I can construct the parse tree in a bottom-up way, starting from the string and trying to match the top-down rules.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm, but with a large string, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can check the leftmost and rightmost derivations.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for the start symbol S. It produces NT15 NT43. So S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So in the string, the first tokens should be the leftmost symbols of NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t12 t99 t31 t90 t31 t16 t38 t36 t13 t12 t13 t13 t54 t48 t6 t6 t12 t33 t11 t33 t11 t12 t91 t38 t63 t54 t16 t38 t36 t13 t11 t7 t83 t48 t6 t11 t7 t12 t33 t11 t6 t16 t37.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the string is a possible leftmost or rightmost derivation. Since S \u2192 NT15 NT43, the first step would be to derive the string starting with NT15 and NT43.\n\nSo the first part of the string must correspond to the derivation of NT15 and NT43. Let's take the first part of the string: t12, etc. Let me see what NT15 and NT43 can produce.\n\nFirst, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Hmm, that's a recursive production. So NT15 can produce NT37 followed by another NT15. Alternatively, NT37 might have a production leading to a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT37 rules: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, and NT19 has two rules, one of which is NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, but that would make it recursive again. Wait, NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 or NT19 \u2192 t13. Oh, right, because I see under NT19: one of the productions is NT19 \u2192 t13. So that's a terminal.\n\nSo for NT19, it can produce t13 or another NT51 NT19. So if we're starting with NT15, which is NT37 NT15, then in the first step, NT37 would produce two NT19s, both of which can then produce t13. So for NT15, NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 \u2192 t13 t13.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t12, which is different from t13. Hmm, that might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 production.\n\nWait, maybe I should look more carefully. Let me re-examine the grammar rules:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n\nSo this means that NT15 produces NT37 and then another NT15. So this is a recursive production, which would generate a sequence of NT37 and NT15. Since NT15 can only produce more itself, this would lead to an infinite loop unless NT37 can eventually produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT37's productions: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. So NT37 must produce two NT19s. Then each NT19 can produce t13 or another NT51 NT19.\n\nSo the derivation would be: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 \u2192 (NT19 NT19) NT15 \u2192 (t13 t13) NT15 \u2192 (t13 t13) (NT37 NT15) \u2192 ... which would go on infinitely unless there's a way to break it, but it seems like NT15 can't produce any terminal except through recursion, which would require NT37 to eventually break into terminals.\n\nWait, but wait, NT19 can produce t13 or another NT51 NT19. So the only way NT19 can produce a terminal is via NT19 \u2192 t13. So in the case where NT37 produces two NT19s, each can produce t13. So NT37 \u2192 t13 t13, so NT15 \u2192 t13 t13 NT15. But that would lead to an infinite loop again unless NT15 can terminate.\n\nThis seems problematic. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way for NT15 to end before the recursion. Wait, but according to the rules, NT15 is defined as NT37 followed by NT15, so you can't remove NT15 without NT37 producing something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the production rule for NT15. Let me check again: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So that's a recursive production. Therefore, any derivation that uses NT15 would require NT37 to eventually derive some terminals. But as per the rules, NT37's only production is NT19 NT19, which would go on to produce two NT19s, each of which can produce t13 or more NT51s.\n\nWait, but then NT19's production has two"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-802","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by it. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces: \"t33 t67 t99 t6 t31 t63 t91 t31 t63 t55 t6 t16 t67 t7 t83 t88 t6 t6 t67 t38 t31 t13 t31 t90 t54 t12 t54 t31 t54 t13 t54 t91 t83 t67 t7 t83 t12 t11 t2 t83 t6 t11 t54\".\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a context-free grammar where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol does not appear on the right-hand side of any rule except when it's the only rule.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see S is the start symbol, and several rules like S -> NT15 NT43, which means the start symbol directly produces two non-terminals. Each production in the grammar seems to be in CNF because they either have two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string is a concatenation of terminals, so I need to see if the grammar can derive this string starting from S.\n\nI think I should parse the string to see if it can be broken down according to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens in the string: 41 tokens. Wait, let me double-check. The string is separated by spaces, so splitting it gives me 41 elements. Since the start symbol S is the highest level, the derivation should result in exactly the count of the string tokens. So S should produce a string with exactly 41 terminals. But wait, in the grammar, the right-hand sides are in terms of non-terminals, so each production step increases the number of symbols. But with 41 terminals, the derivation must have produced 41 non-terminals in some way.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to see if each part of the string can be mapped to a production. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for which non-terminals correspond to certain sequences of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT15 produces NT37 and NT15. Wait, that's recursive, but in the string, I don't see t37 appearing, except in places where the string has t7, t12, etc.\n\nWait, the grammar uses NT symbols to represent parts of the string, and each NT leads to specific terminals. So perhaps each NT represents a certain substring.\n\nLet me check the productions. For instance, NT52 can either produce 't44' or 't6 NT25'. But NT25 also has its own production. So for NT52: NT52 \u2192 NT6 NT25 or 't44'.\n\nWait, but the grammar seems complex, so perhaps building a parse tree would be time-consuming. Maybe I should look for patterns or specific steps.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT15 and NT43. So the string must start with the expansion of NT15 followed by NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t33. So let's see which NT can produce t33.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT10 produces NT50 and NT30. NT50 produces NT41 and NT43. Wait, but t41 is not a terminal, so perhaps that's not right. Wait, in the grammar, NT50 produces NT41 and NT43, but in the given string, we have t33, which is a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT10's productions: NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30. Now, NT50's production is either NT41 NT43 or 't44' (from the rules: NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, NT50 \u2192 NT33). Oh, yes, look at this. NT50 has two rules: one is NT41 NT43, and another is 't44' and perhaps another, because in the breakdown, I see NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, NT50 \u2192 NT46 NT17? Wait, no, in the given grammar, I see lines like NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43 and NT50 \u2192 NT33.\n\nWait, no, looking back: The grammar has lines like NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, and for NT50, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, yes, NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, NT50 \u2192 NT33 (maybe it's a typo, but I think it's better to check. Wait, in the given grammar, lines for NT10: NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43, NT50 \u2192 NT33?\n\nWait, no, in the given list, after NT10, I see NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT30, and looking for NT50: \"NT50 -> NT41 NT43\", \"NT50 -> NT33\". So yes, NT50 has two rules: producing t33 and producing NT41 NT43.\n\nSo if the first part of the string is t33, this can come from NT50\u2019s production of 't33'. So S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Now, what comes next depends on the next non-terminal.\n\nWait, so S is NT15 NT43. The string starts with t33, which would come from NT50, but S \u2192 NT15 NT43, so NT15 and NT43 must produce the rest.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me retrace. S is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first two symbols in the string would come from NT15 and NT43. But the string starts with t33, not NT15 or NT43. So perhaps I need to see what NT15 and NT43 produce.\n\nLooking at NT15: The productions for NT15 are NT37 NT15 and NT37 NT37, right? Wait, in the grammar, looking for NT15: lines say \"NT15 -> NT37 NT15\", \"NT15 -> NT19 NT30\", \"NT15 -> NT28 NT13\". Wait, no, looking back at the given grammar:\n\nI see lines like \"NT15 -> NT37 NT15\" (twice) and \"NT15 -> NT19 NT30\", \"NT15 -> NT28 NT13\". Also, in the string, t33 appears, which I think comes from NT50's production 't33'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach symbol in the string must come from a terminal production in the grammar. So, for each terminal in the string, I need to see which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nLooking at the string: 't33' is followed by 't67', then 't99', etc.\n\nWe saw that 't33' is the production of NT50 \u2192 't33'. So if S starts with NT15 NT43, then when we start production, the first non-terminal to expand is NT15, which would produce something, and then NT43, which would produce another.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't33', which is a terminal produced by NT50. So that would mean that either NT15 or NT43 must produce 't33' somehow, but looking at their productions, NT15 only produces non-terminals or sequences, not 't33'. So perhaps S \u2192 NT15 NT43 would expand to something else. Alternatively, maybe the first NT is NT50, but that's not the case because S is defined as NT15 NT43.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first symbols in the string must be the expansion of NT15 followed by NT43.\n\nSo the string starts with 't33', which is produced by NT50 \u2192 't33'. But how can NT15 produce 't33'? Let me check NT15's productions: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 or NT19 NT30 or NT28 NT13. None of these produce 't33' directly. So this suggests that the initial part might be NT43 \u2192 't67' (from NT43 \u2192 't67'), so maybe NT43 produces 't67'.\n\nWait, looking at NT43's productions: \"NT43 -> NT27 NT0\", \""}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it easier for some parsing methods. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar to understand the production rules. From the grammar provided, the starting symbol is S, and it produces NT15 and NT43. Each of these NTs can produce other NTs or terminals, which are the lowercase 't's followed by numbers (like t12, t55, etc.)\n\nThe string given is: t12 t54 t55 t6 t16 t13 t31 t16 t31 t36 t12 t90 t38 t31 t16 t38 t12 t12 t67 t2 t69 t39 t72 t33 t67 t2 t83 t67 t7 t83 t6 t99 t6 t16 t3 t72 t18 t6 t67 t33 t67 t28 t6 t13.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t12, which is a terminal. I should check which production rule can produce t12. Looking at the grammar, let's see:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT12 -> NT21 NT48 and NT48 -> NT44 NT21. Wait, no, actually, NT12 is mentioned as NT12 -> NT21 NT48. But in the list of rules, I don't see NT12 being directly a terminal. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, I see:\nNT12 -> NT21 NT48\nNT48 -> NT44 NT21\nAnd looking further, NT21 has productions:\nNT21 -> NT10 NT10 and NT10 -> NT50 NT30.\n\nWait, maybe I'm going in circles. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the rules that directly produce terminals. For example, looking for NT21, which can produce t67 or something else? Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see that several NTs directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT6 -> 't16'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT13 -> 't39'\nNT17 -> 't33'\nNT7 -> 't35'\nAnd more. So for example, NT21: NT21 -> NT10 NT10, which then each NT10 can produce NT50 NT30. NT50 produces NT41 NT43. NT41 produces t24, and NT43 produces 't6'.\n\nWait, but t10 is a terminal? Wait, checking NT10: NT10 -> NT50 NT30. NT50 goes to NT41 NT43, which produce t24 and t6. So t10 isn't a terminal itself.\n\nWait, no, looking at NT10's productions, I don't see NT10 being a terminal. Instead, NT10 -> NT50 NT30, and NT50 -> NT41 NT43, etc. So NT10 is a non-terminal that can only produce other Nts, not terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some Nts produce terminals, like NT5 -> 't2', NT6 -> 't16', etc. So for example, NT6 directly produces 't16', and NT5 produces 't2'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first few tokens are t12, t54, t55. Let me see which Nts can produce these.\n\nt12 is produced by NT12. But looking at the grammar, NT12 is defined as NT12 -> NT21 NT48. Both NT21 and NT48 are non-terminals. Then, NT48 is NT48 -> NT44 NT21, which again are non-terminals. NT21 is NT21 -> NT10 NT10, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, then how do we get to a terminal like t55? Because according to the grammar, NT55 would be a non-terminal because in the list, I don't see any NT55 being defined as producing terminals. Wait, no, looking back at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, each NT production seems to take the form of two Nts being concatenated. For example, S->NT15 NT43, which are non-terminals.\n\nBut some of these Nts eventually link to terminals. For instance, NT5 has 't2', NT6 has 't16', etc.\n\nSo the process would be starting from S, which is NT15 NT43. So each of those Nts need to be expanded into a sequence of terminals such that their concatenation forms the given string.\n\nBut the string provided is of length 48, and each step of the derivation splits into two, so the number of symbols should be a power of 2 times the initial. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into the production rules step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string using the grammar. Each step would take a chunk of the string and try to match it to a production rule.\n\nStarting with the entire string as S.\n\nS produces NT15 NT43.\n\nSo the string should be parsed as two parts: the first part is NT15, the second part is NT43.\n\nSo, can the first part of the string (starting with t12) be parsed as NT15, and the rest as NT43?\n\nWait, let's see. The string starts with t12. So the first thing we need is NT15.\n\nLooking at what NT15 does. From the grammar, NT15 -> NT37 NT15.\n\nWait, that's an interesting rule. It's recursive because NT15 produces itself. So let's see what NT37 does. NT37 -> NT19 NT19, and NT19 can be NT12 NT38 or NT51 NT19.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's consider whether the string can be built step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to use a top-down parsing method like recursive descent. Let me see if I can construct the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I should look for the presence of certain terminals and see if they can be reached via the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t12 t54 t55 t6 t16 t13 t31 t16 t31 t36 t12 t90 t38 t31 t16 t38 t12 t12 t67 t2 t69 t39 t72 t33 t67 t2 t83 t67 t7 t83 t6 t99 t6 t16 t3 t72 t18 t6 t67 t33 t67 t28 t6 t13.\n\nWait, the last part is t13, and checking the grammar, NT13 -> 't39'. So t13 must be produced directly by NT13, which is a terminal.\n\nSo looking for t13, it must come from NT13 -> 't39'. Wait, but 't13' is 't13', not 't39'. Wait, no, the string has t13 as the last token. Let me check the grammar again: NT13 is defined as NT21? No. Wait, looking at the list of grammar rules, I see:\n\nLooking for Nts that can produce 't13'.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT21 has NT21 -> NT10 NT10, which don't lead to t13. NT13 has NT13 -> NT69... Wait, no. Wait, looking through the list, let me check each NT rule to see if it can produce 't13'.\n\nLooking for any NT that has a production where the RHS includes 't13'.

{"custom_id":"request-824","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, the grammar looks a bit complex with a lot of non-terminals, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, most of the productions seem to fit that, except maybe some of the longer ones, but I think the problem statement mentions it's in CNF, so I can assume that's already handled.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t31 t13 t11 t2 t83 t13 t13 t90 t13 t13 t13 t88 t6 t6 t13 t16 t38 t55 t6 t55 t6 t55 t39 t6 t13 t33 t11 t90 t16 t90 t63 t31 t54 t12 t91 t6 t72 t67 t7 t83 t18 t6 t33 t39`. It's a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string should start with the left-hand side of NT15, followed by NT43, and continue from there.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t31. So I need to check if any of the productions for NT15 or NT43 can produce t31.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n- NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT15 also has other productions, but let's see if any of them directly produce t31.\n\nWait, actually, I should note that some of the NT rules produce terminals. For example, NT27 \u2192 't67', meaning it directly produces the token 't67'. Similarly, NT6 \u2192 't16', NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT47, and so on.\n\nBut the question is, does any production rule for NT15 or NT43 directly include 't31'? Let me check the NT15 productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT37 has a production NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, and also NT37 \u2192 't12'. But no 't31' there.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again. The NT15 has a production rule NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, but besides that, do any of the NT15 rules produce a terminal? Let me scan all the NT15 entries:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n- Also, let me check: Oh, wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT15: \n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n- Also, from the rest of the NT rules, looking for NT15 appearing anywhere else? Nope, it seems NT15 only has that one production here. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The start symbol S is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string must start with the left-hand side of NT15 followed by NT43. But NT15 can only produce something that eventually leads to the first token of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t31. So I need to see if any production rule for NT15 can derive to a token starting with t31. From the grammar, I don't see any production for NT15 that directly produces a terminal. Only via derivations. So perhaps the first part is derived from NT15, the second from NT43, and then the rest?\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the derivation is a tree where each internal node is a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut the string is a linear sequence of terminals, so it must correspond to a leftmost derivation or rightmost or some order. But the point is, each production must generate the string step by step.\n\nLet me try to see what the string is: t31, t13, t11, t2, t83, t13, t13, t90, t13, t13, t13, t88, t6, t6, t13, t16, t38, t55, t6, t55, t6, t55, t39, t6, t13, t33, t11, t90, t16, t90, t63, t31, t54, t12, t91, t6, t72, t67, t7, t83, t18, t6, t33, t39.\n\nSo 37 tokens. Let's see if they can be traced back from the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nSo NT15 and NT43 need to generate the prefixes of the string.\n\nBut NT15 only has a production NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT15 needs to expand into NT37 and itself. That seems recursive, but perhaps it will eventually produce a terminal.\n\nLet's look at NT37:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT37 has two productions: NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 and NT37 \u2192 't12'. Wait, does it also have NT37 \u2192 't12' elsewhere?\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, under NT37: yes, NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19, and NT37 \u2192 't12'.\n\nWait, in the initial list, I see under NT37:\n\n- NT37 -> NT19 NT19\n- Also, under NT37: NT37 -> 't12'? Or is that under another NT?\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nAlso, further down, under NT19: NT19 -> NT13 NT19, etc., and under another NT? Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check:\n\nIn the initial grammar given, under NT37, the last production is NT37 -> 't12'. No, is that correct?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nYes, there's a line: NT37 -> NT19 NT19 and another line: NT37 -> 't12'? No, wait, checking the grammar again:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT37, it's only NT37 -> NT19 NT19. But elsewhere, like NT19, it's also mentioned that NT19 can produce 't13' under another rule. So perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nWait, I think I may have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at the full list, under NT37:\n\nNT37 -> NT19 NT19\n\nAlso, under NT27, which is different, I don't see a 't67' unless it's somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT26 -> 't12' under NT26? No, I think elsewhere. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, under NT26: NT26 -> 't12' is not listed. Let me find it.\n\nWait, here's a line: NT26 -> 't12'. No, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nThen:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20\n\nEtc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to write down the relevant parts.\n\nLooking at NT15:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\n\n- No other productions for NT15.\n\nSo NT15 must be generating a sequence of NT37 and itself. How does NT37 behave?\n\nNT37 produces either NT19 NT19 or 't12'.\n\nWait, so NT37 can produce a terminal 't12' or two copies of NT19.\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is 't31'. So perhaps the NT15 must generate 't31' somehow. But from the production rules, NT15 can only produce sequences of NT37 and NT15, which in turn produce more NTs or terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe S \u2192 NT15 NT43, and the first part is from NT15 and the second from NT43.\n\nThe string starts with 't31', which would need to be generated by NT15 or by NT43.\n\nWait, NT43's productions:\n\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-842","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because I know how to handle that. The string provided is a series of tokens ending with 't', and I need to figure out if the grammar can produce this sequence.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A grammar is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit that structure since all the production rules either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT15 NT43 is a production with two non-terminals, and NT24 \u2192 't48 NT27 would produce a terminal and a non-terminal, but wait, in CNF, that should only produce two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe that's an error, but I'll focus on the correct ones.\n\nGiven that, I need to analyze the provided string: t12 t13 t11 t2 t83 t6 t13 t6 t16 t12 t12 t13 t13 t12 t91 t83 t67 t2 t83 t87 t6 t11 t12 t16 t38 t38 t13 t16 t90 t36 t16 t31 t63 t13 t33 t11 t13 t54 t55 t87 t11 t7 t83 t44 t87.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of t tokens, like t11, t12, etc. Each of these tokens is a terminal symbol. The task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S following the production rules.\n\nStarting with S, which goes to NT15 NT43. So, the first step is to generate NT15 and NT43. Let me break down NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's an issue because NT15 appears on both sides. That suggests it's part of a recursive rule. So, NT15 is defined as NT37 followed by NT15 again. This looks like a loop, so how do we handle that? Since NT15 is on both sides, it's a recursive production that might be used to expand into a sequence of t tokens via other productions.\n\nMoving on, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1. NT6 and NT1 are non-terminals, but NT1 produces 't48, which is a terminal. So NT43 would expand into a sequence starting with some non-terminals that eventually lead to 't48'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part starts with t12, t13, etc. Let's see if these can be connected back to the start rule S \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Let me start by considering how to derive a string starting with t12.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to find which non-terminals produce t12. Let me scan through the productions for NT that have terminal outputs:\n\nI see NT24 \u2192 't5', NT5 \u2192 't2', NT4 \u2192 't48', NT13 \u2192 't39', NT28 \u2192 't67', NT17 \u2192 't33', etc. Hmm, I don't immediately see an NT that produces t12. Wait, that's a problem. Let me check the list again.\n\nHmm, the provided grammar doesn't include any production where a non-terminal directly expands to 't12'. So, if the string starts with t12, and there's no rule in the grammar that directly yields 't12', that would mean the string can't be generated. But wait, maybe 't12' is produced indirectly through a series of expansions.\n\nSo, perhaps t12 is part of a longer sequence generated by a non-terminal. Let's see.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce t12 when expanded. Scanning through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t12. So, without a production that allows NT12 \u2192 't12', it's impossible to derive t12 directly. Therefore, the string can't be part of any derivation because it starts with t12 and there's no rule that introduces it.\n\nWait, but I must check all possibilities. Maybe t12 is part of a deeper expansion. For example, maybe some NT expands to a terminal and another non-terminal that eventually includes t12. Let's explore that.\n\nLooking at productions, for instance, NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT48. NT13 \u2192 't39', which is a terminal. NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT21. NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', etc. Hmm, I don't see any path that leads to t12 through these.\n\nAnother example: NT24 \u2192 't48' and NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32. NT41 \u2192 NT7 NT31, and NT7 \u2192 NT28 NT29, with NT28 having various productions. Still, I don't see t12 appearing there.\n\nI think my initial thought is correct. Since there's no production rule that directly or indirectly produces 't12', the string cannot be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-841","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a bunch of tokens connected by spaces, like \"t13 t18 t6...\" and so on. I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, first, I should look at each token and see if it's a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some symbols like NT24, NT36, etc., are non-terminals because they have -> rules. The terminals are the ones with 't' followed by numbers or maybe some other single-character terminals like 't44' etc. But in the given string, each token is something like \"t13\", \"t18\", up to \"t91\". So, each of these is a terminal, probably representing a single symbol in the language.\n\nNow, the string starts with \"t13 t18 t6...\", which I need to parse according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each step produces two non-terminals. But the string is just a sequence of terminals, so each symbol in the string must be derived directly from a production, perhaps as a single step in the derivation.\n\nWait, but Chomsky normal form for production rules requires each production to have either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, for the entire string to be generated, each part must correspond to a production. But the string is a linear sequence, so the derivation would have to build this string step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should model each \"t\" as the right-hand side of a production. For instance, each \"t13\" corresponds to a terminal, so I need to see if there's a production where the terminal is generated. Looking at the grammar, some rules have letters like 't44' and 't6', etc. So, I think each \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal.\n\nSo, the parsing process would involve each \"t\" being the result of a production. But since the grammar is in CNF, each step combines non-terminals into two symbols, but for terminals, I think they're leaves in the parse tree.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to see if each \"t\" in the string can be matched by a direct rule in the grammar. That is, for each \"t13\", is there a production in the grammar that directly results in \"t13\"?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT19 -> NT12 NT38\n- Wait, no direct t13. Let's see... Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. The production rules that end with t:s are like NT44 -> 't6', NT2 -> 't41', etc. But I need to find if each \"t13\" corresponds to a rule that produces it.\n\nWait, the production rules for terminals are those where NT... -> 't...'. For example, NT13 -> 't69', NT1 -> 't24', etc.\n\nSo for each \"t13\" in the string, I need to see if there's a NT rule that directly generates it. Looking through, I don't see a rule where NT... -> 't13'. So, in the grammar, I don't see any \"t13\" being generated by any rule. Wait, but in the given string, there's a \"t13\" at the beginning. If the grammar doesn't have a rule that produces 't13', then that token can't appear in any string generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, if the string starts with \"t13\", that's a problem because none of the grammar rules produce 't13'. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar, so the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar rules. Let me check again. The rules like NT50 -> NT41 NT43; NT43 -> NT27 NT0; NT0 -> NT30 NT20; then looking further down, there's NT24 -> 't55' which would produce 't55', but I don't see 't13', 't18', etc.\n\nLooking back, the string has tokens like \"t13\", \"t18\", \"t6\", etc. So, each of these should have a corresponding production rule.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\n- NT21 -> NT13 NT48\nBut wait, NT13 -> 't69', and NT21 is replaced by 't13' indirectly. Hmm, no, because 't13' is only in NT13, which is a non-terminal. So, if a rule like NT21 -> 't13' would require a production that directly results in 't13', which it doesn't.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase: In the given grammar, each 'tXX' is generated by a specific non-terminal NT... So, for 't13', does any NT in the grammar have a rule -> 't13'? Let's check.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT19 -> NT12 NT38 (no 't')\n- NT24 -> 't55' (but 't55' isn't in the string)\nWait, I need to scan all the rules to see if any of them produce the terminals in the string.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't48'\n- NT50 -> 't33'\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n- NT27 -> 't18'\nWait, looking through:\n\nNT27 -> 't18' which matches the second token in the string: \"t18\".\n\nThen NT24 -> 't55', but the string starts at \"t13\", so maybe that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the tokens go like t13, t18, t6, etc. So I'm looking for the presence of these in the grammar as direct productions.\n\nLooking through all the rules, do I see any 't13'?\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT21 -> NT13 NT48\nBut wait, NT13 -> 't69', so that's a way but indirect. So, the string has 't13' in the last part, but looking through all the rules, do I have any rule NT... -> 't13'? I don't think so. The rules generate various 't's but I don't see 't13'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me scan all the rules again:\n\n- NT0 -> 't39'? Wait, looking, NT0 -> 't30' and other terms.\n\nWait, looking through all the 't's:\n\n- NT27 -> 't18'\n- NT24 -> 't55'? No, wait NT24 has multiple rules, some produce non-terminals, some produce terminals like 't5'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's easier to create a list of all terminal symbols in the grammar and see if they match the string.\n\nLooking through the production rules, any NT rule's right-hand side is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, let's extract all the terminals:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT52 -> 't44' (so t44 is terminal)\nNT44 -> 't6' (t6)\nNT27 -> 't18' (t18)\nNT24 -> 't5' (t5)\nNT4 -> 't48' (t48)\nNT5 -> 't2' (t2)\nNT13 -> 't69' (t69)\nNT21 -> 't13' via NT13?\nWait, no. NT21 -> NT13 NT48. So to get 't13', you need a production NT13 -> 't13', but I don't see that. Looking again, none of the NT rules produce 't13'. So 't13' is not present in any terminal production in the grammar. Therefore, the string contains 't13' which can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, looking at the last part:\n\nThere's NT4 -> 't48', NT5 -> 't2', NT29 -> 't63', etc. But 't13' is not present as any right-hand side of an NT rule. Therefore, the string has a 't13' that cannot be produced by the grammar, so the output should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-858","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I look at the string: `t54 t83 t67 t2 t83 t6 t13 t12 t33 t11 t33 t67 t12 t91 t83 t69 t72 t33 t67 t7 t83 t11 t2 t83 t48 t6 t16 t72 t72 t11 t7 t83 t11 t7 t83 t88 t6 t11 t12 t6 t16 t90 t38 t4 t87`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a sequence of symbols: some are terminals like 't54', 't67', 't83', etc., and others like 'N1', 'N2', etc., which are non-terminals. The grammar uses non-terminals such as S, NT15, NT50, NT36, and so on.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which according to the first rule becomes NT15 NT43. So the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Each of these non-terminals will need to be expanded into smaller parts until we reach the terminals.\n\nI'll need to see if each non-terminal in the string can expand into a pair of non-terminals or directly into a terminal. Let's look through the grammar rules to see how the non-terminals expand.\n\nFor example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. So NT15 can produce NT37 and another NT15. NT37 then can produce other non-terminals like NT19 or NT19 again. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see that some NT's have rules that produce combinations of NT's.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is 't54'. So I need to see if any non-terminal can directly produce 't54'. Scanning through the grammar rules, I see NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. But none directly produce 't54'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back, the string starts with 't54 t83 t67 t2...'. So 't54' must come directly from a production rule that produces 't54'. Let's check the grammar rules. I see NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT13 \u2192 't39', NT28 \u2192 't67', etc. But where is 't54' coming from?\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all non-terminals that might produce 't54'. I look through the list and see:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\n- NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT17\n- NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19 or NT17 NT45\n\nIt seems none of these produce 't54' directly. So maybe 't54' comes from a non-terminal that isn't listed here, but looking at the given grammar, 't54' isn't directly produced by any production rule except perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. I see NT52 \u2192 't44', but that's not relevant. Maybe I missed a rule that produces 't54'.\n\nWait, let me look at all symbols in the string to see their possible sources. The string has 't54', 't83', 't67', 't2', 't83', 't6', 't13', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, 't54' could be from a production that produces 't54'. Let me check all the rules again. I notice NT52 \u2192 't44' (not relevant), NT3 \u2192 't48', but wait, maybe I'm missing a rule for NT19 or NT44.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 in one rule, but that's not helpful. There's another rule NT19 \u2192 NT54 NT19? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar list, I see:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\n- NT19 also appears in another rule: NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19, but I don't see it having 't54' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps 't54' is part of a production rule. Let me check the rules again more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't immediately see a rule that produces 't54' directly. So maybe the string can't be generated because 't54' isn't a terminal produced by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't54' comes from a non-terminal that I've overlooked.

Hmm, I think I'm not seeing any rule that produces 't54' directly.\n\nWait, maybe I missed the production for some non-terminal. Let me list all non-terminals and their rules to spot any that might produce 't54'.\n\nHere are some of the rules I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't25' (twelve rules for NT1)\n- NT51 \u2192 't90'\n- NT48 \u2192 't87'\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't5'\n- NT29 \u2192 't63'\n- NT4 \u2192 't48'\n- NT50 \u2192 't33'\n- NT12 \u2192 't16'\n- NT51 \u2192 't50' and others\n- NT28 \u2192 't4' and others\n- NT24 \u2192 several rules, like \u2192 't18' and \u2192 't55'\n\nWait, maybe 't54' is part of a larger production. Perhaps a non-terminal can produce a sequence that includes 't54'. Let me think about how the string starts.\n\nThe string starts with 't54 t83 t67...'. So the first symbol is 't54'. If the first part of the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43, then both NT15 and NT43 must expand to include paths that produce these symbols.\n\nBut if I can't find a rule that produces 't54' directly, then the string can't be generated because there's no way to get 't54' from the start symbol S. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 't54' is part of a larger expansion.

{"custom_id":"request-866","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I have a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has specific rules: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions except the ones where terminals appear on the right-hand side are in CNF. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 isn't in CNF because the non-terminal NT15 appears on both sides. However, a production like 't12' \u2192 't12' is a terminal production, which is allowed.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, the left-hand side must be a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side must be two non-terminals or a terminal. So, any production that starts with a non-terminal and has two non-terminals on the right, or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two terminals is valid. Wait, is that right? No, in CNF, each production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a single terminal. So, the production cannot have two terminals on the right side because that would make the string have two terminals at once, which can't be split into two steps.\n\nWait no, looking again, the given grammar includes some productions with two terminals on the right, like NT4 -> 't48' and NT24 -> 't5', etc. Wait, but in the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 't48', which is a terminal, so that's fine. But in the given string, I don't see any two consecutive terminals, but the grammar allows for that. However, the productions in CNF can have only one terminal on the right side, but two terminals would violate the grammar structure because in each step, you can only replace a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or one terminal. So, having two terminals in a production is not allowed in CNF because it would require two consecutive terminals, which can't be derived from a single production in one step. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWell, regardless, I don't think that's the main issue here. The main point is to determine if the given string can be generated by expanding the grammar. The string consists of a series of t followed by numbers. Each t is a terminal, like 't12', 't99', etc.\n\nThe string provided is: `t12 t99 t87 t38 t36 t38 t90 t54 t13 t13 t90 t13 t83 t69 t39 t39 t72 t33 t33 t16 t3 t3 t72 t69 t72 t33 t33 t16 t7 t83 t55 t6 t31 t36 t33 t87 t12 t31 t38 t54 t13 t54 t55 t6 t16 t24`.\n\nI notice that this string has 45 t's connected in a sequence, each separated by a space. The question is whether this can be generated from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first step is to generate two non-terminals: NT15 and NT43. Then, each of these can be expanded into other non-terminals, and eventually, the non-terminals must be expanded into terminal symbols (t followed by a number) until the entire string is composed.\n\nI think the best approach is to construct the parse tree for the given string. For each symbol, determine what non-terminal it corresponds to and check if the string can be broken down into valid productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't12', which corresponds to the terminal NT12. Looking at the grammar, NT12 is defined as NT21 NT48. So, NT12 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. So 't12' can only appear if both NT21 and NT48 can produce 't12' somehow. Wait, no\u2014that's not how it works. Each production is a way to expand a non-terminal into other symbols.\n\nWait, no: in the grammar, NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10, for example. So, each NT21 can be expanded into two NT10 non-terminals. So, to get 't12' in the string, we need a production that eventually produces 't12' as a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. So NT12 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by NT21 followed by NT48. But both NT21 and NT48 are non-terminals, so NT12 can't directly produce a terminal like 't12'. Therefore, NT12 must be expanded further.\n\nWait a second, in the grammar provided, NT12 is a non-terminal, so 't12' must be the result of some expansion. But in the given grammar, NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. Looking at NT21, it's defined as NT10 NT10, and NT48 is defined as NT44 NT21. That seems complicated. Hmm, but looking at the grammar, actually, some non-terminals are assigned to terminals. For example, NT5 \u2192 't2', NT6 \u2192 't16', etc. So, some non-terminals correspond to a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, for example, NT37 can be either 't12' or 't19' or 't37'. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT10 NT10 (non-terminal)\n- NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT29 (non-terminal)\n- NT51 \u2192 't90' (terminal)\n\nWait, that's interesting. So NT51 is a non-terminal that eventually becomes 't90'. Similarly, NT31 \u2192 't91', NT15 \u2192 't24', etc.\n\nWait, but let me check: each production either has two non-terminals, making it a non-terminal, or a terminal. So, for example, NT51 \u2192 't90' is a terminal production, meaning that NT51 can be replaced by the terminal 't90'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT27 \u2192 NT10 NT10, which are non-terminals. So NT27 expands into two NT10's.\n\nLooking further, NT10 can be NT36 NT20 (both non-terminals) or NT50 NT30 (NT50 is a non-terminal). NT50 is \u2192 't50', but according to the grammar, NT50\u2192 NT41 NT43. Wait, no: in the grammar above, I see:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43\n\nYes, NT50 is a non-terminal that expands into NT41 and NT43.\n\nWait, so it's getting more complicated. Each step depends on the productions.\n\nNow, looking back at the given string: the first part is 't12 t99 t87 t38 t36 t38 t90...'.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n1. 't12' must come from some non-terminal production. From the grammar, NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48. So to get 't12', both NT21 and NT48 must expand into something that results in 't12'. But looking at NT21, it's NT10 NT10. NT10 can expand into NT36 NT20 or NT50 NT30. NT50 is \u2192 NT41 NT43, which are also non-terminals. So this might not lead to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should look for non-terminals that can produce a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't16'\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't69'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't24'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't55' and 't18'\n\nWait, hold on, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for where a non-terminal X \u2192 a where a is a single terminal.\n\nFor example, NT15 \u2192 't24'\u2014so NT15 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by the terminal 't24'. Similarly, NT24 \u2192 't55' or 't18' or other non-terminals. So, in the grammar, NT24 can be a terminal if it has a production that ends with a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, each production for a non-terminal can be to two non-terminals, or to two terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-883","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, but the string is pretty long and filled with 't' followed by numbers, which I guess are terminals. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. In the given grammar, most rules seem to be of the form NTxy \u2192 NTa NTb, where NTxy, NTa, NTb are non-terminals. However, I see some rules where a terminal is on the right side, like NT5 -> 't2', which makes sense because in CNF, non-terminals can produce terminals directly.\n\nThe provided string is: `t54 t6 t90 t36 t91 t33 t11 t12 t6 t41 t48 t6 t6 t11 t7 t83 t6 t11 t7 t12 t12 t13 t13 t31 t13 t54 t91 t16 t24 t55 t6 t90 t36 t33 t33 t39 t55 t6 t18 t63 t91 t90 t4 t87 t33 t33 t39`\n\nI notice that all parts are lowercase, but in the grammar, non-terminals are uppercase with numbers, like S, NT50, etc. Each non-terminal expands into a sequence of non-terminals, and eventually, they must expand into terminals to produce our string.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the derivation starts from the start symbol S, which is NT15 and NT43. So, to get the string, the derivation must expand S into NT15 and NT43, which then each expand into other non-terminals, continuing until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are 't54', but in the grammar, the only rule with 't54' is NT19 -> 't54'. So, the earliest a terminal can appear is when a non-terminal that goes to 't54' is derived.\n\nBut wait, checking the grammar, NT19 appears in several production rules: NT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38 and NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. Also, there's NT19 as the target of NT45 \u2192 NT19 NT19.\n\nSo, the initial step in the grammar is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Both NT15 and NT43 must derive into the corresponding terminals.\n\nLooking at NT15 in the grammar: NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. Wait, that's a recursive production. So, NT15 can only expand into more non-terminals, which means it's going to produce an infinite sequence unless it eventually expands into a terminal. But in the grammar, the only rule for NT15 is NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15. There's no rule where NT15 directly goes to a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because without NT15 going to a terminal, it will keep producing more non-terminals infinitely, which means the string will never end.\n\nBut the provided string has a finite length, so if our starting non-terminal NT15 never produces a terminal, how can the string be generated? That suggests that either NT15 must produce something that ends with a terminal, but according to the given grammar, it doesn't. So, perhaps this string cannot be generated because NT15 would lead to an infinitely long derivation unless it terminates, but it doesn't have such a production.\n\nAlternatively, checking other possibilities: maybe the grammar allows termination through other paths. Let me see.\n\nAre there any other production rules for NT37? Yes, NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19. And NT19 \u2192 't54' or other non-terminals. Wait, but for the string to end, eventually, NT15 and NT43 must produce terminals.\n\nBut if NT15 can't produce a terminal, because its only production leads to more non-terminals, and there's no path to a terminal from NT15, then S \u2192 NT15 NT43 would lead to an infinite sequence in the derivation, which means the string can't be finite. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nAnother way to check is to look for the first occurrence of a terminal in the derivation. The first symbol in the string is 't54', which comes from NT19. So, to get 't54', the derivation at that point must be NT19 \u2192 't54'. But NT19's first production is NT12 NT38, which isn't a terminal. Alternatively, NT19 also has NT51 NT19, which would require NT19 to be expanded further, leading to more non-terminals. There's no production for NT19 that directly produces a terminal except when it's recursive, which might not terminate.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I notice that NT19 has another production: NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19. Then NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20. So, starting from NT19, perhaps there's a way to break this cycle. For example, NT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19 \u2192 NT50 NT20 NT19. Then NT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43. Wait, but NT41: NT41 \u2192 't24' and NT43 \u2192 't16'. So, let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see that NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT20. Let's trace:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15.\n\nBut NT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 again. So, NT15 keeps producing NT37 and itself. Now, NT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19.\n\nSo, NT15's expansion is NT37 NT15, which itself becomes NT19 NT19 NT15, which recursively goes on. This leads to NT15 expanding into an infinite loop unless it somehow terminates, but according to the rules, NT15 doesn't have a production that goes to a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-880","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which directly produces NT15 NT43, according to the production S -> NT15 NT43. So the first step is to split the string into two parts: the left part (from NT15) and the right part (from NT43).\n\nLooking at the string: 't31 t90 t31 t12 t13 t16 t38 t63 t12 t31 t38 t13 t13 t91 t16 t31 t31 t67 t87 t18 t6 t48 t6 t54 t12 t12 t16 t90 t4 t87 t54 t12 t11 t7 t83 t11 t7 t83 t48 t6 t67 t91 t83 t6 t6 t16 t24'.\n\nI'll split this into two parts. The first part should be generated by NT15, and the second part by NT43. Let me split the string at the first non-terminal, which would be after NT15's part. Wait, but looking at the grammar, S produces NT15 and NT43. So the entire string must be a concatenation of two substrings, each generated by NT15 and NT43 respectively.\n\nSo, the first part is everything up to the first NT43 production, and the second part is everything after. But wait, the productions of NT15 and NT43 are further broken down.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Hmm, that's an interesting one. So to produce NT15, you need NT37 followed by NT15. Wait, that's a recursive rule because NT15 depends on itself. So this seems like it's producing a string that starts with NT37 and keeps adding more NT15 until it terminates. But wait, how does it terminate? Because in CNF, each production is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So let's see.\n\nLooking at the rest of the grammar, for example, NT37 has rules like NT37 -> NT19 NT19 or NT37 -> NT17 NT45. Then NT19 has NT19 -> NT51 NT19, which is another recursive rule leading to more NT51 and NT19. Similarly, NT17 has NT17 -> NT2 NT30, and so on. It seems like NT15 is part of a chain that eventually terminates.\n\nWait, but in the case of NT15, the production is NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which suggests that once you produce NT37, you have to produce another NT15. But this can't produce a terminal string unless there's a rule that allows NT15 to terminate. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nLet me look more closely. The NT15 production: NT15 -> NT37 NT15. That would mean you produce NT37 followed by NT15. But since NT15 itself requires another NT37 and another NT15, this seems like an infinite loop unless somewhere down the line, NT15 has a way to terminate. But looking through the grammar, do any of the non-terminals derive to a terminal?\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT0 -> NT30 NT20, and then NT30 can produce other non-terminals, but eventually, some of them produce terminals like 't33', 't84', etc. Wait, so it seems like some non-terminals do produce terminals.\n\nLet me check NT15. Its production is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So, to produce NT15, you need to have NT37 followed by NT15. But then NT15 again needs to be broken down, leading to an infinite chain of NT37 and NT15. That's a problem because it would never terminate. So unless there's a way for NT15 to terminate, it can't produce a terminal string.\n\nWait, but in the string given, the first part starts with 't31'. Let me check the production rules to see how 't31' is derived.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT31 has a production: NT31 -> t91. So NT31 produces 't91'. Also, looking at NT23 -> NT7 NT10. But in the first part of the string, after 't31', we have 't90 t31 t12', etc. Hmm, perhaps I need to trace the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial NT15 can be rewritten by substituting NT37 until it reaches a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT37 has several rules, like NT37 -> NT19 NT19, which leads to more NT19. NT19 can produce NT51 NT19 and so on. It might eventually reach a point where it can produce a terminal, but given that NT15 leads to NT37, which leads to NT19, which eventually leads to a rule that produces a terminal.\n\nWait, let's see: NT19 -> NT51 NT19. So each time you have NT19, you produce NT51 followed by NT19. Then, NT51 -> NT50 NT20. NT50 has NT50 -> NT41 NT43. And NT41 produces 't24', which is a terminal. So perhaps the chain can terminate when a terminal is produced.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't31 t90 t31 t12 t13 t16 t38 t63 t12 t31 t38 t13 t13 t91 t16 t31 t31 t67 t87 t18 t6 t48 t6 t54 t12 t12 t16 t90 t4 t87 t54 t12 t11 t7 t83 t11 t7 t83 t48 t6 t67 t91 t83 t6 t6 t16 t24'\n\nSplitting the string into two parts using S -> NT15 NT43, so the first part is up to NT43, but since NT43 produces something, we need to see if the entire string can be split as A followed by B, where A is derived from NT15 and B is derived from NT43.\n\nLet me check the NT43 production:\n\nNT43 -> NT6 NT1, according to NT43 -> NT6 NT1 from the grammar.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the grammar again. Yes, looking at the productions, NT43 has rules like NT43 -> NT6 NT1, and also NT43 -> NT27 NT0, which produces 't31' and other terminals.\n\nWait, but given that the string starts with 't31', perhaps the B part starts with 't31', which would correspond to NT9 -> NT52 NT4, and NT52 -> 't44', but wait, let me check the NT52 rules: NT52 -> 't44' and NT52 -> 't6'. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, under NT52, there are two production rules: NT52 -> 't44' and NT52 -> 't6'. But in the string, after 't31' comes 't90', perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should parse the string into tokens and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step produces two symbols: either two terminals, a terminal and a non-terminal, or two non-terminals. So during parsing, we can use a recursive descent approach, applying the productions to match the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string can be seen as a sequence of tokens. Let me list them in order:\n\nt31, t90, t31, t12, t13, t16, t38, t63, t12, t31, t38, t13, t13, t91, t16, t31, t31, t67, t87, t18, t6, t48, t6, t54, t12, t12, t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Because some of the non-terminals are connected to others, which in turn produce t's.\n\nFor instance, NT15 -> NT37 NT15. But wait, NT37 produces NT19 NT19, which goes down to t12, t13, etc. Similarly, other non-terminals are structured with other non-terminals leading down to the t symbols.\n\nI think the approach here is to model this as a tree where each non-terminal is expanded into a combination of non-terminals, which eventually lead to the t symbols.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to build a parse tree step by step based on the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t33. So we need to find a production that starts with t33. Wait, looking through the grammar, are any non-terminals directly producing t33? For example, looking at the individual rules, I don't see any production where NTx -> t33 directly. Instead, many non-terminals produce combinations of t symbols via multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in reverse: the string ends with 't63'. Looking through the grammar, NT23 -> NT2 NT50. NT48 -> NT44 NT21, which leads to t6 and t12, etc. So maybe each t is a result of a certain production chain.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model this using a stack-based approach, but since it's CNF, maybe we can try expanding each part step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is such that each non-terminal eventually leads to a specific t symbol, and the string must be a combination of these.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the t symbols are generated by specific non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT44 -> 't6'\n- NT42 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't39'\n- NT28 -> 't67'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT9 -> 't28'\n- NT24 -> 't18' and 't55' (from multiple rules)\n- Wait, but looking at the given grammar, some non-terminals have production with 't' symbols.

Wait, but if t33 is not listed as a direct product of any non-terminal, perhaps the string has 't33' and 't67' which are not present.\n\nWait, that can't be, because in the grammar, some non-terminals are connected and might eventually produce t's. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT33: Wait, no. Wait, perhaps in the grammar, the only terminals are those directly listed. Wait, looking at the non-terminals, they seem to produce combinations leading to various t's.\n\nWait a moment, looking at the grammar's terminal rules: they all end with 't' followed by some number. So 't2', 't5', 't7', etc. So for instance, NT44 -> 't6', NT42 -> 't5', NT28 -> 't67', etc.\n\nBut in the string, I see t33, which is not directly produced by any non-terminal, because checking the rules, no NT directly expands to 't33', 't67' is from NT28.

{"custom_id":"request-901","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem to solve. I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see a bunch of non-terminals (NT followed by numbers) and some terminals (t followed by numbers). The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t13 t12 t33 t67 t67 t2 t83 t12 t12 t67 t7 t83 t6 t99 t12 t38 t13 t31 t13 t6 t11 t33 t67 t91 t83 t87 t6 t67 t11 t7 t83 t83 t72 t33 t67 t91 t83 t87 t6 t16 t38 t38 t38 t31 t13 t54 t12 t13`.\n\nMy approach should involve checking if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step will expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals, which eventually will lead to terminals. So the string length should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of steps, but since the grammar can have different paths, it might vary. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string from the bottom up or top down.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to consider the reverse: starting from S and see if we can apply productions to reach the given string. However, given the complexity, maybe it's easier to parse the string into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me think about how the string is built. Each production either splits into two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the string should consist of a series of terminals where each non-terminal in the derivation splits into two, which themselves may split or be terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a long sequence of t's followed by numbers. I'll need to break it down into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of the grammar, the start symbol S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S splits into NT15 and NT43. Each of these can split further:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15\nNT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n\nLooking at NT43, it becomes NT6 and NT1. NT6 \u2192 NT2 and NT6. Wait, no, NT6's production is NT17 and NT6. Hmm, maybe I should list all the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nBut this could get too complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm for parsing, but since the grammar isn't provided in a standard form, it might take a lot of time.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is just a single string, maybe we can parse it manually.\n\nLet me try to start by looking for possible splits. The string starts with t13, which is a terminal. So perhaps it's generated by some non-terminal that eventually produces t13.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT13 \u2192 NT69 NT21. Wait, no NT13 production. Let me check the given productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I find NT21 \u2192 NT38 NT31. No NT13 productions? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT13 -> NT69 NT21\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user listed:\n\nNT21 -> NT38 NT31\nNT13 -> NT69 NT21\n\nWait, I'm looking at the productions, and I see:\n\nLooking for NT13, I don't see it in the list. Wait, let me scan through all the productions to find NT13.\n\nWait, the user provided the productions, and looking through them, I don't see any NT13. Hmm, that's strange. Did I miss it?\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT13 -> NT69 NT21\n\nWait, no, actually, in the list:\n\nNT13 is present here: NT13 -> NT69 NT21. So yes, NT13 exists. But in the given string, we have t13. So if a NT13 production leads to t13, that's probably how it's generated.\n\nWait, but looking at the productions, NT13 \u2192 NT69 NT21. Both NT69 and NT21 are non-terminals. So t13 must come from a non-terminal that produces t13, but in our grammar, NT13 produces two non-terminals. So how do we get t13? Maybe via NT13 leading to other non-terminals that eventually produce t13.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to approach it differently. Let's look for the entire string and see if it can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the string should start with the expansion of NT15 followed by NT43.\n\nLet me write down the string:\n\nt13 t12 t33 t67 t67 t2 t83 t12 t12 t67 t7 t83 t6 t99 t12 t38 t13 t31 t13 t6 t11 t33 t67 t91 t83 t87 t6 t67 t11 t7 t83 t83 t72 t33 t67 t91 t83 t87 t6 t16 t38 t38 r38 t31 t13 t54 t12 t13.\n\nThat's a long string. Let's see if it can be divided into two parts, each generated by NT15 and NT43.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to look for patterns or units that correspond to known terminals.\n\nLet me look at the string step by step. The first part is t13. Since NT13 is a non-terminal, it must expand into two non-terminals, which could eventually become t13. Alternatively, perhaps there's a non-terminal that directly produces t13, but in the given grammar, I don't see any production that directly converts a non-terminal into t13. All productions for non-terminals result in either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, let's check if there's a terminal t13 directly in the grammar. Looking through the productions, I don't see t13 as a direct production. Instead, all t's are preceded by 't', so it's t1, t2, t3, etc.\n\nSo t13 must come from a non-terminal. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t13.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT13 \u2192 NT69 NT21. Both NT69 and NT21 are non-terminals, so t13 can't appear directly from NT13 unless those non-terminals eventually produce t13.\n\nBut do NT69 or NT21 produce t13? Let's check NT69 and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT69, from the productions:\n\nNT69 isn't listed, so perhaps it's undefined or I might have misread the productions. Let me scan through all the productions again to see if there's a NT69.\n\nWait, I think I missed some. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking through the full list:\n\nNT100+ are present, but NT69 is not explicitly listed. Hmm, perhaps I missed it. Wait, let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, I see NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', NT9 \u2192 't28', etc. Wait, no NT69. So NT69 might not be a defined non-terminal. That could complicate things because if NT13 \u2192 NT69 NT21, and NT69 is undefined, then NT13 can't produce anything. But that can't be, as the grammar must be well-formed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the productions. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT15 -> NT37 NT15\n- NT43 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT21 -> NT38 NT31\n- NT13 -> NT69 NT21\n\nWait, yes, NT13 \u2192 NT69 NT21. But I don't see NT69 in the production list, which could mean that it's possibly NT37. Did I misread the productions?\n\nWait, the user includes a long list of productions. Let me see if NT69 is present elsewhere. Looking through the list, I don't see NT69. Hmm, perhaps this indicates that the grammar isn't complete, or maybe NT69 is a typo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-916","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is pretty long and consists of a sequence of tokens ending with 't' followed by numbers, like 't54', 't6', etc. The grammar has a lot of non-terminals that seem to produce these tokens, often with rules that break down into two parts each time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Since it's in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Looking at the top-level rule, S -> NT15 NT43, which means the start symbol S can only produce two parts. So, any string generated by S should be a combination of these two parts.\n\nThe first step is to break down the string into chunks according to the grammar. The string is: t54 t6 t13 t33 t67 t12 t6 t16 t90 t31 t31 t13 t33 t12 t12 t54 t13 t87 t33 t83 t72 t33 t67 t2 t83 t88 t36 t90 t54 t54 t91 t83 t6 t13 t6 t18 t16 t38 t36 t12 t13 t13 t54 t54 t28 t6 t90 t63 t91.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake. The user provided a different grammar, where S -> NT15 nt15? Or maybe I should check again. Oh no, the first rule is S -> NT15 NT43. So each application of the top rule adds two parts. \n\nI think the approach is to parse the string by recursively applying the grammar rules, starting from S. Since it's in CNF, each step involves splitting the current string into two parts, each generated from the left or right hand side of a production.\n\nMaybe I should try to find the leftmost derivation. Alternatively, since it's a context-free grammar, I can use a recursive descent approach, checking if each substring can be derived according to the rules.\n\nBut let's think step by step. Let's start by looking for the starting symbol S. The top rule is S -> NT15 NT43. So the first two symbols of the string should match NT15 and NT43.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t54. But NT15 is a non-terminal that eventually resolves to t54, right? Let me check the rules. NT15 -> NT37 NT15. Hmm, that's recursive. Also, NT15 can eventually go to 't37' or 't33' in some paths. Wait, maybe I should look for how NT15 is resolved.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a tree or at least track how the non-terminals resolve to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is structured in such a way that it's generated by repeatedly applying the rules. Each non-terminal in the string corresponds to a production that either leads directly to a terminal or splits into two productions.\n\nLet me pick a section of the string and see if it follows any rule. For example, starting with t54, which I think comes from NT15. But NT15 produces NT37 NT15. So 't54' could potentially result from NT15, but how?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which suggests it's a recursive production. So to get a terminal, we need to have a production that eventually terminates, like NT15 -> t54. But looking through the rules, I don't see a direct arrow from NT15 to a terminal. NT50 is a non-terminal that eventually goes to 't44' but it's a different path.\n\nWait, maybe I should check each non-terminal and see what they expand into. Let's go step by step:\n\n- NT15 produces NT37 NT15. So NT15 can only expand into a pair of symbols, one of which is another NT (NT37) and the other is the same NT15 again. So in the string, any occurrence of NT15 must come from this rule. So when we see t54, it's from NT15, which in turn is NT37 NT15. So perhaps t54 is produced by NT37, but that's not directly clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be decomposed according to the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach is to count the number of non-terminals and terminals. Since it's in CNF, each rule produces exactly two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So the string should be a series of splits that correspond to these rules.\n\nBut the string is long, and it's a mix of terminals and non-terminals, so it's hard to see. Maybe the string can be viewed as a binary tree, where each part splits into two until we get to the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the longest possible match from the left. Starting with S -> NT15 NT43. So the string starts with NT15, which is t54.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify: in the grammar, NT15 is a non-terminal, but in the string, it's represented as 't54', which is a terminal. So in the grammar rules, NT15 must produce a terminal symbol, but looking at the rules, that's not the case. NT15 has a rule NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which means it can't directly produce a terminal. So unless there's a path that eventually produces a terminal, NT15 can't be part of the input string.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If NT15 is a non-terminal that can't produce a terminal, then the grammar wouldn't produce a string starting with t54 because NT15 can't directly produce a terminal. But in the string, the first token is t54, so perhaps there's a mistake. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar's structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the letters after each 't' are numbers, like 't54' is the same as 't54', but maybe the actual terminals are where the 't' is followed by a single digit. Wait, maybe I misread the string. Let me look again.\n\nNo, the string is written as \"t54 t6 t13 t33 t67 t12 t6 t16 t90 t31 t31 t13 t33 t12 t12 t54 t13 t87 t33 t83 t72 t33 t67 t2 t83 t88 t36 t90 t54 t54 t91 t83 t6 t13 t6 t18 t16 t38 t36 t12 t13 t13 t54 t54 t28 t6 t90 t63 t91\".\n\nSo each token is separated by a space, and they all start with 't', followed by a number. So 't54' is a single token, not 't' followed by '5', '4'. So in that case, 't54' is a single terminal symbol, 'T54' perhaps.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, terminals end with 't' and a number, like 't54', 't6', etc., so each of these is a distinct terminal. So the string is a sequence of these terminals. So the grammar consists of S, and various non-terminals NTx. Each non-terminal leads to either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nBut looking at the top rule, S -> NT15 NT43. So for S to produce a string, it must first split into NT15 and NT43. Each of these can then further split until all are terminals.\n\nBut as I noticed earlier, NT15 has the rule NT15 -> NT37 NT15, which suggests that NT15 can only split into two non-terminals, one of which is another NT (NT37) and the other is NT15 again. So NT15 itself can't produce a terminal; it can only produce more non-terminals. Unless there's a path where it eventually reaches a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Looking through the rules, there might be a rule that eventually resolves NT15 to a terminal. Let's check all the rules for NT15. The only rule for NT15 is NT15 -> NT37 NT15. So it's an infinite loop, meaning NT15 can never produce a terminal. Therefore, the grammar as given doesn't produce any string starting with t54 because NT15 can't produce a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is t54. That's a problem because according to the rules, S starts with NT15, and if NT15 can't produce a terminal, then the entire string can't be generated.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The grammar starts with S -> NT15 NT43, which means the start symbol S is replaced by the concatenation of NT15 and NT43. Each of these non-terminals (like NT15, NT43) can produce other non-terminals or terminal symbols, as defined in the rules.\n\nNow, looking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of terminals (`t12`, `t55`, etc.) and I need to see if it can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, and B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nI'll start by checking if the string can be broken down according to these rules. The string starts with `t12`, which is a terminal. I need to see which non-terminal can produce `t12`. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT21 -> t12, but that's under the rule NT28 -> NT26 NT23 or something else?\n\nWait, let's check the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nSearching for rules that produce `t12` directly or indirectly:\n\n- Looking through the rules, I notice that NT21 -> t12. So if I have NT21, it can produce `t12`. So the first `t12` could be generated by NT21.\n\nBut NT21 itself must be produced by some rule. Looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT21 -> NT10 NT10 (from rule NT21: NT21 nt10 nt10)\n- Also, from the rule set, other non-terminals lead to NT21. For example, NT41 -> NT28 NT32 (no, that's not NT21). Wait, let me list all NT21 rules.\n\nHmm, actually, looking through the grammar, NT21 is only defined as NT28 NT23.

Then, looking further, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me look through the rules again:\n\nWait, looking through all the NT rules, I don't see a direct rule for NT21 except for one that says NT28 -> NT26 NT23, which is just NT28.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken and NT21 is not present as a non-terminal with a rule. Wait, no; looking again, I think I missed that NT21 has a production.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nAh! I see this rule: NT28 -> NT26 NT23\n\nWait, that's a non-terminal NT28, not NT21.\n\nWait, perhaps I should search for NT21 elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the approach.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, maybe it's better to see if there's a way to parse it using the grammar, step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the rules. Let's try to parse the string step by step, looking for possible leftmost derivations.\n\nThe string is:\n\n`t12 t11 t2 t83 t83 t72 t33 t67 t12 t54 t54 t54 t12 t12 t12 t91 t83 t12 t33 t11 t11 t2 t83 t55 t6 t11 t12 t99 t16 t31 t63 t83 t72 t33 t12 t13 t13 t33 t67 t12 t91 t38 t36 t13 t91 t83 t6 t16 t37`\n\nWait, that's a long string. Each 't' is a terminal, and each terminal corresponds to a specific production.\n\nI think the approach would be to parse the string by identifying the possible non-terminals that can generate these terminals and breaking the string into parts accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to approach by building the parse tree step by step. The string needs to be split into components that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me try to start with the first symbol, `t12`.\n\nFrom the grammar rules, I see that NT21 -> t12. So the first part could be NT21. Now, I need to split the string into the production for NT21.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, are there any rules where NT21 is on the left side? It seems I don't see any rules for NT21 except perhaps one I'm missing.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT21 is not in any production as a non-terminal. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me look again at the rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> NT26 NT23\n- NT48 -> NT44 NT21\n- NT29 -> NT28 NT48\n- NT28 -> NT0 NT13\n- NT10 -> NT36 NT20\n- NT47 -> NT27 NT6\n- NT19 -> NT51 NT19\n- NT52 -> NT6 NT25\n- NT27 -> NT8 NT17\n- NT17 -> NT2 NT30\n- NT49 -> NT47 NT27\n- NT24 -> NT4 NT44\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT26\n- NT2 -> NT41 NT32\n- NT7 -> NT35 NT35\n- NT28 -> NT26 NT23\n- NT48 -> NT44 NT21\n- NT0 -> NT52 NT8\n- NT1 -> NT51 NT38\n- NT28 -> NT20 NT1\n- NT41 -> NT7 NT31\n- NT28 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT43 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT34\n- NT47 -> NT25 NT16\n- NT34 -> NT28 NT5\n- NT29 -> NT28 NT48\n- NT24 -> NT2 NT48\n- NT18 -> NT42 NT48 (Not present)\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if any non-terminal can produce `t12`. From the rules:\n\nLooking for NT... -> t12:\n\nI see that NT21 -> t12. So if I have NT21, it can produce `t12`.\n\nSo the first `t12` could be represented by NT21.\n\nNow, I need to see how NT21 is formed. But looking at the rules, where can NT21 appear as a non-terminal on the left side?\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't immediately see a rule where NT21 is on the left. It seems that NT21 is only on the right side of some productions, as part of the right-hand side of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps NT21 is not a primary non-terminal in the grammar, but I must be missing something.\n\nWait, let's check the rules again.\n\nAh! Here's a rule: NT12 -> NT21 NT48.

{"custom_id":"request-933","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers, like `t16 t90 t67 t6 ...` and so on. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of writing context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided starts with S \u2192 NT15 NT43, which seems to be a terminal symbol, so S is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Wait, no, S is usually the start symbol, and in CNF, the start symbol can be a non-terminal but here it looks like S is followed by two NTs, which are likely non-terminals.\n\nLet me parse the grammar step by step. The first rule is S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Since NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals, this production is allowed in CNF. Now, looking at the other rules, most of them are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz. For example, NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT32, NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT48, etc. However, some rules have the right-hand side as a mix of NTs and terminals. For example, NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT1 and NT1 \u2192 NT51 NT38. Wait, that's not necessarily a problem because some productions can mix NTs and terminals, as long as the NTs are on the left. \n\nLooking further, there are rules where the right-hand side has a 't' followed by a number. For instance, NT44 \u2192 't6', NT42 \u2192 't5', and so on. These are terminal productions, meaning they produce a single terminal symbol. So, in this grammar, many non-terminals can directly produce terminal strings of certain lengths.\n\nNow, the given string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like t16 t90 t67 t6 t90 t63 t91 ... and continues. Each 't' is followed by a number which I assume are the actual terminals, but in the grammar, usually, non-terminals produce sequences of terminals. So, the string's structure is a series of terminals, each possibly followed by another, but in this case, the given string is a long sequence without apparent grouping, which might suggest that each 't' is part of a separate production.\n\nThe first step is to check if all the terminal symbols in the string are produced by the grammar. For example, if a terminal like 't16' is present in any rule as a terminal, it's allowed. From the given grammar, I see that 't6' is a terminal in NT44, 't5' in NT42, and so on. So, if all 't's in the string correspond to such terminals, the grammar can produce the string.\n\nBut the string is quite long, so checking each symbol individually might be tedious. Instead, I should see if there's a way the string could be decomposed into the productions. Let me first list out all the terminals in the string and see if they are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string tokens: t16, t90, t67, t6, t90, t63, t91, t13, t33, t67, t13, t55, t6, t72, t67, t2, t83, t54, t13, t54, t55, m6, t67, t7, t12, t33, t88, t6, t6, t55, t90, t16, t90, t36, t90, t38, t36, t83, t83, t72, t33, t11, t7, t83, t87, t38, t54, t6, t33, t39.\n\nI notice that some numbers repeat, like t67, t90, t55, etc. However, to determine if this string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if each 't' is produced by the grammar's terminals. Let's check if all these terms are in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't16'? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, I see NT6 is undefined; actually, looking through the productions, I don't see any rule where NT6 produces a terminal. Only NT50, NT44, etc., produce terminals. So, 't6' is allowed, but 't16' isn't directly produced by any NT. Wait, looking again, in the grammar rules, I don't see any production for NT6 except perhaps NT6 is undefined. Wait, in the given grammar, some NT's have 't' as a terminal, like NT44 \u2192 't6', but not NT6. So, does NT6 exist? No, because in the given grammar, the rules start with S and NTs like NT15, NT1, NT2, etc. Wait, the grammar has production rules for many NTs, but I don't see NT6 as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check:\n\nThe rules:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any production where NT6 is on the left side. So, if the string contains 't16', then that's a problem because NT6 (which would produce 't16') doesn't exist. But I don't see NT16 in the grammar either. Wait, in the given grammar's productions, I don't see any rule where NT16 is the left side. Only 't16' is a terminal. Wait, but NT6 is not defined, so the grammar cannot produce 't16' because there's no rule that produces 't16'. So that would mean the string has 't16', which cannot be produced by this grammar, leading to the conclusion that the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but I might be mistaken. Let me check the productions again. Scanning through all the left-hand sides, I don't see any NT6. Therefore, if the string contains 't16', which corresponds to NT6 not being defined, that's an issue. But wait, wait, looking back: the grammar rules are all the left-hand sides after the initial S.

{"custom_id":"request-931","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down and see how I can approach it.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) for a CFG requires that all production rules be either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit that structure since all the rules either have two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. So that's good; the grammar is correctly in CNF.\n\nNext, the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t33 t11 t54 t83 t72 t16 t90 t4 t87 t90 t54 t54 t31 t38 t13 t54 t54 t12 t91 t83 t83 t11 t2 t16 t24 t55 t6 t31 t63 t33 t16 t33 t67 t54 t31 t13 t54 t31 t54 t12 t91 t83 t88 t6 t6 t11 t33 t11 t31 t13.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived by the given grammar. One way to approach this is to model the process of generating the string step-by-step, starting from the start symbol S and applying productions until we reach the string. However, since the string is quite long, doing this manually might be tedious. Instead, perhaps I can look for a pattern or specific sequences of terminals that correspond to the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the production rules to see if I can spot any patterns. For instance, some of the rules are A \u2192 a, which represent terminal symbols, while others like S \u2192 NT15 NT43 have two non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the start symbol S, it's defined as S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So the first step of any derivation must produce a string starting with whatever NT15 and NT43 produce. Since NT15 and NT43 are non-terminals, they need to be expanded into sequences of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT15's productions: NT15 can produce NT37 NT15 or t39. But wait, looking again, the rules for NT15 are:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\nNT15 ->t39\n\nBut wait, no, that might not be exactly correct. Let me check the provided rules again to make sure I don't mix them up.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. The production rules start with S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. So S is replaced by NT15 and NT43, two non-terminals. So each of these non-terminals will need to be expanded into sequences of terminals through their respective productions.\n\nSo, step 1: S \u2192 NT15 NT43. Then, each of NT15 and NT43 must be expanded into a terminal string. So their expansions would be concatenated.\n\nLooking at NT15, its productions include:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15 | t39 | ... Wait, actually, looking at the rule list, perhaps I should correct this.\n\nWait, the rules for NT15 are in the list. I'll scan through the provided rules to find NT15.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT15 -> NT37 NT15\n\nNT15 -> t39\n\nSo NT15 can either produce t39 (a terminal) or expand into NT37 and NT15. But since this is in CNF, each production must lead towards terminals. So for NT15, the only terminal it can directly produce is t39, because as a non-terminal, it can't produce other non-terminals unless they themselves can expand into terminals.\n\nWait, no. Looking again, the rule for NT15 is:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT37 NT15, and NT15 \u2192t39.\n\nBut NT37 is another non-terminal, so unless NT37 can produce a terminal, NT15's expansion can't be fixed as just t39. So let me check what NT37 can produce.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT37 has:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n\nAnd then NT19's rules:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT51 NT19\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT37 NT37\n\nWait, that's more complex. So NT37 can produce NT19 NT19, which then lead to further expansions. Let's consider NT19's production:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT12 NT38, or NT51 NT19, or NT37 NT37.\n\nBut NT12's rules: NT12 \u2192 NT21 NT48\n\nNT21 is another non-terminal, and NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT10.\n\nWait, so this could go on indefinitely unless there's a path to produce terminals. Alternatively, perhaps there's a loop that needs to be broken.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated. Instead of diving deep into each non-terminal, maybe it's better to check if the given string can be formed by any derivation steps.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t33, I should check which non-terminals produce t33.\n\nLooking through the production rules where non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nFor example, look for rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal. But in the given rules, looking through, perhaps the rules where non-terminals produce terminals directly are:\n\nLooking for rules like A \u2192 txxx:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t48\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT2 \u2192 t41\n- NT55 \u2192 t5\n- NT15 \u2192 t39\n- Other rules may produce terminals as in certain rules, like NT48 \u2192 t87, NT15 \u2192 t39, etc.\n\nWait, more accurately, looking through all the rules:\n\nLooking for rules that produce a single terminal:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT32 NT2\n- NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT23\n- NT2 \u2192 NT41 NT32 | other rules, so when it's a production like A \u2192 B C, unless B and C produce terminals, which they need to do.\n\nWait, perhaps the direct terminal productions are:\n\nLooking through each rule, the right-hand side is a terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nSo for example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t28\nNT37 \u2192 t12\nNT45 \u2192 t11\nWait, I can go through each rule line by line to find where a non-terminal directly produces a single terminal.\n\nWait, let's list each rule and see if the RHS is a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT15 NT43\n\nOther rule lines (I'll list them quickly):\n\nLooking at each, the rules vary.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT41 NT43 (two non-terminals)\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT35 NT35 (two non-terminals)\n\nBut looking for any rule where a non-terminal is directly expanded into a single terminal.\n\nLooking at:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t6\n- NT42 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t39\n- NT28 \u2192 t6\n- NT29 \u2192 t63\n- NT24 \u2192t55\n- NT9 \u2192 t28\n- NT48 \u2192t87\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT4 \u2192 t48\n- NT29 \u2192t63\n- NT50 \u2192t33\n- NT12 \u2192t16\n- NT51 \u2192t90\n- NT48 \u2192t87\n- NT1 \u2192t24\n- NT34 \u2192t87\n- NT36 \u2192t84\n- NT21 \u2192t99\n- NT45 \u2192t11\n- NT19 \u2192t13\n- NT37 \u2192t12\n- NT6 \u2192t16\n- NT17 \u2192t33\n- NT19 \u2192t54\n- NT37 \u2192t54\n- NT37 \u2192t12 (again)\n- And others.\n\nWait, let's find all rules where a non-terminal is directly producing a terminal (i.e., A \u2192 txxx):\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t6\n- NT42 \u2192t5\n- NT13 \u2192t39\n- NT28 \u2192t6\n- NT29 \u2192t63\n- NT24 \u2192t55\n- NT9 \u2192t28\n- NT48 \u2192t87\n- NT5 \u2192t2\n- NT4 \u2192t48\n- NT50 \u2192t33\n- NT12 \u2192t16\n- NT51 \u2192t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
