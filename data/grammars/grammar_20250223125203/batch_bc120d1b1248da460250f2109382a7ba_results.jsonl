{"custom_id":"request-8","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t21\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I should probably look at the grammar provided and understand how it works.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The start symbol is S. The first rule is S -> NT82 NT22, which means I need to expand NT82 and NT22 to get the final string. \n\nLooking at the second rule, S -> NT40 NT77, so if the string starts with either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77, that's a possibility. Now, let's see what each of these symbols expands to.\n\nNT82 can be expanded into NT48 NT74. Let me write that down: NT82 \u2192 NT48 NT74. Next, NT74 can be broken down into NT58 NT98. So, NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98. Now, NT58 is a terminal, so it stays as 't17'. NT98, however, can be either 't5' or 't34' based on the rules. \n\nSo from S \u2192 NT82 NT22, expanding NT82 gives me NT48 NT74, which then breaks down to NT48 NT58 (which is 't17') and NT98. But wait, the string we're testing is \"t21\". From this path, NT58 is 't17' and NT98 is either 't5' or 't34'. Neither of those is 't21', so this path doesn't lead to \"t21\". \n\nLet me check other possibilities. Let's see if there's another rule that could produce 't21'. Looking through the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 NT15 NT71. And NT71 can be 't36' or 't5'. Then, NT15 is 't49'. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, I see that NT48 can be broken down further. Let me try another approach. Maybe there's a production rule that directly relates to 't21'. Looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands into 't21'. So, perhaps the other way is better.\n\nLet me try expanding S \u2192 NT40 NT77. NT40 can be NT97 NT0, which are terminals? Wait, NT40 is 't28'? Or is it that NT40 expands into 't28' via another rule? Wait, actually, looking at the rules, NT40 can be 't28' or have other expansions. Wait, no\u2014the rules I see include NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 and NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71. But in the list, there's NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 and NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71. Additionally, I see NT40 can be NT39 (but that's not in the initial list). Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the rules provided are as follows:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\nNT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\nNT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\nNT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\nNT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\nNT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\nNT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\nNT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\nNT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\nNT12 \u2192 't31'\nNT22 \u2192 't23'\nNT15 \u2192 't49'\nNT97 \u2192 't48'\nNT98 \u2192 't5'\nNT18 \u2192 't33'\nNT3 \u2192 't5'\nNT0 \u2192 't6'\nNT82 \u2192 't29'\nNT71 \u2192 't36'\nNT71 \u2192 't5'\nNT98 \u2192 't34'\nNT22 \u2192 't12'\nNT36 \u2192 't35'\nNT48 \u2192 't15'\nNT68 \u2192 't5'\nNT35 \u2192 't29'\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\nNT94 \u2192 't0'\nNT72 \u2192 't8'\nNT40 \u2192 't28'\nNT9 \u2192 't40'\nNT18 \u2192 't9'\nNT91 \u2192 't38'\nNT95 \u2192 't10'\nNT77 \u2192 't15'\nNT40 \u2192 't39'\nNT82 \u2192 't34'\nNT48 \u2192 't21'\nNT74 \u2192 't17'\nNT58 \u2192 't17'\n\nAlright, so looking at this, the NT48 can expand into 't21' via NT48 \u2192 't21'. So if I can reach NT48 and have it expand without another expansion, then I can get 't21'. \n\nSo looking back at the S rule S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So if I expand that, NT40 can be 't28' via NT40 \u2192 't28' or other paths. Let me check: NT40 can be NT97 NT0, which both are terminals ('t28' and 't6') or NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71, which again can expand further. Alternatively, NT40 can be 't28' directly from NT40 \u2192 't28'. So S \u2192 NT40 NT77 would become 't28' followed by whatever NT77 is.\n\nWhat about NT77? From the rules, NT77 \u2192 NT40 NT98? Wait, let me check. Wait, the rules don't have NT77 appearing as a left-hand side except NT77 itself. Wait, actually, looking back, the rules provided include NT77 \u2192? Wait, no, looking carefully, the initial rules are:\n\nThe grammar is S -> NT82 NT22, S->NT40 NT77. Then, the other rules are all NT-> things. Wait, no, they don't have NT77 on the left except in the initial S. So from NT77, is it a non-terminal? Wait, but in the given rules, I don't see any production for NT77 beyond S. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Wait, the given rules are:\n\nThey list S -> NT82 NT22, S->NT40 NT77.\n\nThen the other rules start with NT36, NT22, etc.\n\nSo NT77 is part of the initial S rule but doesn't have its own production. So NT77 cannot be further expanded, meaning in this grammar, NT77 is a terminal. But that's a bit unusual because usually only non-terminals have rules. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check each line.\n\nWait, for example, the second line: S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Then lines like NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77. So from NT36, you can expand into NT18 and NT77. But if NT77 doesn't have a production, then it must be a terminal. So in this case, in the S rules, S can expand into NT40 NT77, where NT40 can be 't28' and NT77 is a terminal as well. So then S \u2192 't28' followed by ... but wait, NT77 can't expand further because it's not defined as a non-terminal with a production. So that's a problem. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT77 can only be a terminal. So S \u2192 NT40 NT77 would produce something like 't28' (from NT40 being 't28') followed by whatever NT77 is, but if NT77 is a terminal, then the second symbol is a terminal, not a non-terminal that can expand.\n\nWait, but let me check if I misread. The initial rules only have S's rules; all the other lines start with NT, which are non-terminals except for the ones that end up being terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for how each NT is defined. For instance, NT36 breaks down into NT18 and NT77. But if NT77 needs to be defined to expand, but in the list of rules, NT77 only appears once in S, but not as a left-hand side of another rule. That must mean that NT77 is a terminal because it doesn't have any production. Alternatively, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, the rules are listed as:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\nNT36"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar has a start symbol S which can produce two alternative expressions: S -> NT82 NT22 or S -> NT40 NT77. So any string generated by this grammar must be a combination of these two possibilities.\n\nLooking at the string \"t36\", I notice that it's a single token. In the grammar, I see that NT36 is a non-terminal that can produce other non-terminals or terminals. Specifically, NT36 -> NT18 NT77. Wait, but in the given string, it's just \"t36\", which is a terminal. So does NT36 produce \"t36\"?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT36 -> NT18 NT77. But I also see another rule: NT18 -> 't33', and NT36 isn't directly leading to a terminal \"t36\". Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the initial rules, S can produce NT40 NT77. Then, NT77 isn't defined in the provided rules, except that it's used in S->NT40 NT77. Oh, but in the rules, I see that NT77 is not further expanded\u2014it's just part of the production. Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT77 isn't rewritten further. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- S -> NT40 NT77 (so NT77 is part of S, but it's not defined further)\n- NT40 -> 't40'? Wait no, actually, in the provided rules, NT40 is not written; instead, NT40 is part of S->NT40 NT77, but I don't see a rule for NT40 beyond that. Wait, looking again, no, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT40 has several productions like NT40 -> NT97 NT0, NT40 -> NT15 NT71, NT48 -> NT36 NT3, etc. But in the initial S->, NT40 is used. But since NT40 isn't defined beyond being in the string, I think that might be a mistake. Oh, wait, wait: in the initial S-> rules, NT40 is part of the production, but if NT40 is a non-terminal but hasn't been defined, then that production is incomplete. That might be a problem. Or maybe it's a typo, and I should check if NT40 is defined elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking again at the rules:\n\nWait, in the list, under NT40, I see:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nWait, but the initial production is S -> NT40 NT77, which isn't present in the rules. So that suggests that NT40 is present in S, but in this specific production, it's combined with NT77. But if NT40 is not further defined as a separate non-terminal elsewhere, then S->NT40 NT77 would be an incomplete production.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted.

But in the given rules, NT40 is defined as several productions, but not as a terminal. Therefore, S->NT40 NT77 would require NT40 and NT77 to be terminals, which they aren't. That suggests that the initial production for S might be ill-formed, but perhaps that's a mistake, or maybe the NT40 and NT77 in the S production actually refer to terminals instead of non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S->NT40 NT77 is intended to produce \"t40 t77\", but since NT77 isn't rewritten, it might just be treated as a terminal \"t77\", but that's unclear.\n\nWait, but looking at the initial problem, the string is \"t36\". So I need to see if \"t36\" can be derived.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\nNT36 has production NT18 NT77.\n\nWhat's the production for NT18? It's 't33'. So NT36 -> 't33' NT77.

Looking through the rules, does any rule produce 't36'?\n\nLooking at the terminal productions, 't36' isn't directly produced by any rule. For example:\n\n- NT71 -> 't36' (line 1385: NT71 -> 't36')\n\nWait, no, in the given rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't36' as a terminal. The only production that produces 't36' is NT71 -> 't36'. So how is 't36' a terminal?\n\nSo to get 't36', we'd need to have a production that directly uses NT71, which is defined as producing 't36'.\n\nLet me see where NT71 is used. The only rule for NT71 is line 1385: NT71 -> 't36' and line 710: NT71 -> 't5'.\n\nSo NT71 can produce either 't36' or 't5'.\n\nSo perhaps the string is built by using the production NT71 -> 't36'. So why can we get 't36'?\n\nLooking back, let's trace the possible derivation for \"t36\".\n\nSince \"t36\" is just a single terminal, we need to find a production where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that can generate it in one step. But looking at the given rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't36' except NT71 via NT71 -> 't36'.\n\nTherefore, to get 't36', we need to see if any sequence of productions can derive it from the start symbol S.\n\nLet's explore the possible path:\n\nOption 1: Start with S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nBut NT22 has production NT71. Since NT71 can produce 't36' or 't5'. Wait, no, S -> NT82 NT22 would result in something like [something][something], so for the string 't36' to be generated, the entire string would have to be a concatenation of two terminals from NT82 and NT22, which would require both to produce terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at NT82: it's a terminal 't29' (from NT82 -> 't29') or via"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-16","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string `t9 t39` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I'll recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) consists of production rules that expand non-terminal symbols into sequences of terminal and non-terminal symbols. The Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and each production from S has two non-terminals. The string we're checking is `t9 t39`, which comprises two terminals. So, I need to see if these two terminals can be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. I'll consider each possibility.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Now, I need to see if NT82 can produce `t9` and NT22 can produce `t39`. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT82's productions are:\n- NT82 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- NT82 \u2192 NT29 NT0\n- NT82 \u2192 NT82 NT22 (useless, as it's a recursive production)\n- NT82 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n\nLet me see if any of these can lead to `t9`. The terminal symbols in NT82's productions are `t29`, `t0`, and from NT48 and NT36. From NT48, let's see where that goes.\n\nNT48 can be:\n- NT36 NT3\n- NT40 NT71\n- NT68 NT97\n- NT94 NT95\n- NT68 NT97 again\nWait, specific rules for NT48 are given as:\nNT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3, NT40 NT71, NT68 NT97, NT94 NT95. \n\nSo, NT48's terminals are `t36`, `t3`, `t40` (which is NT40, etc.), but we need to look for `t9`. From NT40, the rule is NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0. So NT40 leads to NT97 and NT0. NT97 is `t8`, and NT0 is `t6`. But also, looking at other rules, like NT18 \u2192 `t33`, but not helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe I should backtrack. Let's focus on the string `t9 t39`. So, we need two terminals, so the derivation must be two steps from S.\n\nWait, hold on. The start symbol S produces two non-terminals, so the string must be the concatenation of the derivations of these two non-terminals. Each non-terminal in the S production must be expanded to a string of terminals.\n\nSo, for S \u2192 NT82 NT22, the string would be the concatenation of NT82's expansion and NT22's expansion. We need both of them to produce a terminal string.\n\nSimilarly, for S \u2192 NT40 NT77, the string would be NT40's expansion followed by NT77's expansion.\n\nSo, let's analyze both options.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nNT82's possible expansions:\n1. NT48 NT35\n2. NT29 NT0\n3. NT82 NT22 (useless)\n4. NT36 NT3\n\nWe need NT82 to produce `t9` and NT22 to produce `t39`.

Let's see:\n\nIf NT36 \u2192 NT48 NT3, and NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3, this can go on. It's possible, but I'm not sure if it can terminate with t9.\n\nAlternatively, NT36 can go via NT18 NT77. NT18 is in the rules: NT18 \u2192 NT91 NT94. Let's see:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT91 NT94.\n\nNT91: from the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT38. So NT91 is just 't38'.\n\nNT94 can be:\n- NT9 NT12\n- NT98 NT5\n- NT72 NT95\n- NT40 NT39\n\nLooking for `t9`. NT9 is 't40', so not helpful. NT40 is another non-terminal. Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, in NT94, possible rules include NT40 NT39. So NT94 can produce NT40 't28' (since NT40 \u2192 t28) and NT39. But in our string, we need `t9 t39`. Hmm, perhaps NT94 can produce `t9` through another route?\n\nWait, NT94's rules are:\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT94 \u2192 NT98 NT5\n- NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\n- NT94 \u2192 NT40 NT39\n\nSo, can any of these lead to `t9`?\n\nLooking at NT9, it's 't40'.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form means. It's a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, all the rules seem to fit this structure\u2014each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So that's good, but it doesn't directly tell me if the string is in the language, just that the grammar is in CNF.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is `t49 t36`. Since it's two tokens, I assume each token is a terminal symbol. In CNF, the start symbol S must derive the entire string, so I need to see if starting with S, I can apply production rules to get `t49 t36` at the end.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, its productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo from S, I can only go to either NT82 and NT22 or NT40 and NT77. I'll have to check both possibilities.\n\nLet's start with the first production: S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Now, I need to see if NT82 can produce `t49` and NT22 can produce `t36`.\n\nLooking at NT82's productions, I see that NT82 \u2192 't29'. Wait, no, NT82 has a production to 't29' from earlier (NT82 \u2192 't29'), but let me check the rules again.\n\nChecking the NT82 productions:\n- NT82 \u2192 't29' (from line NT82 -> 't29')\nSo, NT82 can only produce 't29'. But in the string we're looking for, the first token is 't49', so NT82 needs to produce 't49'. But from the grammar, NT82 can't produce 't49' because all rules for NT82 lead to terminals or non-terminals that eventually produce terminals, but none of them seem to directly produce 't49'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the NT40 rules because 't40' is mentioned in the string.\n\nWait, the string is 't49 t36'. Let me first check if NT49 and NT36 have production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see non-terminals like NT49? Wait, no, the NT40 rules have 't40' as terminal. Wait, let me check the entire grammar again.\n\nWait, the non-terminals are NT3, NT12, NT15, and so on. I don't see a rule for NT49. Let me check each line:\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, etc.\n- NT22 has multiple rules, some to 't36'\n- NT94 has multiple rules, some to 't9'\n- NT72 \u2192 't8'\n- NT77 is a terminal for some rules, like NT77 \u2192 't15'\n- NT48 \u2192 't15'\n- NT68 \u2192 't5'\n- NT35 \u2192 't29'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10', 't6', 't10'\n- NT94 \u2192 't0', 't9? Wait, lines like NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12 and others.\nWait, the NT97 rule goes to 't48' etc.\n\nWait, I'm looking for 't49' and 't36' in the terminals. Do any production rules lead directly to 't49'? Looking at the given rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't49'. The non-terminals are:\n\nLooking at NT49: Wait, in the provided grammar, I only see NTs like NT3, NT12, NT15, etc. Not NT49. So if the string is 't49', that must mean a production rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't49', but I don't see any in the given rules. So, since 't49' is a terminal and there's no rule that allows a non-terminal to produce 't49', then the production NT49 would not exist. Therefore, 't49' cannot be part of any derivation starting from S because there's no way to produce 't49' via the given rules.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let's check all the terminals:\n\nLooking at the entire grammar, the terminals are things like 't1', 't2', up to 't58' but I'm specifically looking for 't49' and 't36'.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I don't see any non-terminal NT that directly produces 't49'. Let me scan the production rules for any that end with 't49' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT58 \u2192 NT58 NT98 (Wait, no, 't58' is a terminal? Wait, in the rules, NT58 \u2192 't58'? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see NT58 \u2192 't17'? No, wait, let me look.\n\nNo, I'm looking through all the lines.

So NT15 produces 't49' directly. So if a derivation can lead to NT15, then NT15 can produce 't49'. So that's a possibility. Now, does the string have 't49'? Yes, the second token is 't36', and the first is 't49' in the string. Wait, no, the string is 't49 t36', so it's 't49' followed by 't36'. So we need to have a production that gives 't49' followed by 't36'.\n\nBut looking back, the start symbols S can only produce certain options. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the first S production: S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\nIf NT82 \u2192 't29', then that's the first token, which is 't29', but we need 't49'.

{"custom_id":"request-43","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string `t34 t40 t48` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Each production seems to be splitting non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals. But I notice that the grammar has some inconsistencies. For example, there are multiple rules like NT71 \u2192 t36 and then another NT71 \u2192 t5. That\u2019s a bit confusing because a grammar should have unique left-hand sides per production if they are in Chomsky Normal Form. So I need to check if that's correct or if it's a mistake. But assuming the grammar is as given, I'll proceed.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is `t34 t40 t48`. Since it's a sequence of three tokens separated by spaces, I can think of this as three consecutive production steps if the string is derived from the start symbol S. Let's break it down token by token.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and looking at the production rules, S can produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the first step is to choose which production to apply. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then, we need to see if NT82 can produce t34 and NT22 can produce t40, and then the next production for NT22 can lead to t48. Wait, no, because NT82 and NT22 are non-terminals, so each would generate their own strings. Let me think again. The entire string is a result of two non-terminals generated from S. So S needs to produce a string where the first part generates t34 and t40, and the second part generates t48? Wait, no. Because each of the two symbols after S is a non-terminal, so each of those needs to be expanded into the required terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Each step in the expansion of the string will split into more non-terminals, and so on until terminals are reached. Since the string has three symbols, it might result from a leftmost derivation with two productions splitting into two non-terminals, and each of those splitting further. Let me structure it.\n\nThe initial string is three terminals: t34 t40 t48.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So a string of three terminals could be generated by starting with S, which splits into two non-terminals whose expansions then split further. So, maybe the string is obtained by having S produce two non-terminals, each producing one terminal, but that would only make two terminals. Wait, that can't be, because the string is three terminals. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal expands into sequences that can lead to multiple terminals. Alternatively, considering that the grammar's rule is in CNF, each production is only splitting into two symbols, so each time you have a non-terminal, it splits into two, so the length of the string would double each time. But that's not correct because in each step, a non-terminal can expand into more than one symbol, but only one step at a time. So for a string of length n, the depth would be log n. But in this case, the string is of length 3, which is not a power of 2, so that might not be applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to see the possible productions.\n\nThe string is `t34 t40 t48`. So, we start from S. Let me see which of S's productions can lead to this string.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then, NT82 needs to produce t34, and NT22 needs to produce t40 and t48. But NT22 can only produce two symbols, so it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps I need to have more productions. Let's try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps each step of the expansion from S would produce a string that's a combination of two non-terminals, each of which can be expanded into the required terminals. But the given string is three terminals, so maybe S \u2192 NT82 NT22, and NT82 \u2192 t34, and NT22 \u2192 t40 t48. But wait, NT22 can't produce two terminals because in CNF, each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So NT22 must produce exactly two symbols, which can't both be terminals unless the production is a terminal. But in CNF, a production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Oh, right, a production can produce a single terminal. So if NT22 is a terminal, that would mean a production for NT22 is t22, but perhaps in this case, NT22 is being used as a non-terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, we have S \u2192 NT22, which is a non-terminal. So the initial step would produce two non-terminals, and each would need to produce their own strings.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me map out the possible paths.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\nNow, I need to have NT82 generate t34 and NT22 generate t40 t48, but wait, no, because each of these is a non-terminal, so their expansions would produce parts of the string. So, S expands into NT82 NT22, which are two non-terminals, each of which needs to produce one terminal each. But that would only give two terminals. But we have three, so this approach doesn't seem to work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the productions from NT22 can generate more than two symbols. But wait, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each non-terminal can only expand into two symbols, which can be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, a non-terminal A \u2192 B C generates two symbols, which are B and C. If B is a terminal, then A \u2192 t BC would be a production where A generates t and B, but according to CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols. So maybe the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the parser should generate the string as a sequence of productions, each expanding a non-terminal step by step until all symbols are terminals. Let me try to see if `t34 t40 t48` can be derived by such a process.\n\nStarting with S, the first production must be S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nNow, we have to expand NT82 and NT22 until all non-terminals are resolved into terminals.\n\nBut I need to see how NT82 and NT22 can produce their respective parts.\n\nFirst, NT82. Looking at the grammar, the production for NT82 is in multiple places. Let's list all the productions where NT82 appears on the left:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- NT71 \u2192 t36\n- NT71 \u2192 t5\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT82 \u2192 t29\n- NT18 \u2192 t33\nWait, actually, in the original grammar, the production for NT82 is only where? Hmm, no, in the given rules, I only see S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35, and NT82 \u2192 t29, and NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98, etc. Wait, looking back, I think I need to correct that.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29\nNT71 \u2192 t36\nNT71 \u2192 t5\nNT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\nNT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\nNT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\nNT82 \u2192 t29 (again)\n\nWait, so NT82 has two productions: once to t29, and then from NT72 it can produce NT82 NT35, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I need to list all NT82's productions.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- NT98 \u2192 t5 (same as before)\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT82 \u2192 t29\n\nSo, NT82 can directly produce t29, or it can be part of a larger production like NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35.

Looking through the production rules, I notice NT40 \u2192 t39. So `t39` can come from NT40.\n\nNow, checking the rules, NT40 has multiple productions. One is NT40 \u2192 t9, which isn't helpful. Another is NT40 \u2192 t40, which is 't40', but that's a terminal as well, but wait, no. Wait, the productions under NT40 are: NT40 \u2192 t39, NT40 \u2192 t15 NT71, etc. So `t39` is indeed derived from NT40.\n\nMoving to the middle part, `t10`. Looking for where `t10` comes from. I see NT0 \u2192 t10 and NT9 \u2192 t40. Wait, in the rules: NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95, and NT95 \u2192 t10. So `t10` can be directly from NT95, which comes from NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95, and NT95 \u2192 t10. But do these non-terminals lead back? \n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, `t10` appears in the string. So, possibly, it's derived from some non-terminal that eventually reaches t10. Looking at NT95 \u2192 t10, so NT95 can directly generate t10. So we need to see if NT95 is reachable from the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then each of these needs to derive into something that can eventually produce the tokens.\n\nLooking at NT82: in the rules, NT82 \u2192 t29 or other non-terminals? Wait, in the rules, NT82 \u2192 t29. So NT82 can directly produce `t29`, but in the string, the first part is `t21`, not `t29`. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps NT82 doesn't derive to `t21`.\n\nAlternatively, is there another way to get `t21`? Let me check. Going through all the rules, I see NT74 \u2192 t17, and NT48 \u2192 t21. So NT48 can produce `t21`.\n\nSo perhaps S \u2192 NT82 NT22 is one path, but I'm not sure if NT82 can produce `t21`, which is `t21`, so looking at NT48's production: NT48 \u2192 t21, which is what we need. So perhaps S \u2192 NT48 NTsomething? Wait, the start symbol S is only S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the string comes from S, so it would be two non-terminals, each expanding into sequences that produce the tokens.\n\nWait, the string is `t21 t10 t39`, so three tokens. Since each production in the grammar produces two non-terminals, the leftmost derivation would be for the entire string as a single string, but maybe it's more efficient to see if each part can be connected.\n\nWait, but each production is a binary split, so to get three tokens, we'd have to split into two parts that derive into sequences that add up to three tokens. Hmm, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire derivation starts with S, and we have to see if S can derive into three terminals, but that's unlikely because S only splits into two non-terminals at first. So the string would need to be split into two parts, each of which is a production, possibly with non-terminals further splitting.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation of S, but each part of S would generate a sequence of terminals. So if S \u2192 NT82 NT22, then NT82 and NT22 each generate a terminal, but in the string, there are three terminals. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT40 NT77, which would give two parts, each possibly generating two terminals each, leading to four, but the string has three. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is formed by three non-terminals each producing a terminal, but that's not possible because S only splits into two non-terminals. So maybe the string is a combination of the two non-terminals from S, each splitting into two more, leading to a total of four, but the string has three. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the non-terminals produces two terminals and the other produces one. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, each rule either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals. So for example:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\nLet's say NT82 can generate two terminals, so perhaps NT82 \u2192 NT48 NT3, but wait, no. Wait, NT82 is one non-terminal; it can produce a terminal or split into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, if NT82 \u2192 t29 (a terminal), and NT22 \u2192 something else.\n\nNT22 can split into NT71 NT48. Then NT71 \u2192 t36, NT48 \u2192 t21. So NT22 \u2192 t36 t21, which is two terminals. So then, NT82 \u2192 t29, NT22 \u2192 t36 t21. So the entire string would be t29 t36 t21, which is three tokens. But the string is t21 t10 t39. That's a different order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S splits into NT40 NT77. NT40 can split into t39, and NT77? Let's see NT77's rules: looking through the provided rules, I don't see NT77 splitting into anything except maybe another production? Wait, looking at the rules, under NT77, I see nothing except maybe a typo? Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT77: No production given, except maybe it's listed as one of the NTs with rules. Wait, the list of NTs includes NT77, NT40, etc. Wait, I think I might have missed some rules. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nS->NT82 NT22, S->NT40 NT77\n\nNT36->NT18 NT77\n\nNT22->NT71 NT48\n\nNT74->NT58 NT98\n\nNT72->NT82 NT35\n\nNT3->NT91 NT94\n\nNT12->NT48 NT74\n\nNT40->NT97 NT0\n\nNT94->NT9 NT12\n\nNT40->NT15 NT71\n\nNT48->NT36 NT3\n\nNT22->NT68 NT97\n\nNT94->NT72 NT95\n\nNT12->'t31'\n\nNT22->'t23'\n\nNT15->'t49'\n\nNT97->'t48'\n\nNT98->'t5'\n\nNT18->'t33'\n\nNT3->'t5'\n\nNT0->'t6'\n\nNT82->'t29'\n\nNT71->'t36'\n\nNT71->'t5'\n\nNT98->'t34'\n\nNT22->'t12'\n\nNT36->'t35'\n\nNT48->'t15'\n\nNT68->'t5'\n\nNT35->'t29'\n\nNT0->'t10'\n\nNT94->'t0'\n\nNT72->'t8'\n\nNT40->'t28'\n\nNT9->'t40'\n\nNT18->'t9'\n\nNT91->'t38'\n\nNT95->'t10'\n\nNT77->...?

{"custom_id":"request-51","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that can make parsing easier. The string to evaluate is `t17 t48 t31 t5`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. It starts with the start symbol S, which can produce two different sequences:\n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must come from one of these two starting paths. Let me break down the components.\n\nLooking at the productions, all the NTs are non-terminals except for the ones with the 't' which are terminals. The string I'm checking is made up of four terminals: t17, t48, t31, t5. \n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from either S production. Let's take the first production: S -> NT82 NT22. So, the string must start with NT82 and then NT22. But the string starts with t17, which is a terminal, not an NT. That doesn't match because NT82 should produce t17, but looking at the productions, NT82 is a non-terminal that produces 't8' as a terminal. Wait, no, let me check the productions again. Oh, wait, looking at NT82's productions, I don't see one that produces 't17'. The productions for NT82 are:\n\nNT82 -> 't29', which would be t29, not t17. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, the first production S -> NT82 NT22 would eventually generate two terminals, but since the string starts with t17, which isn't t29, that path is out.\n\nNow, let's look at the second production S -> NT40 NT77. So the string would start with NT40 producing t40, followed by NT77 producing 't15' (since NT77 -> 't15'). But again, the string starts with t17, which doesn't match t40 or t15. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, did I misread the productions? Let me check. Oh, wait, looking at NT74: it can produce NT58 NT17. Wait, is that the case? Let me see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT74 -> NT58 NT17\n\nYes, so NT74 can produce NT58 and NT17. So NT17 is part of the productions. Let me see which non-terminals produce t17 terminals. \n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT74 -> NT58 NT17\n\nWait, no, that's ND74. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the list, under NT74: \n\nNT74 -> NT58 NT17\n\nHmm, so NT74 can produce NT58 and NT17. So if any NT leads to NT74, then it can produce a t17 terminal.\n\nNow, looking back at the string: the first token is t17. So to get t17, we need a production that eventually leads to t17. That would be NT74 -> NT58 NT17.\n\nSo for the string to have t17 as the first symbol, the starting symbol S should derive to a path that includes NT74. But the S productions don't have NT74, only NT40 and NT82.\n\nWait, but let's check if any of the non-terminals S can reach NT74. Looking back at S's productions: \n\nS -> NT82 NT22: both NonTerminals, so the next step is to see what these produce.\n\nSimilarly, S -> NT40 NT77: production rules for NT40 and NT77.\n\nSo to have t17 in the string, S must go through a production that leads to NT74, but S doesn't have NT74. So perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to build the derivation step by step.\n\nGiven the string `t17 t48 t31 t5`.\n\nEach token in the string is a terminal, so each must be the result of a non-terminal production.\n\nSo the first terminal is t17, which comes from NT74 -> NT17, as per the production NT74 -> NT58 NT17. Wait, but in that case, the t17 is from NT74, which requires that the N-terminal NT74 is used.\n\nBut S doesn't produce NT74 directly. Let me check if any S production can lead to NT74. No, according to the productions, S produces either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So S can't directly produce NT40 and NT77 via NT74 because NT77 is directly producing 't15' or other things.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for a path where S's first production leads to NT82 NT22, and then each of those can produce other non-terminals leading to t17.\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nThen, NT82 can produce 't29', and NT22 can be divided in a few ways.\n\nLooking at NT22's productions: \n\nNT22 can produce:\n\n- NT71 NT48\n\n- 't12'\n\n- 't23'\n\nWait, so in NT22's production, one of the options is 't23', which is exactly the second token in the string: t48? Oh wait, wait, no, the second token is t48, not t23. Wait, but t48 could be from other NTs.\n\nWait, let me think again. The string is `t17 t48 t31 t5`. So to get t17 as the first symbol, the first non-terminal in the derivation must be one that produces t17 as a terminal. Let's see which non-terminals produce t17.\n\nFrom the production rules:\n\nLooking for NTs that directly produce 't17' as terminals:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT74 -> NT58 NT17: produces t17 when NT74 is used.\n\nAnother possibility: any other NT that can reach NT74?\n\nBut the string's first symbol is t17, so to get that, the first non-terminal must be NT74, which would be produced by an NT that can derive into NT74.\n\nWait, but none of the NTs directly produce NT74. Let me check the productions for all NTs.\n\nWait, looking at NTs:\n\nNT58 produces NT17 NT17 (e.g., NT58 -> NT17 NT17: so NT58 produces two t17s.)\n\nBut wait, the string only has one t17, but if NT58 produces two t17s, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT48: NT48 can produce 't15' and 't49' (wait, no, looking in the production rules:\n\nWait, my list of productions is:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't17' directly:\n\nFind all NTs where one of their productions is a terminal 't17'.\n\nFrom the productions, for each NT, look for their productions:\n\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77: doesn't produce t17.\n\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48: doesn't produce t17.\n\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT17: so this produces t17.\n\n- NT71 -> t36? No, NT71 -> t36? Wait, checking NT71:\n\nFrom the productions, NT71 -> t36 and NT71 -> t5, according to:\n\n\"NT71 -> t36\", \"NT71 -> t5\"\n\nSo NT71 can produce t36 or t5.\n\nAnother point: NT17 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal. So, the only way to get t17 is through NT74, which requires producing NT58 and NT17.\n\nWait, but if we have t17 as the first token, that comes from NT74, which must be derived from a higher-level NT that eventually produces NT74.\n\nBut S's productions are S->NT82 NT22 and S->NT40 NT77. There's no way S can directly produce NT74, nor can any of the NTs directly connected from S reach NT74.\n\nFor example:\n\nFrom S, choosing S->NT40 NT77: NT40 can produce t40 and NT58, and in that case, perhaps from NT40, we can go further, but let's see:\n\nLooking at NT40:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0: produces t0.\n\nWait, no, wait, the productions for NT40 are:\n\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\n- NT40 -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe given string to evaluate is `t6 t21 t17 t31`. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that in CNF, a string's derivation must correspond to a leftmost or rightmost parse, and the number of symbols in the string must equal twice the number of productions taken minus one. For a string of length n, the number of productions in the derivation must be n.\n\nThe string has four symbols, so the derivation should take exactly three steps (since 2^3 -1 =7, but wait, no, for n symbols, the number of productions is 2n-1. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Each step produces one terminal, so for four terminals, we need three productions. Wait, no, each split requires one production. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the number of steps in the leftmost derivation for a string of length m is m-1. Because each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until the leaves are terminals. So for the string 'a b c d', we need three splits. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing concepts. Maybe it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nLooking at the rules, the start symbol is S, which can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Let me check the production rules:\n\nThe first rule for S is S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\nThe second is S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSo the string must start with either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77. Wait, but wait\u2014the string given is four terminals: t6, t21, t17, t31. But S starts with NT, meaning non-terminals. So the initial steps must produce sequences of non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nLooking at NT rules, let me see if I can find how the non-terminals lead to these terminals.\n\nLet's look at each terminal in the string: t6, t21, t17, t31.\n\nLooking up the production rules:\n\nFirst, t6 is represented by NT0 \u2192 't6' (rule: NT0 -> 't6').\n\nBut in the start symbol's production, NT0 doesn't appear. The start is S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So in the first case, NT82 and NT22, each must derive to something that eventually leads to the terminals.\n\nLooking at NT82: Wait, in the rules, NT82 is a non-terminal? Wait no, wait. The production S \u2192 NT82 NT22\u2014wait, but in the initial rules, NT82 is not a non-terminal but seems to be a terminal because looking at the rules, NT82 is under NT22's production? Wait, no, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, actually, the initial set of rules is a list, each of the form A \u2192 aBc or A \u2192 B, etc. So NT82, NT22\u2014are all these non-terminals? Or are they terminals?\n\nWait no, wait: I'm looking at the first few rules:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\n\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\n\nAnd so on, and then some entries like NT12 -> 't31'\u2014so in this list, some non-terminals directly map to terminals. So for example, NT12 \u2192 't31'. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nSo in the grammar, the production rules are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. Since some of the non-terminals resolve to terminals directly.\n\nSo the idea is that, starting from S, we can expand S into NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst case: S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Now, we need to see if NT82 and NT22 can derive to the first two terminals of the string: t6 and t21.\n\nLooking at NT82: Since NT82 is not followed by any production rules (I don't see any line starting with NT82), perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at the first few rules:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n\nNT15 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT97 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT98 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT82 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT71 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, so actually, NT82 is a non-terminal because the first rule starts with it.

{"custom_id":"request-76","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t17 t48 t15 t12 t28` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all the production rules are in the form of A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except for the start symbol. Here, the start symbol is S. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol S. The grammar has two productions for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, the start symbol S must derive the given string through a series of these productions. Since the string starts with `t17`, I need to see if there's a way for the non-terminals to expand into `t17 t48 t15 t12 t28`.\n\nI recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, the process builds the string from the start symbol down, splitting each non-terminal into two others until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n1. Identify which production rules can lead to the terminals in the string.\n2. Check if the terminals appear in the left-hand side (LHS) of any production rule.\n3. Attempt to trace possible derivations from S to the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols:\n- NT77 is one of the options. The first production of S is S \u2192 NT82 NT22, but the second is S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So, if we take the second production, then each of NT40 and NT77 might break down further.\n\nWait, S is split into NT40 and NT77. So, first, S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to produce parts of the string.\n\nBut looking at NT40, the grammar has several productions:\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT94\n- NT18 \u2192 NT9 NT19... Wait, I don't see NT19 in the given data. Wait, looking back at the rules, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the initial user provided a grammar with several rules, some of which are:\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n\nSo, for S \u2192 NT40 NT77, let's see the possible derivation paths.\n\nLet me try a possible path:\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n- NT40 expands to, say, NT15 NT71 (one of its options)\n- NT77, the other part, perhaps has a production? Looking back, the grammar for NT77 isn't directly given. Wait, let me scan through all the rules to see if any rule starts with NT77.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT71 \u2192 t36 or t5\nWait, no. Actually, in the given rules, NT71 appears on both sides of productions:\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48 and NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97, and also NT71 has direct productions like NT71 \u2192 t36 and NT71 \u2192 t5.\n\nWait, let me check: the rules given include NT71 \u2192 t36 (from NT71 \u2192 t36) and NT71 \u2192 t5 (from NT71 \u2192 t5). So, NT71 can produce either 't36' or 't5'.\n\nSo, coming back, if I have S \u2192 NT40 NT77, I need to expand NT40 and NT77, and see if together they can produce the string.\n\nWait, but NT77 itself is a non-terminal. In the given rules, does NT77 have any productions? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules provided:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT77 \u2192 ...? Hmm, in the initial rules, I don't see NT77 on the left side, but on the right sides, I see NT77 appearing. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77. So, NT77 can't directly be the LHS of any production, except perhaps the ones that have it on the RHS.\n\nWait, but as a non-terminal, NT77 can be derived further, but does any rule have NT77 on the left? Looking through the rules:\n\nNo, I think NT77 does not appear on the left of any production rule. Therefore, NT77 is a terminal? But wait, in the given rules, if NT77 isn't a production, but appears in other productions, it must be a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, all non-terminals have production rules that either replace them into two non-terminals or into terminal symbols. Since NT77 does not have a production, it means it's a terminal. So if S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and NT77 is a terminal, then the first part is NT40 and the second is NT77.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first symbol is 't17'. So maybe I should consider whether NT40 and NT77 can produce this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other production for S is better. The first production is S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Let's see.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT82 NT22, then the string must be a combination of whatever NT82 produces and whatever NT22 produces.\n\nLooking now, NT82's production is:\n- NT82 \u2192 NT72 NT22 (from the given rules)\nWait, other NT82 productions? Let me check again:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 NT72 NT22\n- NT82 also appears in other production rules, like NT82 \u2192 NT48 NT21?\n\nWait, let me list all NT82 productions:\n\nLooking back at the rules, NT82 is on the LHS of two productions:\n1. NT82 \u2192 NT72 NT22\n2. NT82 \u2192 NT48 NT21\n\nAnd it also appears on the RHS of other rules, for example, NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the initial grammar has:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\n- NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\n- NT12 \u2192 't31'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- NT15 \u2192 't49'\n- NT97 \u2192 't48'\n- NT98 \u2192 't5'\n... and many others, including terminal productions.\n\nWait, but in the NT82 rule, the first production is NT82 \u2192 NT72 NT22. Then, in another rule, NT82 appears on the RHS, but that's part of another non-terminal's production.\n\nSo, for NT82, the possible ways to expand are:\n- NT82 \u2192 NT72 NT22\n- NT82 \u2192 NT48 NT21\n\nNow, if the string starts with 't17', let's see if NT82 can produce a 't17' or not.\n\nLooking at NT48's production, from the given rules:\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT48 \u2192 NT21 NT...\nWait, from the given rules, NT48 has:\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT48 \u2192 NT21 NT...

{"custom_id":"request-72","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to work through this problem. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string that I need to check if it's generated by the grammar. The string is `t15 t5 t0 t23 t36`.\n\nFirst, understanding Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The starting symbol is S. So I need to see if I can parse the string `t15 t5 t0 t23 t36` by following these production rules.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, the initial productions are:\n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must start with NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Since the string starts with t15, which is a terminal, I need to see how it can be derived.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, for example, NT40 has productions like NT97 -> t48, NT98 -> t5, NT18 -> t33, etc. But wait, the string starts with t15, so let's see where t15 comes from.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT40 has a production that includes t15. Specifically, NT40 -> t15 NT71? Wait, no. Let me check again. The rules are:\n\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- NT48 -> NT36 NT3\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n- NT58 -> NT58 NT98\n- NT72 -> NT82 NT35\n- NT35 -> NT29 NT0\n- NT29 ... etc.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread. Let me list the rules again:\n\nLooking through each rule, I see NT40 has production NT40 -> NT15 NT71 and NT40 -> NT97 NT0. So t40 can be either t15 followed by NT71 or t97 followed by t0.\n\nIn our string, we have t15 followed by t5, t0, etc. So maybe the first part is t15 NT71, which reduces to t15 something. But I think I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is `t15 t5 t0 t23 t36`. Let's list these as a sequence of terminals: t15, t5, t0, t23, t36.\n\nI need to parse these in order. Let's see if this can be generated starting from S.\n\nLooking at S's productions again:\n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo the first step would be to replace S with one of these, which are two non-terminals. So the first two symbols of the string must come from NT82 and NT22 or NT40 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT82, from the rules, I see NT82 -> t29 NT0. So t82 is generated by t29 followed by NT0. But the first symbol in the string is t15, which is not t29, so the first production must be S -> NT40 NT77 because t40 can lead to t15 or t97, and if the string starts with t15, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, let me check NT40's productions:\n\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nSo NT40 can produce t97 followed by NT0, or t15 followed by NT71. Since the string starts with t15, the second option makes sense. So the first production would be NT40 -> t15 NT71.\n\nSo the first two symbols are t15 and t5. Wait, but according to the string, the second symbol is t5. So let me see how NT71 can produce t5.\n\nLooking at NT71's productions: from the rules, I see NT71 -> t36 and also NT71 -> t5. Wait, is that correct? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through, I see NT71 has multiple productions:\n\n- NT71 -> t36\n- NT71 -> 't5' \u2014 I think that's a typo, since it's in the grammar. So in the grammar, perhaps NT71 is rewritten as `t36 NT0` or something? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules, under NT71, I see:\n\n- NT71 -> t36\n- NT71 -> t5\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the NT71 is a non-terminal, which must be expanded into two non-terminals. Let me check the rules carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the given grammar:\n\n- NT72 -> NT82 NT35\n- NT71 -> t36\n- NT71 -> t5\n\nNo, that's not correct. Wait, in the grammar, the rules for NT71 are:\n\n- NT71 -> t36\n- NT71 -> t5\n\nThat would imply that NT71 can produce t36 or t5, but those are terminals. Wait, but in Chomsky normal form, productions are either to two non-terminals or a single terminal. So if NT71 is a non-terminal, it can't directly produce a terminal; instead, it must produce a combination of terminals or non-terminals leading to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe some rules in the grammar are written as `NT71 -> t5`, which would mean that NT71 can produce t5 as a terminal. So in that case, when parsing, we can have t5.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for NT71, the productions are:\n\n- NT71 -> t36\n- NT71 -> t5\n\nSo that would mean NT71 can be t36 or t5.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT36, for example, among its productions is NT36 -> NT18 NT77.\n\nSo, given that, in the string, after t15, we have t5. Let's track this.\n\nFrom S, the first production is S-> NT40 NT77. So the first two symbols are NT40 and NT77. But in the string, it's t15 followed by t5. So maybe the first production is not S-> NT40 NT77.\n\nWait, perhaps the first production is S-> NT82 NT22, which would have t82 followed by t22, but the string starts with t15, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait no, the first production is S-> NT40 NT77 or S-> NT82 NT22. But in the string, the first symbol is t15, which is produced by NT40, so perhaps the first symbol is from NT40.\n\nBut let me re-examine the process.\n\nEach production in the grammar is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, to parse the string `t15 t5 t0 t23 t36`, we can try to see if it can be derived from S.\n\nStarting with S, which can be either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nIf we choose S-> NT40 NT77, then the first step would be replacing S with NT40 NT77. So the first two symbols must be from NT40 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string: the first two symbols are t15 and t5. So let's see if NT40 can produce t15.\n\nLooking at NT40's productions: NT40 -> NT97 NT0 or NT40 -> NT15 NT71. So to get t15 as the first symbol, the first production would be NT40 -> t15 NT71. But that would make the first part t15 NT71. But NT71 is a non-terminal, so we need to expand it further.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t15 comes t5. So if NT71 can produce t5, that would fit. So let's see if NT71 can produce t5. According to the rules, NT71 can produce t5 (NT71 -> t5). So that's possible.\n\nSo after S-> NT40 NT77, the next step would be to replace NT40 with t15 NT71, and NT77 with t5.\n\nSo now the string is becoming t15 (from NT40) followed by t5 (from NT77), but wait, no, NT77 is being produced by what production? Let me check the rules for NT77.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT77 as a non-terminal with a production; instead, it's a terminal? Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-93","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t23 t8 t28 t0 t29 t39` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by looking at the structure of the grammar and the production rules to see how the string can be derived.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar starts with S. The first rule is S -> NT82 NT22, and the second is S -> NT40 NT77. Since the string starts with t23, which comes from NT22, I think I should follow the path that starts with S -> NT82 NT22. \n\nLooking at NT22, the rules are:\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n- NT22 -> 't12'\nSo, from NT22, I can either keep going deeper or produce t12. Here, the string starts with t23, but t23 is from NT22, so that suggests that NT22 should produce t23. Wait, but in the grammar, NT22 has a production to 't12' which is a terminal. Where does t23 come from? Maybe I need to check the rules again.\n\nWait, no, looking again, there's a separate rule NT22 -> 't23' in the provided grammar. Yes, because sometimes I might have misread a rule. So NT22 can produce 't23' directly. So the first step is S -> NT82 NT22, where NT22 becomes t23.\n\nNow, the remaining part of the string after t23 is `t8 t28 t0 t29 t39`. So after T23 is generated, the next symbols should come from the other part of S, which is NT82. Let's see what NT82 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT82, it has:\n- NT82 -> 't29'\n- NT82 -> 't34'\nSo it can produce either t29 or t34. In the string, the next symbol after t23 is t8, but neither t29 nor t34 is t8, so that suggests I'm taking the wrong production. Maybe I need to take a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong. The string is `t23 t8 t28 t0 t29 t39`. So after t23, the next symbol is t8. But NT82 doesn't produce t8. So maybe I should look at another production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is in the order t23, t8, t28, t0, t29, t39. So, after S starts as NT82 NT22, after producing t23 from NT22, the NT82 part should then produce t8, t28, etc. But looking at NT82, it can only produce t29 or t34, which don't match t8. So perhaps I'm taking the wrong initial production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S should have been split differently. Let me consider the other possibility for S: S can also be NT40 NT77. So maybe instead of taking S -> NT82 NT22, I should take S -> NT40 NT77. Then, NT40 can produce certain symbols.\n\nLooking at NT40's productions:\n- NT40 -> 't12'\n- NT40 -> 't28'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\nSo if NT40 is in the first part, it can produce t12, t28, or t39. In the string, after t23, the next symbol is t8, which isn't among these. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try another approach. Let's see where the string can come from. The first symbol is t23, which comes from NT22. So S must split into NT82 NT22, because NT22 can produce t23. Then, the remaining part is NT82, which needs to produce the rest: t8, t28, t0, t29, t39.\n\nBut looking at NT82's productions, it can only directly produce t29 or t34, which are t29 and t34. The next symbol after t23 is t8, which is not produced by NT82. So that can't be part of the NT82 tree. Therefore, perhaps the initial split of S is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me consider that after NT22 produces t23, the other part is NT82, which needs to generate the rest of the string, which is t8, t28, t0, t29, t39. So NT82 must be able to produce t8, t28, etc. But looking at NT82's productions, it only produces t29 or t34, so this seems impossible.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the initial split of S into NT82 NT22 might not be the correct path. Let me check the other option for S, which is NT40 NT77.\n\nIf S splits into NT40 NT77, then NT40 can produce 't12' or other symbols. But the string starts with t23, so that path might not work. Alternatively, maybe the initial split is correct, and the issue is in the NT82 part.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a result of multiple splits. Let me try to see if the entire string can be formed by some leftmost derivation.\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT82 NT22. NT22 is t23. Then, NT82 needs to produce the rest of the string: t8, t28, t0, t29, t39.\n\nSo, after S, we have NT82 NT22 -> (NT82) t23. Then, NT82 needs to expand into the remaining string. So, let's see if the remaining part (t8 t28 t0 t29 t39) can come from NT82.\n\nLooking at NT82, possible productions are 't29' and 't34'. Neither of these is t8. So this seems impossible. Therefore, maybe the initial split is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me consider that each NT symbol can have more productions, and perhaps the string is built by multiple steps.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NT symbols have left-hand sides that involve T symbols, which are terminals. So perhaps the string breaks down as follows:\n\nStart with S -> NT82 NT22, but then perhaps each of these can split further.\n\nWait, let me map out each symbol in the string to a NT production. The string is t23, t8, t28, t0, t29, t39. Each of these comes from some NT symbol.\n\nt23 comes from NT22. Next, t8 comes from NT82? But NT82 doesn't have 't8' as a production. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure.\n\nWait, wait, looking again, the NT symbols are like NT36, NT22, etc. Each of these can have productions, including to 't' symbols.\n\nLet me list all the NT symbols and their possible productions:\n\nNT36: -> NT18 NT77, -> NT91 NT94\n\nNT22: -> NT71 NT48, -> NT68 NT97, -> 't12' (and another rule is NT22 -> 't23')... Wait, in the provided grammar, under NT22, are there two rules? Or is it one of the lines listing production rules?\n\nWait, the grammar as provided has lines like:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\n\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\n\nNT94 -> NT9 NT12\n\n...\n\nAlso, some NTs have a terminal directly:\n\nNT22 -> 't12'\n\nNT40 -> 't15'?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the lines after NT22 have multiple rules. Let me clearly list all the NT rules:\n\nFrom the grammar provided:\n\nNT36: -> NT18 NT77\n\nNT22: has two rules:\n-> NT71 NT48\n-> 't12'\n\nWait, no, looking again, the grammar is written as a list of productions. Each line either combines two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\n\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\n\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\n\nNT72 -> NT82 NT35\n\nNT3 -> NT91 NT94\n\nNT12 -> NT48 NT74\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nNT94 -> NT9 NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-94","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the string `t33 t0 t39 t34 t34 t8` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions where each rule's left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, or two terminals. The given grammar seems to fit that structure, so that's a good start.\n\nThe string to check is `t33 t0 t39 t34 t34 t8`. My initial thought is to work backwards from the start symbol, S, since it's the root of the derivation. The start symbol S has two productions: \n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo the string must start with one of these prefixes. Let's break down the string into its components: the string is a sequence of six tokens, each of which is a terminal symbol. So the entire string is six tokens long. \n\nLet me list them as positions 1 to 6:\n1. t33\n2. t0\n3. t39\n4. t34\n5. t34\n6. t8\n\nNow, I need to see if there's a derivation sequence that starts with S and ends at this string. Since the string has six tokens, I'll need to see if the derivation can split into the right parts.\n\nLet me consider the two main options starting from S:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT82 NT22. Then, I'll need to see what NT82 and NT22 can derive into. The string starts with t33, so let's see NT82.\n\nLooking at the production for NT82: NT82 -> 't29'. So NT82 can be a terminal (t29). But our string starts with t33, not t29. Therefore, this option is not matching.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I need to consider more steps. Because in CNF, each step splits into two symbols, so each terminal may result from a chain of productions. So maybe NT82 could split into a sequence that eventually results in t33.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for NT82 again. Actually, looking at the given grammar, NT82 only has one production: NT82 -> 't29'. So it can't go further; it's a single terminal. That means if S uses the first production, the first part would be t29, not t33. Since the string starts with t33, this path is impossible. So maybe Option 1 is not the right starting point.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT40 NT77. Let's see what NT40 and NT77 can produce. The string starts with t33, so let's check NT40.\n\nLooking at NT40, there are multiple productions, including NT40 -> 't39' and NT40 -> 't28', etc. So NT40 can produce t39, which is present at position 3 of the string. Hmm, but the first term is t33, so perhaps the first NT40 is producing t33? Let me check NT40's productions.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT40 has this production: NT40 -> 't39', and others. So yes, NT40 can directly produce 't39'. But in our string, the first token is t33, so maybe that's not the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Since the string starts with t33, let's look for productions that can derive t33. Looking through the grammar, NT3 has a production NT3 -> 't5'. Wait, no, I think the NT3 in the given grammar has other productions. Let me scan again.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT18 -> 't33'. So if NT18 can produce t33, perhaps that's a way in. So where does NT18 come from?\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can split into S -> NT82 NT22 or S -> NT40 NT77. If S -> NT9 -> NT... wait, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nI think the correct way is to parse the string step by step, starting from S, and see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nThe string is six tokens: positions 1 to 6: t33, t0, t39, t34, t34, t8.\n\nLet's try to build a parse tree.\n\nLet's see, starting with S, which can be either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Since the first token in the string is t33, and the first production of S can't generate t33 (because NT82 -> t29, which is different), so the remaining option is S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nSo we have S = NT40 NT77.\n\nNow, NT40 can produce 't39' directly, but our first token is t33, so that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe NT40 can produce something that leads to t33 later on. Wait, looking at NT40's productions:\n\nNT40:\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT40 -> 't28'\n- NT40 -> NT71 NT48\n\nHmm, none of these produce 't33', except NT18 does. So perhaps the path is more involved. Maybe NT40 can split into NT71 NT48, then NT71 and NT48 can further split.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the entire string is a series of productions leading to it. Let's think recursively.\n\nSince the entire string needs to be covered, let's see if each step can split correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see each token in the string as a part of a production tree.\n\nLet me consider each token in the string and see if they can be the result of the terminals in the productions from S.\n\nLet me map the string as t33, t0, t39, t34, t34, t8.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nSince the first token is t33, which is produced by NT18, not NT40 (which starts with t39 or t28), perhaps the second option can't be the starting point because the first symbol would need to be NT18, but S can't produce that directly.\n\nWait, wait. No, S can't produce NT18; S can only produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So if the first symbol is t33, which comes from NT18, but S is splitting into NT40 NT77, so perhaps S needs to derive into a structure that eventually produces NT18 somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think differently.\n\nEach node in the parse tree represents a non-terminal (NT), and each step in the parse tree corresponds to expanding a non-terminal into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nGiven that each production in the grammar is a non-terminal expanding into two symbols, either both non-terminals or a combination.\n\nSo, the overall process is a series of splits: each step, a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, which may themselves split further until the leaves are all terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is six terminals, we need exactly five splits to get from the initial S to nine symbols (but wait, that doesn't make sense with five splits. Wait, actually, each split adds one more symbol. So to go from 1 symbol (S) to 6, we need 5 splits, each split replacing one symbol with two. So 1 \u2192 2, then 2 \u2192 3, etc., up to 6.)\n\nSo let's model this as a derivation. Each step increases the number of symbols by one.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the entire string as a series of production splits.\n\nLet me attempt to build the derivation step by step.\n\nWe have S, and it can split into NT40 NT77.\n\nSo the string must be built as NT40 NT77 expanding into the tokens.\n\nBut NT40 can produce 't39', so perhaps that's the fifth symbol in the string? Wait, the string is t33 t0 t39 t34 t34 t8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a result of NT40 and NT77 expanding in a way that each produces a sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to trace each token:\n\n1. First token: t33. It's produced by some non-terminal, let's say X1.\n\n2. Second token: t0. Produced by X2.\n\n3. Third token: t39. Produced by X3.\n\n4.

The given string starts with `t10`, `t21`, etc., which are terminals, so I should trace back from these to see if they can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it's seven tokens long: `t10`, `t21`, `t9`, `t49`, `t38`, `t28`, `t38`. So the derivation path should have seven steps, but wait, let's think about the Chomsky normal form. Each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So starting from S, it's the start. The initial step is S, which produces something like NT NT. Let's see the two productions available for S:\n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo S can only go through these two paths.

Let me try to see which path leads to the required terminals.\n\nGiven S -> NT40 NT77, let's see:\n\nNT40 can expand to NT97 NT0, which could lead to some terminals, but looking at NT0 -> 't6' and NT97 -> 't48'. So maybe that's a possible path. Alternatively, NT40 can expand to 't28' directly. Wait, in the productions, looking at NT40:\n\nLine 4: NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nLine 5: NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nLine 6: NT40 -> NT48 NT3\n\nLine 7: NT40 -> NT71 NT48\n\nLine 8: NT40 -> NT58 NT98\n\nLine 9: NT40 -> NT (but I think it's not, since NT40 has multiple productions)\n\nWait, looking at the given NT40 productions:\n\nLine 4: NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nLine 5: NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nLine 6: NT40 -> NT48 NT3\n\nLine 7: NT40 -> NT71 NT48\n\nLine 8: NT40 -> NT58 NT98\n\nSo NT40 can become any of these. Now, looking at NT40 -> NT97 NT0.\n\nNT97 -> 't48', right? Because in line 14: NT97 -> 't48'.\n\nAnd NT0 -> 't6' (line 10: NT0 -> 't6')? Wait no, line 10 says NT0 -> 't6'? Wait line 10 says:\n\n- NT0 -> 't6' (yes, because in line 10: NT0 -> 't6'.)\n\nBut wait, that would make the production NT97 NT0 becoming 't48' 't6' = 't48 t6'. But in our string, after 't28' we have 't9', which isn't 't6'. So perhaps that's not the path.\n\nAlternatively, from NT40: let's look for a path that can produce 't28', which is the second token in the string.\n\nLooking at NT40 productions:\n\n- NT40 -> NT71 NT48 (line 7)\n- From NT48, let's see its productions:\n\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3 (line 11) or NT48 -> 't21' (line ...

{"custom_id":"request-113","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I'm evaluating is `t48 t15 t23 t39 t38 t10 t35`, and the grammar is a bunch of rules that define how symbols can be rewritten.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF is. From what I remember, in CNF, each production rule is either:\n\n1. A single terminal symbol.\n2. Two non-terminal symbols.\n\nThis means the right-hand side (RHS) of each production has at most two symbols, which makes parsing and analysis somewhat manageable. Also, there are no \u03b5 productions because every production leads to a terminal or a non-terminal, but in this case, the terminal symbols are just single-character tokens like t followed by a number, or numbers themselves.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S. The first two productions of S are:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nThese are two separate productions for S. From S, it branches into two NTs, each of which can be further broken down.\n\nNow, looking at the NTs:\n\nNT36, NT22, NT74, etc., each have their own productions. The NTs that end with -> [something] with an NT (like NT36 -> NT18 NT77) are internal, while those that have terminal symbols directly are the actual terminal symbols in the language. For example, NT12 -> 't31'.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminal symbols: t48, t15, t23, t39, t38, t10, t35.\n\nTo see if the grammar can generate this string, I'll need to try to find a derivation in the grammar that matches it. That means starting from S and applying productions step by step until I reach the string.\n\nSince this is a linear approach and the string has seven tokens, it's likely to involve several steps. Each production that adds a terminal is going to be crucial. But it might also form a tree that, when flattened, matches the string exactly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals reduce directly to a single terminal. For example, NT48 can produce t15. So in the string, t48 appears at the beginning, so perhaps it's derived from NT48.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT48 -> t15. So that's how we get t15 as a terminal.\n\nBut the first token in the string is t48. So how can we get t48?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any of the NTs directly producing t48. All the terminals listed are either single letters with numbers or other symbols. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar list:\n\nNT18 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't5'\nNT22 -> 't12' and 't23'\nNT36 -> 't35'\nNT48 -> 't15'\nNT72 -> 't8'\nNT40 -> 't28'\nNT9 -> 't40'\n\nWait, so NT48's production is directly 't15'. Similarly, NT22 can produce 't23'. So in the string, we have t23 as the third token. That suggests that NT22 might have been involved in the derivation.\n\nWait, the string is t48, t15, t23, t39, t38, t10, t35.\n\nSo t23 is the third symbol. Since NT22 can produce 't23', perhaps at some point, there was a NT22 that was expanded into 't23'. But since we're dealing with a flat string, each symbol comes from an NT, so the order matters.\n\nWait, S branches into NT82 and NT22. So perhaps the string starts with NT82 and NT22 expanding to their respective terminals, but in the given string, the first symbol is t48, which isn't from NT82. Because NT82's production in the grammar is not directly to t48; looking at the grammar:\nNT82 appears on the left side in S's productions, and on the right side of other NTs, like NT36 -> NT18 NT77, NT22 -> NT68 NT97, etc., and also for NT74 -> NT58 NT98.\n\nWait, looking more closely, NT82 is present in S's possible productions but does any NT directly go to t48? Checking the list, yes, NT48->t15, and NT40->t28, etc. But no NT is directly producing t48.\n\nWait, the first symbol in the string is t48. But none of the NTs produce t48 except maybe one I'm missing. Looking at the productions:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\n- NT82 -> 't29' (from earlier, because looking back, some lines say NT82->'t29', NT72->'t8', etc.\n\nWait, for S's productions:\n\nS->NT82 NT22 and S->NT40 NT77.\n\nSo, looking at NT82, in the grammar list, I see NT82 -> 't29'.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 can produce 't23' or other things.\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is t48. But none of the NTs directly produce t48 except if I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. Here's the part about NT48:\n\nLooking at all the NT rules:\n\nNT18 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't5'\nNT22 -> 't12' and 't23'\nNT36 -> 't35'\nNT48 -> 't15'\nNT72 -> 't8'\nNT40 -> 't28'\nNT9 -> 't40'\n\nWait, so NT48 can only produce 't15' directly. So how do we get t48 as the first symbol in the string?\n\nMaybe that's not possible. Then perhaps the string isn't in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Let me take a step back.\n\nThe string is t48 t15 t23 t39 t38 t10 t35.\n\nSo the initial token is t48. Since no NT directly produces t48, except perhaps a typo or misreading. Let me check again the grammar:\n\nLooking for an NT that produces 't48' directly. Scanning through all NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT48 -> t15\n- Others: NT36 -> t35\n- Wait, is there any NT that directly produces 't48'? Not that I can see. So that might be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is produced through multiple steps. So, for instance, some NTs might be expanded through other NTs, eventually leading to t48.\n\nWait, let me think about how the derivations would work. Let's see; S starts as NT82 NT22.\n\nSo S can derive as:\n\nNT82 (which can be 't29') and NT22 (which can be 't23') or other things.\n\nBut the first token is t48, which is from what NT? It's not from NT82 or NT22, so maybe that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps it's an S production branching differently. Let me look again: S can branch into NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77.\n\nWait, so S is either NT82NT22 or NT40NT77.\n\nIn our string, the first symbol is t48. So assuming the first step is S->NT82 NT22, then NT82 is 't29', and NT22 could be 't23', so t29 and t23. That doesn't match the string which starts with t48 t15...\n\nAlternatively, maybe S uses the other production: S->NT40 NT77. In that case, NT40 can produce 't28', and NT77 can produce... Hmm, looking for NT77's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT77: Not sure, let me check. The grammar list shows:\n\n- NT40 appears on the left side and produces 't28'?\n- NT77: Checking all rules, I see NT77 is produced by what? Or wait, looking for NT77 on the RHS.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT40 -> NT28 (I think that's a typo, let me look carefully. Maybe I misread NT40's productions).\n\nWait, let me list all NTs:\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT22 -> NT68 NT97\nNT94 -> NT9 NT12\nNT98 -> NT34\netc.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT rule for"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t10 t38 t10 t23 t49 t49 t23 t9`, and the grammar has several production rules. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar fits that structure, so that's a good start.\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of a sequence of terminals: t10, t38, t10, t23, t49, t49, t23, t9. My goal is to find a derivation starting from the start symbol S that produces this string exactly.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that the start symbol S (which is uppercase) can only produce certain combinations of non-terminals. The first two options are S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the expansion of S will start with NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.

For example, NT22 \u2192 't12' and also NT22 \u2192 't23' elsewhere. So each NT rule is uniquely defined. Okay.\n\nNow, our string is t10 t38 t10 t23 t49 t49 t23 t9. So the derivation needs to expand S into this sequence. Remembering that S is a non-terminal and in Chomsky Normal Form, each step is only expanding one non-terminal at a time, replacing it with two others (which might eventually produce terminals).\n\nLet's think about the possible expansions of S.\n\nFirst, S can expand into either:\n\n1. NT82 NT22\n2. NT40 NT77\n\nSo let's explore both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\nNow, NT82 and NT22 are non-terminals. Let's expand each:\n\n- NT82: Looking at the rules, NT82 \u2192 't29' or based on earlier rules. Wait, checking the provided list, I see NT82 \u2192 't29' on one line, and also NT82 seems to appear in other productions, perhaps in the NT22 \u2192 't22'?\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking back, the given grammar includes:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't29'\n\nYes, so NT82 can be replaced directly with 't29'. So in this case, S expanding into NT82 NT22 would produce 't29' followed by whatever NT22 expands to.\n\nSo NT22 can expand in several ways. Let me look at the rules for NT22:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- NT22 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, no, hold on. Looking again, I think I might have miscounted. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nThe grammar has lines like NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, NT22 \u2192 't23', and also NT22 \u2192 't12'. Wait, no, not 't12'; looking at the provided rules:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74 (so NT12 is another non-terminal)\n- And earlier, NT12 \u2192 't31'\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the grammar's production rules for NT22.\n\nWait, the provided rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- Another line says NT22 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, no. Let me check the list again carefully:\n\nThe lines given are:\n\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n- NT22 -> 't23'\n- NT15 -> 't49'\n- NT97 -> 't48'\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT18 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT82 -> 't29'\n- NT71 -> 't36'\n- NT71 -> 't5'\n- NT98 -> 't34'\n- NT22 -> 't12'\n\nWait, so NT22 has three production rules:\n\n1. NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n2. NT22 \u2192 't23'\n3. NT22 \u2192 't12'\n\nYes, that's correct. So in the expansion of S, if S \u2192 NT82 NT22, then NT22 can become 't23' or 't12' or NT71 NT48.\n\nIn the string we're trying to produce, after 't29' (from NT82), the next symbol is 't38', then 't10', etc.\n\nSo, looking at the string sequence: t10, t38, t10, t23, t49, t49, t23, t9.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't10'. Hmm.\n\nWait, if S expands to NT82 NT22, then NT82 \u2192 't29' immediately, so the first symbol in the string would have to be 't29'.\n\nBut the given string starts with 't10'. Therefore, Option1 (S \u2192 NT82 NT22) can't generate a string starting with 't10', because NT82 always expands to 't29'. So this path is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct path must be Option2: S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSo, S expands to NT40 NT77.\n\nNow, let's expand NT40 and NT77.\n\nFirst, NT40:\n\nLooking up the rules, NT40 has several production options:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT40 \u2192 't49'\n- NT94 \u2192 't40'?

Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the grammar has non-terminals on the left side of the arrows, and the right sides are combinations of non-terminals or terminals. Since each production is in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except that the start symbol can have two terminals as well. Wait, looking at the grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT82 NT22, which is two non-terminals, so I guess the initial productions can have two non-terminals, but the rules are such that each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string in question is \"t8 t15 t0 t17 t48 t12 t29 t38\". So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through some sequence of productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string length. There are 8 symbols separated by spaces. So the derivation should start with S and then split into two parts each time, leading to a binary tree with height log2(8)=3, but wait, 2^3=8 leaves, so maybe the depth is 3 splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar, perhaps using a top-down approach or something like that.\n\nBut let me first list what each non-terminal in the grammar resolves to. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77. But some of these non-terminals then produce terminals. For example, NT22 can produce 't12' and 't23' according to the grammar. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT22 productions:\n- NT22 can be split into NT71 and NT48, but also directly to 't12' and 't23'.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps it's better to make a mapping from non-terminals to their terminal and non-terminal options.

Let me start by understanding the structure and rules of the grammar.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several non-terminals that can produce either other non-terminals or terminal symbols. The terminals are strings like 't17', 't40', etc., and they represent the leaves of the derivation tree.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the given grammar has two production rules for S:\n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, the initial step is to see which of these two S productions can derive the string. Let's consider each possibility separately.\n\nStarting with the first production S -> NT82 NT22. We need to check if NT82 can derive the first 't17' and NT22 can derive the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at the NT82 production rules:\n\nNT82 -> t29\nSo, NT82 can only produce t29. But the first token in our string is t17, which doesn't match. Therefore, this production of S cannot be used to derive the given string because NT82 can't generate t17.\n\nNow, let's consider the second production S -> NT40 NT77. We'll need to see if NT40 can generate the first 't40' (since the second token is t40, which might come from NT40 or another NT).\n\nLet's expand NT40:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT40, there are multiple options:\n\n- NT40 -> t28\n- NT40 -> t28\nWait, actually, looking back, I see that NT40 has several productions. Let me list them correctly:\n\nNT40 -> t28\nNT40 -> t28 -> Wait, is that correct? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, I think I missed some NT40 productions. Let me go through all the NT40 rules:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> t28\nNT97 -> t48\nNT0 -> t6\n\nSo, to expand NT40, we can first choose to go through NT97 or the terminal t28.\n\nIf we take NT40 -> t28, then that's a direct expansion to t28, which matches the second token in our string 't40'? Wait no, the string is `t17 t40 ...` so the second token is 't40', but NT40 can produce t28. That doesn't match. So that path doesn't work. Alternatively, if we go through NT97, which is a non-terminal, we need to expand that further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me reorganize:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT40, the productions are:\n\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT40 -> t28\n\nSimilarly, for NT77, the productions are:\n\nLooking for NT77:\n\n- NT77 -> t15\n\nSo NT77 can only directly produce t15.\n\nWait, so the second production of S is NT40 NT77, which would produce t28 (from NT40) and t15 (from NT77). But the string starts with t17, so that's a conflict. So the second S production also doesn't seem to match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the NT40 and NT77 again.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I misread NT77's productions. Let me scan the grammar again.\n\nLooking at all the NT77 productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT77 -> t15\n\nThat's it. So NT77 can only produce t15. So, the S production S -> NT40 NT77 would produce t28 and t15, which doesn't match the string's first tokens.\n\nHmm, this seems problematic. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps S doesn't have only those two productions. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nThe initial grammar was:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nYes, that's all. So S can't derive anything else except those two options. So starting with either S production, neither seems to generate the correct start symbol t17.\n\nWait, then perhaps the string isn't generated by this grammar. But I should make sure I haven't missed any expansion possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way through NT40 to generate t40, which might come from another path. Let me check if any NT40 can derive t40.\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT97 -> t48\nNT0 -> t6\n\nSo NT40 can expand to NT97 NT0. Then, expanding NT97 gives t48, and NT0 gives t6. So the entire expansion from NT40 would be t48 and t6. But that doesn't help because we need t40 and t15. Wait, perhaps I'm thinking wrong here.\n\nWait, actually, T17 is the first token in the string, but in the production S -> NT40 NT77, the first symbols would be the expansion of NT40 and then NT77. So NT40 is supposed to generate the first symbol, which is t17, but looking at NT40's productions, the only terminal is t28, so that won't work.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the string starts with t17, which would require NT40 to produce t17, but looking at NT40's rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT40 can only produce t28 or through a chain that doesn't involve t17. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me double-check the productions for NT40.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, under NT40:\n\nNT40 -> t28\nNT40 -> t28 (Wait, that seems like a typo, perhaps it's supposed to be another non-terminal? No, in the given grammar, it's two entries:\n\nLooking back at the user's grammar, they wrote:\n\nNT40 -> t28\n\nBut in the list, it's:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nAnd NT40 -> t28\n\nSo yes, NT40 can produce t28 or go into NT97 and NT0.\n\nSimilarly, for NT77:\n\nNT77 -> t15\n\nYes, only t15.\n\nSo NT40 NT77 would produce t28 and t15, which doesn't match the string, which starts with t17.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because the initial symbols don't align.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed something. Let me think differently: maybe the string can be split in a way that uses a different S production. Like, maybe there's a way to split the string into more than two parts, but since the grammar is in CNF, each production is only two non-terminals.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal on the left, and two symbols on the right. So each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, but the expansion starts with two symbols.\n\nSo the given string is of length 9 tokens (since it's split by spaces as t17 t40 t38 t12 t10 t33 t49 t5 t5). That means the derivation tree would have at least a certain number of steps, but perhaps it's longer than I thought.\n\nWait, but if S must derive exactly two symbols at each step, the number of tokens in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. Let's see: the string has 9 symbols, which is not a power of two (2^3=8, 2^4=16). So that might be a problem. Because in a CNF grammar, derivations produce strings with lengths that are powers of two. Wait, no, CNF allows for derivations of any length, as each step can expand non-terminals into two symbols, and so the overall length can grow.\n\nWait, more accurately, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so starting from S, the first step gives two symbols, then each of those could expand further, leading to four symbols after two steps, etc. So the total number of symbols after n steps would be 2^n.\n\nBut the given string has 9 symbols, which is not a power of two, so that suggests that the string isn't in the language, because its length can't be generated under this grammar.\n\nBut wait, wait, let me think again. Maybe the non-terminals can expand into terminals and non-terminals, so the actual number of terminals can vary. So perhaps the length can be any length, not necessarily a power of two. Because each non-terminal can expand into either two non-terminals or two terminals.

Wait, looking back, the grammar does have:\n\nWait, in the given problem, the list of productions is:\n\nLooking through them again:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces 't17'.\n\nIn the problem, I see:\n\n- NT72 is split into NT68 and NT97, which becomes 't5' and 't48'.\n- NT94 is split into 't0' (from above) and other splits.\n\nWait, here's a production that seems to have 't17': in production 36, it's under NT74 -> NT58, but perhaps NT58 can produce 't17'? Looking more closely:\n\nLooking through the productions, for each NT:\n\nLooking for NT with 't17' as a terminal.\n\n- NT74: -> NT58 NT98. So, NT74 can split into NT58 and NT98. Do these have any terminals? Looking at NT58: I don't see it in the list of terminals. Wait, in the given grammar, perhaps I missed it. Let me recount:\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT74: -> NT58 NT98. So NT74 can go to NT58 or NT98. Do any of these have a terminal?\n\nWait, in the list, NT98 is written twice: 'NT98 -> 't5'' and 'NT98 -> 't34''. Wait, that's conflicting. Or perhaps it's a typo. Let me check:\n\nLine 19 says NT98 -> 't5', line 26 says NT98 -> 't34'. That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar has duplicates. That might be an error, but assuming it's part of the grammar, I'll proceed.\n\nSo, if NT74 splits into NT58 and NT98, and one of the terminals is 't17', perhaps I didn't see where NT58 leads.\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce 't17':\nLooking through the given productions:\n\nIs there any NT that directly goes to 't17'?

Because the string provided has a 't17', but in the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't17'. Therefore, perhaps this is a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in mapping the NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar can chain through non-terminals, eventually leading to these tokens. Let me try to see if 't17' is present anywhere.\n\nLooking back, do any of the NTs directly produce 't17'? It doesn't seem so.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-172","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. I'm new to context-free grammars, so I need to take it step by step. The task is to determine if the given string `t0 t48 t48 t40 t9 t36 t12 t15 t48 t48` is generated by the provided grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF).\n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar fits this structure, so I can proceed.\n\nThe string has ten tokens. Since each production in CNF either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals, the number of productions should reflect the derivation steps. For a string of length n (number of terminals), the derivation will have n-1 non-terminals. So for ten terminals, I should expect nine non-terminals in the derivation.\n\nLet me write out the string: t0, t48, t48, t40, t9, t36, t12, t15, t48, t48.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. From the grammar, S has two productions: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the first step in the derivation of S will produce two non-terminals, and each step will replace a non-terminal with other non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t0. Let me check which productions produce t0. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT0 \u2192 't6' and NT0 \u2192 't10'. Wait, but in the given string, the first token is t0, which is a terminal. So the first production must produce t0. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, but t0 is not directly a terminal here; maybe I misread. Let me check again. In the grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 't6' and NT0 \u2192 't10'. So 't0' isn't directly produced by any NT. That's strange. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me go through the grammar again:\n\nLooking for where 't0' appears. Okay, I see NT98 \u2192 't5', NT94 \u2192 't0' (twice), NT97 \u2192 't48', etc. So NT94 \u2192 't0'. So t0 is produced by NT94.\n\nWait, but in the first step, S is either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the first production is a pair of non-terminals. The string starts with t0, which is a terminal, so the entire string must be derived by replacing S through nested productions until we hit terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then, NT82 produces t29, right? Let me check: NT82 \u2192 't29'. So NT82 is replaced by t29. Then NT22 can produce t23. So that would give t29 t23 as the first two tokens. But in the given string, the first two tokens are t0 and t48. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first step could be S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Let's see what NT40 and NT77 produce.\n\nNT40 can produce several things. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, which would be another non-terminal pair.\nNT40 \u2192 't28'\nNT40 also has other productions? Let me check:\n\nYes, NT40 has:\n\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT40 \u2192 't28'\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\nWait, so NT40 can be a terminal (t28) or non-terminals.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and in the first step, we choose NT40 \u2192 't28', which gives us t28. Then NT77: looking at the rules, NT77 \u2192 't15'. So that would give t28 t15. But the string starts with t0, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we choose NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0. Then, NT97 produces 't48' and NT0 can produce 't6' or 't10'. But the string starts with t0. So, t0 would have to come from NT0 \u2192 t6 or t10, but in our case, t0 is in the middle. So perhaps we're not on this path.\n\nWait, maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT82 NT22, but that led to t29 t23, which isn't matching. So perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and to get t0, perhaps NT77 is producing t0 somehow.\n\nWait, looking at NT77's rules: I don't see NT77 directly producing t0. Let's check the rules again. Maybe I missed a rule.\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\nI see NT77 \u2192 't15', which suggests that NT77 produces 't15'. So the only way to get a terminal like 't0' is through a non-terminal that produces 't0', which is NT94 \u2192 't0' (twice). So somewhere in the derivation, we'd have to have NT94 \u2192 't0'.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't0'. From the rules:\n\nNT94 \u2192 't0' (twice). So any production of NT94 would produce 't0'.\n\nSo in the given string, we have 't0' as the first token, so that must come from some NT94.\n\nSo the derivation must have a chain like S \u2192 something that eventually leads to NT94, which then becomes 't0'. But S is either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So perhaps we can find a way to get NT94 in the derivation.\n\nWait, let's think: starting with S, which branches into two non-terminals, so the derivation must split into a left and a right part, each leading to a terminal.\n\nLet me try to see if I can build the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t0 t48 t48 t40 t9 t36 t12 t15 t48 t48.\n\nLet's consider that each production must have two non-terminals except the last one, which is a terminal. Wait, no: in CNF, every production is a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the entire string will be a sequence of productions where each non-terminal splits into two or a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the string as a parse tree. Alternatively, think recursively.\n\nLet's try to parse the string from the start. The string is t0 followed by t48, etc. Maybe the first token is from NT94 \u2192 t0. Then after that, we have t48, which could come from NT48, but NT48 can produce 't21' or 't15'. Hmm, wait:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT48: Wait, in the given grammar, NT48 \u2192 t15, as per the rules:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t15. Because looking for NT48, in the rules given:\n\nLooking for NT48: there's a rule NT48 \u2192 't15'. So yes, NT48 \u2192 t15.\n\nSo after t0, the next token is t48, which would require NT48 \u2192 t15, but that would produce 't15', which is not t48. Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, let's clarify: in the given grammar, each NT rule on the left is the symbol, and on the right are the productions. Wait, perhaps I read the grammar incorrectly. The grammar is written as S -> NT82 NT22, etc. So each right-hand side is a sequence of non-terminals. So for example, S \u2192 NT82 NT22 means that S can be replaced by NT82 and NT22. Similarly, NT94 \u2192 't0' means that NT94 can produce a terminal 't0'.\n\nSo, to break it down again, for a string like t0 t48 t48 ... We start by looking for a way to get t0, which must come from NT94 \u2192 t0.\n\nBut the S production starts the derivation. So to get t0 somewhere in the string, we need S to eventually produce NT94, which then produces t0.\n\nSo let's try to find a path:\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT40 NT77, because S \u2192 NT82 NT22 would not lead to t0 as the first token. So let's assume S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nThen NT40 can produce '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-178","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. In CNF, each production rule has either a single terminal or two non-terminals on the right-hand side. That means all production rules must be of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, most of the rules seem to fit this pattern. For example, S -> NT82 NT22 is a production with two non-terminals on the right, so that's fine. However, I notice some rules that might have more than two parts or terminals. Wait, I see some rules like NT94 -> NT72 NT95, which is two non-terminals, that's okay. But then there are rules where a non-terminal is followed by an 't' value, like NT71 -> 't36'. Wait, those are not allowed in CNF because CNF only allows terminals or non-terminals. But in this case, 't' is a terminal, so maybe that's okay. Let me check the others. For example, NT3 -> 't5' is also a terminal, so those are fine.\n\nSo the grammar seems to be in CNF because all rules have either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t33 t36 t8 t8 t34 t39 t31 t23 t5 t9`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The standard method is to use a bottom-up approach, trying to match the string by expanding rule by rule. Alternatively, we can think of it as constructing a parse tree where the leaves are the string's symbols and the internal nodes are the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which is in CNF, S can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So each application of S will produce two non-terminals: NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77. \n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t33. So to get t33, there must be a production that directly produces it. Looking through the rules, NT3 -> 't3' and 't5' are possible. Wait, NT3 can only produce 't5'. Oh, but the first symbol is t33, which doesn't appear in any of the terminal symbols. Wait, looking through the rules, let me check each non-terminal:\n\n- NT3 -> 't5' (so it can't produce 't33')\n- NT18 -> 't18' (but our first symbol is 't33')\n- NT3 -> 't5' again\n- S -> NT82 NT22 and NT40 NT77\n- NT82 -> 't29'\n- NT71 -> 't36'\n- NT94 -> 't0' etc.\n\nWait, none of the non-terminals seem to produce 't33'. Let me check again. Wait, the rule NT71 -> 't36'. No. NT94 -> 't9'. Hmm, I don't see a production that generates 't33' as a terminal. So is that even possible? That would mean the string can't start with 't33' because there's no rule that directly produces that.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again. Looking through the list:\n\n- NT36 -> 't35';\n- NT18 -> 't33';\n- So NT18 can produce 't33'. So maybe the string starts with NT18 expanding to t33.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is t33. So perhaps the first part of the string comes from NT18 -> t33.\n\nBut wait, how do we get to NT18? Because the grammar starts with S, which can only produce two non-terminals. So the leftmost derivation would start with S, which splits into two non-terminals. Let's consider the first symbol t33, which is produced by NT18 -> t33. So perhaps the first step is S -> NT18 NT_something.\n\nBut wait, looking at the S productions: S can only go to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So S cannot directly produce NT18. That means that in order for the string to start with t33 via NT18, there must be a way for S to derive a sequence where one of the non-terminals is NT18.\n\nSo let's think: For the string to start with t33 (from NT18), the leftmost symbol would come from NT18. So perhaps the S production is S -> NT40 NT77, which then can be expanded further. Let's see:\n\nNT40 can produce 't10' and other terms. Wait, looking at NT40's productions:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0;\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3;\nBut also, NT40 can directly produce 't10' or 't28'? Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, NT97 -> 't48', so NT40 -> NT97 NT0, which would become t48 and t0. Or NT40 -> 't28' directly?\n\nLooking back through the rules, I see NT40 has rules like NT40 -> 't28'. Yes, there's a rule NT40 -> 't28'. So NT40 can produce t28. Similarly, NT77 can be broken down:\n\nLooking at NT77, in the given rules, do we have a production for NT77? Looking through, I don't see any. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again:\n\nThe rules listed are:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\n\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\n... other rules...\n\nLooking through, I don't see NT77 -> something. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the beginning again.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I see:\n\nNo, it's not there. Hmm. So NT77 doesn't have a production, but in the grammar, every non-terminal must have a production. Because in CNF, every non-terminal must have productions; otherwise, the grammar is incomplete.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If NT77 isn't producing anything, then S -> NT40 NT77 would mean that NT77 can't be further expanded, which might not be allowed because, in CNF, all non-terminals must have at least one production.\n\nBut perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, in CNF, all non-terminals must have at least one production. So if the given grammar includes all non-terminals, we have to make sure that each of them has a production. But in the given grammar, I don't see any production for NT77. That might be an issue. Did I miss it?\n\nLooking again through the rules:\n\nS production includes NT77 as part of the rule. So NT77 must have a production. Let me look for NT77 in the given rules. Wait, in the list, I don't see any rule with NT77 on the left. So perhaps I overlooked it.

My goal is to determine if the string can be generated by the grammar, so I need to figure out the steps to check this.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the rules are either two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t38 t28 t10 t38 t0 t39 t34 t33 t23 t49 t38`. I notice that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So each 'tn' represents a single terminal symbol, which is a letter t followed by a digit, but since they're all used separately, I need to check how they fit into the productions.\n\nThe grammar has several production rules that produce terminals. I'll list out all the production rules that result in terminals:\n\n- S -> NT82 NT22\n- S -> NT40 NT77\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n- NT72 -> NT82 NT35\n- NT3 -> NT91 NT94\n- NT12 -> NT48 NT74\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT94 -> NT9 NT12\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- NT48 -> NT36 NT3\n- NT22 -> NT68 NT97\n- NT94 -> NT72 NT95\n- NT12 -> 't31'\n- NT22 -> 't23'\n- NT15 -> 't49'\n- NT97 -> 't48'\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT18 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT82 -> 't29'\n- NT71 -> 't36'\n- NT71 -> 't5'\n- NT98 -> 't34'\n- NT22 -> 't12'\n- NT36 -> 't35'\n- NT48 -> 't15'\n- NT68 -> 't5'\n- NT35 -> 't29'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT94 -> 't0'\n- NT72 -> 't8'\n- NT40 -> 't28'\n- NT9 -> 't40'\n- NT18 -> 't9'\n- NT91 -> 't38'\n- NT95 -> 't10'\n- NT77 -> 't15'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT82 -> 't34'\n- NT48 -> 't21'\n- NT74 -> 't17'\n- NT58 -> 't17'\n\nWait, I see that some non-terminals have multiple productions leading to the same terminal. For example, NT22 has multiple rules leading to different terminals, but I notice that the rules like NT71->t5 and NT71->t36 are conflicting. But in the given grammar, I think the correct way is to consider each production as separate, so if a non-terminal can produce multiple terminals, but in this case, NT71 has two rules: one producing t36 and another (but looking at the list, I see NT71->t5 is one rule, and another production for NT71 was possibly mistakenly duplicated, but the user input shows a list that may have duplicates. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the user's grammar has multiple lines for the same non-terminal. For example, NT22 is defined as:\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n- NT22 -> 't23'\n- Also, NT22 appears again as NT22 -> NT68 NT97, and another as NT22->t12. So each line is a separate production rule.\n\nSo the grammar is a bit dense, with many rules, each non-terminal potentially having multiple options.\n\nNow, the string given is: `t38 t28 t10 t38 t0 t39 t34 t33 t23 t49 t38`\n\nI need to parse this string into a sequence of terminal symbols. Since each is a tn, where t is followed by a number, I can treat each as a single unit. So the string is a sequence of these terminals:\n\nt38, t28, t10, t38, t0, t39, t34, t33, t23, t49, t38\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation must consist of a series of steps that expand the start symbol S into a sequence of non-terminals and then terminals, with the number of steps equal to the length of the string minus one.\n\nThe string length is 11, so the derivation should take 10 steps. Each step replaces a non-terminal into two non-terminals. However, in this case, since we're generating the string from S, which is a non-terminal, each step may involve breaking down a non-terminal into others until all are terminals.\n\nBut since each production in CNF has exactly two non-terminals on the RHS or a single terminal, perhaps it's easier to approach this using a top-down approach, but with such a long string, it might be challenging to do manually. Alternatively, maybe I can build the parse tree or use dynamic programming for parsing.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be generated by trying to match production rules. Let's look at the first symbol in the string: t38.\n\nLooking through the productions, see which non-terminals produce t38.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT91 -> t38 (from line: NT91 -> 't38')\n- Also, S can produce NT82 NT22, but NT91 is a terminal only in NT91->t38.\n\nWait, no, NT91 is actually an NT (non-terminal): NT91 -> 't38'.\n\nSo to produce t38, the immediate production would have to be from a non-terminal that can go to t38 in one step.\n\nLooking through the rules, the only non-terminals that directly produce t38 are:\n\n- NT91 -> t38\n\nSo the start symbol S can (initially) produce NT82 and NT22. Looking at these, both NT82 and NT22 are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right way. Let me think again.\n\nIn the Chomsky normal form, the left-hand side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either one or two non-terminals.\n\nIn the initial step, S can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is t38, which is generated by NT91. So the first step must involve a non-terminal that can produce t38. Looking back, the only non-terminal that can directly produce t38 is NT91. So perhaps the entire derivation must start by having NT91 on the left-hand side, but the initial productions for S are NT82 NT22 and NT40 NT77. So S does not directly produce a non-terminal that can produce t38.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be generated by a sequence of steps where the non-terminals are broken down until reaching NT91.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if there's a way to get t38 as part of a larger substring generated from S via several expansions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider whether the string starts with t38, but since the initial productions from S do not have t38, perhaps the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the string includes t38 as the first symbol, which can only be produced by NT91, but NT91 is a non-terminal, so how can the start symbol S produce t38 directly? It can't, because S's productions always expand into two non-terminals. Therefore, perhaps the string is invalid because the first symbol cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily be the case because the productions could be structured in such a way that S is expanded first into two non-terminals, each of which is further expanded, eventually producing a t38.\n\nWait, no. Because the length of the string is 11, meaning we have 11 terminals. Since each production can generate either two non-terminals or a terminal, each step reduces the count of symbols by one. Starting with S (count=1), after one expansion, we have two symbols (could be two non-terminals, two terminals, or one of each).

{"custom_id":"request-193","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It starts with S, which can produce two options: NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So, the string must start with one of these two pairs. Then, I see a list of non-terminals (NT36, NT22, NT74, etc.) that can each produce other combinations of non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are represented by strings like 't29', 't48', etc., which are the actual symbols in the string I need to evaluate.\n\nThe string I'm supposed to evaluate is: `t29 t48 t40 t28 t48 t36 t40 t48 t40 t49 t0`. Let me count the number of tokens here: 11. So the parse tree must have 11 symbols. The root is S, which produces two non-terminals, so each expansion would add two more symbols until I reach the terminal string. \n\nI think the approach here is to try to build a parse tree that matches the given string. Since the grammar has many non-terminals, I might need to work step by step, expanding each part to see if it can lead to the target string.\n\nStarting with S: it can be NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nI'm looking at the string starting with t29. Let me check which non-terminals can produce t29. From the grammar, I see NT82 \u2192 't29' and NT35 \u2192 't29', among others. So NT82 and NT35 are possible sources for t29.\n\nWait, but the first part of the string is t29, so it must come from a non-terminal that produces t29. Let me see: looking at the productions, NT82 \u2192 't29' and NT35 \u2192 't29'. So either NT82 or NT35 can produce t29.\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is t29. Let me check the grammar rules for NT82 and NT35.\n\nFor NT82: It can produce NT48 NT36 or NT48 NT3 (since NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94, but that's more complex, maybe I should look at direct terminals). Wait, actually, the productions for NT82 are: NT82 \u2192 't29' and also NT82 \u2192 NT48 NT36. So directly, NT82 can produce t29.\n\nSimilarly, NT35 can produce 't29' directly.\n\nSo the first symbol t29 must come from either NT82 or NT35. Let me explore both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The first non-terminal is NT82 \u2192 't29'. So the first part is done. Now, the next symbol is t48. The second non-terminal is NT22. So we need NT22 to produce t48.\n\nLooking at NT22's productions: NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48 or 't23'. So NT22 can directly produce t23 or NT71 NT48. The next symbol after t29 is t48, which would need to come from NT48. Let me see if NT22 can produce t48.\n\nWait, wait. NT22's production is either NT71 NT48 or 't23'. So if NT22 is 't23', it would produce t23, but the next symbol is t48. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, we need NT22 to produce NT71 NT48. But then, the next symbol after t29 is t48, which would have to come from NT48. So let me check.\n\nIf NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, then the next symbols would be first NT71 and then NT48. The next token is t48, so NT48 should produce t48. Let me check NT48's productions.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3 or 't15' or 't21'. So NT48 can directly produce 't15', 't21', or combination of NT36 and NT3. Wait, 't21' is present in the string after t29 and t48, so maybe NT48 produces 't21'. But the next token after t48 is t48, but that's the same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me structure this differently.\n\nThe string is: t29, t48, t40, t28, t48, t36, t40, t48, t40, t49, t0.\n\nSince S starts with NT82 and NT22, and let's say the first part is NT82 \u2192 't29', then the second non-terminal is NT22. So after 't29', we have 't48', 't40', etc.\n\nSo, after NT82 produces t29, the next non-terminal is NT22, which needs to produce t48. Let's see how NT22 can produce t48.\n\nNT22's options: 't23' or NT71 NT48. So to get 't48', NT22 must be 't23' (but that would produce 't48' as 't23' is 't23' \u2192 't23', which is not matching) or via NT71 and NT48.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if NT22 \u2192 't23', it would directly produce t23. But the next token after 't29' is t48, which is not t23. Therefore, the other option is that NT22 must produce NT71 NT48. So the first symbol from NT22 would be NT71, and the second would be NT48. But in the string, after t29 comes t48, which would mean that NT71 must produce something that leads to t48, which seems possible if NT71 produces t48 via some of its own productions.\n\nWait, let's check if NT71 can produce t48. Looking at NT71's productions: NT71 \u2192 't36' NT77, 't5' NT12, 't36' NT77, 't5' NT12, or 't36' NT77, 't5' NT12 (wait, I think duplicates may exist but it's the same). So looking for a production that directly produces t48.\n\nWait, none of these directly produce t48. So perhaps that's not the right path. Alternatively, maybe NT71 can produce something that can lead to t48. Or perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me backtrack. The first token is t29, which can come from NT82. So after that, we have the second part of S, which is NT40 and NT77. Wait, no. Wait, the initial S is either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the first part is NT82 and the second is NT22. Or first is NT40 and second is NT77.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me clarify: The initial S is either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nSo in the first case, we have S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So the string starts with NT82, then NT22. In the second case, S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the string starts with NT40, then NT77.\n\nGiven the string starts with t29, which can come from NT82 (since NT82 \u2192 t29) or from NT35 (since NT35 \u2192 t29). But in the initial case, the first part is either NT82 or NT40. So if the first symbol comes from NT82, then the first part is NT82 \u2192 t29, and the second part would be NT22.\n\nAlternatively, if the first symbol comes from NT35, then that would require a more complex production, but looking at the grammar, NT35 can only produce t29 directly. Let me check the productions for NT35. Looking back, in the grammar, I see NT35 \u2192 't29' and also NT35 \u2192 NT48. Wait, no: in the initial grammar list, I see NT35 is one of the productions.

The grammar has a series of production rules, and the string to evaluate is `t15 t15 t38 t39 t23 t36 t48 t31 t8 t36 t38 t36`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF is: it's a form where every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this structure, as each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and is either expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string consists of terminal symbols, so I need to see if I can derive it step by step using the production rules. My approach will be to break down the string into parts that match individual production rules and then build a parse tree from the string upwards to see if it can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list the relevant production rules for terminals in the string. The string contains t15, t15, t38, t39, t23, t36, t48, t31, t8, t36, t38, t36. \n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n- t15 can come from NT48 (since NT48 -> t15).\n- t38 comes from NT74 (NT74 -> t17), but wait, t38 is present; there's no direct rule for NT38. Hmm, that's an issue. Wait, let me check the rules again. Oh, I see that NT72 can produce t8. \n\nBut the string has t38 multiple times, which might imply that NT74 is involved since NT74 \u2192 t17 is another option, but t38 isn't present in the terminals directly. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT77 has a production to t15. NT77 \u2192 t15 and NT74 \u2192 t17. So maybe t38 is from some NT? Wait, looking back, I don't see any production where an NT directly produces t38. The string has t38 appearing three times. That's a problem because none of the NTs seem to directly produce t38. \n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the production rules. Looking at NT74: NT74 -> NT58 NT98. NT58 isn't a terminal, so that's not helpful. NT98 is 't5' according to the given rules... Wait, NT98 \u2192 t5, and NT58 \u2192 ? Let me check.\n\nIn the rules, I see NT58 \u2192 t17, which is another terminal. Wait, so NT58 is a non-terminal that can produce t17. Similarly, NT98 \u2192 t5. So NT74 \u2192 t17, which would give t17 when NT74 is used. But in the string, we have t38, which doesn't match any terminal directly from the NTs.\n\nWait, but I must have made a mistake because the string must be reducible. Let me think again. The string has 't38' three times. I need to find a production that produces 't38' from some NT. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT36: NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77. NT18 can produce 't33' and NT77 can produce 't15', so that's t33 t15. Not t38.\n\nLooking at NT94: NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12, and NT9 \u2192 't40', NT12 can produce 't31' (from NT12 \u2192 't31') and 't12' (another production). So NT94 can produce 't40 t31' or 't40 t12' or possibly others. Not t38.\n\nLooking at NT48: NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3. NT36 can become 't33 t5' when expanded via NT36 \u2192 NT33... Wait, no, the rules say NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77. NT18 is 't33', NT77 is 't15'. So NT36 becomes 't33 t15'. Then NT48 \u2192 't33 t15 t3'? No, that's not it. Hmm, NT48 could become NT36 NT3, which is 't33 t15' and 't5' respectively. So t33 t15 t5? That would be 't33 t15 t5', but the string has 't38's, so that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production for t38 somewhere. Let me check again. The given rules are extensive, but I don't see any NT directly producing 't38'. That's a problem. The string has 't38' which according to the rules doesn't seem to be produced by any NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. This structure is useful because it simplifies the implementation of parsers, but for this problem, it's about determining membership.\n\nThe given grammar starts with S and has several production rules. S \u2192 NT82 NT22, and others. So S is the start symbol and the initial non-terminal that needs to derive the string. The string provided is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: `t29 t39 t49 t23 t17 t28 t39 t23 t6 t10 t21 t23`.\n\nMy approach is to work backwards from the string, trying to find a derivation path that leads back to S. Each step should break down the string into smaller parts, using the reverse of the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the entire string, I look for the rightmost symbol and see if it's a terminal that can be derived from any rule. Since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps each production leads to two symbols, so each step should split the string into two parts.\n\nLooking at the string, the rightmost symbol is t23. From the grammar, I check which production ends with NT22. Looking at the rules, NT22 can produce t23 or t36. Wait, let me check: NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48 and also NT22 \u2192 't23', right?

{"custom_id":"request-231","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to context-free grammars, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the given grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should simplify the analysis a bit.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. The string we're evaluating is: t49 t15 t21 t12 t9 t17 t31 t23 t49 t23 t8 t49 t6.\n\nBreaking this down, it's a series of terminals (like t49, t15, etc.). So, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from S by applying the production rules.\n\nSince S starts as NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then, we need to see if each of these non-terminals can produce the corresponding part of the string.\n\nNext, the string starts with t49. Looking at the non-terminals, I see NT15 -> t49 and NT97 -> t48. So, to get t49, the non-terminal must be NT15.\n\nSo, let's check if NT82 can produce t49 and NT22 can produce something else.\n\nLooking at NT82, in the productions, I see NT82 -> t29. So, if NT82 is supposed to produce t49, that doesn't fit because NT82 can only produce t29. That's a problem because the first part of the string starts with t49, which doesn't match what NT82 can produce. \n\nWait, no. Wait. The first part of the string is t49, which would have to come from NT15 -> t49. But NT82 can only produce t29. So, the first NT in S is NT82, but it can't produce t49. That suggests that maybe S is supposed to be the other production, which is S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSo, let's try the other production: S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nNow, the string starts with t49, which would have to come from NT97 -> t48 or NT15 -> t49. Wait, NT77 is part of the production S \u2192 NT40 NT77, so the first non-terminal is NT40, and the second is NT77.\n\nLooking at NT77: in the productions, I see NT77 \u2192 t15. So, the second part can produce t15. But the string starts with t49, which would have to come from NT40 or NT77, but NT40 can produce t28 (wait, looking back, NT40 has productions like NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 and also NT40 \u2192 t28. Wait, but NT40 can produce t28 directly, but also have other rules.\n\nWait, let me check. NT40 has several productions, including NT40 \u2192 t28 and others. But in the string, the first part is t49, which would have to come from NT15 -> t49. So, the first part would have to be NT15, but S is producing NT40 NT77. So, the NT40 can't produce t15; instead, it's supposed to produce t49 as the first part.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the string positions:\n\n1. t49\n2. t15\n3. t21\n4. t12\n5. t9\n6. t17\n7. t31\n8. t23\n9. t49\n10. t23\n11. t8\n12. t49\n13. t6\n\nSo, the first symbol is t49. That would need to come from a non-terminal that can produce t49. Looking through the productions, I see NT15 \u2192 t49 and NT97 \u2192 t48. So, only NT15 can directly produce t49.\n\nSo, the first non-terminal in the string must be NT15. But in S \u2192 NT40 NT77, the first part is NT40, not NT15. So that would mean NT40 must produce t49. But looking at NT40's productions:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT40 \u2192 NT48 NT74\n- NT40 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71 (duplicate)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT48 NT74 (duplicate)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT22 NT22\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the productions for NT40 are:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\nNT40 \u2192 NT48 NT74\nNT40 \u2192 NT9 NT12\nNT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3 (Is this for NT48?)\nWait, no, let's see: the grammar is listed as:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> NT48 NT74\nNT40 -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, NT40 can produce NT97 NT0, which then could produce t48 and t6 (since NT0 \u2192 t6). So, if NT40 produces NT97, which then produces t48, but our string starts with t49, which can't come from t48. Alternatively, if NT40 produces NT15, which gives t49. So, the first part could be NT40 \u2192 NT15, producing t49. But I think NT40 can produce NT15, so maybe that works.\n\nWait, no. NT40 can produce NT15 NT71, which would then have to expand into symbols. But for the first symbol to be t49, which comes from NT15 \u2192 t49, then NT40 would have to produce NT15 as the first part, and then the second part would be NT77, which is supposed to produce, well, the next symbol is t15.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try a different approach. Let's try to parse the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if we can match the symbols.\n\nGiven the string: t49 t15 t21 t12 t9 t17 t31 t23 t49 t23 t8 t49 t6\n\nWe need to match this from the start symbol S.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then, we need NT82 and NT22 to produce the first two symbols, which are t49 and t15.\n\nBut NT82 \u2192 t29. So, no, that doesn't work because t29 \u2260 t49. Therefore, S cannot be NT82 NT22.

{"custom_id":"request-233","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This helps in simplifying the structure, but I'm not sure if that directly applies here since the grammar provided has a mix of both non-terminals and terminals. Wait, no, actually looking at the grammar, it seems like all the terminals are single-character strings like 't17', 't12', etc., so maybe each production rule is of the form non-terminal \u2192 non-terminal non-terminal, and some also produce terminal symbols directly. But CNF typically restricts production rules to exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps this grammar isn't strictly in CNF, but the question states it's presented in CNF, so maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's in CNF, but some rules produce terminals and others produce non-terminals. So each production either leads to two non-terminals or a single terminal. Let me check the grammar given:\n\nThe start symbol S appears to have two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nThese are both S \u2192 NTNT, so two non-terminals each. Then looking further down, I see rules like NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, which are non-terminals producing two non-terminals. However, other rules like NT22 \u2192 't23' and NT0 \u2192 't6' seem to produce terminals directly. So, this grammar is not entirely in CNF, but perhaps the question allows for some overlap, treating the terminals as a kind of production that can be used as leaves in the parse tree.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t17 t12 t5 t6 t31 t34 t9 t40 t34 t36 t49 t8 t5`\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do this, I should probably parse the string according to the grammar rules, ensuring that each step follows a production.\n\nStarting with the entire string, the first step is to see if the start symbol S can produce the whole string. Since S has two productions, maybe we need to try both and see if either can generate the string. Let me first look at the start symbols' right-hand sides.\n\nS can go to NT82 followed by NT22, which would mean the string starts with 't29 t23' because looking at the rules:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't29'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't17', not 't29', so that production doesn't seem to fit. Let me check the other S production:\n\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\n- NT40 \u2192 't28' or 't40' or others. Wait, looking at the rules, NT40 can go to:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT40 also can go to NT15 NT71 and NT48 NT36, etc. But in the given grammar, NT40 \u2192 't28' and NT97 could go to 't48', and NT0 \u2192 't10'. So let's see if the string can be built from this.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't17', so perhaps the other start production leading with NT36 is more relevant since NT36 \u2192 't35' from one rule and also can produce NT18 NT77. But NT36 starts with 't35', which doesn't match 't17'. Alternatively, maybe this is not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the overall structure. The string is a sequence of t17, t12, t5, t6, t31, t34, t9, t40, t34, t36, t49, t8, t5.\n\nEach production seems to generate two parts, so maybe the string needs to be broken down into pairs. Alternatively, it's a parse tree where each node is a production, and the leaves are the terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking for the start symbol S. The start symbol can generate either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Since the string starts with t17, let me see which of these can produce a 't17' in the string.\n\nLooking at nt rules, the NT40 \u2192 't28', but that's t28, not 17. NT22 can produce t23 and 't12', but wait, looking closely:\n\n- NT22's rules include 't12' and 't23' and others. Like NT22 \u2192 't12' and NT22 \u2192 't23'. So the first part of S \u2192 NT22 could start with 't12' or 't23', but our string starts with 't17', so that can't be the case. So perhaps the other production of S being NT40 NT77 is the right path.\n\nSo let me consider S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Now, each of these can produce further non-terminals. Let's try to parse the string as starting with the first part as NT40 and the second part as NT77.\n\nSo the first part of the string, starting with 't17', would be part of NT40's production. Looking at the rules for NT40, I see NT40 \u2192 't28', NT48 NT36, NT97 NT0, NT15 NT71, and NT48 NT36 again. So to get a 't17', is there a way for NT40 to produce a t17?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 't21', NT71 \u2192 't36', and others. Wait, is there any rule for NT40 that leads to a terminal like t17? Or is t17 produced by another non-terminal that's a child of NT40?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think recursively. Let me try to see if t17 can be part of a production by looking upstream. So t17 is in the string as the first token. Let's see which non-terminals could lead to t17. Looking at the grammar, do any rules produce t17?\n\nYes, looking at the production rules:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't36', no, that's t36.\nWait, wait, no, looking at the list:\n\nThe only t17 comes from NT71 \u2192 't12' and 't5' etc. Wait, but no rule directly produces t17. So perhaps t17 is generated via some other production.\n\nWait, perhaps the string's first part t17 is part of a larger non-terminal expansion. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Let's list out all the rules and their outputs:\n\n- S has two rules: NT82 NT22 and NT40 NT77\n- NT82 \u2192 't29', NT35, etc.\n- NT72 \u2192 't8', etc.\n- NT74 \u2192 't17'! Wait, yes! Looking at the rules: NT74 \u2192 't17'.\n\nYes, that's a rule I see. So NT74 can produce 't17' as a terminal. If the string starts with 't17', perhaps it's from the NT74 in one of the productions.\n\nWait, but in the initial grammar, S's productions are NT40 NT77. So perhaps the first part is part of NT40 and the second part is NT77.\n\nLet me check NT40's production. Since the string starts with t17, perhaps the first part of the production is NT74 \u2192 't17', but that's not possible because S's production is NT40 and NT77. So maybe the string starts with part of NT40 and part of NT77.\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's parse the string step by step, trying to break it down into possible chunks generated by each non-terminal.\n\nThe string is: t17, t12, t5, t6, t31, t34, t9, t40, t34, t36, t49, t8, t5.\n\nI need to see if this can be partitioned in such a way that each partition corresponds to a production.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT40 NT77, so the entire string would be the concatenation of the expansions of NT40 and NT77. So the first part of the string should be what NT40 generates, and the latter part should be what NT77 generates.\n\nLet's see: the entire string is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string starts with t9, so I'll look for productions that start with t9. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT9 is the only non-terminal that produces t9. Its production is NT9 \u2192 t40 and NT40 \u2192 t28. So t9 comes from NT9 \u2192 t40 \u2192 t28. Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is t9, which is actually NT9. So perhaps I should map t9 to NT9, then see how the string continues.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the steps: each symbol in the string must come from a production. Since each production in CNF is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a (if it's a terminal). Looking at the given grammar, some of the productions are terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't5', and others are non-terminals. So for example, NT9 is a terminal 't9', because the production is NT9 \u2192 't40', but wait, no, that can't be right because NT9 would produce another non-terminal. Wait, looking back, the grammar's productions start with S, and the non-terminals seem to be combinations like NT36, NT22, etc. Wait, perhaps the string uses 't' followed by numbers, which are either direct terminals or via non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check. The grammar has:\n\nNT9: NT9 \u2192 't40' -- so NT9 produces a terminal 't40'? But that doesn't make sense, because that would be a terminal symbol for '40', but in the string, they have 't9', etc. Hmm. Wait, maybe I misread. Wait, looking again at the grammar, I see:\n\nFor example, NT3 \u2192 NT18 NT77, which isn't terminal. But some of the NTs do have productions that produce terminals, like NT18 \u2192 't33', NT3 \u2192 't5', etc. So for NT9, the production is NT9 \u2192 't40' which is a terminal 't40'. But then the string has 't9', not 't40'. So perhaps there's confusion here. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the grammar works. Because in the string, the initial symbols are 't9', but in the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't40', which is different. That suggests that 't9' is a terminal that's produced by another non-terminal, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing NT9 with another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me step back. The first step is to parse the string `t9 t17 t38 t5 t21 t5 t15 t49 t15 t8 t48 t15 t49 t8` as a sequence of terminal symbols. Each symbol must be matched by a production's terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals have productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT18 \u2192 't33'\n- NT9 \u2192 't40' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, it'sNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT0. So perhaps that's not the case. Hmm, maybe I should list all the NT productions correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each production properly:\n\nThe S productions are:\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo S is replaced by either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77.\n\nNow, looking into the NT productions:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\nNT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\nNT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\nNT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\nNT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\nNT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\nNT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\nNT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\nNT12 \u2192 't31'  -- Wait, is this a terminal or production?\nWait, the notation is that sometimes the productions are given as 'a b', meaning terminal followed by terminal, which isn't typical in Chomsky Normal Form where productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. Oh, perhaps some of the productions are implicitly producing terminals. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar has productions that have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. For example, if a production is A \u2192 a B, that would allow the a to be a terminal.\n\nLooking back, for example, the production NT12 \u2192 't31' suggests that NT12 can produce the terminal string 't31'. Similarly, looking through the grammar, other productions are:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't12' as one of the rules. So NT22 can produce 't12', which would be a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either to two non-terminals or a single terminal. So some non-terminals can directly produce terminals without involving other non-terminals.\n\nSo for example, NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48 is a production with non-terminals, while NT22 \u2192 't12' is a terminal. So in that case, 't12' can be directly produced by NT22.\n\nThis changes the approach because each step can produce a terminal or continue to expand non-terminals.\n\nSo the string is `t9 t17 t38 t5 t21 t5 t15 t49 t15 t8 t48 t15 t49 t8`.

My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me list the productions again to understand the structure:\n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n3. NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n4. NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n5. NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n6. NT72 -> NT82 NT35\n7. NT3 -> NT91 NT94\n8. NT12 -> NT48 NT74\n9. NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n10. NT94 -> NT9 NT12\n11. NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n12. NT48 -> NT36 NT3\n13. NT22 -> NT68 NT97\n14. NT94 -> NT72 NT95\n15. NT12 -> 't31'\n16. NT22 -> 't23'\n17. NT15 -> 't49'\n18. NT97 -> 't48'\n19. NT98 -> 't5'\n20. NT18 -> 't33'\n21. NT3 -> 't5'\n22. NT0 -> 't6'\n23. NT82 -> 't29'\n24. NT71 -> 't36'\n25. NT71 -> 't5'\n26. NT98 -> 't34'\n27. NT22 -> 't12'\n28. NT36 -> 't35'\n29. NT48 -> 't15'\n30. NT68 -> 't5'\n31. NT35 -> 't29'\n32. NT0 -> 't10'\n33. NT94 -> 't0'\n34. NT72 -> 't8'\n35. NT40 -> 't28'\n36. NT9 -> 't40'\n37. NT18 -> 't9'\n38. NT91 -> 't38'\n39. NT95 -> 't10'\n40. NT74 -> 't17'\n41. NT58 -> 't17'\n\nWait, I see that some of these have multiple productions. For example, NT71 has two different productions: NT71 -> t36 and NT71 -> t5. Similarly, other non-terminals have multiple options.\n\nNow, looking back at the input string:\n\nThe string is \"t5 t39 t10 t21 t0 t28 t40 t38 t38 t8 t33 t23 t28 t49\".\n\nLet me split it into individual tokens:\n\n1. t5\n2. t39\n3. t10\n4. t21\n5. t0\n6. t28\n7. t40\n8. t38\n9. t38\n10. t8\n11. t33\n12. t23\n13. t28\n14. t49\n\nSo, there are 14 tokens.\n\nNow, I need to check if this can be generated by the grammar. \n\nFirst, let's note that the start symbol is S, which produces NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So, any derivation from S must start with the concatenation of two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5. So, let me check where t5 can come from. Checking the productions, I see:\n\nNT98 -> t5 (from production 19)\nNT3 -> t5 (from production 21)\nNT94 -> t5 (from production 25)\nNT71 -> t5 (from production 24? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, NT71 has two productions: NT71 -> NT71? Wait, let me check the given productions again.\n\nWait, production 4 is NT22 -> NT71 NT48\nProduction 24: NT71 -> t36\nProduction 25: NT71 -> t5\nWait, no, looking at the given list:\n\nProductions for NT71 are:\n\nLooking through the list, production 4 is NT22 -> NT71 NT48\nNT71 only appears on the left in production 4 and possibly others. Wait, looking again, there's a production for NT71:\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- Production 4: NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n- Production 24: NT71 -> t5 (Wait no, wait. Let's recount the productions:\n\nWait, in the given list, from 1 to 41, let me list all NT71 productions:\n\nLooking at production numbers:\n\nProduction 4: NT22 -> NT71 NT48\nProduction 24: NT71 -> t5 (No, production 24 is NT22 -> t5. Wait, no.\n\nWait, let me carefully go through the list again:\n\nFrom the user's input:\n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\n3. NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\n4. NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n\n5.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string we need to check is `t39 t8 t5 t39 t9 t21 t21 t49 t28 t0 t9 t15 t12 t31 t39`.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the elements in the string are terminals, so each token in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. My task is to see if these terminals can be derived by the grammar starting from the start symbol, which is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are two initial productions for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo the first step is to see which of these can lead to the start of the string. Let's look at the first token t39. Let me check which non-terminals can produce t39.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n- NT40 has a production: NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 and another NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71.

Similarly, rules like NT82 \u2192 't29' mean NT82 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the initial grammar, we have S \u2192 NT82 NT22, so if both NT82 and NT22 are terminals, then S directly produces t29 t12? Because looking at the rules, NT22 has two productions: NT22 \u2192 't23' and NT22 \u2192 't12'. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar shows NT22 has two rules:\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- NT22 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, so for NT22, it can be broken down into NT71 NT48, or it can be a terminal 't23' or 't12'. So NT22 is a non-terminal, but can produce two different terminal symbols.\n\nSimilarly, NT82 has NT82 \u2192 't29'.\n\nSo, going back to S's first production: S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Since NT82 can only produce t29, that's fixed. Then NT22 can produce t23 or t12 (since in the rules, NT22 \u2192 't23' and NT22 \u2192 't12'). So from S's first production, the string starts with t29 followed by either t23 or t12.\n\nLooking at the input string, the first token is t39. So S \u2192 NT82 (t29) followed by NT22 which is t12 or t23, which does not produce t39. So the first production of S can't lead to the first token t39.\n\nNext, S's second production: S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Let's see what NT40 and NT77 can produce.\n\nFor NT40: Looking at the rules, it has several productions:\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT40 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 again?

{"custom_id":"request-273","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string given is `t10 t36 t33 t40 t28 t10 t6 t9 t15 t48 t23 t39 t38 t49 t34`, and the grammar is a set of production rules. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky normal form entails. CNF is a specific way to structure CFGs where each production is either:\n1. A non-terminal symbol A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals.\n2. A non-terminal symbol A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, all production rules seem to fit this structure except for a single rule: `NT97 -> NT9 NT12`. Wait, that's actually in CNF as well because both NT9 and NT12 are non-terminals. So, no issues there.\n\nNow, my task is to parse the given string using this grammar to see if it's a valid derivation. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I'll need to check if each terminal can be matched by the left-hand sides of the rules in the correct order.\n\nThe string is: t10, t36, t33, t40, t28, t10, t6, t9, t15, t48, t23, t39, t38, t49, t34.\n\nI think the best approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the entire string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has the productions:\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, the initial split is between NT82 and NT22, or between NT40 and NT77. Let's see which one fits with the string.\n\nLooking at the string's first element t10, but the next is t36, so wait, let me clarify: the entire string is a sequence of terminals, so the initial step is to match t10 t36 t33 etc., but each terminal is a separate symbol, so it's like the string is a series of individual terminals: t10, t36, t33, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Typically, in a CFG, a production's left-hand side (LHS) expands into a sequence of symbols ( terminals and non-terminals) in the right-hand side (RHS). So each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with its RHS. \n\nBut since the string is a linear sequence, to make sense of this, the LHS must be a single non-terminal, and each step appends symbols until all RHS non-terminals are replaced, resulting in the entire string.\n\nBut the string starts with t10, so perhaps each t is a terminal symbol. So the grammar must have production rules where each non-terminal eventually expands into a series of tinals and non-terminals that ultimately become t's.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky normal form, the RHS can have at most two non-terminals. So, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo, the string consists of a series of terminals. The problem is to see if the string is a valid derivation starting from S.\n\nTo see this, perhaps we can build a parse tree by following the production rules, ensuring at each step that the current buffer (remaining symbols) can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, we can perform a top-down parsing using the given grammar, checking if the string can be derived.\n\nGiven that the string is 15 symbols long, and each step in a leftmost derivation would replace a non-terminal with its RHS, which could increase the length as we replace each symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to reconstruct the derivation step by step.\n\nLet me note that the start symbol S can produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Since the first symbol in the string is t10, I need to see which production of S can lead to a string that starts with t10.\n\nWait, but S itself is a non-terminal and would have to be expanded into non-terminals, each of which can be further expanded until terminals are reached.\n\nSo, the entire string is a sequence of terminals. Hence, the start symbol S must derive a string of terminals, each step expanding a non-terminal into a sequence that becomes the entire string.\n\nWait, perhaps I can work through the string step by step, trying to match it to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string should be produced by a leftmost derivation starting from S.\n\nLet me outline the string again: t10, t36, t33, t40, t28, t10, t6, t9, t15, t48, t23, t39, t38, t49, t34.\n\nThe length is 15. Since the start symbol S is non-terminal, the derivation would replace S step by step, and each replacement would add more symbols (terminals and non-terminals).\n\nBut building a parse tree manually would be tricky, so perhaps I can look for known structures or see if each terminal in the string can be matched correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can check the grammar for any possible expansion where each step leads to the next terminal.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the entire string can be split into a structure that matches the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t10. So, I can check which production results in t10 in the first step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals can produce t10.\n\nLooking at the rules, I need to find any A \u2192 t10.\n\nScanning through the productions:\n\nLooking for 't10' as the RHS of some production:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT94 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me list all the production rules that produce terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, here are the rules where non-terminals expand to terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT82 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT71 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT71 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, actually, some rules have multiple terminals. For example:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT91 \u2192 't38'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT72 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT94 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT82 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't21'\n\nNT74 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT58 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't48'\n\nWait, I think I might have found some rules that produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't40' \u2014 Wait, that can't be, because 't40' is a terminal. So this isn't possible because NT9 is a non-terminal, but its expansion is a terminal symbol 't40'? That can't be right, because in the grammar, non-terminals expand into other symbols, either non-terminals or terminals, but terminals are only on the RHS when they are terminals, not as part of a non-terminal's expansion. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Looking at the grammar, each production rule is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each RHS has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, a rule like NT9 \u2192 t40 would be invalid because 't40' is a terminal, which can't be part of a non-terminal's expansion in CNF. So perhaps that's an error. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem statement lists some rules where a non-terminal expands into a terminal, which would violate CNF. That can't be correct. So perhaps I need to verify the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking back at the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't40' \u2014 Wait, but that's a production of the non-terminal NT9 to the terminal t40. That's not possible in CNF because in CNF, each production for a non-terminal must be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So a single symbol on the RHS can be a terminal. Wait, wait, CNF allows productions of the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nTherefore, a production like NT9 \u2192 't40' would be allowed because it's a terminal in the RHS. However, that seems to imply that NT9 is a terminal itself, which it's not. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps in the given grammar, each production either has two non-terminals on the RHS or a single terminal symbol."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CNF grammar has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side has at most two non-terminals. Each production's right side can also consist of a single terminal, which is a leaf in the parse tree. Since this grammar is given in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo the start symbol S directly produces a combination of two non-terminals, NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77. The string we're given consists of a series of terminals, so the first step is to parse this string by breaking it down according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by trying to match the string. The string is:\n\nt28 t5 t48 t35 t38 t5 t48 t5 t15 t38 t31 t34 t23 t28 t35 t28\n\nI'll try to segment this into parts that match the productions. I'll start from the beginning.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t28, t5, t48, etc.\n\nThe first production from S is S \u2192 NT82 NT22. I need to see if the string can be derived from this.\n\nSo, NT82 and NT22 should each be expanded into sequences of terminals. Let's see what the productions for NT82 and NT22 are.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT22 NT97\nWait, no, let me check again. The grammar has:\nNT82 -> t29? Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, NT82 is a non-terminal, and its production is given as NT82 -> t29. Is that correct? Wait, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nYes, the grammar has:\n\nNT82 -> t29\n\nSo NT82 is a terminal 't82'? Or wait, maybe I got the numbers wrong. Wait, in the grammar, are the terminals 't1', 't2', etc., or 't28', 't5', etc.?\n\nWait, in the string, the first term is 't28', which corresponds to NT82 in one production. Wait, the NT82 in the grammar has a production NT82 -> t29, which is a terminal. But in the string, we have t28 as the first term.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if NT82 can produce 't28' as a terminal somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, the first entry after NT36 is \"NT36 -> NT18 NT77\". Then, looking further, I see:\n\nNT82 -> t29: Wait, no, in the grammar, is NT82 a non-terminal or a terminal? Because some entries in the grammar seem to have 't' followed by numbers, like t28, t5, etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the right-hand sides can be either two non-terminals or a single terminal (since it's CNF). So if I see entries like NT82 -> t29, that means NT82 produces the terminal 't29'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t28, which is different from t29. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, here are some productions:\n\n- NT82 -> \"t82\"? Or is it 't28'?\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me write down all the grammar productions for better clarity:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n3. NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n4. NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n5. NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n6.

Looking at the grammar, is there a non-terminal that can produce 't28'? Let me check all the 't' productions:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 't34'\n- NT18 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't6', 't10' \u2013 wait, under NT0, we have two productions: NT0 \u2192 't6' and NT0 \u2192 't10'? Or is NT0 the same as in the second S production? Hmm, no, looking at the grammar, NT0 has two productions? Wait no, looking again, no, actually each non-terminal can only have one production per line. Wait in the grammar:\n\nLooking back, the lines after NT15 are:\n\n19. NT98 \u2192 't5'\n20.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal or terminal on the right. That makes things a bit easier because I can parse the string using a top-down approach, expanding the start symbol step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, and there are two initial productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nI need to see which one of these can be used to derive the given string. The string is `t5 t39 t17 t15 t23 t40 t40 t9 t34 t38 t49 t6 t39 t12 t5 t23`.\n\nHmm, the string starts with 't5', 't39', etc. I notice that the first symbol in the string is 't5'. I should check the right-hand sides of the initial productions to see if any of them can lead to 't5'.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT82 NT22, the next symbols after S are NT82 and NT22. So, both NT82 and NT22 need to expand into terminals. Let me check what NT82 and NT22 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar rules, let's go through NT82. The rule for NT82 is: NT82 \u2192 t29. So, the first symbol in the string is 't5', but according to the grammar, NT82 can only produce 't29', not 't5'. So, the first production S \u2192 NT82 NT22 might not be the way to go.\n\nThe other initial production is S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So, let's see what NT40 and NT77 produce. NT40 first: looking at the rules, NT40 can produce multiple things. Let's check: NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, NT15 NT71, NT48 NT35, etc. Wait, this is a bit complicated because NT40 has multiple productions. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for which symbols in the string correspond to the right-hand sides of the grammar rules. For example, if the string starts with 't5', which symbols can produce 't5'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NT40 production has a rule where NT40 \u2192 't10' via NT94 -> 't0' and NT94's other rule, but wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me check individual symbols.\n\nI see NT98 \u2192 't34', which might be relevant for 't34' in the string. Also, NT12 \u2192 't12', which could be useful for later in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building a parse tree starting from S and see if I can reach the given string.\n\nStarting with S, the first step from S can only be either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Since the string starts with 't5', let's see which of these can lead to 't5' at some point.\n\nLooking again, NT40 has a production NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0. NT97 is 't48' and NT0 is 't6'. But that doesn't help us get 't5'. Another production for NT82 is 't29', which isn't 't5'. So, neither S production can directly produce 't5' as the first symbol. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the string can be derived as a sequence of these NT productions leading to t5. Let's try to break it down.\n\nLet's assume we take S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Now, NT40 can produce multiple things, including NT97 NT0, which would produce 't48' and 't6'. But in the string, the first symbol is 't5', so that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've made a mistake in checking. Let me check each step carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the possible first symbols from each production:\n\nFrom S \u2192 NT82 NT22: NT82 can only produce 't29', so the first symbol would be 't29', which doesn't match the string's 't5', so this production can be discarded.\n\nFrom S \u2192 NT40 NT77: Now, let's see what NT40 and NT77 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT40, the rules are:\n\n1. NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n2. NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n3. NT40 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n4. NT40 \u2192 NT98 -> 't5', so wait, is that correct? Let me see: NT40 has a production NT40 \u2192 NT98, right? Or is it NT40 \u2192 NT98 NT...?\n\nWait, looking at the initial grammar:\n\nHere's the part for NT40:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> NT48 NT35\nNT40 -> NT98 -> 't5'? Wait, perhaps I'm confused.\n\nWait, the rules list for NT40 includes:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT98 -> 't5'?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the production for NT40 includes several options. Let me parse the grammar as provided:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nStarting with S, then in NT40:\n\nLooking for NT40, in the grammar, there's NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71, NT40 \u2192 NT48 NT35, and also NT40 \u2192 NT98, but that can't be right because NT98 is a non-terminal, so perhaps it's NT40 \u2192 NT98 NT..., but I don't see that in the given list.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the rules step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar given, starting from the S rule, and then NT rules.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT82 -> t29\n\n- NT71 -> t36\n\n- NT71 -> t5\n\nWait, some NTS produce multiple things, like NT71 has two productions: NT71 \u2192 t36 and NT71 \u2192 t5.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier because NT71 has two outcomes. So, if S \u2192 NT82 NT22, producing 't29' and whatever NT22 produces. But in the string, the first symbol is 't5', so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, for S \u2192 NT40 NT77, let's see:\n\nNT40 can produce a 't5' if there's a production that leads to that. Wait, looking back, perhaps I misread. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT40 appears in some rules:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT... hmm, perhaps I'm missing a production where NT40 directly produces a terminal. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see a production where NT40 directly produces a terminal, except perhaps in some cases where another terminal is produced. Wait, perhaps there's a production where NT40 combines with another NT, like NT40 \u2192 ... But I might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any production where a terminal is involved and see if it's present in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t5, t39, t17, t15, t23, t40, t40, t9, t34, t38, t49, t6, t39, t12, t5, t23.\n\nI see 't5' appears twice, 't15' once, 't23' once, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTS produce these terminals:\n\nNT94 \u2192 t0, t5\n\nNT71 \u2192 t36, t5\n\nNT12 \u2192 t12\n\nNT48 \u2192 t15\n\nNT3 \u2192 t5\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- t5 can come from NT94 or NT71.\n\n- t15 comes from NT48.\n\n- t12 comes from NT12.\n\n- t0 comes from NT94.\n\n- t36 comes from NT71.\n\nHmm.

It looks like each non-terminal (like S, NT15, NT3, etc.) is rewritten into either two terminals or two non-terminals, which fits Chomsky normal form.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT82 NT22. So the string generated by S must be a concatenation of the strings produced by NT82 and NT22.\n\nLooking at NT82 and NT22 in the grammar:\n\n- NT82 -> t29 (from the rules: NT82 -> t29) because in the production rules, NT82 is a terminal. Wait, no. Wait, looking again: NT82's production is not directly a terminal, wait, no, actually, in the rules, I see NT82 -> t29, so yes, it's a terminal. Similarly, NT22 has multiple productions: NT22 -> t23, but also other rules. Wait, let's check all NT22 rules:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\nNT22 -> NT68 NT97\nNT22 -> t23\nNT22 -> NT97 is a production, no, wait, looking again: The initial grammar has S -> NT82 NT22, and the NT's in the grammar are multiple, each with their own rules. For example, NT22 has NT22 -> t23, which is a terminal, but also other rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the non-terminals include all the NT's, and each has possible productions to other non-terminals or to terminals.\n\nWait, the initial grammar is given as a series of lines each stating a production. So, for example, S -> NT82 NT22, which is one production for S. So S can be replaced by NT82 followed by NT22. \n\nThen, each NT has its own productions.\n\nSo, for example, NT36 has two productions: NT36 -> NT18 NT77 and NT36 -> NT35.

Let me count the tokens: 17 tokens. \n\nSince S is the start symbol, the string generated by S must be the concatenation of S's leftmost symbols, which are based on S's productions.\n\nLooking back at S's productions:\n\nS can produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nSo the generated string must be either (NT82's expansion followed by NT22's expansion) or (NT40's expansion followed by NT77's expansion) concatenated together, and so on until the entire string.\n\nLet me check both possibilities.\n\n\nFirst, let's consider the production S -> NT82 NT22:\n\n- NT82 -> t29 (from rule NT82 -> t29)\n- NT22 has multiple production rules.

NT82:\n   NT82 \u2192 t29\n   (From line 23: NT82 -> t29)\n   Then, I see in rule for NT72 (line 6): NT72 -> NT82 NT35, so NT82 is involved here, but not as a terminal.\n\nWait, so only line 23 for NT82 produces t29.

{"custom_id":"request-317","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol, which can sometimes have just a single non-terminal. But here, the start symbol is S, and the productions for S go to combinations of NT and numbers. Wait, no, looking closer, the non-terminals seem to have 'NT' prefixes, and then numbers. For example, S -> NT82 NT22. Then, NT36 -> NT18 NT77 and so on. So the non-terminals are labeled as NTXX, where XX is a number.\n\nWait, the string we're checking is a sequence of tokens like t17, t40, etc. So these must be the terminal symbols, right? Because in a typical CFG, terminals are the leaves, and non-terminals are internal nodes in the parse tree.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the given string can be parsed using the grammar. Each step of the parsing would involve replacing a non-terminal with a sequence of other non-terminals and terminals according to the production rules.\n\nThe string is: t17 t40 t23 t21 t0 t17 t21 t38 t0 t15 t40 t34 t48 t6 t31 t38 t33.\n\nThat's 17 tokens. Let's count them. Wait, no, 17 tokens? Wait, the string is written as a series of individual t tokens separated by spaces. Let me count them: t17, t40, t23, t21, t0, t17, t21, t38, t0, t15, t40, t34, t48, t6, t31, t38, t33. That's 17 tokens.\n\nSince the grammar uses CNF, every production (except maybe S) is of the form A -> BC. The start symbol S can produce sequences like NT82 NT22, which then need to be expanded further.\n\nSo, to parse the string, we'll build a parse tree starting from S, breaking it down into the sequence of tokens.\n\nBut doing a full parse manually might be time-consuming. Another approach is to see if each token in the string can be generated directly by a production rule, or if they require intermediate steps.\n\nLet's list the tokens and see if they can be generated by the non-terminals:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nThen, NT82 -> t29 (but wait, the given rule is NT82 -> t29? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT82 -> t29 (Yes, from the list: NT82 -> t29)\n\nWait, wait. No, actually, looking again, some non-terminals are directly assigned to terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't31', which I think is t31 with a dot? Or is it t31 with no dot? In the list, the rules are written as NT36 -> NT18 NT77, etc., and for some, it's like 't31'. So, I think the 't...' are terminals, and the NT... are non-terminals that need to be broken down further.\n\nSo, each time we encounter a terminal token like t17, t40, etc., that should be matched by a production of a non-terminal that can produce that terminal, or more likely, a production that has that terminal as part of its right-hand side.\n\nWait, for example, let's look at NT77. The production for NT77 is NT40 NT98. So NT77 can be expanded into NT40 and NT98.\n\nLooking back at the string, the first token is t17. So, we need to see if any production of a non-terminal can directly produce t17. Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see a production where a NT... directly expands to t17. For example, checking the list:\n\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n- NT58 -> NT58 NT9 (from NT58 -> NT58 NT9? Wait, in the list, it's NT58 -> NT58 NT9.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminals and check which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking again at the given productions, some are terminals:\n\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't40'\n- NT91 -> 't38'\n- NT95 -> 't10'\n- NT74 -> 't17'\n- NT48 -> 't15'\n- NT68 -> 't5'\n- NT35 -> 't29'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT94 -> 't0'\n- NT72 -> 't8'\n- NT40 -> 't28'\n- NT9 -> 't40'\n- NT18 -> 't9'\n- NT91 -> 't38'\n- NT95 -> 't10'\n- NT77 -> 't15'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT82 -> 't34'\n- NT48 -> 't21'\n- NT74 -> 't17'\n- NT58 -> 't17'\n\nWait, let me list each terminal and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nt17 can be produced by NT77 and NT74, because their productions have 't17' as part of their rules.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT77 -> NT40 NT98\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n- NT58 -> NT58 NT9\n\nWait, that's all. But NT77 and NT74 don't directly produce t17, they produce other non-terminals and then those can be broken down.\n\nHmm, perhaps t17 is produced by NT58 -> t17? Let me check. Looking at the rules:\n\nWait, in NT58's productions: NT58 -> NT58 NT9. So that doesn't help. Unless there's another rule for NT58. Wait, looking again.\n\nWait, the list has:\n\n- NT58 -> NT58 NT9\n- NT15 -> 't49' (Wait, but 't49' is one of the tokens? No, looking at the string again, none of the tokens are t49. The string only includes t17, t40, t23, t21, t0, t17, t21, t38, t0, t15, t40, t34, t48, t6, t31, t38, t33.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the string again. The string given is: t17 t40 t23 t21 t0 t17 t21 t38 t0 t15 t40 t34 t48 t6 t31 t38 t33.\n\nNo t49 in the string. So perhaps t17 can only be produced by another non-terminal. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at NT72: NT72 -> t8. So that's another terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building a derivation tree in reverse. Starting from the rightmost token and seeing if it's possible to backtrack.\n\nWait, but that might not work. Maybe a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm, but since the string is long and the grammar is a bit complex, it's a bit difficult.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the given string and see if each token can be produced by some non-terminal path.\n\nFor example, the string starts with t17. To produce t17, which non-terminals can do that?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT77 -> NT40 NT98\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n- NT58 -> NT58 NT9\n\nSo, NT77 and NT74 both can derive into t17? Wait, no.

It's a sequence of terminal symbols, and I need to see if this can be derived starting from S. Since this is a concatenation of strings, each part of the string should correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the symbols are a mix of NT (non-terminals) and t (terminals).

Let me start by understanding the structure of both the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several production rules where the non-terminals (like S, NT36, NT22, etc.) are expanded into other non-terminals or terminals. The start symbol is S, and each production rule is of the form A -> BC, which is characteristic of Chomsky Normal Form. Each rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminals which are the leaves.\n\nLooking at the initial rules, S has two options:\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, the string we're evaluating must start with either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Let's check the string. The first token is t31, so I need to see which production of NT36 would produce t31. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals are terminals. Specifically, looking for the rules:\n\nNT12 -> 't31'\nSo, if the string starts with t31, that must come from NT12.\n\nWait, but S starts with NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the initial part of the string after S should be a concatenation of two non-terminals or terminals. But the first token in the string is t31, which is a terminal. So that suggests that the first rule used is S -> NT12, but looking at the grammar, I see that there's no S -> NT12 rule. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string is a sequence of production steps starting from S, so I should trace how the string can be derived step by step from the start symbol.\n\nBut in CFGs, a string is the result of applying the production rules until all symbols are terminals. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals, but for it to be a string, the non-terminals must eventually expand into terminals.\n\nSo the initial two symbols from S must be two non-terminals, which then expand into the string. Let me see. The string starts with t31, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce terminals?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT12 -> 't31'\n- NT22 -> 't23'\n- NT36 -> 't35'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT82 -> 't29'\n- NT71 -> 't36'\n- NT48 -> 't15'\n- NT74 -> 't17'\n- NT58 -> 't17'\n- NT94 -> 't0'\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT18 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT15 -> 't49'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT40 -> 't28' (Wait, same NT40 has two rules here?)\nWait, no, NT40 has multiple production rules:\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- NT40 -> NT39 (terminal?)

{"custom_id":"request-350","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t5 t10 t31 t39 t49 t35 t6 t21 t36 t29 t36 t6 t15 t33 t39 t49 t12 t12 t40\" and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of the grammar, I notice that S starts by breaking down into two NTs, each of which eventually leads to terminal symbols (those with 't' or numbers at the end). So, the string must be broken down into a series of these terminals, following the production rules.\n\nThe string has 20 tokens. Since each production either is a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals, the total number of non-terminals in the parse tree will be such that the number of terminals is related by the formula: number of terminals = (number of non-terminals) \u00d7 average branching factor. But in CNF, each production has either one terminal or two non-terminals. So, the number of non-terminals should be roughly half of the terminals. However, in this case, the string has 20 terminals. Let me count how many NTTs are available in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal (like S, NT36, NT22, etc.) eventually leads to terminals. So I can start by checking if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol S through these productions.\n\nThe start symbol S can go to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Let's see which part of the string can be derived from either of these.\n\nIf I take S -> NT82 NT22, then the string must start with NT82 and NT22. Checking the string:\n\nt5 t10 t31 t39 t49 t35 t6 t21 t36 t29 t36 t6 t15 t33 t39 t49 t12 t12 t40\n\nFirst token is t5. Looking at NT82 productions: NT82 can only go to 't29' according to the grammar. But the first token is t5, which doesn't match t29. Also, S's other option is NT40 NT77. So the first two tokens must be NT40 and NT77.\n\nWait, no, NT82 and NT22 are the two parts. So the start is NT82 followed by NT22. So each of these must generate a substring of terminals.\n\nLet me check NT82: According to the grammar, NT82 goes to 't29' directly. So the first token should be t29. But the first token is t5. That doesn't match. So let me check if NT82 can be split into two non-terminals. No, because NT82 -> t29 is a terminal production. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other productions, maybe NT36 -> NT18 NT77 would give a sub-derivation, but I need to see if that fits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built starting with T40 and T77. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the second token, t10. Let's see where t10 comes from. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce 't10'. Looking through the productions:\n\nLooking at NT94: NT94 -> NT9 NT12; NT9 is a terminal? Wait, NT9 is in the grammar as NT9 -> 't40', yes, so NT9 is 't40'. NT12 is in the grammar: NT12 -> 't31' and also NT12 -> 't12'. So 't12' can come from NT12.\n\nBut wait, looking for 't10', it's not directly a terminal, but let me check if any NTs produce t10.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT0 -> 't10' \u2014 yes, so if a NT0 is present, it can produce t10.\n\nSo let's check if 't10' can come from NT0, which then would require NT0 being present in the derivation.\n\nSo now, assuming the string starts with NT40 -> 't40' followed by NT77.\n\nWait, S -> NT40 NT77, so the first two tokens should be t40 and t77. But the first token is t5, which doesn't match t40, unless NT40 somehow starts with t5, but looking at NT40 productions: NT40 can go to multiple options:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> NT48 NT35\nNT40 -> NT28 (which is NT28 -> 't28'), but I don't think we have that.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, looking for NT40:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> NT48 NT35\nNT40 -> NT28 (I think not, as in the list, I don't see NT40 -> NT28.

{"custom_id":"request-352","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, right? The string given is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like `t29 t29 t6 t31...` and so on. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Each production rule takes a symbol and breaks it down into two symbols. The start symbol is S, which immediately splits into NT82 NT22. So, the initial parse will have to start from S.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t29`, which might correspond to NT82 or NT48 since in the rules, NT82 -> t29 and NT48 -> t15. Wait, actually, from the rules, NT82 and NT35 both go to t29. So possibly S is NT82, leading to t29, and then we have another element.\n\nWait, the first token is t29, so that would be from one of the first productions: S -> NT82 NT22. So NT82 is t29, then NT22 needs to generate the next part of the string. But let's check the string. After t29, it's t29, t6, t31, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string as a sequence of t's and numbers, so it's a series of symbols. Each symbol in the string must come from a production in the grammar. Starting from S, which is NT82 NT22. So that would generate two symbols: first part t29 and then the rest would follow as per the split.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t29, which would be NT82, as nt82 -> t29. Then, the next symbol is t29 again, which could be either NT48 or NT35, but wait, looking at the grammar, the first symbol after NT82 is NT22, so the string after NT82 is NT22, which then needs to split into the remaining part.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nThe string is: t29, t29, t6, t31, t49, t8, t10, t28, t0, t29, t34, t35, t36, t38, t35, t34, t35, t39, t21.\n\nSo, length 19. Hmm.\n\nStarting with S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nSo the first token is t29. From the grammar, NT82 can produce t29. That's correct, so the first step is S => NT82 NT22 => t29 NT22.\n\nNow, the next part is NT22. Looking at the grammar rules for NT22, there are multiple options: NT22 can be 't23', but more importantly, in the rules, NT22 has several production options. For example, NT22 -> NT71 NT48. So maybe NT22 can split into two parts, which would contribute to the next tokens.\n\nLooking at the string, after t29, the next tokens are t29, t6, t31. So the second part is NT22, which is generating multiple parts. Let me see:\n\nOption 1: NT22 -> 't23', but that's likely not the case here because the second token is t29, which isn't directly producing t6. So probably not.\n\nOption 2: NT22 can split into NT71 and NT48. Then, we have to look at the remaining string: t29, t6, t31, etc. So from NT22 being split into NT71 and NT48, how does that help?\n\nLooking at the next tokens, after t29, we have t29 again. So that would beNT71 splitting into something. Wait, NT71's production is 't36' and also 't5', as per the rules. So NT71 can produce t36 or t5. Let me check: in the string, after the first t29, it's t29 again, then t6. So perhaps NT71 is 't36'? Wait, t36 is produced by NT71. But how does that lead to t6?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's map each step.\n\n1. S => NT82 NT22 \u2192 t29 and NT22\n2. Now, we process NT22. Looking at the string, after t29, the next is t29, so NT22 must produce t29 as one of its parts. Looking at the rules for NT22, the production NT22 -> 't23' doesn't produce t29, so the other options involve splitting NT22 into two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n\nSo, that splits NT22 into NT71 and NT48. Now, each of these can further split.\n\nSo, the first part after t29 is NT71, and then the next is NT48. So, let's process that.\n\nFirst, NT71 can generate 't36' or 't5'. Let's see: after t29, the next token is t29. So if NT71 is 't36', but the next symbol is t29, that doesn't match. Alternatively, if NT71 is 't5', but that doesn't give us t29. So perhaps I'm going wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Since NT22 is producing two parts, the second part starts right after NT82's t29, so after t29, the next symbol is t29, which would be the expansion of NT22's part. But if NT22 is splitting into NT71 and NT48, then each of those needs to produce t29.\n\nWait, but NT71 can't produce t29; according to the rules, NT71 produces 't36' or 't5'. Similarly, NT48 can produce 't15' or 't19' (from NT48's rules). Let's check the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT72: NT72 -> 't8' and also NT40. So if NT48 is involved, it can produce t15 or t19, but I don't see t19 in the string. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider the entire string again. It's 19 tokens. Let's count the symbols after the initial t29 from S's NT82.\n\nSo, after t29 (from NT82), the tokens are: t29, t6, t31, t49, t8, t10, t28, t0, t29, t34, t35, t36, t38, t35, t34, t35, t39, t21.\n\nWait, that's 18 symbols. So the NT22 should produce these 18 symbols through its splits.\n\nSo, breaking down NT22, which is 't22' in the rule, but the string has to be split into two parts for each NT22.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to use a parsing strategy, like the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is quite large, that might take some time.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS => NT82 NT22 \u2192 [t29, NT22]\n\nNow, process NT22. The first part of NT22 is split as per its productions. NT22 can be split into different production rules, so let's see which one fits the next tokens.\n\nThe next token is t29. So, in NT22, we need a production that can start with t29. From the grammar, let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT22:\n\n- NT22 -> 't23' \u2192 that's one possibility, but the next token is t29, not t23.\n- NT22 also has rules like NT72 -> 't8' and possibly others.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of NT22 as producing the next tokens in the string by splitting into multiple symbols. So, the first symbol after t29 is t29, so perhaps NT22 can produce t29, which would require that NT22 has a production that directly gives t29. Looking at the rules, NT82 is the only one that can produce t29, but NT22 doesn't have a production that directly gives t29.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the first token after t29 from NT22 is t29, but NT22 doesn't have a production that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is quite long, so I need to approach it methodically. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what context-free grammars (CFGs) are. CFGs consist of a start symbol, a set of non-terminal symbols, a set of terminal symbols, and production rules. Since the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S. I see that S can produce NT82 NT22 and NT40 NT77. So the initial step would be to apply one of these productions. This means the string starts with either \"t29 t22\" or \"t40 t77\". \n\nThe input string is: t6 t17 t12 t23 t39 t23 t10 t31 t10 t34 t8 t33 t38 t12 t21 t12 t5 t9 t38 t48. \n\nI'll write down the string as a list for easier handling:\n\n1. t6\n2. t17\n3. t12\n4. t23\n5. t39\n6. t23\n7. t10\n8. t31\n9. t10\n10. t34\n11. t8\n12. t33\n13. t38\n14. t12\n15. t21\n16. t12\n17. t5\n18. t9\n19. t38\n20. t48\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar's productions. I think the best way is to use a bottom-up approach, starting from the string and trying to reduce it using the grammar's productions.\n\nBut before that, I'll list out all the productions and see how they can generate terminals. \n\nLet's see the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22 | NT40 NT77  \nNT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94 | NT9 | NT4  \nNT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74 | 't31'  \nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48 | 't23' | 't12'  \nNT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77 | 't35' | 't33'  \nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 | NT15 NT71 | NT9 | NT48 | NT3 \u2192 Wait, that can't be right, let me check the original grammar. \n\nWait, in the original grammar:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0  \nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71  \nNT40 \u2192 NT48 NT74  \nNT40 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 Not sure. Wait, looking back, I think there are multiple rules for NT40. Let me list them:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0  \nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71  \nNT40 \u2192 NT9 NT12  \nWait, actually, looking at the original grammar:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0  \nNT40 -> NT15 NT71  \nNT40 -> NT48 NT74  \nNT40 -> NT9 \u2192 Not sure, but looking back, I think the fourth line under NT40 is NT40 -> NT3 \u2192 But that doesn't make sense because NT3 is a non-terminal, but the production should be something else. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, maybe it's another terminal. Wait, let me check the original grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back: in the original grammar provided, under NT40, the productions are:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0  \nNT40 -> NT15 NT71  \nNT40 -> NT9 NT12  \nNT40 -> t49  \n\nWait, no, perhaps the last line was a typo, or perhaps it's NT40 -> something else. Wait, looking more carefully:\n\nIn the original grammar:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0  \nNT40 -> NT15 NT71  \nNT40 -> NT48 NT74  \nNT40 -> NT9 \u2192 But NT9 is another non-terminal. Wait, maybe the last rule is NT40 -> t49. Wait, checking the original grammar again, perhaps the last rule is missing. Wait, in the original problem, under NT40 there are four entries:\n\n1. NT40 -> NT97 NT0  \n2. NT40 -> NT15 NT71  \n3. NT40 -> NT9 NT12  \n4. NT40 -> t49  \n\nYes, so the productions for NT40 are:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0  \nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71  \nNT40 \u2192 NT9 NT12  \nNT40 \u2192 t49  \n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals have their own productions. \n\nNow, the string starts with t6. Looking for productions that start with t6. Checking the rules:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT82 \u2192 t29, NT36 \u2192 t33, etc. Wait, but t6 is a terminal. So, looking for non-terminals that produce t6.\n\nIn the original grammar, I see NT35 \u2192 t29, but that's not relevant. Wait, looking through all the terminals:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that when expanded results in t6. Checking:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t40  \n- NT40 \u2192 t49  \n- NT82 \u2192 t29  \n- NT71 \u2192 t36  \n- NT77 \u2192 t15  \n- NT0 \u2192 t6  \nSo, NT0 \u2192 t6. That means, to produce t6, we need NT0. \n\nSo, in the string, the first element is t6. So, in our reduction, we need to have a production that uses t6, which comes from NT0 \u2192 t6. So, that would mean that in the derivation, at some point, we must have NT0 generating t6. \n\nSo, for the string to be generated, one of the factors (since the grammar seems to generate two non-terminals at each step) must be NT0. Let's see the first two elements: t6 and t17.\n\nWait, actually, initial step: S can produce two non-terminals. So, the string is a sequence of two non-terminals (since each production of S produces two non-terminals, each possibly expanded into a terminal or more non-terminals). So, the string is a sequence like A B, where A and B are the results of expanding the two non-terminals from S.\n\nBut in the string provided, it's 20 elements, which is even? Wait, 20 is even, so perhaps each production adds two terminals. But wait, let me count: the string has 20 elements. Each production of S (S \u2192 NT..) leads to two non-terminals, each of which can be expanded into more non-terminals or terminals. The total number of terminals would be the sum of the terminals in their expansions. \n\nBut in this case, the string length is 20. So, the grammar may require that each step produces an even number of terminals. Wait, but in CFGs, the derivation can produce any number of terminals, but the initial step S has two non-terminals, and each subsequent step applies productions to non-terminals, which can lead to varying numbers of terminals.\n\nSo, the string's length (20) could be accommodated as long as the reduction steps can generate it. \n\nBut perhaps starting a bottom-up approach might help. Let's try to start at the end of the string and try to reduce it to S.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to see if each part can be matched by the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the string is a concatenation of two non-terminals, each of which is generated by S's productions. So, the entire string can be split into pairs, and each pair can be checked against the productions of S. \n\nWait, that's a bit abstract. Another approach is to see the structure of the string.\n\nWait, let me list all the elements:\n\nt6, t17, t12, t23, t39, t23, t10, t31, t10, t34, t8, t33, t38, t12, t21, t12, t5, t9, t38, t48.\n\nI see t6 at position 1 and t48 at the end. So, perhaps t6 is NT0, and t48 is another non-terminal. Let me see where t48 comes from.\n\nLooking at the terminals, some non-terminals produce t48.\n\nFrom the grammar, for example, NT71 \u2192 t36, NT77 \u2192 t15, etc. Wait, looking at NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-365","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem in front of me. It involves determining whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know. A context-free grammar has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is a sequence of terminal and\/or non-terminal symbols. Since this grammar is in CNF, each production rule must produce either two non-terminals or one terminal symbol. That's important because it affects how the grammar can generate strings.\n\nThe given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT82 NT22, and so on. Some of these non-terminals have arrows pointing to other non-terminals, while others directly point to terminal symbols, which are the t's followed by numbers. The string to evaluate is \"t9 t39 t17 t10 t0 t21 t6 t17 t28 t40 t23 t49 t23 t23 t0 t39 t15 t0 t17 t48.\" It looks like each part is separated by a space, but I think each 't' followed by a number is a single token, so each 'tX' is one symbol in the string.\n\nMy task is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding according to the given grammar. One approach is to construct a derivation or use the parsing methods suitable for CNF grammars, like the CYK algorithm. But since the string length is 20, it might be a bit tedious to do it manually, but let's try to see if we can find any patterns or key points.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it first expands to NT82 NT22. So any string generated by this grammar must start with the combination of these two symbols. Let's see the first two tokens in the string: t9 and t39. Wait, but according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, which would correspond to t82 and t22. But in the string, the first two are t9 and t39. That doesn't match NT82 or NT22. Hmm, that suggests that either the string doesn't start with the correct expansion or perhaps the starting symbol isn't being used correctly.\n\nWait, no, S is the start symbol, so the very first production would have to generate the initial sequence. So if S expands to NT82 and NT22, then the string must start with t82 and t22. But the string starts with t9 and t39, which don't match. So that would mean the string cannot start with these symbols, right? Unless I'm misunderstanding how the expansions work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol's expansion is different. Looking again at the grammar, S also has another production: S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So S could expand to either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. The string starts with t9, which isn't t82 or t40, so either S is not being used as the start, or maybe it's not the right path.\n\nWait, the context-free grammar works by deriving strings, so each expansion starts from the start symbol and goes down, replacing non-terminals until only terminals remain. If S can be expanded into NT82 NT22, then any string would have to be built from these. But the first two tokens don't match, so perhaps the string doesn't start from S.\n\nWait no, S is the start symbol, so any derivation must start from S. Therefore, the string must be a direct derivation from S. If S cannot directly produce the string's starting symbols, then the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nBut let me check again. The initial productions for S are S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. The first part is both non-terminals. So the first step in the derivation would replace S with either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Neither of these involve t9 or t39, which are the first two symbols of the string. Therefore, the string cannot be derived from S because the first two tokens don't match any possible expansion of S.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's another way. Maybe the non-terminals can expand further, and through some chain of productions, the starting non-terminals could produce the initial ts. But considering the structure, each non-terminal either expands to another non-terminal or a terminal. Let me look at the productions for the non-terminals that might be involved.\n\nLooking at NT77: NT77 \u2192 NT48 NT98. NT48 \u2192 NT82 NT3, which would then expand to t82 and t3. Similarly, NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3, which would give NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, and so on. But this seems complicated. The initial derivation is always going to produce t's that are derived from the initial S's non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the initial problem is that S never directly expands to t9 or t39. So perhaps the string cannot be generated because it's unable to start with t9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows for some non-terminals that eventually produce t9 and t39 through a series of steps. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT97: NT97 \u2192 t48, and NT48: NT48 \u2192 NT82 NT3 or NT36 NT3.\n\nSo NT82 is a non-terminal that ultimately can produce t82 through NT82 \u2192 NT18 NT77, then NT18 \u2192 NT9 NT19 (wait, no, in the grammar, NT18 \u2192 't33'), so NT18 is directly 't33'. So NT82 \u2192 NT18 NT77, which would be t33 NT77.\n\nBut NT77 is NT48 NT98, as per NT77 \u2192 NT48 NT98.\n\nThen NT48 can be 't82' and 't3' (from NT48 \u2192 NT82 NT3), or 't36' and 't3' (from NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3). \n\nWait, but in the string, the first t is t9. Let's see if any non-terminals can produce t9. Let's look through the grammar.\n\nLooking for NT that have \u2192 leading to t9.\n\nI see NT9 \u2192 't40', NT18 \u2192 't33', NT91 \u2192 't38', NT95 \u2192 't10', NT71 \u2192 't36' and others.\n\nHmm, is there any non-terminal that produces t9? Let me check. The grammar seems to have several non-terminals that produce terminals, but I don't see one that directly or indirectly is leading to t9.\n\nWait, perhaps through multiple steps. Let's say NT97 \u2192 NT48 NT95, from NT97 \u2192 NT48 NT95, and NT48 can expand to NT82 NT3, which is t82 and t3, or to NT36 NT3, which is t36 and t3. None of these give t9.\n\nAnother path: NT91 \u2192 NT38, but NT38 is another non-terminal. Wait, does NT91 lead to t38? Let me recheck: NT91 \u2192 't38' directly, I think. Let me look.\n\nLooking back, yes, NT91 \u2192 't38' (from NT95\u2019s expansion?), wait, no: looking at the grammar, I don\u2019t see NT91 as a production that leads directly to a terminal. Let me see:\n\nNT91: \"NT91 -> 't38'\" yes, correct.\n\nSo NT91 \u2192 t38. But does any non-terminal point to NT91? Let me check.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that expand to NT91. Let's see: for example, there might be NT94 \u2192 't9' (from NT74\u2019s expansion?

{"custom_id":"request-379","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars. Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol can't be on the right side of a production. Looking at the grammar given, I see it's in CNF because all the rules start with a non-terminal on the left and either produce two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t12 t49 t6 t23 t17 t9 t9 t17 t38 t39 t6 t49 t9 t33 t31 t15 t15 t48 t48 t15 t49`. \n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse this string from left to right using the grammar. Parsing with a CFG often uses methods like the CYK algorithm, but since the string isn't too long, maybe a recursive approach would work. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps I can use a simple top-down parsing method, like using a stack or a parse table.\n\nBut maybe an easier way is to see if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol 'S' by applying a series of productions. So let me look at the string and see if each part fits into the productions.\n\nLooking at the first token: `t12`. I check the grammar rules for 't12' as the left-hand side. Scanning through the productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t23 or t12. Wait, the rule NT12 is given as 't31', so that would produce t31, not t23 or t12. But looking at the rules, NT12 is 't31', and NT22 can produce 't12' via NT22 -> NT31? Wait, no, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT12 -> 't31'\n- NT22 -> 't12' (that's one rule)\n- NT22 also has other rules, like NT22 -> NT71 NT48, but that seems more complicated. Since the string starts with `t12`, which must be produced directly.\n\nSo the first step is to use NT22 \u2192 't12'. So we have t12, which comes from NT22. Now, looking at how NT22 is derived, the rule is NT22 \u2192 't12', so that's an atomic production. So that's the first token handled via NT22.\n\nNow the next token is `t49`. The string after t12 is t49. So after handling t12 (NT22), the next part of the string is t49. Let me see how t49 can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't49'\n- Other rules for NT48 and NT3, but that's not relevant here. Wait, the rule NT94 can produce 't49' directly. So if I have t49, it must come from NT94. Now, can NT94 be derived from any combination of the rules?\n\nLooking back, the rule for NT94 is: NT94 \u2192 't40', but wait, no. Looking at my grammar, I see NT94 -> NT9 NT17? No, wait, let me check the given grammar.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has:\n\nNot entirely sure, but let's list all the NTs and their rules as provided.

It seems NT77 is on the left side of a production as the second symbol. So in the initial S production, S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So NT77 is a non-terminal, but it's not on the left side of any other production, except for S.\n\nWait, that's impossible. In a CFG, all non-terminals on the left must be on the left of some production. So if NT77 is in a production (as in S \u2192 NT40 NT77 and none else), then it must have a production somewhere else.\n\nLooking again: Are all the rules provided?

{"custom_id":"request-392","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal can be expanded into two other symbols, either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe initial start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminal symbols, either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nThe input string is: `t36 t34 t12 t34 t40 t5 t38 t15 t40 t48 t40 t38 t6 t35 t10 t36 t40 t40 t33 t10 t39 t12`.\n\nLet's split this into individual tokens to process them step by step. The tokens are:\n1. t36\n2. t34\n3. t12\n4. t34\n5. t40\n6. t5\n7. t38\n8. t15\n9. t40\n10. t48\n11. t40\n12. t38\n13. t6\n14. t35\n15. t10\n16. t36\n17. t40\n18. t40\n19. t33\n20. t10\n21. t39\n22. t12\n\nSince the string starts with t36, which is a terminal. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t36. Looking through the productions, terminal terms are on the right side of the rules. Checking the non-terminals:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t29\n- NT71 \u2192 t36\n- NT35 \u2192 t29\n- NT36 \u2192 t35\n- NT18 \u2192 t33\n- NT71 \u2192 t5\n- NT74 \u2192 t17\n- NT58 \u2192 t17\n- Others produce various terminals.\n\nFrom the list, NT71 can produce t36. So, the first production must involve NT71: NT71 \u2192 t36.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is matched by NT71 \u2192 t36.\n\nNow, the second token is t34. Looking at the production for NT71, it can go to t36 or t5. But t34 isn't produced by NT71. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I need to backtrack. Let me look at the grammar again:\n\nLooking for where t34 is produced. Checking the rules:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 NT58 NT35 \u2192 because NT58 \u2192 t17 and NT35 \u2192 t29, but wait, no, the production is NT71 \u2192 NT58 NT35, which are non-terminals. Then, NT58 \u2192 t17 and NT35 \u2192 t29, so NT71 can produce t17 t29, which isn't t34.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all production rules:\n\nLooking through all productions, I see NT48 \u2192 t21, NT74 \u2192 t17, NT3 \u2192 t9, etc.\n\nWait, let's check NT22 productions. NT22 has several rules:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\nNT22 \u2192 NT74 NT48\nNT22 \u2192 't12'\n\nLooking at these, t12 is directly produced by NT22. So, in our token list, after t36 (which is from NT71), the next token is t34. Hmm, perhaps this is part of a longer expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the string is a sequence of the leftmost derivation. Let me think about the initial expansion.\n\nThe string starts with t36, which comes from NT71 \u2192 t36.\n\nNow, the next token is t34. So, after t36, we need to produce t34. Maybe the next non-terminal in the expansion after NT71 is another non-terminal that can derive t34. But in the production rules, I don't see a way for NT71 to produce t34. So perhaps this isn't the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S uses the other production S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nLet's consider that. If S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then the first two symbols would be NT40 and NT77.\n\nBut the string starts with t36, which is a terminal. So if the first non-terminal is NT40, then NT40 can produce t40, but the first token is t36, which doesn't match. Therefore, S must be expanding via S \u2192 NT71 NT22, because that's how we get a terminal first.\n\nWait, no. Let's check the initial productions again:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\nFirst token generated would be the first part of this split: NT82 produces t29, which doesn't match the first token t36.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT40 NT77. The first non-terminal is NT40, which produces t40, but the first token is t36. So that doesn't match either. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the first part is NT71, which produces t36, and the second is NT22, which can produce t12 or other things.\n\nWait, maybe the string is derived from the second production: S \u2192 NT40 NT77. But if that's the case, the first part should produce t40 and the second t77. But the string starts with t36, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nThe initial step is that S can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nSuppose the first production is S \u2192 NT71 NT22, but actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, S's productions are S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSo the first symbol of the string must be either the first terminal produced by NT82 or NT40.\n\nBut the string starts with t36, which is produced by NT71, not NT82 or NT40. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps S can't directly produce t36 because its immediate productions don't start with t36. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at the productions again. S can produce NT71 and NT22 via one production and NT40 and NT77 via another.\n\nBut looking at the production rules, is there a way for S to produce a string starting with NT71?\n\nWait, S can produce NT71 via NT22's production: NT22 \u2192 't12' is not relevant. Wait, let's check S's rules again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. In the given grammar, S is split into two parts:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, to produce any string, S must first produce one of these pairs. So the first two symbols in the string must correspond to one of these pairs.\n\nBut the string starts with t36, which is produced by NT71, so that's not possible because NT82 and NT40 are different. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe S can produce all possible combinations of its children. So, in the derivation, the initial S can produce NT82 NT22, then each of those can be expanded further.\n\nBut the problem is, the string starts with a terminal, so the initial expansion must involve a non-terminal that can produce that terminal.\n\nSo, for example, if S \u2192 NT71 NT22, then NT71 can produce t36 and NT22 can produce t12. So the string would start with t36 t12. But the first token in the string is t36, but then what comes next? t34.\n\nHmm, let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT71 NT22, and then NT71 \u2192 t36, NT22 \u2192 'something else'. But wait, NT22 can also produce t12.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet's consider the string: t36 t34 t12 t34 t40 t5 t38 t15 t40 t48 t40 t38 t6 t35 t10 t36 t40 t40 t33 t10 t39 t12.\n\nWe need to see"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-393","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on CNF, but I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe grammar provided has S as the start symbol. Let me look at the productions:\n\n- S can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n- Then there are a bunch of productions where non-terminals on the left produce other non-terminals or terminal strings. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, etc. Some of them produce actual character strings like t49, t31, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t49 t29 t28 t21 t38 t36 t34 t34 t31 t31 t5 t9 t23 t35 t29 t36 t17 t38 t38 t33 t36 t31`.\n\nWow, that's a long string. It has 21 tokens, which suggests it's a sequence of steps that might involve a lot of non-terminals and terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, each step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one because each production replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe Chomsky Normal Form implies that the parse tree is a binary tree, meaning the number of nodes in the parse tree would be 2^n -1 for some n, where n is the number of terminals. Let me think, the string has 21 terminals. So, n would be such that 2^n -1 is at least 21.\n\n2^4 -1 = 15, 2^5 -1=31. So n=5 would give 31 nodes, which would mean 21 terminals. So the leftmost derivation would have 5 levels, but that's a rough estimate.\n\nBut maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string top-down or bottom-up. Since the grammar is in CNF, a simple bottom-up approach using the CYK algorithm might be feasible, but the grammar is quite large, with many non-terminals, so that could be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to break down the string step by step, checking each part against the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the productions for each non-terminal to see what can generate what:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48 or t23 or t12 or t35, etc.\n\nWait, I need to clarify which non-terminals expand into terminals. Let me try to list the productions that result in terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't23', 't12', 't68', 't97', etc. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n\nWait, but some rules have 'tX' where X is a number. Also, let's list all rules where the RHS is just a terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't29'\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't36'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77 (so no terminal, two non-terminals)\n\n- NT22: some rules go to t23, t12, t35, etc.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n\nNT22 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n\nNT22 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't35'\n\nSimilarly, NT48 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't29'\n\nSo, many of the non-terminals can produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t49. So, let's see which productions can derive t49. Looking at the rules, I see that NT97 \u2192 't40', and NT40 \u2192 't28' and other things. Hmm, but in the rules, there's NT9 \u2192 't40'. Wait, looking:\n\nWait, maybe I need to correct that. Let me look again:\n\nThe rules include:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't40'\n\nAnd then NT40 has several productions:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT82 (*looking to the full list)\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT72\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of rules; let me go through them:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT97 \u2192 't48'\n\nWait, not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to see which non-terminals produce 't49' but looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't49' except maybe NT49? Wait, do I have any NT rules that go to 't49'?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't49'. Unless I missed it.\n\nWait, let's scroll through the rules again:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't31'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't49'\n\nAh! Oh, here we go. NT15 \u2192 't49'. So NT15 can directly produce 't49'. So in the string, the first token is t49, which must come from NT15. So the first step is:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't49'\n\nSo that's good. Now, the string is: t49 t29 t28 t21 ... which after t49, the next is t29, which is the result of some production.\n\nBut NT15 is a non-terminal. So how does NT15 fit into the rest of the derivation? Let me think.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S. So starting from S, the first step in the derivation would expand S into either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nBut in the string, the first two tokens are t49 and t29. If S expands into NT82 NT22, then the first two tokens could correspond to those non-terminals, but S \u2192 NT82 NT22, so NT82 would produce t29 (since NT82 \u2192 't29'), and NT22 would produce t23 or t35 or others. But the string starts with t49, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the string, the first token is t49, which would come from a production of NT15. So perhaps the starting symbol S can't produce t49 because S's productions are to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So wait, hold on. That would mean that if S \u2192 NT15 NTsomething, but looking at the rules, S does not have a production where it produces NT15 as a non-terminal. Looking back at the user's provided grammar, I see that S is produced by NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So S cannot produce NT15 immediately.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t49, which is derived from NT15. So in that case, how can the string start with t49 if S's first step only gives NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. That suggests that NT82 or NT40 must produce some non-terminal that can derive to t49, which is NT15. But looking at the rules, NT82 \u2192 't29', not NT15. So the first token t49 implies that the first step must start with NT15, which is a child of some NT.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me structure this.\n\nThe string starts with t49, which must be derived from NT15. So in the parse tree, the root S must somehow produce NT15 and NTx, but in the grammar, S only produces combinations like NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So S is a non-terminal that must be broken down into NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Therefore, the initial part of the string must be the result of the expansion of S.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction because if S is expanded into NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77, then those non-terminals produce their own productions. So the string starts with t49, which is NT15, but NT15 isn't part of the immediate children of S.\n\nWait, that suggests that perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. This structure is helpful because it allows us to use a recursive descent parsing approach or to apply algorithms like the CYK algorithm for testing membership.\n\nThe grammar starts with the start symbol S. The initial productions from S are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo S can be expanded into a pair of non-terminals. The string we're trying to analyze starts with `t9`, which I assume is part of a non-terminal. Looking at the productions, I need to see which non-terminals can produce `t9`.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t40\n- NT18 \u2192 t33\n- NT91 \u2192 t38\n- NT95 \u2192 t10\n- NT77 \u2192 t15\n\nWait, none of these directly produce t9. Hmm, maybe I missed one. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t48\n- NT40 has multiple rules, e.g., NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, and NT40 \u2192 t28\n- NT15 \u2192 t49\n- NT94 \u2192 t0\n- NT72 \u2192 t8\n- NT40 \u2192 t28\n- NT9 \u2192 t40\n- NT18 \u2192 t33\n- NT91 \u2192 t38\n- NT95 \u2192 t10\n- NT77 \u2192 t15\n\nOh, I see. None of the NT rules directly produce t9. That's a problem because our string starts with `t9`. Since the string begins with `t9`, which isn't produced by any non-terminal in the given grammar, it's impossible for the grammar to generate this string. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Are there any ways that a non-terminal could produce t9 indirectly? Let's see if any non-terminal can produce something that reduces to t9. \n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nIs there a way that NT4 could reduce to t9? Let me trace. From NT97 \u2192 t36 and NT9 \u2192 t40, but t9 doesn't appear anywhere. Alternatively, is there any NT rule that has a t9 in its expansion? Looking through all the options, it seems none have t9 except perhaps NT19 or similar, but they're not listed. I think it's safe to say that there's no way for any non-terminal to produce t9.

{"custom_id":"request-398","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Chomsky Normal Form is useful because it allows for systematic parsing using algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It has several production rules, some of which are to terminals. The string to evaluate is: `t39 t10 t38 t48 t21 t38 t17 t36 t33 t28 t21 t29 t17 t9 t17 t28 t12 t36 t17 t10 t34 t12 t12`. So, the string consists of 22 terminal symbols.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. The CYK algorithm works by filling a table where each cell represents a substring of the input, and for each position, it checks which non-terminals can derive that substring.\n\nLet's outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Identify all the terminals in the grammar**: From the given rules, all the strings ending with 't' except the last rule (perhaps). Wait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\n   NT productions include rules that start with NT and lead to other NTs or a terminal. The terminals used are: t39, t10, t38, t48, t21, t36, t33, t28, t22 via 't23' (Wait, no, the NT rules also have terminals in some places. For example, NT22 -> 't23'.\n\n   Wait, but in the given grammar, for example, some non-terminals like NT36, NT40, etc., have rules that produce a terminal. For instance, NT97 -> 't48', NT98 -> 't5', etc.\n\n   So the string consists of terminals, each being a 't' followed by a number. So all the elements in the string are terminals.\n\n2. **Construct the CYK table**: The CYK table will have 22 positions, each corresponding to a character in the string.\n\nBut manually building a 22x22 table would be quite time-consuming, so perhaps I can look for patterns or see if any production rules can lead directly to parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to match the string by checking if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production rules are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo S starts with either NT82 or NT40. From there, each of these NTs is a non-terminal that can split into other NTs or a terminal.\n\nLet me check if the string starts with 't39'. Looking at the NTs that produce 't39', from the given rules:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't29' (from NT82 -> NT71 NT48)\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nWait the rules are as follows (I need to parse all production rules carefully):\n\nWait, let me list the production rules for each NT.\n\nLooking at the first production: S \u2192 NT82 NT40, etc.\n\nBut to make it manageable, perhaps I should list each NT and see their left-hand sides and production rules, along with whether they can lead to terminals.\n\nBut this approach might not work, so let's think differently.\n\nGiven the string starts with t39. So, in the grammar, is there an NT that can produce t39?\n\nFrom the provided rules, looking for any NT that has a production ending with t39.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT82 \u2192 't29', and possibly further down: NT68 \u2192 't5'; NT35 \u2192 't29'; and looking for NT that can derive t39.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules:\n\nNT40 can produce t28, t39, etc. Specifically:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 (Wait no: checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, for NT40:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe provided rules include:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nNT40 -> 't28'\n\nBut wait, let me double-check:\n\nWait, in the given rules, the NT40 has:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nNT97 -> 't40'\n\nThus, combining NT40 \u2192 NT97 and NT0 \u2192 't6' would make NT40 \u2192 't40 t6' (t40 t6?), but the actual string has 't39 t10', etc.\n\nWait, no, wait: When parsing, each step applies a production, replacing a non-terminal with either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo for example, if we have S \u2192 NT40 NT77, we can consider NT40 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t39. So the first substring to be produced is t39.\n\nBut from the grammar, which non-terminal productions lead to t39?\n\nLooking through the rules, let me see:\n\nLooking for any rule where the right-hand side (RHS) can produce t39. So, any NT that directly produces t39?\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77 ... no.\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48 ... and the 't23' from NT22.\n\nWait, perhaps looking under the non-terminals:\n\nNT: Let's parse each production for each NT.\n\nStart with NT40:\n\nNT40's rules are:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't28'\n\nSo, for NT40 directly, the terminals are t28. So it can produce t28 directly.\n\nLooking for NT that can produce t39.\n\nLooking for where RHS is t39.\n\nWait, the provided rules may not directly have an NT with t39 as a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, the string starts with t39, so maybe some non-terminal can derive t39 via a chain.\n\nLooking further, is there an NT that can produce t39?\n\nFor example, looking at NT97: NT97 \u2192 't40' (since one of the rules is NT97 \u2192 't40'), so if NT97 can produce t40, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but if some NT can produce 't39' via two steps or something?\n\nWait, perhaps looking for NT that can produce something that leads to t39.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of it as a parsing problem.\n\nThe CYK algorithm starts by initializing a table where each cell corresponds to a substring. For each position, we check if there's a non-terminal that can produce that substring by checking all possible pairs of non-terminals in the grammar that produce that substring.\n\nBut instead of filling the entire table, perhaps I can see if the string can be divided into parts that fit the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a way to split the string into left and right parts based on the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt39 t10 t38 t48 t21 t38 t17 t36 t33 t28 t21 t29 t17 t9 t17 t28 t12 t36 t17 t10 t34 t12 t12\n\nLet's see if this starts with t39.\n\nLooking at the grammar, maybe NT40 can produce t39 via a chain.\n\nWait, the first production for S is S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSo if the first part is NT40 and the second is NT77.\n\nFrom NT40, one of its productions is 't28', which is a terminal. But if the first symbol is t39, perhaps NT40 needs to produce t39.\n\nWait, wait a minute: If the string starts with t39, that would mean that the first NT40 must expand into something that starts with t39, but according to the production for NT40, its immediate terminals are 't28', so that's not t39. So perhaps S \u2192 NT40 NT77 can't produce a string starting with t39.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT82 NT22, let's see what NT82 can"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-413","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar has several production rules starting with S. I see that S can produce combinations of NT and number-like tokens, like NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Then, these intermediate non-terminals (NT) like NT36, NT22, etc., each have their own production rules that either split into other NT rules or into actual terminal tokens, like 't23' or 't31'.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t36 t21 t49 t48 t49 t23 t38 t10 t15 t5 t23 t5 t29 t49 t5 t10 t36 t33 t49 t39 t0 t28 t40 t49.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals can only be replaced by other non-terminals or terminals. Each production in the grammar seems to have exactly two parts: for example, S -> NT82 NT22. This suggests that the grammar is in CNF, meaning each production is either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nThe string consists of 24 tokens. Let me count the number of symbols in the grammar. Each production of S produces two tokens, so the starting expansion of S would double the symbols each time. Wait, actually, each production step can replace a non-terminal with two others, leading to a binary expansion.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string from right to left, using the grammar as a way to check if it can be derived.\n\nWait, another method is to simulate a pushdown parser. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree must be a binary tree where each node has exactly two children, which can either be a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to work backward from the string. Starting from the right, see which production could generate that terminal. Then move inward.\n\nLooking at the first token in the string: t36. Let me check what non-terminals can produce t36. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77: so NT36 can become two non-terminals, but not a terminal. So maybe not the first step.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me recount each production.\n\nIn the provided grammar, search for lines starting with NT71:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT71 appears in two lines (copied pasted above):\n\nLine 4: NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n\nLine 5: NT72 -> NT82 NT35\n\nLine 6: NT3 -> NT91 NT94\n\nLine 7: NT12 -> NT48 NT74\n\nLine 8: NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nLine 9: NT94 -> NT9 NT12\n\nLine 10: NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nLine 11: NT48 -> NT36 NT3\n\nLine 12: NT22 -> NT68 NT97\n\nLine 13: NT94 -> NT72 NT95\n\nLine 14: NT12 -> 't31'\n\nLine 15: NT22 -> 't23'\n\nLine 16: NT15 -> 't49'\n\nLine 17: NT97 -> 't48'\n\nLine 18: NT98 -> 't5'\n\nLine 19: NT18 -> 't33'\n\nLine 20: NT3 -> 't5'\n\nLine 21: NT0 -> 't6'\n\nLine 22: NT82 -> 't29'\n\nLine 23: NT71 -> 't36'\n\nLine 24: NT71 -> 't5'\n\nSo, NT71 has two production rules: one produces 't36', another 't5'. That's unusual because typically in CNF, the productions are either A->BC or A->a, where each non-terminal can generate two other non-terminals or a terminal. So having a non-terminal that can produce two separate terminals is acceptable, but it complicates the parsing because you have to account for both possibilities.\n\nNow, looking at our string, the first token is 't36', so that must come from a production that produces 't36'. Looking at the grammar, NT71 can produce 't36' via NT71 -> 't36'. So perhaps the first token comes from NT71 being replaced by 't36', but then we have the rest of the string to consider.\n\nWait, but in the grammar as it is, 't36' is a terminal, which would mean that it must come from NT71. But in order to do that, the NT71 must be replaced by 't36' and then somehow that contributes to the entire string.\n\nWait, let me instead consider the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar given starts with S and splits into NTs and terminals. Each rule looks like it's in CNF since each production has at most two non-terminals on the right side, and some are terminals.\n\nThe string to check is: `t17 t29 t39 t10 t34 t29 t48 t0 t48 t10 t49 t40 t15 t21 t36 t28 t36 t9 t48 t5 t0 t5 t31 t34`.\n\nI think the process involves trying to parse the string from the start symbol using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string should be parsed in a way where each terminal in the string matches the productions step by step, and the number of steps corresponds to the length of the string minus one.\n\nLet me first list out the productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n3. NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n4. NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n5. NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n6. NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n7. NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\n8.

NT95 \u2192 't10'\n40. NT74 \u2192 't17'\n41. NT58 \u2192 't17'\n\nHmm, a lot of these NTs have direct terminals, either single or double. The first step is to see which production rules of S can be applied to the first few symbols of the string.\n\nThe string starts with `t17 t29 t39 ...`.\n\nLooking at S, it can produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the first step would be to choose between these two.\n\nIf I take the first option, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, then the string's first symbol must match one of the first symbols of NT82 or NT22.\n\nFrom the production rules, NT82 \u2192 't29' (rule 23), and NT22 has multiple options. Let's see: NT22 can be 't23' (rule 16), 't12' (rule 27), or others. Wait, looking at NT22's rules:\n\n16. NT22 \u2192 't23'\n27. NT22 \u2192 't12'\nAnd other rules lead to non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the first symbol of the string is 't17', so the first symbol of the string is 't17', which should be matched by the first component (NT82 or NT40) in the S production.\n\nWait, no. S produces two non-terminals, so the string is the sequence of those non-terminals expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as each production is a step, and each step reduces the string by replacing a non-terminal with either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nSince it's a binary grammar, the string length is important. For a string of length n, there are n-1 productions because each production reduces the number of non-terminals by one.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try both possible initial productions for S.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then the string is `t17 t29 t39 t10 t34 t29 t48 t0 t48 t10 t49 t40 t15 t21 t36 t28 t36 t9 t48 t5 t0 t5 t31 t34`.\n\nWait, the first symbol must match the first terminal of NT82 or NT22.\n\nFrom the rules, NT82 \u2192 't29' (rule 23). So the first symbol is 't29', but the string starts with 't17', which doesn't match 't29'. So this production can't be used for the start.\n\nTherefore, the other option is S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Let's see if this works.\n\nThe first symbol is 't17', so the first component (NT40 or NT77) must expand to 't17'.\n\nLooking at NT40 rules:\n\n9. NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n11. NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n19. NT97 \u2192 't48' (rule 18)\n25. NT40 \u2192 't28' (rule 35)\n27. Wait, rule 9 is NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, and then NT97 \u2192 't48', so applying first to NT97, then NT0. Let's check NT0's rules:\n\n21. NT0 \u2192 't6' or 't10' (rules 22: NT0 \u2192 't10').\n\nWait, so if NT40 \u2192 't28' (rule 35), then the first symbol would be 't28', but the string starts with 't17', which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, NT40 can be derived via other paths. Wait, maybe there's another way. Let me check the other NT40 rules.\n\nLooking at NT40, does it have any direct terminals besides in rule 35 (NT40 \u2192 't28')? Or maybe via other productions? Wait, perhaps through NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, as rule 9.\n\nWait, so to find 't17', perhaps in the tree's somewhere else.\n\nWait, is there any NT whose production can lead directly to 't17'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT74 \u2192 't17' (rule 40). So any NT74 production would start with 't17'.\n\nSo perhaps somewhere in the derivation, we have a branch that leads to NT74.\n\nSo perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Then, the first symbol is 't17', which comes from NT74. So how would that happen?\n\nSo in that case, in the first step, we'd have NT40 and NT77.\n\nBut for NT40, to produce 't17', I need to have a path leading to that. But from the initial productions of NT40, I don't see an immediate way. So perhaps I need to parse further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try to outline the approach.\n\nThe standard way to determine if a string is generated by a grammar in CNF is to perform a recursive descent parser, but that might be too involved here.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be broken down into components where each component (after expansion) matches the next symbols in the string.\n\nWait, the string is `t17 t29 t39 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-416","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the grammar looks like. It's given in a list of productions. The start symbol is S, and it seems to have two productions:\n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Looking at the string to check, the first token is 't6'. Hmm, let's see how that's possible.\n\nWait a minute, in the grammar, many of the NT symbols (like NT82, NT22, etc.) have productions that lead to 't' followed by some number. For example, NT40 -> NT97 NT0, and NT0 -> 't6'.\n\nSo, maybe the string starts with a 't6', which comes from NT0. But wait, how does that connect back to the start symbol S?\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step. The string is: \n\nt6 t36 t49 t5 t39 t36 t0 t12 t35 t8 t34 t9 t15 t33 t21 t23 t10 t15 t49 t34 t21 t15 t10 t21 t21.\n\nThat's quite long. Let me consider how the derivations would work.\n\nStarting with S, after the first step, it will produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Then each of those NT symbols can produce other NT symbols or terminal 't' followed by a number.\n\nSince the string starts with 't6', which is a terminal, that means that the first part of the production must have a NT0 which goes to 't6'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 has two productions:\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n\nSo, NT0 can directly produce 't6' or 't10'. Since our string starts with 't6', one possibility is that the first part of the S production is NT0, and the other part is another NT symbol that leads to the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but S can only split into two NT symbols. So the first step is S -> ... either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. But 't6' must come from one of these NT symbols. Let me check each of these.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT82 only has productions like NT82 -> t29 (from looking at the list). So if NT82 comes from S, it would produce t29, not t6.\n\n- NT40 has multiple productions. One of them is NT40 -> 't9' (in the production NT9 -> 't40'), wait no, looking at the given grammar, let's list all NT40 productions:\n\nLooking back:\nNT40 has the following productions:\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- NT47 -> NT58 NT98 (Wait, no, NT58?), Wait, let me check all NT40 entries.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I think I need to spot all the productions for NT40. Let's see:\n\nFrom the given list:\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- Also, looking through, I see NT97 -> 't48', but no, NT97 is a non-terminal? Wait no, in the grammar, every line starts with 'NT' followed by a number, like NT36, NT22, etc. Wait, that's not right. Each production is either a non-terminal leading to two other non-terminals or a non-terminal leading to a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, each production is in the form NTxx -> something. So NT82 is a non-terminal that can expand into two other non-terminals. So, all the 't' followed by numbers are terminals. Got it.\n\nSo, NT40's productions:\n\n1. NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n2. NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nNo direct production for NT40 -> t. So, to get 't6', I need to trace how NT0 can produce 't6'. Looking at NT0, it can directly produce 't6' or 't10'.\n\nSo, if the first symbol is 't6', that suggests that NT0 in the first step produces 't6' without any expansion. So the tree would look like S -> NT40 NT77, but wait, no\u2014 wait S can split into two NT symbols, but looking at the grammar, S can also split into NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. But NT82 may not lead to 't6' immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's clarify:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S has two productions:\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, after the first step, the string derived is either [NT82, NT22] or [NT40, NT77], and each of those can further expand.\n\nIf the string starts with 't6', that means the first symbol in the right-hand side must be something that leads directly to 't6', which is NT0 -> 't6'.\n\nLooking at NT40's productions, it doesn't produce 't6' directly. So the only way to get a 't6' is through NT0. Therefore, the first step must be S -> NT40 NT77, and then one of the NT symbols (either NT40 or NT77) must eventually derive 't6'.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again: S starts as S -> NT40 NT77, so the first two symbols in the string must be the expansions of NT40 and NT77.\n\nBut in the string we have, the first symbol is 't6', which would have to come from either NT40 or NT77.\n\nLooking at NT77, which I don't see in the initial list, wait, wait, let me check the grammar again. The lines under the grammar are:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\n\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nThen, for NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\nAnd many other lines, like NT22 -> NT71 NT48, etc.\n\nWait, I realize I didn't list all the NT77 productions. Let me check the given grammar lines again to see if I missed NT77.\n\nLooking at the given list:\n\n- NT77: appears only once as S -> NT40 NT77\n\nWait no, let me check again.\n\nNo, NT77 only appears in the initial S production as S -> NT40 NT77, and perhaps another production elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking at all the lines, NT77 is only once in the initial S production. Wait no, let me scan all the productions:\n\nLooking through all the lines, I see NT77 only in the first S production: S->NT40 NT77.\n\nWait, no, I think that's incorrect. I must have missed NT77 elsewhere. Wait, let's check all the lines:\n\nLooking carefully:\n\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n\n- NT72 -> NT82 NT35\n\n- NT3 -> NT91 NT94\n\n- NT12 -> NT48 NT74\n\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\n- NT94 -> NT9 NT12\n\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\n- NT48 -> NT36 NT3\n\n- NT22 -> NT68 NT97\n\n- NT94 -> NT72 NT95\n\n- NT12 -> 't31' (Wait, no, that's a terminal production. So NT12 -> 't31').\n\n- NT22 -> 't23' (another terminal production)\n\n- NT15 -> 't49'\n\n- NT97 -> 't48'\n\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n\n- NT18 -> 't33'\n\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n\n- NT82 -> 't29'\n\n- NT71 -> 't36'\n\n- NT71 -> 't5'\n\n- Wait, NT71 has two productions: NT71->t36 and NT71->t5. So NT71 can produce either 't36' or 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT98->t5 and NT98->t34. So, two options for NT98.\n\nNow, looking for NT77, it's not there except in the initial S production.

{"custom_id":"request-421","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. My task is to determine whether the string can be generated by the grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies the analysis of possible derivations.\n\nThe given grammar has the starting symbol S, which has two production rules:\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo S can directly produce a combination of two non-terminals, NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77. This suggests that any string generated by S will start with two non-terminals, each of which will need to be expanded into more symbols until terminals are produced.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t29 t48 t28 t28 t15 t0 t39 t36 t15 t33 t23 t5 t17 t23 t10 t34 t40 t40 t12 t23 t33 t17 t33 t28 t9`.\n\nI notice that all elements are terminals starting with 't' and followed by numbers, except the last one which is just '9'. Let's check the grammar to see if these corresponds correctly.\n\nI'll start by trying to find a possible derivation from S to the given string. Since S starts with two non-terminals, the first step is to have two branches in the derivation.\n\nLooking at the first elements of the string: the first symbol is 't29'. From the grammar, let's see which non-terminals can produce 't29'. Scanning through the rules:\n\n- NT82 can produce 't29' (NT82 -> t29)\n- NT40 -> t29? No, it's NT40 -> t28 or t34.\n- NT36 -> t35\n- NT22 can produce 't23'\n- NT71 -> t36 or t5\n- Others like NT58 -> t17\n\nSo the only non-terminal that directly produces 't29' is NT82. Therefore, the first part of the string must come from NT82's expansion. Let's see what NT82 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT82's production rules:\n- NT82 -> t29 (done)\n- NT82 -> NT82 NT35 (which in turn would produce t29 and whatever NT35 produces)\nBut wait, in the string, after 't29' comes 't48', which would need to be in NT35's expansion. Let's check NT35's expansion.\n\nNT35 has production:\n- NT35 -> t29\nBut wait, in the string after 't29' 't48', so the next symbol is 't48'. So the first NT82 must be followed by another NT that produces 't48'. But according to the grammar, NT82's only terminals are 't29', and for its other rule, NT35, which might produce 't29' again. That doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which NT corresponds to which expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me consider each step.\n\nThe first symbol in the string is 't29', so it must come from a production of NT82 since that's the only non-terminal that directly produces 't29'. So the first step is:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\n\nNow, NT82's first step is 't29', and the second must come from the other production rule of NT82, which is:\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n\nSo after the first 't29', we have another NT82 and NT35, but NT35 produces 't29'. However, in the string, the symbol after 't29' is 't48'. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I'm misparsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT82 can be used in a way that after 't29', we can derive further symbols into the string. Let me think. Maybe the first NT82's only 't29' is matched, and then the second symbol comes from NT22.\n\nWait, the string after S starts with 't29', but NT82 can produce 't29', but then the next symbol is 't48'. So for NT22, let's check its productions.\n\nLooking at NT22:\n- NT22 \u2192 t23\n- NT22 \u2192 't23' (maybe that's a mistake, let's check the rules again)\nWait, actually, in the rules, I see NT22 has several productions, including NT22 -> t23, and also NT22 -> t5 via NT74 or other paths? Let me check:\n\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\nNT71 -> t36 or t5\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\nBut it's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps NT22 can lead to 't23' as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT22 has a production NT22 -> t23. So in that case, if NT22 is producing t23, then after S \u2192 NT82 NT22, we would have NT82 \u2192 t29, and NT22 \u2192 t23, resulting in the string starting with t29 t23. But the actual string starts with t29 t48. So that doesn't match. Therefore, maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check NT22's productions more carefully.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\nNT71 -> t36 | t5\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\n\nWait, so NT22 can produce NT71 and NT48, but then where do those NTs go? Let me see:\n\nNT71 can go to t36 or t5\nNT48 can go to NT36 NT3. What does NT36 produce?\n\nNT36's productions are:\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n- NT36 -> NT75 NT0? Wait, looking back, I think it's NT36 -> NT18 NT77. Wait, but in the given rules, NT36 has:\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT36 -> NT75 NT0? Wait, in the given list, I don't see NT36 having a rule for NT18 NT77 outside of NT36.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the NT36 rules again:\n\nIn the grammar, NT36 has:\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n- NT36 -> NT75 NT0? Wait, no, looking back, I'm a bit confused. Let me list all NT36's rules:\n\nLooking back, in the given grammar:\n\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n- NT36 -> NT75 NT0 (Wait, did I misread that?) Or perhaps the list is more like:\n\nWait, the given grammar is a bit extensive. Let me look again carefully. It seems that for NT36, it's:\n\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n- NT36 -> NT75 NT0.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. So, each non-terminal can produce exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the string and see how it can be broken down into the grammar symbols. The string is: `t31 t9 t23 t0 t35 t9 t33 t29 t5 t10 t48 t17 t29 t39 t17 t5 t33 t39 t49 t5 t38 t17 t21 t10 t28 t21`.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has two productions: S -> NT82 NT22 and S -> NT40 NT77. I'll need to see if the string can expand through either of these.\n\nLet's start with S -> NT82 NT22. So the first two symbols should match NT82 and NT22. But wait, the string starts with t31, t9, etc. The non-terminals in the grammar are symbols like NT82, NT22, etc., but each production ends in terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT82 -> t29, which is a terminal string. Then NT22 can go to several options: NT71, NT48, etc. Wait, but the string's first terminal is t31. Let's see which NT symbols produce t31.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77 (but no t36 terminal)\nNT12 -> 't31' (so NT12 produces t31)\nSimilarly, NT22 can produce 't23' as seen in NT22 -> 't23', but the first symbol is t31.\n\nSo for the starting production S -> NT36 NT18? Wait no, the start is S -> NT82 NT22 or S -> NT40 NT77. Wait, I think I might be mixing up the NT symbols with the terminals.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which splits into NT82 and NT22. Let me think about how that might produce t31. \n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the grammar, the non-terminals are S, NT82, NT77, NT36, NT22, etc. The terminals are like t31, t9, t23, etc.\n\nSo when generating the string, each non-terminal in the derivation will split into other non-terminals until we get to terminals, which will then form the string.\n\nSo for example, starting with S, which can be NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nSuppose the string starts with t31. So I need to find a production that results in t31. Looking at NT symbols, let's check which NT symbol can produce a t31.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT12 -> 't31' (production 1: NT12 -> t31)\n\nSo if I can derive NT12 as one of the non-terminals in the string, then that could produce t31.\n\nBut S is either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So to get the first token as t31, perhaps the second part of the split needs to be NT12.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nThe string is: t31 t9 t23 t0 t35 t9 t33 t29 t5 t10 t48 t17 t29 t39 t17 t5 t33 t39 t49 t5 t38 t17 t21 t10 t28 t21.\n\nSo the first token is t31, which comes from NT12 -> t31.\n\nSo perhaps in the derivation, one of the NT symbols becomes NT12.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT82 NT22\n\nSo we have NT82 and NT22. To have t31 as the first symbol, perhaps NT22 is derived to produce t31? But in the productions, NT22 can go to 't23', 't71', 't48', etc. So t23 would come from NT22 -> 't23' (production 14). So if NT22 is 't23', the first token would be t23, but the string starts with t31, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first NT symbol is NT36, but wait, NT36 produces NT18 NT77, which would not give a terminal unless it further expands.\n\nBut that might be too deep. Let's think of starting with S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nIf the first NT is NT40, which can produce several things. Looking at NT40's productions:\n\nFrom the list, NT40 has multiple productions:\n\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0 (production 4)\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71 (production 15)\n- NT40 -> NT48 NT74 (production 10)\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0 (another occurrence, production 19)\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71 (production 20)\n- NT40 -> NT48 NT74 (production 24)\n- NT40 -> NT28 (production 17)\n- NT40 -> NT9 NT12 (production 9)\n- NT40 -> 't28' (production 17)\n\nWait, looking back, NT40's productions include 't28'? Let me check the list again:\n\nLooking for NT40 productions:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0 (twice)\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71 (twice)\nNT40 -> NT48 NT74 (twice)\nNT40 -> NT28 (production 17)\nIs there a NT40 -> 't28'? Or is that another production?\n\nWait, looking at the list: NT40 has:\n\n- NT40 -> NT28 (production 17)\n- NT40 -> 't28' (but I need to check if that's the case)\n\nWait, the list of productions for NT40 is:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> NT48 NT74\nNT40 -> NT28\nNT40 -> NT9 nt12\nNT48 nt36 nt3\n\nWait, no, looking at the list:\n\nThe list has lines like \"NT40 -> NT28\", which is a production to a non-terminal, so not a terminal. Wait, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, looking at the list again:\n\nThe productions start with:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT22 ... etc.\n\nWait, actually, all the productions are either to non-terminals or to terminals. So \"NT40 -> NT28\" is a production to a non-terminal, so it doesn't produce a terminal. So to get 't28', it must come from another production of NT40 that actually ends in a terminal.\n\nLooking back, I see that in the list, one of the NT40 productions is NT40 -> 't28' (production 17). So that would allow NT40 to produce t28.\n\nSo S can produce S -> NT40 NT77, which would be t28 followed by whatever NT77 can produce.\n\nBut the string starts with t31, which is from NT12, so perhaps S is being split into NT36 NT18?\n\nWait no, S is either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nWait, perhaps the first part is NT36 and the second is NT18, but again, that might not get us to t31.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the first few steps.\n\nLet me try to follow the string step by step, seeing if I can parse it.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt31, t9, t23, t0, t35, t9, t33, t29, t5, t10, t48, t17, t29, t39, t17, t5, t33, t39, t49, t5, t38, t17, t21, t10, t28, t21.\n\nSo, each of these must come from a terminal production of a non-terminal after expansion.\n\nSo, for instance, the first t31 comes from NT12 -> t31.

{"custom_id":"request-428","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of parsing algorithms and CFGs.\n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in CNF has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production can only have two symbols on the RHS. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions have exactly two symbols on the RHS, either non-terminals or terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, but wait, NT82 is a non-terminal, but the way it's written, it's written as NT82, which is a term like NT followed by numbers. So, I need to check if each production on the RHS is either a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nBut wait, looking closely, some of the RHS seem to consist of two non-terminals, and others are a mix or two terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, where both are non-terminals. Another production is NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, which is two non-terminals. However, there's a production like NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98, both non-terminals again. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting some of these. Are the numbers after NT terminals or just part of the non-terminal names?\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the grammar again. For instance, S \u2192 NT82 NT22. If NT82 is a non-terminal, then the RHS is two non-terminals. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 't6', so NT0 is a non-terminal that produces the terminal 't6'. So, in this case, terminals are those with single characters like 't' followed by a number or 't' and digits. So, in the string, we have a sequence of these symbols like 't39', 't48', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t39 t48 t10 t21 t15 t17 t17 t28 t9 t10 t0 t5 t15 t10 t33 t33 t8 t29 t17 t9 t48 t38 t5 t6 t39 t31.\n\nFirst, let me note that the grammar and the string both consist of terms starting with 't', like 't39', which are terminals, meaning they need to match exactly with the productions in the grammar.\n\nNow, the process to determine if the string is in the language is to perform a top-down parsing using the given grammar. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach like the\u8d77\u5e8a machine can work too, but I think bottom-up might be more straightforward for this string.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production on the RHS can be either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So the RHS can be two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking back at the given grammar, all RHS seem to be two symbols, but I need to confirm whether each symbol is a non-terminal or terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT82 NT22: both NT82 and NT22 are non-terminals because they have two letters. NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77: again, two non-terminals.\n\nHowever, I see that some productions like NT3 \u2192 't5', which would be a terminal. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 't6' is a terminal. So, all leaves in the string must be non-terminals that can produce terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to check if the derivation of the string can be done by walking through the grammar rules.\n\nLet me parse the string step by step using a bottom-up approach. I'll treat each symbol as a terminal and see if I can find a sequence of productions that can reduce the string to a non-terminal, working my way back to the start symbols.\n\nThe string is:\nt39 t48 t10 t21 t15 t17 t17 t28 t9 t10 t0 t5 t15 t10 t33 t33 t8 t29 t17 t9 t48 t38 t5 t6 t39 t31.\n\nThat's 26 symbols. Since the productions are binary, a string of 26 symbols would require 25 productions to reduce the entire string to a single non-terminal. So, I need to see if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build the parse tree from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me see what the string starts with. The first symbol is t39. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t39?\n\nLooking through the rules, I can check each production that has t39 as a terminal. Wait, let's look through the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT12 \u2192 't31'\n- ... other rules\n- Some rules on NT3: perhaps I missed. Let me go through each rule.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT3:\n- NT3 \u2192 't5' (produces terminal t5)\n- No other rules for NT3 as far as I can see.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT77: NT77 \u2192 NT40 NT98? Or maybe not. Wait, in the given grammar, I think I've seen NT77 is a rule, but I'm not sure. Let me scan all the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\n- NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 (twice, seems it's another instance)\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT71 \u2192 NT36\n- NT71 \u2192 NT5 (duplicate rule, but perhaps it's allowed if necessary)\n- NT98 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT22 \u2192 NT12\n- NT36 \u2192 NT35\n- NT48 \u2192 NT15\n- NT68 \u2192 NT5\n- NT35 \u2192 NT29\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT9 \u2192 't40'\n- NT18 \u2192 't33'\n- NT91 \u2192 't38'\n- NT95 \u2192 't10'\n- NT77 \u2192 't15' (Wait, maybe in the given rules I have to check for that)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 (twice?

{"custom_id":"request-438","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and I'm given a specific string to evaluate. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol here is S. Looking at the productions:\n\nS can go to NT82NT22 or NT40NT77. So S must start the string.\n\nNow, looking at each NT in the rules, some of them eventually produce terminal symbols, and others produce other non-terminals. My task is to parse the given string step by step, expanding non-terminals into terminals until I reach the string as a whole or determine it's impossible.\n\nThe given string is: t10 t49 t6 t34 t17 t21 t35 t8 t9 t34 t36 t48 t10 t34 t48 t28 t39 t17 t48 t33 t9 t12 t15 t21 t33 t0 t29.\n\nThis is 31 tokens, which is a pretty long string. I need to see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at S's first production: NT82 and NT22. So the string must start with t29 (from NT82 \u2192 t29) and t12 (from NT22 \u2192 t12). Wait, but the first token is t10, not t29. That seems off. Or perhaps I have to expand further.\n\nWait, no, S can produce either NT82NT22 or NT40NT77, so the first step is to split S into two non-terminals. Let me try the first option: NT82 and NT22.\n\nFrom NT82 \u2192 t29 when NT22 is 't12'? Wait, no, looking back: NT82 is a non-terminal that produces 't29' when it's in some production. Or wait, let me clarify. Each NT may have multiple productions; I might need to check what each NT can produce.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for each NT:\n- NT82: has a production \u2192 t29, for example in the rule NT82 -> t29.\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar, NT82 has production NT82\u2192 t29? Yes, in the list, I see NT82\u2192 t29.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 has multiple productions:\nNT22 \u2192 't23' (for example in the second rule), but also \u2192 t5 from another rule, such as NT72? Wait, no, NT22 has a production to 't12' and 't23' and others.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT22 can produce 't23', 't12', 't68 t97', which I think is 't68 and t97', but that's two terminals? Or is it a production like NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97, which then may produce t5 and t8.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it as building the string backward, seeing if I can match the given tokens step by step.\n\nLet me list the tokens in reverse, starting from the end, which is t29. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce 't29'?\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t35 and t29 (from NT36\u2192 t35 t29)\n- NT35 \u2192 t34 and t... Wait, looking at NT35, maybe I need to check each production.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 t29\n- NT0 \u2192 t29 (no, wait NT0 has multiple productions, like NT0\u2192t10, t9, etc.)\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up NT35 and NT36. Let me see:\n\nIn the production list, I see NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77 and NT35 \u2192 t29. So NT35 directly produces t29. So if the last token is t29, it could come from NT35. So in the string, the last token is t29, which could be produced by NT35, which in turn would be one of the non-terminals in a production rule. So NT35 needs to be part of a higher-level production.\n\nWait, but in the current level, after the first expansion from S, we have NTs. Let's try to break it down.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nSo the string should be constructed as (NT82's expansion) followed by (NT22's expansion).\n\nLooking at the tokens, the first token is t10, so let's see which NT can produce t10.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT0 \u2192 't10', 't10' via NT0 \u2192 t10, and other rules.\n\nBut in the hierarchy, how do we get t10? Let's see:\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT40 NT77, but the first token is t10, so if I follow that branch, S \u2192 NT40 and NT77, which would have to produce t10 and...? Let me try that.\n\nWait, maybe I should try each possibility step by step.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t29. So first token should be t29, but the string starts with t10. So this can't be the case. Therefore, this branch is invalid.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\n- So the first part is NT40 and the second is NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t10. So let's see if NT40 can produce 't10' as the first token.\n\nLooking at NT40's productions, I see multiple rules. For example, NT40 \u2192 t28, and another NT40\u2192 t39. Hmm, wait, no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 (some production), another NT40\u2192 t28, and more.\n\nWait, in any case, NT40 might not directly produce t10. Alternatively, perhaps NT40 can be expanded into other non-terminals that lead to t10.\n\nWait, let me see the production NT97 \u2192 't48' (from NT97\u2192 't48'), and another NT68 \u2192 't5' etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to see what non-terminals can produce the tokens in the string.\n\nLet me look at the string tokens starting from the beginning: t10, t49, t6, t34, etc.\n\nIf S\u2192 NT40 NT77, then the first token is ' NT40's production.\n\nLooking at NT40's productions:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't28' (some rule, like NG40\u2192t28 directly)\n- NT40 \u2192 t28\n- NT40\u2192 t39\n- NT40\u2192 't40' (maybe through expansion)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Maybe it's better to create a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to check the start symbols and see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can build a leftmost derivation or useCYK parsing, but I need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check what each NT can generate.\n\nFor example, let's look for the first token t10.\n\nLooking through the NTs and their productions, which nt can produce 't10'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t28\n- NT40 \u2192 t39\n- NT95 \u2192 t10 (probably, since NT97 \u2192 t48 and others)\nWait, probably, NT97\u2192 't48', NT72\u2192 't8', etc.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, I see:\n\nNT0 produces 't10', 't9', etc.\n\nNT18 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT22 can produce 't23', 't12', 't68 t97', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if the given string starts with NT40 \u2192 't10'.\n\nLooking for a production where 't10' is directly produced.\n\nWait, NT0 \u2192 't10', so perhaps the production is S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and then NT40 is 't10' via NT40 \u2192 't10' through some expansion, but I don't see a direct production from NT40 to 't10'.

{"custom_id":"request-439","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows for a systematic approach to determine if a string is part of the language.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string to evaluate. The grammar has several non-terminals, like S, NT36, NT22, and so on, and some terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by a number. The string provided is a sequence of these 't' terms: t33, t23, t40, and so forth, ending with t0. \n\nThe string has 37 tokens, which is quite long. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a single terminal. So, each step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. This means that the length of the string should be 2^n - 1 where n is the number of steps, but the string length here doesn't seem to fit that pattern because it's 37, which isn't one less than a power of two (since 2^6=64, 2^5=32, so 32-1=31, 64-1=63). So, 37 doesn't match either of those. Hmm, that might be a red flag, but maybe not, because the initial grammar steps could vary.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think step by step. The starting symbol is S, which in the grammar branches into two options: either NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77. So S can be replaced by two non-terminals, each of which can be further broken down.\n\nThe string starts with t33, t23, t40, t31. Let me check the grammar for rules that produce these terminals or non-terminals. Looking at the left-hand sides: NT36, NT22, NT40, NT9, etc.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t33. Checking if any non-terminals produce t33. Looking at the production rules, I see NT18 -> t33. So that's one possibility. Now, the second symbol is t23. Looking at the grammar, NT22 -> t23. So that could be another. The third symbol is t40. Checking the grammar, NT40 has rules like NT40 -> NT97 NT0, among others. So t40 could come from NT40's production. Wait, but t40 is itself a terminal. Looking back, in the grammar, the only production for t40 is as a terminal or perhaps from a non-terminal? Wait, checking the production rules: I see NT40 has several rules, but none where NT40 directly produces t40. Instead, the only way to get t40 is through one of its productions. Wait, no, looking again: In the grammar, there's NT40 -> t28? Or is it another rule? Wait, checking the list: \n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- S -> NT82 NT22\n- S -> NT40 NT77\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n- NT72 -> NT82 NT35\n- NT3 -> NT91 NT94\n- NT12 -> NT48 NT74\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT94 -> NT9 NT12\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- NT48 -> NT36 NT3\n- NT22 -> NT68 NT97\n- NT94 -> NT72 NT95\n- NT12 -> 't31'\n- NT22 -> 't23'\n- NT15 -> 't49'\n- NT97 -> 't48'\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT18 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT82 -> 't29'\n- NT71 -> 't36'\n- NT71 -> 't5'\n- NT98 -> 't34'\n- NT22 -> 't12'\n- NT36 -> 't35'\n- NT48 -> 't15'\n- NT68 -> 't5'\n- NT35 -> 't29'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT94 -> 't0'\n- NT72 -> 't8'\n- NT40 -> 't28'\n- NT9 -> 't40'\n- NT18 -> 't9'\n- NT91 -> 't38'\n- NT95 -> 't10'\n- NT77 -> 't15'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n- NT82 -> 't34'\n- NT48 -> 't21'\n- NT74 -> 't17'\n- NT58 -> 't17'\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine. For example, NT22 can produce 't23' directly. So t23 is produced by NT22 -> t23.\n\nSimilarly, NT36 -> NT18 NT77; NT18 is t33, so that would mean NT36 can produce t33 followed by NT77. But NT77 can produce t15. So NT36 can produce t33 t15.\n\nLooking at the string after the first four symbols: t33, t23, t40, t31. Let's see: The first symbol t33 is from NT18, which is a production of NT36. So perhaps the first non-terminal is NT36, which then splits into NT18 and NT77. The NT18 becomes t33, and NT77 becomes t15. So the sequence after NT36 would be t33 t15. But in the string, after t33 comes t23, which would have to come from another non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the order. Let me think: The string is a sequence of symbols, so each symbol is either a terminal or comes from a non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet's start by considering the entire string and see if we can find a way to break it down.\n\nThe string is: t33 t23 t40 t31 t9 t34 t31 t0 t10 t21 t29 t15 t10 t8 t36 t21 t21 t23 t39 t6 t0 t21 t49 t21 t38 t39 t36\n\nThat's 37 symbols, which is a lot. Let's try to see if it can be derived.\n\nStarting with S, which can be split into S -> NT82 NT22 or S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nLet's try the first option: S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nNow, NT82 can produce 't29' or via other productions. Looking at NT82: in the grammar, NT82 -> 't29' is a terminal production. So NT82 becomes t29.\n\nThen NT22 can be split into two options: NT22 can produce 't23' directly or go through other productions. Since the second symbol in the string is t23, that would make sense for NT22 producing 't23'. So the first part would be t29 t23, but the string starts with t33, so maybe this path isn't the right one. So perhaps S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nLet me try that: S splits into NT40 and NT77.\n\nNow, let's look at NT40 and NT77.\n\nNT40 has several productions. For example, NT40 can produce 't40' if it has a production for that, but looking at the rules, I don't see NT40 directly producing 't40'. Instead, let's look for productions that lead to t40 in the string.\n\nWait, the third symbol in the string is t40. So perhaps the NT40 can be produced by another non-terminal or directly, but from the grammar, it seems NT40 is always produced by other non-terminals, not directly as a terminal. So perhaps we need to find a way to produce t40 as part of the expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, the third symbol is t40. So perhaps that comes from NT40. Let me check NT40's productions.

{"custom_id":"request-452","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding both the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar consists of non-terminals and terminals. Non-terminals start with 'N' and terminals are 't' followed by a number or other strings composed of these 't' numbers. Each production rule is either A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 B where B and C are terminals or non-terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are like that.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t23 t38 t40 t17 t10 t29 t49 t31 t34 t8 t12 t33 t33 t38 t39 t15 t10 t12 t23 t17 t49 t17 t10 t6 t40 t39 t48`.\n\nWait, that's a lot of parts. I think each split is a token, so the entire string is a sequence of these 't' tokens. I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. Let's see the production rules for S:\n- S -> NT82 NT22\n- S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo the start string must expand into one of these. Let's see the first rule: S -> NT82 NT22. So from S, we get NT82 and NT22. Then each of these non-terminals can be further broken down.\n\nI need to parse the given string backward to see if it can be built up from the start symbol by applying the production rules in reverse. \n\nLet's consider the string as a list: [t35, t23, t38, t40, t17, t10, t29, t49, t31, t34, t8, t12, t33, t33, t38, t39, t15, t10, t12, t23, t17, t49, t17, t10, t6, t40, t39, t48]\n\nI'll approach this using a top-down parsing strategy, trying to match the string by expanding S and seeing if it matches.\n\nFirst, S can expand into NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Let's try both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT82 NT22\nThen NT82 \u2192 production rules. Looking at the grammar, NT82 has what?\n\nLooking through the productions: I see NT82 -> t29. So NT82= t29.\n\nSo NT82 is 't29'. So part of the string starts with 't35' which is different, so maybe this path doesn't work. Wait, maybe I should think of parsing the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct path is S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nLet's see. NT77 \u2192 t15. So if S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then the last symbol is 't48', which is from NT48 \u2192 't17' in the productions? Wait, I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to split the string into factors based on the grammar rules. Let me see if I can group the tokens into the possible non-terminals.\n\nEach production in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So for any substring, it should match one of the rules.\n\nLet's look at the end of the string: the last few tokens are t10, t6, t40, t39, t48.\n\nLooking at NT48 \u2192 t17, but the last part is t48. So is there an NT48 production that ends with t48? Looking at the productions:\n\nWait, I don't see NT48 in the production list. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up NTs with the 't' tokens. Wait, the terminals are 't35', 't23', etc., so the 't' tokens are the leaves.\n\nSo when I see a 't' token, it's a result of the terminal production. So when parsing top-down, I replace S with a production and then each non-terminal expands until it hits terminals.\n\nSo the approach is to build the string step by step, starting from S and expanding non-terminals into their terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLet's write the string as a list to parse:\n\nOriginal string: ['t35', 't23', 't38', 't40', 't17', 't10', 't29', 't49', 't31', 't34', 't8', 't12', 't33', 't33', 't38', 't39', 't15', 't10', 't12', 't23', 't17', 't49', 't17', 't10', 't6', 't40', 't39', 't48']\n\nLet me try to parse from the start symbol.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT40 NT77 (since NT40 seems more common in the string).\n\nSo after expanding, the string starts with 't40' and 't77'. Wait, but the first token is 't35', which doesn't match 't40' or 't77', so that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, let's try S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29 (from NT82 \u2192 t29). But the first token is 't35', which is not t29. So maybe S \u2192 NT82 isn't working.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the production rules can be applied multiple times, recursively.\n\nLet me think about the grammar structure:\n\nEach production is either A -> BC or A->B.\n\nWe have a list of productions:\n\n- S has two options, NT82 or NT40.\n\nLet's pick S->NT40 NT77.\n\nThen, NT40 can be 't28', 't39', 't49', etc. Wait, looking at the productions, NT40 has multiple rules. For example, NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, or NT97 \u2192 t38. Oh, but NT40 also has a production to T28, T39, T48... So perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to write the entire grammar in terms of the production rules and see if the string can be derived.\n\nBut considering the computational complexity, this might take a while. Alternatively, I can represent the grammar as a parsing table and attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a recursive descent parser for the grammar and trying to parse the string.\n\nLet me try to outline the process:\n\n1. Start with the entire string. We need to parse it from the start symbol S.\n\n2. The first step would be to expand S into a production. Let's try both options.\n\nFirst option: S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\nSo the string would be split into two parts: the first part must expand to NT82, and the second part to NT22.\n\nBut the first token is 't35', which may not match any part of NT82 or NT22.\n\nWait, let's see NT82 can be t29. So the first token being 't35' suggests it's not derived from NT82.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 can be t12, t23, t33, etc.\n\nLooking at the first token 't35', it's a terminal. So in the grammar, NT82 can produce t29, but no production for NT35. So perhaps 't35' is from NT35, which is a non-terminal. So the string starts with 't35', which is the result of NT35, right?\n\nWait, I need to figure out which non-terminals correspond to which terminals. It might help to create a mapping or see which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n\nBut let's list all the non-terminals and see what they produce:\n\nNT36: nt18, nt77\n\nNT22: nt71, nt48; or 't23', 't12', 't33'\n\nNT74: nt58, nt98\n\nNT72: nt82, nt35\n\nNT3: nt91, nt94\n\nNT12: 't48'\n\nNT40: nt97, nt0; or 't28', 't39', 't48'\n\nNT94: nt9, nt10; or 't0'\n\nNT77: nt15\n\nNT40: nt97, nt0, etc., or 't28', 't39', '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-446","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the analysis since the parse tree will directly reflect the derivation steps without any intermediate transformations.\n\nThe starting symbol here is S, which has two production rules:\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must start with the combination of either NT82 and NT22 or NT40 and NT77. Let me note down the first tokens of the given string to see if this condition holds. The string begins with t39, t12, t29, etc. Wait, looking closer, the string starts with \"t39 t12...\", but the initial productions of S suggest the first two symbols should be something else. \n\nWait, let me see: the first production is NT82 NT22, so the first two symbols of any derived string from S would be the terminal symbols from NT82 and NT22. Similarly, the second production starts with NT40 and NT77, so their terminal symbols would be the first two. Let me see what NT82 and NT22 produce. From the rules:\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29\nNT22 \u2192 t12 or t23 or t35 or t5 or t71 or t68, etc.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar rules, each NT production leads to exactly one terminal symbol. So NT82 directly produces 't29' and NT22 produces something else. But in the string, the first token is 't39', which doesn't match 't29' or any of the options for NT22's production. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again. The given string is: t39 t12 t29 t29 t8 t33 t31 t12 t31 t23 t28 t49 t36 t39 t0 t31 t9 t8 t5 t15 t12 t35 t29 t5 t39 t9 t29 t48.\n\nLooking at the first token 't39', I need to see if any non-terminal produces 't39'. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t28 (from NT40 \u2192 t28) or t39 (from NT40 \u2192 t39). Wait, I see that NT40 has two productions: one leads to t28 and another to t39. So NT40 can produce 't39'.\n\nAh, so maybe the initial S rule isn't S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Wait, no, S is a starting symbol and when expanded, each production of S will generate two non-terminals. But if any of those non-terminals produce a terminal, then the first token in the string must be a terminal from that non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by parsing the string step by step, trying to find a possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to build the parse tree and see if it's possible.\n\nBut that might take time. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be checked by seeing if each step of splitting into non-terminals is possible.\n\nWait, another approach: the given string should be split into pairs of consecutive non-terminals. Wait, no, that's not the right approach because in the productions, each non-terminal expands into a terminal or another non-terminal. So for example, NT82 \u2192 t29, which is a terminal; but another production may be NT82 \u2192 something else. Wait, looking back, all the productions I see for NT82 is only NT82 \u2192 t29. So NT82 can only produce 't29', which is a terminal. So when S expands into NT82 and NT22, that part would produce 't29' followed by whatever NT22 can expand into.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't39', which would have to come from a production of a non-terminal that expands to 't39'. Looking through the rules, NT40 has a production that goes to 't39'. So perhaps the S expansion starts with NT40 NT77.\n\nWait, S's productions are S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the first expansion from S could be NT40 followed by NT77. Now, the first token in the string is 't39', which would be produced by NT40 expanding to 't39', and then the next part is 't12', which should come from NT77 expanding.\n\nSo let's see if NT77 can produce 't12'.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I don't see NT77 producing anything. Wait, let me check the list again. Oh, here is NT77: NT77 \u2192 t15. So NT77 can only produce 't15', which is a terminal. But the second token in the string after 't39' is 't12', which doesn't match. So that creates a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that NT77 is the second element. Alternatively, perhaps the S expansion is not the standard one. Alternatively, perhaps the S production is such that one of the NTs is something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by S expanding into NT40 and NT77, and then NT40 expanding into 't39', but then NT77 might expand into more non-terminals? Wait, but according to the rules, NT77 only expands into 't15'. So the second token after 't39' would have to be 't15', but in the string it's 't12', which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, that seems like a contradiction. So alternatively, perhaps the S production is S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then, the first token would be 't29', but the string starts with 't39'. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me write down the initial steps.\n\nThe string starts with 't39 t12 t29...', so the first step in any valid derivation would have to produce 't39' as the first symbol. Since NT40 can expand to 't39' or 't28', and the non-terminal S expands to either NT82 and NT22 or NT40 and NT77.\n\nSo the initial S step could be to expand the first non-terminal as NT40 and the second as NT77.\n\nSo NT40 \u2192 't39' or 't28' and NT77 \u2192 't15'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't39', so let's consider that as the first step.\n\nNow, the first two symbols in the string are 't39' and 't12'. So after 't39' comes 't12', which would have to come from NT77 expanding. But NT77 only expands into 't15', not 't12'. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but NT77 only has one production: NT77 \u2192 t15. So in that case, the second token after 't39' would have to be 't15', but the string has 't12' instead, which doesn't match. Therefore, this path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first non-terminal expanded is NT82, which produces 't29', but the string starts with 't39', so that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps the initial assumption that S \u2192 NT82 NT22 is the correct first step leads to a problem, as the first token should be 't29', which isn't the case. Therefore, perhaps the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I might have missed something. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way that NT77 can produce more than one symbol. No, in context-free grammars, each production is a single symbol expansion, which can be a terminal or a single non-terminal. There's no way for NT77 to expand into multiple symbols in one step.\n\nWait, unless the NT77 is expanded by another NT before it can be processed. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.\n\nThe string is: t39 t12 t29 t29 t8 t33 t31 t12 t31 t23 t28 t49 t36 t39 t0 t31 t9 t8 t5 t15 t12 t35 t29 t5 t39 t9 t29 t48.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't39', that must come from NT40 expanding to 't3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since each production only leads to two non-terminals, the string should be a leftmost or rightmost expansion.\n\nLet me list all the production rules provided, but focusing on the non-terminals that appear in the target string:\n\nLooking at the target string, the non-terminals are:\n\nNT82, NT22, NT40, NT77, NT36, NT18, NT35, NT98, NT94, NT12, NT48, NT74, NT72, NT3, NT15, NT97, NT98, NT12, NT15, NT71, NT82, NT71, NT98, NT34, NT22, NT23, NT9, NT40, NT97, NT72, NT0, NT94, NT72, NT40, NT35, NT0, NT94, NT72, NT0, NT94, NT9, NT17, NT38, NT36, t5, t31, etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to process the string step by step, trying to split it into two non-terminals at each step.\n\nThe target string is quite long, with 36 elements. Since each step in the grammar produces two symbols, the number of symbols should double at each application. But since S \u2192 NT...NT, the initial expansion is two symbols. Let me count the symbols: 36. Since 2^5 is 32, which is close, but not 36, maybe it's a mix of expansions and symbols.\n\nAlternatively, each step (for each production) leads to a split into two, so the total number of symbols after each step increases by a factor of 2. Starting with S, which is two non-terminals (e.g., NT82 and NT22). Then each of those can produce another pair, leading to four, and so on. So the number of symbols should be a power of 2. But 36 isn't a power of 2, so this might mean that the string isn't generated by this grammar, but maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, could the string have interleaving non-terminals and terminals that allow for a mixed expansion?\n\nWait, but the target string is all terminals except possibly some non-terminals. Looking back, I see that in the target string, many symbols are 't' followed by numbers, like t5, t31, etc., but some have multiple t's, like t17 t0 or t40 t5. Also, there are non-terminals like NT82, NT22, etc., which are not terminals but non-terminals that need to expand further.\n\nBut the target string provided is a single sequence of symbols, all being terminals or non-terminals? Wait, no, the target is given as individual symbols separated by spaces, like `t5`, `t31`, etc. So each symbol in the string is either a terminal (like t5, t31) or a non-terminal (like NT82, NT22, etc.), which themselves need to be expanded.\n\nBut in the grammar, each production for NT... produces exactly two non-terminals. So each non-terminal can only expand into other non-terminals. However, in the given string, when can a non-terminal appear as a prefix of a production? Looking at the production rules, many of them start with NT followed by something. For example, NT82 \u2192 NT22 NT31. Wait, wait, no, looking at the provided grammar, I need to find the left-hand sides.\n\nLooking back:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\nNT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\nNT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\nNT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\nNT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT9 \u2192 NT94 NT12\nNT18 \u2192 NT9 NT17\nNT91 \u2192 NT38 NT95\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT10?\nWait, no, looking more carefully, perhaps I should re-examine the productions.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with a lot of lines.

{"custom_id":"request-454","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is a bit complex with multiple non-terminals, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens. \n\nFirst, let me understand what's given. The grammar has rules like S \u2192 NT82 NT22, and so on. Each of these rules produces two non-terminals until eventually, some of them produce terminal symbols, which are either 't' followed by a number or specific 't' numbers like 't36', 't5', etc. The string to check is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nThe string is: `t48 t5 t12 t9 t35 t39 t33 t8 t12 t48 t38 t36 t34 t17 t39 t35 t40 t21 t29 t34 t12 t28 t10 t39 t5 t34 t21 t33 t36`.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing can be done with a recursive descent parser since the grammar is in CNF, which is suitable for such parsing methods.\n\nBut before diving into parsing, maybe I can look for a pattern or see if the grammar has any simplifications. Let me list out all the production rules and the terminals they produce.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to reverse-engineer the string. That is, start from the start symbol S and see if the string can be generated by expanding S step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nS can be derived from two rules: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the string should start with one of these combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t48. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t48. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT48 appears in several rules: \n   NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n   NT48 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n   NT48 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n   NT48 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n   NT48 \u2192 NT35 NT3\n   NT48 \u2192 NT0 \u2192 but that's a terminal, probably not directly.\n\nWait, but more precisely, each of these rules expands further. For instance, NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3. So to produce t48, either of those expansions must eventually lead to t48.\n\nHmm, but maybe it's better to look at the first token in the string. The first token is t48, so to get t48, which production rules in the grammar produce t48.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see that NT48 has several production rules. Let me list all NT's that can expand to t48:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT48 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n- NT48 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT48 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT48 \u2192 NT35 NT3\n\nBut none of these directly produce t48. Instead, they produce subterms. So perhaps I need to look further down each of these paths.\n\nLet me pick one path: Let's assume the first two symbols are NT48 and t5. Wait, no, the first symbol is t48. So which rule produces t48 as the first symbol?\n\nWait, no, the first two symbols in the string are t48 t5. Hmm, wait no: Let me recount.\n\nWait the string is `t48 t5 t12 t9 t35 t39 t33 t8 t12 t48 t38 t36 t34 t17 t39 t35 t40 t21 t29 t34 t12 t28 t10 t39 t5 t34 t21 t33 t36`.\n\nWait, the first token is t48. So according to the grammar, which rule can produce t48 as the first symbol?\n\nLooking at the given rules, it's not directly produced. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I should think in terms of the left-hand side of the production. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused. The first symbol is t48, but in the grammar, the non-terminals only appear as NT followed by a number. So, for example, NT48 can be a non-terminal that eventually produces t48 through a series of expansions.\n\nWait, but according to the given rules, NT48 can expand into various pairs. For example, NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3. So the first symbol would be whatever NT36 expands to, and then NT3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think recursively. The string is a series of tokens, and each token corresponds to a terminal symbol or a non-terminal. But in this case, since all the non-terminals are either the start symbols or other NTs, perhaps the string needs to be generated by expanding the start symbol S into these NTs and terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t48, which is a terminal. So in the grammar, one of the NTs must expand into t48. Let me look at all NTs that can produce t48 via expansion.\n\nLooking through the given production rules:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT18 \u2192 NT9 NT33 (from NT18's rule)\nWait, that might be a long path.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to build a parsing tree. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see the entire string as a series of expansions. Let's try to see if this is manageable.\n\nThe string is: t48 t5 t12 t9 t35 t39 t33 t8 t12 t48 t38 t36 t34 t17 t39 t35 t40 t21 t29 t34 t12 t28 t10 t39 t5 t34 t21 t33 t36\n\nSo, 32 symbols. Since each production in CNF produces two symbols, the derivation would require the string length to be 2^n for some n, where n is the number of steps. 32 is 2^5, so maybe n=5 steps from S.\n\nBut let me think about how to parse it.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see if each symbol can be mapped to a non-terminal or terminal.\n\nThe string starts with t48, which is a terminal. So in the grammar, which NT can directly produce t48? Looking back, maybe I missed a rule. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT18 \u2192 NT9 NT33\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT94\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\nWait, no NT48 directly produces t48. Wait, perhaps a different path.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check all the NTs that can produce certain terminals.\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT94\nNT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12 or NT72 NT95\nBut none of these are terminals yet. So perhaps I need to go deeper.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a better approach.\n\nSince the string starts with t48, let me see which non-terminal can produce t48 as its first symbol. In the grammar, NTs can only expand into other NTs except for the terminals, which are like 't36', 't5', etc.\n\nWait, but all the terminals are of the form 't' followed by a number. So, perhaps the way to approach this is to reverse each production to see if any NT ends with a terminal.\n\nWait, that might be complex. Alternatively, perhaps I can map each terminal to the possible NTs that can produce it directly or indirectly.\n\nBut this might take a long time. Alternatively, I can try to find which NT can be expanded into t48. Wait, but I don't see any NT producing t48 directly. That suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, looking at the given rules:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT18 \u2192 NT9 NT33\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT94\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12 or NT72 NT95\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT34\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT97 \u2192 NT9 NT12 (Wait, no, looking at the given rules, NT97 has two productions: NT97 \u2192 NT9 NT12 and NT97 \u2192 NT72 NT95?\n\nWait, no.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It starts with S, which can produce different combinations of NTs. The start symbol is S, and the string we're evaluating starts with t5 and ends with t90.

I need to check if this sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nThe string has 32 tokens, and each step in the context-free grammar reduces the number of symbols according to the production rules.

But looking at the string, I don't see a t6, so perhaps all t6 would be invalid unless NT0 is in the string somehow.\n\nWait, but in our string, I don't see 't6'\u2014the string is: t5 t15 t29 t12 t10 t39 t48 t9 t23 t39 t5 t49 t0 t35 t33 t15 t33 t10 t21 t0 t48 t9 t38 t48 t33 t5 t9 t0 t34 t39.\n\nLooking for 't6'\u2014I don't see it, so maybe if any of the productions produce 't6', it's used here.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT0 -> 't6'\u2014so if in the string we have a 't6', it must come from NT0. However, in our string, I don't see any 't6'\u2014that could be a problem. Wait, let me check again:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt5 t15 t29 t12 t10 t39 t48 t9 t23 t39 t5 t49 t0 t35 t33 t15 t33 t10 t21 t0 t48 t9 t38 t48 t33 t5 t9 t0 t34 t39.\n\nLooking at the tokens, 't10' occurs a few times. Where does 't10' come from? From NT98->t5, but 't10' is different. Alternatively, in the grammar, is there any NT that produces 't10'? Let's check the rules. I see:\n\n- NT98 -> 't5' (so that's t5)\n- NT22 -> 't23' (so that's t23)\n- NT0 -> 't6' (so that's t6)\n- NT58 -> 't17' (but I'm not sure if that's relevant)\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I don't see any NT that produces 't10' directly. So in the string, I see a 't10'\u2014for example, in the 10th token, it's 't10' and later at position 19, another 't10'. How can that happen? Because none of the NTs directly produce 't10'.\n\nSo that's a problem because all the NTs either produce non-t symbols or t symbols as per the rules. So any 't10' token would have to come from a production that produces it.

The string is quite long, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form looks like. CNF is a context-free grammar where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. Looking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions do fit this format. Some non-terminals produce two other non-terminals (like NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77), and others produce terminal symbols directly. So, it's indeed in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t39 t12 t10 t40 t23 t5 t28 t10 t35 t5 t15 t23 t28 t35 t39 t5 t28 t40 t49 t35 t33 t40 t5 t33 t49 t36 t0 t0 t23`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nI think the best approach here is to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. Parsing in CNF can often be done using a stack or recursive descent, but maybe I can do it manually.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into parts that match the productions. Let's look for sequences that correspond to the left-hand side (LHS) of the productions or their terminals.\n\nThe first symbol is `t6`. Looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce t6. For example, NT0 -> 't6' and NT9 -> 't40'. Wait, no.

Let me correct that.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLines like NT71 -> t36 and NT71 -> t5. That can't be correct; each non-terminal can have multiple productions but can't have the same LHS with different RHSs. Wait, perhaps I misread the rules.

I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the starting symbol which may have one terminal. Also, all symbols are non-terminals except the terminals, which are the atomic symbols like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at the grammar given, I can see that the start symbol is S, and its productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, initially, S must be rewritten using one of these options. Each of these NTs is a non-terminal that can be further broken down.\n\nThe string I'm given is:\n\"t6 t17 t48 t6 t31 t15 t48 t6 t34 t28 t33 t23 t12 t21 t31 t40 t49 t29 t49 t5 t15 t8 t35 t31 t34 t34 t9 t39 t48 t35 t9\"\n\nThis string is a sequence of terminals, each presumably corresponding to a single character. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSince this is a parsing problem, I can either try to construct a parse tree step by step or use recursive descent parsing. But since the grammar is small, perhaps a recursive approach would work.\n\nTo start, I'll consider each production for S. Let's pick the first production S \u2192 NT82 NT22. This means that the first part of the string should start with NT82 derived into t6 and NT22 into t17, etc. Alternatively, the second production S \u2192 NT40 NT77 could lead to different starts.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is t6. So I should check if either of the productions for NT15 can start with t6 or t17. Wait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nFor example, NT0 \u2192 't6', so if a non-terminal leads to NT0, then one of the terminals will be t6. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 't5', NT12 \u2192 't31', etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to work backwards from the given string, trying to match the terminals and seeing if the non-terminals can expand into the required sequences.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual tokens for clarity:\n\n1. t6\n2. t17\n3. t48\n4. t6\n5. t31\n6. t15\n7. t48\n8. t6\n9. t34\n10. t28\n11. t33\n12. t23\n13. t12\n14. t21\n15. t31\n16. t40\n17. t49\n18. t29\n19. t49\n20. t5\n21. t15\n22. t8\n23. t35\n24. t31\n25. t34\n26. t34\n27. t9\n28. t39\n29. t48\n30. t35\n31. t9\n\nNow, starting from the beginning, the first token is t6. Looking at the grammar, the only NT that produces t6 is NT0: NT0 \u2192 't6'. So somewhere in the leftmost derivation, we must have a production where an NT that produces t6 is used.\n\nSo looking at the grammar, let's see which NTs produce t6:\n\nLooking at all the non-terminals:\n\n- NT82: has a production to t29\n- NT71: to t36 or t5\n- NT3: to t91 or t9 or ... other variables\n- Wait, no, perhaps I should look through all the rules for t6. Wait, from the rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT22 \u2192 't12', 't23', etc.\nWait, but t6 is only from NT0. So at some point, we must split the string into a production that includes NT0, which expands to t6.\n\nLooking at the given string, maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT82 and NT22. But NT82 may produce t6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nSo, S is replaced by NT82 and NT22. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model using a parse table or a recursive descent parser. But given the time constraints and the structure of the problem, perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be represented as a leftmost derivation from S.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string token by token.\n\n1. t6: This must be from NT0.\n\nLooking for a production where NT0 is used. NT0 \u2192 't6'. So this is straightforward.\n\nNow, the first symbol is matched.\n\nNow, looking at the structure of NT0, which is S \u2192 NT82 NT22, as the first production. So after producing t6, which is 'NT0', the remaining string must be parsed from NT82 and NT22.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The production is S \u2192 NT82 NT22, so the leftmost symbols are NT82 and NT22. So when we derive S, it's replaced by NT82 and NT22. So the first part is NT82, which must generate the rest of the string up to NT22.\n\nWait, perhaps the leftmost derivation would proceed by expanding NT82 first. Let me outline a more concrete approach.\n\nSo, during leftmost derivation, after S is replaced by NT82 NT22, the first symbol to be produced is from NT82. So the first token t6 must be from NT82. Looking at the productions for NT82:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the productions for NT82 are:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't29' (from the given rules: NT82 has a production to 't29')\nWait, but wait, in the given grammar, the first rule is S \u2192 NT82 NT22. That suggests that in the left production of NT82, it can be replaced by NT82 \u2192 NT68 NT97 and so on, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should list all the productions for each non-terminal to avoid mistakes.\n\nReviewing the grammar:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 NT71 NT0 (from earlier rules)\nWait, no, looking back, let me list all the rules for each non-terminal. It's a large set.\n\nFor NT82:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 NT71 NT0\n\nWait, from the given rules, checking:\n\nFor example, the first rule is:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\n\nThen, other rules:\n\nNT82 -> NT71 NT0\n\nAnd other rules, like NT82 -> 't29'?\n\nWait no, let me check all the rules for NT82.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT82 -> 't29' (from the given rules)\n\nWait, yes. Looking:\n\nYes, in the given rules, one production for NT82 is NT82 \u2192 't29'. Similarly, others like NT71 \u2192 't36' or 't5' etc.\n\nWait, but that might not be directly applicable. Let's list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is to model this as a context-free grammar parser using a recursive descent approach, treating it as a parse tree.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in CNF, each production is at most two non-terminals. So each non-terminal must expand into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut perhaps a better strategy is to construct the parse tree for the given string.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a relatively small grammar and the string isn't too long, I can attempt to see if each token can be matched by some non-terminal's production.\n\nStarting with t6, which we know comes from NT0.\n\nSo, we can imagine that we have a parse tree where at some point, NT0 contributes a terminal t6.\n\nLet's try to parse the entire string step by step.\n\n1. First token: t6 \u2192 NT0. Now, the remaining string starts from index 2 to 31.\n\nBut wait, how do we proceed?

{"custom_id":"request-477","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. My job is to figure out whether the string is generated by the grammar. The grammar is a bit complicated with a bunch of rules, and the string is quite long, so I'll need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form looks like. Each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That makes parsing easier because each step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the given grammar is in CNF, all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or two terminals. Some of the production rules have two terminals, so those will directly contribute to the string.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals, and others produce other non-terminals. The string I need to check is: `t40 t40 t29 t12 t29 t40 t39 t34 t12 t23 t12 t28 t33 t40 t12 t39 t0 t29 t48 t9 t21 t29 t9 t23 t6 t38 t23 t49 t33 t36 t28`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to perform a top-down parsing of the string using the grammar. Starting from the start symbol S, which according to the grammar can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the start symbol S is a non-terminal, and in the string, the first symbol is t40, which corresponds to S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, S \u2192 NT40 NT77, so S can be replaced by NT40 followed by NT77. So the first part of the string should be t40 (from NT40) followed by t77. But the string starts with t40 t40. Hmm, that's a problem because the first production for S is either S \u2192 NT82 NT22, which would give t82 t22, or S \u2192 NT40 NT77, which gives t40 t77. The string starts with t40 t40, which doesn't match either of these. Wait, unless there's a way to have multiple steps.\n\nWait, so maybe the first S can produce S1S2 where S1 is NT40 and S2 is NT77. But then S1 and S2 might themselves be non-terminals that produce terminals. So maybe starting from S, we have to expand each rule step by step.\n\nLet me list out the starting symbol and the possible initial expansions:\n\nS can go to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nIn the string, the first symbols are t40 t40. So let's see:\n\nIf we choose S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then NT40 can produce t40, and NT77 can produce t15. So the first part of the string would have to be t40 t15. But the string starts with t40 t40, so that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can go through a series of substitutions. Let's try to see if there's a path that can give us the first two t40s.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT40 NT77 is the only S rule that starts with NT40. So the first symbol of the string must be produced by NT40. So the first part is t40 from NT40, and the next symbol is also t40. So maybe the NT40 on the left can produce another t40 somewhere else.\n\nLooking back at the NT40 production rules: \n\nNT40 can go to NT97 NT0, NT15 NT71, or NT48 NT21. Wait, no, looking again, I see:\n\nWait, according to the provided grammar, NT40 has the following productions:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT48 NT21\n\nHmm, so no direct terminal production for NT40. That's a problem because the string starts with two t40s. Since NT40 can only be expanded into two non-terminals, I don't see a way for NT40 to produce t40 directly, which is a terminal. Wait, am I missing something? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking closely, in the non-terminals under NT, I don't see any production that directly gives t40 except in the S rule. Wait, but looking at NT40's productions, none of them directly produce a terminal. So the only way for NT40 to ever produce a terminal is through substitution.\n\nWait a second, but in the provided grammar, is there a rule that directly produces t40? Looking again:\n\nThe grammar has S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and then NT40 has production rules like NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, etc. I don't see NT40 \u2192 t40 anywhere. Hmm, that's an issue.\n\nIf that's the case, then starting with S \u2192 NT40 NT77, the NT40 can't produce t40, which is required in the string. So the first two symbols can't both be t40 because the NT40 can't directly produce a t40. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any rules. Let me list the NT40 productions:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT48 NT21\n\nNone of these produce a terminal. So NT40 can't produce t40 directly. That suggests that the string cannot be derived from the grammar, so the answer should be No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe the NT40 rule includes something else? Let me check again. Looking back:\n\nThe grammar lists for NT40 several productions, none of which produce t40. So that seems to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with two t40s, which would require NT40 to produce t40 twice, which it can't, as it can't produce t40 directly. Thus, the string is not in the language of the given grammar.\n\nAnother point to consider: Maybe the substitution path leads to t40 somehow, but given that NT40 can't produce t40 directly, and I don't see how it can in any number of steps, that would eliminate the possibility.\n\nSo, after going through the grammar rules and trying to find a way to produce the initial t40 t40 in the string, I don't see a way. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a set of production rules. CNF means each production is either a terminal, a single non-terminal, or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is `t48 t49 t40 t21 t0 t39 t36 t23 t28 t9 t49 t28 t49 t15 t29 t48 t0 t34 t12 t21 t5 t9 t36 t35 t12 t38 t33 t9 t40 t39 t33 t33`. I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S has two productions:\n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, either production must be used to derive the string. Let me first consider both options and see if the string can be parsed using either.\n\nThe string starts with 't48 t49...'. Let me check if 't48' and 't49' correspond to any productions directly or are part of larger production sequences.\n\nLooking at the production rules, 't48' appears on the right-hand side of NT48 -> NT36 NT3, and NT48 also appears in NT48 -> NT15 NT71. Similarly, 't49' is not a non-terminal; instead, looking at the grammar, I see that some symbols like NT12, NT15, etc., have terminal productions. Specifically, NT3 -> 't9' and NT77 -> 't15' are clear terminals.\n\nWait, the productions end with non-terminals except certain ones. Let me list the terminal symbols in the grammar based on the right-hand sides:\n\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77 \u2192 non-terminals; so 't36' is NT36's terminal?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should map each non-terminal to its productions and see which produce which terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string from the end, trying to see if it can be generated by reverse application of productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two symbols at most. But wait, in CNF, the productions can only be two non-terminals or one. But looking at the grammar, some productions have more than two symbols on the right, like S -> NT82 NT22. Oh, wait, no, all rules are either two non-terminals or terminals? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, every production except S's has right-hand sides of two non-terminals. Wait no, looking more carefully, no, all productions have either single or two non-terminals except for some cases. Wait, actually, all right-hand sides seem to be either single non-terminals or two non-terminals, except perhaps when a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal. So, it's in CNF because each production is at most two non-terminals or two terminals. Wait, no\u2014those that produce terminals are single terminals, and non-terminals are either single or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar given is in Chomsky Normal Form, so every production must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 B, where A and B and C are non-terminals. But in the given grammar, all the production rules seem to have two non-terminals on the right side except for when a non-terminal is replaced directly by a terminal. For example, NT3 \u2192 't9', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT40 \u2192 't28', and so on.\n\nSo, each non-terminal either produces one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, to parse the string, I can use a recursive descent approach or derive the string step by step.\n\nBut doing it manually might take a lot of steps, so perhaps I can look for the structure in the string.\n\nThe string is: t48 t49 t40 t21 t0 t39 t36 t23 t28 t9 t49 t28 t49 t15 t29 t48 t0 t34 t12 t21 t5 t9 t36 t35 t12 t38 t33 t9 t40 t39 t33 t33.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated starting from S.\n\nSince the start symbol S has two productions: S -> NT82 NT22 or S -> NT40 NT77. So, the first two symbols must be the right-hand sides of either of these productions.\n\nLooking at the string: The first symbol is t48. Let's see where t48 appears in the productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, 't48' appears in NT48 -> NT36 NT3 (so NT48 can produce t36 followed by t3) and NT48 -> NT15 NT71 (so NT48 can produce NT15 followed by NT71). Wait, no\u2014that would produce 't36' and 't3' or 't15' and 't71', but those are non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014wait, NT48's productions are actually leading to non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nWait, for NT48: The productions are:\n\n- NT48 -> NT36 NT3 \u2192 so the right-hand side is two non-terminals, which would expand into terminals and\/or non-terminals.\n\nBut since NT48's production ends with NT77, which in turn has a production that ends with 't15'. Hmm, perhaps it's better to see all possible steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a top-down parsing approach, starting from the top symbol S and trying to split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree in reverse, starting from the end of the string.\n\nAnother approach is to model the entire string as a sequence of symbols generated from S.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming manually. Let me think about key points:\n\nEach production in the grammar is either two non-terminals, or a terminal. So every expansion step reduces a non-terminal into two symbols (possibly terminals). So the number of symbols increases by one each time we apply a rule.\n\nWait, in production S -> NT82 NT22: the S would expand into NT82 followed by NT22. So the length of the string would increase.\n\nWait, let's think about the number of symbols.\n\nThe string has 33 symbols. The initial S has length 1. Each production of a non-terminal adds either one (if it's a terminal) or one (since each rule is A->BC, which would add two symbols in place of one, increasing the count by one). So the length would increase as more non-terminals are expanded.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to calculate how many symbols would result after each step.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can try to find if the string can be split into valid substrings that match the productions.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe string starts with t48 t49. Wait, but t48 is a terminal. According to the grammar, t48 can only appear in the right-hand side of NT48, as in NT48 -> NT15 NT71 or NT48 -> NT36 NT3. But wait, looking back:\n\nWait, no, actually, the productions are:\n\n- NT48 -> NT36 NT3 (so t36 followed by t3)\n- NT48 -> NT15 NT71 (so NT15 and NT71)\n\nBut t48 is not a terminal in these. Wait, looking again, I see entries like NT3 -> 't5'. So 't3' is a terminal, because NT3 \u2192 't5' is represented in the grammar as NT3: 't5'? Wait, in the grammar given:\n\nWait, let me re-express the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for each non-terminal, the productions are as follows. For example, under NT36:\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77.\n\nSimilarly, NT48 has two productions:\n\n- NT48 -> NT36 NT3\n- NT48 -> NT15 NT71.\n\nBut wait, these produce two non-terminals each, which may expand further.\n\nSo to produce 't48 t49', I need to see how that can happen.\n\nBut looking at the productions, 't48' is only in NT48's productions, but as part of non-terminals. So how does 't48' appear as a terminal in the string? Because in the string, 't48' is the first symbol. So how could that come about?\n\nWait, maybe 't48' is part of a non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, NT48 can produce NT36 followed by NT3. So if NT36 produces, say, NT18 followed by NT77.

Looking at the grammar, let me see the rules that produce t34.\n\nLooking through the RHS of all rules, I see:  \n- NT82 -> t29  \n- NT48 -> t15  \n- NT74 -> t17  \n- NT58 -> t17  \n- NT22 -> t12  \n- NT48 -> t21  \n- NT74 -> t17  \n- NT15 -> 't49' wait, no\u2014wait, the non-terminals are NT followed by numbers and letters? Wait, no, I think the rules are written with 'NT36' meaning a non-terminal called NT36. And the string is all lowercase letters and digits, like 't34'.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the grammar, some non-terminals are lowercase, e.g., t29 is a terminal, because in the rules, when a non-terminal is written as 't...', it's a terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, variables (non-terminals) are names like NT82, S, etc., and terminals are lowercase letters and numbers.\n\nWait, no: in Chomsky Normal Form, both left and right-hand sides have non-terminals, but in the right-hand side, terminals are represented by strings or symbols, so in the grammar provided, the RHS have either other non-terminals or specific terminal strings? Wait, looking again, many of the RHS are combinations of non-terminals, but some have terminals listed as t-something. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, many of the RHS are non-terminals, but others have t-something as literal terminals. For example:\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77  \nNT22 -> NT71 NT48  \n...\nNT3 -> NT91 NT94  \nBut then, look at this rule:\n\nNT92 -> t5  \nWait, actually, in the given grammar, some non-terminals have the form NT... followed by an equals sign and another non-terminal, except in cases where the RHS is a literal terminal. For example:\n\nNT48 -> t15  \nSo that's a terminal: 't15' is part of the string.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT22 -> t12  \nSo t12 is a terminal.\n\nBut in other rules, like NT40 -> NT97 NT0, it's two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no: Let me look more carefully at each production.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22  \nS -> NT40 NT77  \nNT36 -> NT18 NT77  \nNT22 -> NT71 NT48  \nNT74 -> NT58 NT98  \nNT72 -> NT82 NT35  \nNT3 -> NT91 NT94  \nNT12 -> NT48 NT74  \nNT40 -> NT97 NT0  \nNT94 -> NT9 NT12  \nNT98 -> NT5  \nNT18 -> NT33  \nNT3 -> NT5  \nNT0 -> NT6  \nNT82 -> t29  \nNT71 -> t36  \nNT71 -> t5  \nNT98 -> t34  \nNT22 -> t12  \nNT36 -> t35  \nNT48 -> t15  \nNT68 -> t5  \nNT35 -> t29  \nNT0 -> t10  \nNT94 -> t0  \nNT72 -> t8  \nNT40 -> t28  \nNT9 -> t40  \nNT18 -> t9  \nNT91 -> t38  \nNT95 -> t10  \nNT77 -> t15  \nNT40 -> t39  \nNT82 -> t34  \nNT48 -> t21  \nNT74 -> t17  \nNT58 -> t17  \nNT12 -> 't31'  \nNT22 -> 't23'  \nNT15 -> 't49'  \nNT97 -> 't48'\nNT9 -> t40  \nSo here, some rules have terminals, such as NT36 -> t35 (literal 't35'), while others have other non-terminals.\n\nSo the string is entirely composed of these terminals, and each terminal matches one of the RHS in the grammar.\n\nThe key is to see if the entire string can be generated by starting from S and expanding the non-terminals until we get all terminals.\n\nSo, to approach this, maybe I can represent the string as a list and try to find possible phrases in the grammar that correspond to the first few symbols, then replace them with the corresponding non-terminals, and repeat until I either consume the entire string or get stuck.\n\nBut given the length, this could be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the string as a sequence of symbols and see if it's a valid derivation.\n\nLet me first list all the non-terminals and their terminals:\n\nNon-terminals:\nS, NT22, NT82, NT40, NT48, NT74, NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string: \n\nt28 t36 t8 t0 t35 t28 t28 t10 t0 t33 t39 t36 t31 t40 t28 t49 t48 t38 t36 t17 t31 t29 t15 t38 t12 t29 t6 t8 t31 t38 t8 t33 t23.\n\nLet me break this down. Each token in the string is either a non-terminal or a terminal. Looking at the grammar, some symbols like t28, t36, etc., are terminals. So the string is a sequence of these terminals, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two main productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nEach of these produces a string of two non-terminals. So, the string we're evaluating needs to be derived from S through a series of productions, eventually leading to the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me map the string to possible non-terminal pairs. The string starts with t28, which according to the grammar, must be derived from a non-terminal that expands into t28. Looking at the productions, NT28 is not present; instead, looking at NT productions, I see NT28 isn't a non-terminal, so perhaps the first step is to see how the first few tokens could be generated.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step, expanding each non-terminal level by level.\n\nLet me start by looking at S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So, the string starts with NT82 and NT22. From the grammar, NT82 could produce t28 (looking at NT40's productions: wait, no, NT40's productions are to other non-terminals.

I think in the first part, I thought NT82 is a non-terminal, but looking at the productions, I don't see NT82 on the left side again except for S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So, in the given grammar, NT82 only appears as S \u2192 NT82 NT22, and then from the data, NT82's production is not listed again. Wait, no, wait, looking back, in the given grammar, some NT82 are listed with arrows, but actually, looking at the lines:\n\nThe first line after 'Grammar' is S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nThen the next line: S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nThen a line: NT36 -> NT18 NT77.\n\nThen: NT22 -> NT71 NT48.\n\nThen: NT74 -> NT58 NT98.\n\nThen: NT72 -> NT82 NT35.\n\nThen: NT3 -> NT91 NT94.\n\nThen: NT12 -> NT48 NT74.\n\nThen: NT40 -> NT97 NT0.\n\nThen: NT94 -> NT9 NT12.\n\nThen: NT40 -> NT15 NT71.\n\nThen: NT48 -> NT36 NT3.\n\nThen: NT22 -> NT68 NT97.\n\nThen: NT94 -> NT72 NT95.\n\nThen: NT12 -> 't31'.\n\nThen: NT22 -> 't23'.\n\nThen: NT15 -> 't49'.\n\nThen: NT97 -> 't48'.\n\nThen: NT98 -> 't5'.\n\nThen: NT18 -> 't33'.\n\nThen: NT3 -> 't5'.\n\nThen: NT0 -> 't6'.\n\nThen: NT82 -> 't29'. (Hmm, no, wait, looking back, in the initial grammar given, the user presented up to NT68 -> 't5', but then it seems the next lines are perhaps terminal symbols since some have arrows to 'tX'. So, perhaps some non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted some. Let me clarify the grammar structure.\n\nLooking again, the grammar seems to have rules where some non-terminals branch into other non-terminals (e.g., NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35), but also, at the end, some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals, which would be the leaves.\n\nWait, so for example, NT22 has a rule NT22 \u2192 't23', meaning that NT22 can produce the terminal 't23'.\n\nSimilarly, NT97 \u2192 't48', etc.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each terminal must be matched by a production of a non-terminal, possibly directly (if it's a terminal symbol), or via a series of non-terminals.\n\nLet me map the string step by step, attempting to find a derivation.\n\nThe string is: t28 t36 t8 t0 t35 t28 t28 t10 t0 t33 t39 t36 t31 t40 t28 t49 t48 t38 t36 t17 t31 t29 t15 t38 t12 t29 t6 t8 t31 t38 t8 t33 t23.\n\nI think it's helpful to approach this by looking at the start symbol S and see what it can produce.\n\nS can either produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So, the first two symbols after S will determine which production we're taking.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t28. Let's see if any non-terminal can directly produce t28.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't28' is present. So, NT40 can produce t28.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, there is a line: NT40 -> 't28'. So, NT40 can produce 't28'.\n\nAlso, looking back, another line: NT82 \u2192 't29'.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t28, which would require either starting with NT40, which produces 't28'.\n\nWait, but S can go either as NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nBut the first symbol is 't28', which only 't28' can come from NT40, not NT82.

{"custom_id":"request-499","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. I need to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. Hmm, let me start by understanding what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring the production rules of a context-free grammar. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol appears on the left as the only A.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that S is the start symbol with the production S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and another S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the start symbol S generates pairs of NT and another non-terminal. Each of these NTs seems to have their own productions, either splitting into more NTs or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: t6 t5 t5 t40 t34 t35 t48 t36 t40 t35 t39 t40 t33 t31 t21 t34 t40 t49 t0 t31 t15 t5 t33 t38 t40 t0 t28 t28 t35 t9 t39 t15 t29.\n\nI think my goal is to parse this string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps a recursive descent parser or a CYK algorithm would be suitable, but since I'm just manually checking, I'll try to break it down.\n\nLet's start by looking at the first few tokens. The string starts with t6, t5, t5, t40, etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the start symbol S produces either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the initial step would be to check if the string can be split into any of these starting pairs.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t6. Looking at the productions for NT0: NT0 \u2192 't6', so t6 is a terminal directly produced. Similarly, for NT18 \u2192 't33', etc.\n\nBut let's focus on S's production: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSo the first part of the string must be NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if it can be split into either.\n\nThe first token is t6. So maybe the first part is NT0 \u2192 t6. But in the grammar, NT0 has two productions: one is NT0 \u2192 't6' and another is NT0 \u2192 't10'. So t6 is directly produced. So if S \u2192 NT0 something, but S's first production is NT82 NT22. So maybe NT82 is t6.\n\nBut looking at NT82's productions: NT82 \u2192 't29' is one production, another is NT82 \u2192 't34'. So t29 and t34 are both directly produced from NT82.\n\nBut the first token in the string is t6, which isn't directly produced by NT82, since NT82's only productions are t29 and t34. Similarly, S\u2019s other production is NT40 NT77. Let me see: nt40 is not directly a terminal, but if the string starts with t6, maybe the first part is NT0.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nThe string begins with t6. From the grammar, NT6 is present with a production NT6 \u2192 't6' (I think NT6 is same as NT0 in this context, but looking more carefully, I see NT0 has NT0 \u2192 t6 and nt0\u2192 t10.\n\nSo t6 can come from NT0. So perhaps the first part of the string is handled by NT0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the higher-level productions. Let me see: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the string starts with t6, but t6 is in NT0's productions. So unless NT82 or NT40 can produce t6, the initial part would not be matching.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the productions more carefully. The S productions are S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the entire string must be split into two non-terminals, each of which must parse into their respective parts.\n\nSo for the string to start with t6, the first part must be NT82, which would generate t29 or t34, not t6, so that can't be. Alternatively, if the first part is NT77, but I'm not sure what NT77 produces.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT77's productions: NT77 is in S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Wait, no, S's production is S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So NT77 is another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT77's productions, I don't see any. Wait, let me check. In the grammar, I have entries for NT77: the productions include NT77 \u2192 and others. Wait, the user list seems to have lines like:\n\nNT77 -> NT58 NT98.\n\nWait, so NT77 can produce other NTs. So the initial production is S \u2192 NT82 NT22, which would require NT82 and NT22 each to produce some sequence, possibly leading to terminals.\n\nBut t6 is the first token, so let me see if any NT can produce t6. NT0 \u2192 't6' and NT18 \u2192 't33', etc. But in the given grammar, looking through all the NTs, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't6' (twice), NT15 \u2192 't49', NT12 \u2192 't48' and 't74', etc. But specifically, does any NT produce t6? Yes, NT0 does. So if the first production is NT0, which produces t6, then perhaps the string can start with t6.\n\nWait, but in the start symbol's productions, S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So S directly splits into two non-terminals, which must themselves split into terminals. So the entire string is the concatenation of the strings generated by NT82 and NT22, or by NT40 and NT77.\n\nSo in the initial step, the parser would first choose whether to expand S into NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nLet me check what the first token is: t6. So let's see which of the two options can start with t6.\n\nIf the expansion is NT82 NT22, then the first non-terminal is NT82, which can produce:\n\nFrom NT82's productions: NT82 \u2192 't29' or NT82 \u2192 't34'. So t29 and t34 are the only terminals. So t29 and t34 are the first tokens.\n\nBut the string starts with t6, which isn't t29 or t34. Therefore, the expansion of S as NT82 NT22 can't produce t6 as the first symbol. So that path is invalid.\n\nThe other option is that S expands to NT40 NT77. So now, the first symbol must come from NT40. Let me look at NT40's productions. From the grammar:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't28' (twice), NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71, etc. So NT40 can produce t28 directly, or via other NTs.\n\nBut the first symbol is t6, which is not t28. So the NT40's direct production doesn't yield t6. Alternatively, if NT40 is expanded via other NTs, but at the top level, S's first symbol is t6, which would have to come from NT40's direct production. Since none of NT40's direct productions produce t6, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so neither S \u2192 NT82 NT22 nor S \u2192 NT40 NT77 can produce the first token t6 as a terminal. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. NT0 can produce t6, but how does that integrate into the S's production.\n\nBecause S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and if NT40 produces a sequence that ends up with t6 in the first position. But looking at NT40's productions, none of them start with t6. Only NT0 can produce t6, but NT40's direct productions produce t28 or other NTs. So this seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think about the grammar again. Each S \u2192 NT followed by another NT.

I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is pretty long, with a bunch of tokens separated by spaces. I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I should try to parse the string step by step, checking each symbol against the grammar rules. Let's write down the string: `t0 t48 t34 t33 t5 t39 t36 t48 t9 t39 t5 t33 t17 t0 t5 t21 t29 t40 t48 t28 t28 t40 t38 t23 t40 t34 t28 t34 t33 t29 t48 t36 t5 t17`.\n\nI'll start by checking if the first symbol, `t0`, can be derived from the start symbol S. Looking at the grammar, S has two options: `S -> NT82 NT22` and `S -> NT40 NT77`. Since `t0` is a terminal, I need to see if any production rules directly produce `t0`.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I notice NT0 -> 't6' and NT0 -> 't10', but that's it. Wait, there's also NT98 -> 't5' and NT0 -> 't10', but no production for NT0 \u2192 t0. Hmm, none of the non-terminals directly produce `t0`. Wait, looking again, I see NT22's rule: NT22 -> `t23` and `t12`. Also, NT40 has several productions ending with `t49`, `t6`, `t10`, etc. But I don't see a production that directly results in `t0`. So, if the string starts with `t0`, that's a problem because none of the non-terminals can derive `t0`.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the NT0 productions again. The grammar has NT0 \u2192 NT94 and NT0 \u2192 NT15 NT71. Also, NT0 \u2192 't6' and 't10'. But is there a way to produce `t0`? It doesn't look like it. So, if the string starts with `t0`, it's impossible for the grammar to generate it because none of the terminals are `t0`.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the grammar. Oh, maybe I missed something. Looking through the rules again, I see NT0 \u2192 `t6` and `t10`. But none of the non-terminals directly produce `t0`. So, if S is supposed to produce NT82 and NT22, and neither of those can produce `t0` unless maybe via other non-terminals. But since `t0` isn't present as a direct terminal in any of the NT rules, it's impossible.\n\nSo, the first symbol is `t0`, which isn't present in any of the terminal options. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar. Hence, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-504","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a series of tokens, each possibly representing a terminal symbol. My task is to check whether this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except for the case where a non-terminal can produce a single terminal symbol. However, looking at the given grammar, I notice that many rules produce a single terminal symbol, like NT3 \u2192 't5'. So, it seems like some non-terminals can directly produce terminals. I need to be careful here because that might make the grammar non-conforming to CNF, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production can have at most two non-terminals on the right side. So, some rules might have two non-terminals, which would mean they can produce two terminals in two steps. But in this case, the given grammar seems to have some rules that directly produce a terminal symbol, like NT3 \u2192 't5'. But then, perhaps this is causing the grammar to have a mixture of CNF rules and ones that directly assign terminals. I'll need to handle that.\n\nSo, the string given is: t39 t5 t12 t40 t48 t9 t29 t29 t17 t28 t8 t31 t33 t48 t49 t10 t34 t29 t28 t9 t29 t9 t49 t39 t29 t31 t39 t9 t48 t33 t6 t0 t38 t28.\n\nLet me list the tokens for clarity:\n\n[t39, t5, t12, t40, t48, t9, t29, t29, t17, t28, t8, t31, t33, t48, t49, t10, t34, t29, t28, t9, t29, t9, t49, t39, t29, t31, t39, t9, t48, t33, t6, t0, t38, t28]\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be generated by the given CFG. To do this, perhaps I can start by analyzing the structure of the CFG and how it can generate the given string.\n\nFirst, looking at the start symbol, S. The grammar starts with S, so I should see how S can be expanded. Looking at the production rules for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, S can be replaced by NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77. Both are combinations of two non-terminals each. That means, when expanding S, each step would break down these non-terminals into their components until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, after expanding S, each of the resulting symbols must match the tokens in the string. Let's denote the string as t1, t2, ..., tn, so in this case, t39, t5, etc.\n\nLet me try to trace back how the string could have been produced.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT82 NT22, then NT82 must be expanded to the first token, t39, and NT22 must be expanded to the second token, t5? Or is it the other way around? Wait, actually, the string is a sequence of tokens, so the expansion from S would first split into NT82 and NT22, which would produce two parts. Then each of those could be further expanded.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t39, which must come from the expansion of NT82 in the first step. Or wait, in the first step, S is replaced by two non-terminals, so the entire string must result from the expansions of both NT82 and NT22.\n\nSimilarly, if S was replaced by NT40 and NT77, then the first token would be from NT40, and the second from NT77. But in the string, the first token is t39. Looking at the productions for NT40, I see that there are multiple rules, such as NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, and a few direct terminals like NT40 \u2192 t28, NT40 \u2192 t39, etc.\n\nWait, hold on. The string starts with t39. So perhaps S was replaced by NT40 and NT77, but the first token is from NT40's expansion. Looking at NT40's productions, there is a rule that directly produces t39. So, if NT40 can produce t39 directly, that could be the first token. Then, the next token should come from expanding NT77.\n\nSo, let's tentatively say that the first token, t39, comes from NT40, which directly expands to t39. The second token would then come from expanding NT77. Let me check the productions for NT77:\n\nLooking back, the grammar for NT77 has a production NT77 \u2192 NT40 NT98. There's also NT77 \u2192 t15, perhaps? Wait, looking at the list, the rules mention NT77 \u2192 NT40 NT98 and NT77 \u2192 t17, maybe. Wait, checking:\n\nIn the grammar given, there's a rule for NT77 \u2192 t15 and NT58 \u2192 t17. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nThe rules include:\nNT74 \u2192 t17\n...\nSo, perhaps NT77 does have a direct expansion to t15? Wait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, the user input is a long list of grammar rules. Let's scan for NT77:\n\nYes, here's one: NT77 \u2192 t15.\n\nSo, NT77 can be directly expanded to t15. Alternatively, it can be expanded to NT40 NT98.\n\nBut in our case, the second token is t5. Let me check if t5 is compatible with NT77's expansion.\n\nWait, according to the grammar list, NT22 \u2192 t5 and NT22 can be expanded to both non-terminal and terminal results, but for NT77, it can be either NT40 NT98 or t15. Hmm, none of the non-terminals directly result in t5 unless we look at NT*\u2192t5.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, we have NT3 \u2192 t5 and NT0 \u2192 t6, but there's also NT22 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo, let's see: After S \u2192 NT40 NT77, the first token is t39 (from NT40). Then, the second token is t5. How?\n\nWait, if NT77 was expanded, the second token could be the first symbol of NT77's expansion. But NT77 can expand to t15 or to NT40 NT98. So, if the second token is t5, how does that happen?\n\nOption 1: NT77 \u2192 t15, so the second token would be t15, but in the string it's t5. Doesn't match.\n\nOption 2: NT77 \u2192 NT40 NT98. Then, the next token would be the first part of this expansion, which is NT40. But NT40's possible expansions include t39, t28, etc., but t5 is a terminal that non-terminals might produce.\n\nWait, but looking back: NT22 \u2192 t5. So, if NT40 expands to something involving NT22, maybe? Or perhaps there's another rule for NT40 that includes NT22 in the chain.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT40 has several rules, including:\n\nNT40 \u2192 t28\nNT40 \u2192 t39\nNT40 \u2192 t28 (redundant)\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT40 \u2192 NT82 NT35\nNT40 \u2192 NT39 NT9\n\nWait, but specifically, I see NT40 \u2192 t39 and t28. So, if in the expansion, we have NT40 \u2192 t39 or t28. So, in the case where the second token after t39 is t5, which isn't directly produced by NT40. So perhaps that path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial split isn't S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Maybe it's S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nLet's see: If S \u2192 NT82 NT22, then the first token from NT82 and the second from NT22.\n\nBut the first token in the string is t39. Let's see if NT82 can produce t39.\n\nLooking back: The grammar for NT82 is NT82 \u2192 t29 and also NT82 \u2192 NT71 NT0"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-517","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. The string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I'll note that the string is 43 elements long. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production can be two steps at most because in two steps, you can expand all non-terminals into terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to build a parse tree for the string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. Alternatively, I can try to identify if each part of the string conforms to the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S has two productions: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the string must start with either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77.\n\nLet me examine the first part of the string: t15 t5 t33 t17... Hmm, starting with t15, which is a terminal. Since t15 is a terminal, according to the grammar, I need to find which non-terminals produce t15.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT48 \u2192 t21, NT40 \u2192 t28, NT3 \u2192 t5, NT18 \u2192 t9, NT94 \u2192 t0, NT72 \u2192 t8, NT9 \u2192 t40, NT18 \u2192 t9, etc. Wait, no. NT40 \u2192 t28, but I also see NT94 \u2192 t0, and NT22 \u2192 t12. But t15 is another terminal. Let me check the productions for t15.\n\nLooking back, there's NT48 \u2192 t15, yes. So t15 can be produced by NT48. So the first symbol t15 must come from NT48. Let's see, in the string, the first symbol is t15, so the first token is NT48.\n\nBut wait, the grammar has S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So S must produce two non-terminals, each of which can produce more symbols. But in the string, the first symbol is t15, which is a terminal, so it's part of a non-terminal.\n\nLet me break it down. The string starts with t15, which must come from a non-terminal that can produce t15. From the productions, NT48 \u2192 t15. So, the first part is NT48. So, the first symbol is part of NT48.\n\nBut since S is the start symbol, the entire string must be derived from S, which can produce either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77. So, the entire string must be divided into two parts, each derived from NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77.\n\nLet me see the string as a sequence of symbols. If I assume the first part is NT40 and the second is NT77, or the other way around. Let's check which one starts with NT40 or NT82.\n\nWait, the string starts with t15, which we've established is part of NT48. But S must derive to NT40 NT77 or NT82 NT22. So the string must be split into two main parts, each part derived from NT40 or NT82 and NT77 or NT22 respectively.\n\nBut the first symbol is t15, which is part of NT48, which isn't part of S's initial options. So maybe that suggests that the string starts with NT48, which would normally be followed by another non-terminal. But S branches into two, so perhaps the string is part of one of the productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning and trying to match the productions.\n\nThe string starts with t15. From the grammar, t15 is produced by NT48 \u2192 t15. So, the first part is NT48.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t5. But NT48 doesn't directly produce t5. So, after NT48, we need another production. Wait, NT48 only has one production, which is \u2192 t15. So that's terminal, but after that, we need another non-terminal. Wait, maybe there's a longer expansion.\n\nWait, no. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So in this case, NT48 is only a single terminal, which would mean that the next symbol can't be another terminal unless it's part of another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. If nt48 produces t15, then the next symbol must be matched as the next production from the same non-terminal, but in this case, NT48 only has one production.\n\nThis suggests that the initial symbols might not align with the productions starting at S. Maybe I should consider that the entire string is split into two parts, each derived from the S's options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me start over.\n\nS can produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the entire string must be a concatenation of symbols that can be derived from either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77. Each NT is a non-terminal that can produce multiple terminals via their productions.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two possible parts: one starting with NT82 and the other with NT22, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the entire string is derived through a chain of productions.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's better to look for specific patterns. For example, looking for t15, which comes from NT48. So if I have NT48 in the string, I expect it to be followed by another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but S's productions are either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the entire string must be split into either NT82's derivation followed by NT22's derivation or vice versa.\n\nLet me try to split the string at each possible point to see if any split conforms to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nBut that might take a while. Alternatively, let's check if the total number of symbols is even or odd. The string has 43 symbols, which is odd. But each production in NT82 and NT22 would require even splits because each NT is expanded into two NTs or terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the longest possible terminals at the beginning.

So the first part is NT48. Then, the next symbols are t5, t33, etc. But NT48 only produces t15, so after that, perhaps the next non-terminal is NT something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

{"custom_id":"request-522","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. I remember that with Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because all the non-terminals are on the left side, and each only has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided is a bit complex, with a bunch of NTs and terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Let me write it down:\n\nt10 t23 t49 t31 t9 t40 t35 t0 t29 t17 t35 t31 t31 t29 t49 t0 t40 t8 t28 t17 t31 t23 t49 t8 t48 t10 t39 t33 t15 t12 t48 t23 t5 t9 t15.\n\nFirst, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar starts with S, and S has two NT82 and NT22, the string must consist of two parts. Let me break the string into two parts each starting from the beginning, because S \u2192 NT82 NT22 is the only way to split it into two.\n\nWait, actually, no. The starts are S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Each of these NTs can split further, so maybe the production will result in a tree, but each step only replaces one NT. However, since this is a string, perhaps each split needs to produce a sequence of terminals on both sides of the NT. Hmm, maybe it's better to consider the string as a concatenation of terminals generated by each production.\n\nLet's think about the structure. Each NT eventually must expand into a terminal. So, the entire string should be a series of terminal expansions from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many NTs have productions that expand into other NTs and a few terminals. But some NTs directly correspond to a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT22 can be 't23' or 't12' or 't5' or 't36' etc. Wait, the grammar shows multiple productions for many NTs. So, each NT can have multiple options. But for the string, we need to choose a sequence of productions that lead each part to the terminals in the string.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can approach it by starting from the string and try to see if each sequence of terminals corresponds to a possible derivation starting from S. Alternatively, perhaps we can use reverse engineering, working from the string backwards to see if each step can be matched by a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to try to build a parse tree for the given string and see if it fits the grammar.\n\nWait, but the string is 37 tokens long. It's t10, t23, t49,... up to t15. Let's count: 10,23,49,31,9,40,35,0,29,17,35,31,31,29,49,0,40,8,28,17,31,23,49,... Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the given string can be split into a sequence that starts with S. Since S is NT82 NT22, maybe the string starts with the expansion of NT82 and NT22 leading to t10 and t23 respectively. But wait, looking at the string, the first token is t10, which is part of the first NT, and the second is t23, which may or may not be part of the second NT.\n\nWait, the grammar's S production is S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So, the string would have two parts: the expansion of NT82 and NT22. So, the string should start with the expansion of NT82, followed by the expansion of NT22.\n\nSo, the first part of the string, before the split, would be t10 and possibly others, and the second part after the split would be t23 and the rest. Or perhaps the string is a concatenation of two expansions: one from NT82 and the other from NT22.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT82 NT22 directly. So, the string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT82 and NT22. So, I can split the string into two sections corresponding to each NT, then check if each part can be derived from each NT.\n\nSo the string is:\n\nt10 t23 t49 t31 t9 t40 t35 t0 t29 t17 t35 t31 t31 t29 t49 t0 t40 t8 t28 t17 t31 t23 t49 t8 t48 t10 t39 t33 t15 t12 t48 t23 t5 t9 t15.\n\nThat's 37 tokens. Let's see, perhaps the string for NT82 is the first x tokens and NT22 is the remaining. The question is, how to split them.\n\nLooking at NT82's productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\nBut NT82 itself can have productions. Wait, let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT82 rules:\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT22 NT34? Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, from the grammar:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\nBut where do NT82 produce?\n\nLooking for NT82:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 NT71 NT35 (I think), no.\n\nWait, looking through, I see:\n\nNT82 is expanded as NT74? Or maybe I'm looking at the NTs with higher indices. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, I'll list all the non-terminals and their productions more carefully.\n\nWait, for NT82, looking through the given grammar:\n\nAre there any rules where NT82 is on the left? Let me see: The given grammar includes NT82 as:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT9 NT40\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n\nIs there an NT82? Wait, let me check the list:\n\nWait, the given grammar has rules starting with S and then other NTs. Looking back, perhaps NT82 is a terminal? No, because the grammar rules are production rules, where NTs produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, some of the rules in the grammar include NT82...

The string is a list of tokens, each of which is presumably derived from a single terminal symbol. So each token in the string corresponds to the result of a production rule applied to a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the initial productions from S are:\n\n1.

No, unless there's a rule I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the entire production chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step, parsing the string using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the entire string as a series of substitutions, making sure that each token corresponds to a production.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.

The start symbol S has two productions: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSo the string must be a concatenation of two parts: one part starting with NT82 and NT22, and the other part starting with NT40 and NT77. Or the reverse.\n\nBut the given string has a lot of tokens, which need to be split into two parts, each part corresponding to one production from S.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens in the string to check the splitting.\n\nThe string has 38 tokens. So each S production would generate a certain number of tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-529","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the grammar. It's in CNF, meaning all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each production has at most two non-terminals on the right side, and some terminals. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar will start with two symbols from either NT82 or NT22 or the cross between NT40 and NT77. Wait, no, the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. But looking at the provided strings, it's a sequence of terminal symbols, so I need to see how these NT's and numbers are expanded.\n\nWait, the grammar has multiple productions for each NT. Let's list out the possible expansions for each NT. Maybe that will help in parsing.\n\nFor example:\n- S can go to NT82 and NT22. So, starting with NT82 or NT22.\n- Then, each of those NTs can expand further:\n  - NT82 \u2192 t29 (terminal) or NT77 (non-terminal) or others. Wait, looking at the production rules, NT82 has:\n    NT82 -> t29 | NT77 | other possibilities?\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar, the NTs are on the left as NT something, and the productions are written as NT36 -> NT18 NT77, etc. So each NT on the left (like NT36, NT22, etc.) can produce a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, the first production for NT is S \u2192 NT82 NT22, so S expands directly into two NTs. But let's list all the possible productions for each NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by seeing the string as a sequence of terminals, and see if it can be decomposed into the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string is: `t34 t5 t12 t28 t21 t9 t31 t34 t35 t34 t39 t48 t0 t33 t33 t35 t12 t35 t36 t23 t39 t40 t33 t17 t29 t21 t31 t9 t40 t23 t38 t35 t9 t38 t49 t17`\n\nThat's a long string with 39 tokens, all terminals. So the grammar must derive this by expanding into all these terminals.\n\nSince it's a tree structure, each production step contributes non-terminals that eventually expand into terminals or combine through productions.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string from left to right and see if there's a valid way to split it into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ambiguity of the grammar, perhaps a recursive descent parser would work, or using the CYK algorithm for parsing context-free grammars.\n\nBut since manually doing CYK might be cumbersome, perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string is correctly generated by the productions.\n\nLet's take the string step by step.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the string is supposed to be a derivation starting from S, and every step must follow the productions.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, let's see which NTs can generate each terminal and where.\n\nBut given that the grammar has multiple ways for each NT to expand, this could get complicated.\n\nPerhaps another way is to note that the grammar seems to have several productions for similar NTs leading to similar terminals. Maybe I can group some of them for simplicity.\n\nLooking at the NTs and their productions:\n\n- NT82 can produce t29 or NT77. From the grammar, NT77's productions include t15, t22, t36, t40, etc. But wait, let me list each NT's productions more clearly.\n\nWait, it might help to reorganize the grammar into a dictionary of NT \u2192 productions:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t29, NT77\n- NT77 \u2192 t15, NT82, NT0, NT17\n- NT40 \u2192 t9, NT22, t28, t40, etc. Wait, let's list all productions accurately.\n\nLooking again:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, t12\nNT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98, NT72\nWait no, NT22 is a non-terminal on the left. Let's see:\n\nEach line starts with an NT on the left, followed by productions:\n\n1. NT82 \u2192 t29 | NT77\n2. NT77 \u2192 t15 | NT82 | NT0 | NT17\n3. NT36 \u2192 NT18 | NT77\n4.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This structure helps in parsing, so maybe constructing a parse tree could be useful, but it's a bit complicated given the long string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, which produces two options: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. These seem like the top-level rules that any string must start with either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77. The string starts with t12, which is a terminal.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the string can be divided into segments that match the alternatives for S. Let's look at the first few tokens: t12, t48, t48, t49, etc.\n\nI think the best approach is to first check which of the two options for S can derive the string. Let's consider each case.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nThat would mean the string should start with NT82 and then NT22. Let's check the string:\n\nThe first token is t12, which I need to match against NT82 or NT22. Looking at the grammar, NT12 is defined as NT48 NT74. Wait, that's interesting. Let me trace NT12:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\nNT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3 (from the rules)\nSo NT48 is NT36 followed by NT3. Then, looking at the rules, NT36 is defined as NT18 NT77, and NT18 is NT19? Wait, looking back at the grammar, I notice that some NTs have different production rules. I'll need to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a recursive descent parser is not the way to go because the string is quite long. Perhaps using memoization or checking the steps methodically.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting lost. Maybe starting with the first token, t12, let's see what NT12 can produce. NT12 is defined as NT48 NT74, and each of those is further defined.\n\nSo let's expand NT12:\n\nNT12 -> NT48 NT74\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\n\nSo NT48 is NT36 NT3, and NT74 is NT58 NT98. Let's expand these:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\nNT18 \u2192 NT33 (since looking up, NT18 has production NT33, which is a terminal)\n\nWait, actually, the rules for NT36 are: NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, and NT18 \u2192 't33'. So NT36 is t33 followed by NT77. And NT77 is NT18, as per the grammar. Wait, no, looking back, NT77 is defined as NT40 NT17? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT77 is derived from NT40 NT17, but wait, let's check all the definitions:\n\nLooking for NT77, I see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT40 NT17. So NT77 is NT40 followed by NT17. \n\nSo, putting this together, NT12 would be NT48 NT74, which is (NT36 NT3) (NT58 NT98)\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77 \u2192 t33 (since NT18 \u2192 t33) and then NT77 \u2192 NT40 NT17.\n\nNT40 \u2192 let's see, NT40 has multiple productions. Looking back:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 or NT15 NT71. Hmm. Wait, no, look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, S is the start, but NT40 is a non-terminal. Let me find the rules for NT40. \n\nLooking for NT40 in the grammar:\n\nI see lines like NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 or NT94 NT0, etc. Wait, let's list out the productions for NT40:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT15 \u2192 't49' ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misfinding. Let me parse through all the rules again to make sure.\n\nActually, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and then each NT has its own productions. Let me reorganize the NT rules:\n\nNT12: NT48 NT74 \u2192 (NT36 NT3) (NT58 NT98)\n\nNT36: NT18 NT77 \u2192 (t33) (something)\n\nNT18: t33\n\nWait, no, is NT18 a terminal or a non-terminal? Looking back, I see NT18's definition: NT18 \u2192 't33', which is a terminal (since it's enclosed in quotes). So NT18 is a terminal, meaning I don't need to expand it further. Therefore, NT18 is 't33'.\n\nSo, revisiting NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77 \u2192 t33 NT77. Then, NT77 is NT40 NT17.\n\nNT40 \u2192 let's see its definitions. From the grammar, NT40 has these productions:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n\nWait, looking through the rules, here's where NT40 is defined:\n\nNT40: \n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, I don't see 'NT40' having other productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are multiple lines with NT40.

{"custom_id":"request-542","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar is a bit complex with a bunch of production rules, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and from the production rules, S can go to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So any string generated by this grammar must start with either \"t82 t22\" or \"t40 t77\" because the rules under S turn into terminal symbols. Wait, no, not exactly. The NT symbols on the left side are variables, and the right side are terminals except for the NT rules which have other NT symbols. So the process is about replacing non-terminals (NTs) until all are terminals.\n\nWait, but the string to evaluate starts with t12, which is a terminal, so the derivation must eventually produce t12 at some point before the strings that produce S. So maybe the entire string has to be derived by expanding S to two parts, each of which eventually resolves to t12, t9, etc.\n\nBut looking more closely, S -> NT82 NT22. The NT82 would produce something, and NT22 would produce something. So the entire string must be a pair of such productions. Looking at the given string, it's 37 tokens long, so that would imply a certain structure, but wait, in a Chomsky normal form, each production replaces a single non-terminal with two others, so the derivation tree is a binary tree. So the string length would have to be 2^n for n steps, but the given string has length t12... which is, let's count, the tokens are split as follows: 37 tokens, but wait, each expansion increases the number of symbols, but the end result is a string of terminals. So for example, S can become two NTs, each of which can again split into two more, etc., until we end up with just terminals. So the total number of terminals in the string would be 2^n where n is the depth of the derivation. For example, n=6 gives 64 symbols, n=5 gives 32, but the string here is 37, which doesn't fit exactly. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into two parts, each starting with a certain NT. So let's see the string: t12 t9 t35 t33 t38 t48 t34 t39 t40 t39 t33 t10 t49 t33 t28 t21 t9 t12 t0 t31 t15 t34 t5 t10 t10 t33 t34 t23 t29 t0 t49 t40 t34 t38 t40 t39 t8.\n\nWait, the string starts with t12, which is a terminal. Looking at the production rules, nt12 -> 't31' (so nt12 is t31), which is a terminal. Similarly, nt22 has rules that can produce t23, etc. So perhaps the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model this as a derivation tree. Starting from S, the first step is to produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Let's take the first option: NT82 and NT22.\n\nNT82: Looking at the rules, nt82 can produce which tokens? Let me check the given rules:\n\nLooking for nt82 in the production rules. Scanning:\n\n- NT82 -> 't29' (wait, no). Wait, wait, the left-hand side (LHS) is variables, and the RHS is either terminals or other variables. So for example, NT36 -> NT18 NT77. So NT74 -> NT58 NT98, etc.\n\nWait, let me make this clearer. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production is of a single non-terminal to two non-terminals or terminals. So to get a string of terminals, we have to expand each non-terminal step by step until all are terminals.\n\nGiven the string starts with t12, which is a terminal. So that would have come from a production rule where the LHS was a non-terminal, say A, and in that production, one of the symbols on the RHS was 't12'. Looking at the rules, I need to check which non-terminals can derive to t12.\n\nLooking for 't12' in the RHS of any production:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nnt12 -> 't31'\n\nNo t12 in the RHS except as a product of non-terminals. Wait, actually, looking again, perhaps the string starts with t12, which comes from nt12 -> t31, so if the first part of the string is t12, then maybe that's a way to start. But wait, the first token is t12, which would be the result of nt12 being replaced by t31, but then that's not t12. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nGiven:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\n\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\n\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\n\nNT72 -> NT82 NT35\n\nNT3 -> NT91 NT94\n\nNT12 -> NT48 NT74\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nNT94 -> NT9 NT12\n\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\n\nNT22 -> NT68 NT97\n\nNT94 -> NT72 NT95\n\nNT12 -> 't31'\n\nWait, so I see that NT12 has a rule -> 't31'. But the string starts with t12, which is a terminal. So maybe t12 is actually NT12, which is derived from t31. That can't be directly, because t31 is a different terminal. Hmm, maybe this indicates that in the initial expansion, one of the symbols is NT12, which is replaced by t31. So the string starts with t31, but the given string starts with t12. That suggests perhaps that the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string given starts with t12 as a terminal, which must come from some NT that directly produces it. But looking through the rules, is there any NT (nonterminal) that can produce 't12'? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't12' as a terminal. All the rules either split into other non-terminals or have 't's with numbers. Except, wait, the rule: NT12 -> 't31' and NT22 -> 't23'. So if the string starts with t12, that would mean that in the derivation, there was a non-terminal that was replaced by t12, but I don't see that in the rules. So perhaps my initial approach of S -> NT82 NT22 could lead to t12, but if the first token is t12, maybe it's from NT12-> t31, so perhaps the string is from a different part of the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me split the string into two parts based on the start of S. So the string must be formed by expanding S into two parts, each of which is then further expanded into the rest.\n\nSo the string starts with t12. Let's see if t12 is part of S's expansion. From S, we can go to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Let me try the first option: NT82 and NT22.\n\nNow, let's see if NT82 can produce t12. Looking through the rules for NT82: I don't see any production rule where NT82 goes to 't12'. The possible rules for NT82 are, for example, if there was a rule like NT82 -> t12 NTsomething, but I don't see that. So unless one of the other expansions leads to t12, but looking at the rules again, perhaps the NT12 leads to t31, but that's a different number. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider NT22. There's a rule NT22 -> 't23' and several others. So if I take NT22, it can produce t23, which is another terminal. But in the string, the first token is t12, which doesn't match t23, so that seems not to fit.\n\nWait, maybe the string isn't coming directly from S. But S is the start symbol, so any generated string must start from S. So the first symbol must come from S's production.

{"custom_id":"request-549","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. First off, Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific kind of context-free grammar where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That means every production has either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided has a mix of productions, some leading to terminals (like 't35', 't22', etc.) and others leading to non-terminals. The string I need to check is a sequence of terminals: `t35 t33 t6 t0 t6 t36 t33 t5 t31 t38 t40 t5 t34 t17 t49 t9 t0 t39 t28 t21 t38 t6 t10 t0 t38 t0 t21 t17 t21 t23 t33 t21 t9 t9 t15 t10 t34 t36`.\n\nThe goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, any parsing method like the CYK algorithm might work, but given the string length and the rules, maybe a top-down approach or backtracking could be feasible, though I'm more comfortable with CYK because it's systematic.\n\nBut before jumping into CYK, perhaps I should see if I can reconstruct the parse tree.

NT58 \u2192 't17'\n\nWow, that's a lot. Now, the string starts with 't35', 't33', etc. Let me note the first few tokens: t35, t33, t6, t0, t6, t36, t33, t5, t31, t38, t40, t5, t34, t17, t49, t9, t0, t39, t28, t21, t38, t6, t10, t0, t38, t0, t21, t17, t21, t23, t33, t21, t9, t9, t15, t10, t34, t36.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string has 36 tokens. Given that the grammar produces strings where each non-terminal step produces two tokens, the total length of the string should match the initial productions. Since the starting symbol is S, which produces NT...NT..., each of those is a two-symbol production, so the depth would be log2(n-1) or something. But perhaps that's more detailed than I need.\n\nLooking at S: S can be NT82 and NT22, which both are non-terminals and lead to terminals. For example, NT82 \u2192 't29' from production 23, and NT22 has multiple options, but some are terminals like 't23' from production 16. So to get 't35', which is in the string, I need to see which production leads to 't35'. Looking at production 28: NT36 \u2192 't35', so NT36 = t35.\n\nSo, to get t35, the previous step must be NT36. So building from the string backward, the last token before t35 is 't33', but perhaps it's easier to build from the end. Wait, no, parsing is usually done from left to right, but in CNF, it's leftmost derivation. Alternatively, CYK starts from the beginning and fills the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps checking for the leftmost derivation step by step would help.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to see which production rules generate t35. Looking at the grammar, t35 is derived from NT36, which is production 28: NT36 \u2192 't35'.\n\nSo the string starts with t35, which must come from NT36. So the first step in the parse would be: S \u2192 NT82 NT22, but wait, S can also be NT40 NT77. Hmm, maybe I should consider which non-terminals can lead to t35.\n\nLooking at the production for NT36 \u2192 't35' (production 28) and maybe others? Looking back, NT36 is only in production 28 as 't35' and production 3 as NT18 NT77, which doesn't help. So the first production must be NT36 \u2192 't35', but where does NT36 come from? NT36 is on the RHS of S only in production 3, but production 3 is NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77. So to get 't35', the starting S must go through NT36 \u2192 't35' somehow, but S only produces NT... So this suggests that the first step is S \u2192 NT... leading to NT36, but NT36 needs to be further derived into \"t35\".\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure this.\n\nThe string starts with t35, which is the first symbol. So the leftmost derivation starts with S \u2192 NT82 NT22, but wait, the first symbol is t35. But according to the grammar, S's productions are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT... But the starting token is 't35', which could only come from NT36, so that would require that S \u2192 NT36 ... but looking at the productions, S doesn't have NT36 as a left-hand side; instead, S goes to NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77.\n\nThis is a problem because the first symbol is t35, which only comes from NT36, but S doesn't produce NT36. Therefore, how can the first symbol be t35?\n\nWait, looking again at S's productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nNo production for NT36. So how can the first symbol be NT36, which would produce 't35'?

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. CNF means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and it's defined in two ways: S can be NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Each NT production leads to two other NT symbols, except for some that produce terminal tokens directly.\n\nThe string to verify is: `t31 t31 t23 t49 t12 t34 t9 t0 t49 t15 t29 t28 t34 t12 t23 t17 t34 t12 t6 t35 t23 t5 t38 t33 t49 t8 t5 t34 t31 t34 t29 t9 t35 t40 t12 t15 t31 t33`.\n\nI should check if each token in the string can be generated by the grammar. Since it's a top-down parser, I start from the start symbol S and see if each token can be part of a derivation. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Let's take each possibility and see which one can generate the first few tokens.\n\n1. The string starts with 't31' twice. Let's see where 't31' comes from. Looking at the grammar, NT12 -> 't31'. So, T12 appears multiple times in the string. Let's check if T12 can be part of a production.\n\nLooking at NT12:\nNT12 -> NT48 NT74\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT18 -> 't33'\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\nNT58 -> NT17 NT58 (Wait, that seems recursive but probably not part of this derivation. Alternatively, NT98 -> NT72 NT95.\nNT72 -> NT82 NT35\nLet's follow this path.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to process the string step by step.\n\nLooking at S, which is S -> NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nLet me consider the first possibility: S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nSo, after S, we have two terms: NT82 and NT22. Let's see possible productions for these.\n\nNT82: looking at the grammar, does NT82 have a production? Checking the rules, I see NT82 -> 't29' (twice) and NT68 -> 't5', but for NT82, in the given grammar, NT82 appears as a terminal.\n\nSpecifically, looking at ND82: NT82 -> 't29' is produced by two rules: NT82 -> NT35 -> ... eventually leads to 't29' (from the grammar, NT35 -> NT29, and so on). Wait, let me verify:\n\nWait, NT82 directly produces 't29' in two rules: NT82 -> 't29' (from NT35 and NT82).\n\nWait, perhaps I should draw the productions more clearly.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- S can be NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n- Other NT non-terminals have productions either to two other NT symbols or terminal tokens.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT82 -> 't29' (twice)\nNT71 -> 't36' or 't5'\nNT36 -> 't35'\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, the string starts with t31, t31, t23, etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see 't31' except in NT12 -> 't31'. So the first token must come from NT12.\n\nLet me try to think as a parser. At the top level, S has two symbols, each of which can be a NT. The first of the two symbols in S is either NT82 or NT40. Both must be expanded into the first token.\n\nBut the first token is 't31', which corresponds to NT12. So, how can the first symbols of S generate 't31'?\n\nLooking at S:\n\nS can be NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nLet's suppose that the entire string is generated as NT82 NT22. So NT82 is the first, and NT22 is the second. But the first token is t31, which comes from NT12, not NT82 or NT22.\n\nSo that can't happen. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order.\n\nWait, no. Each production of S produces a leftmost, then for rightmost or whatever, but in a top-down parser, typically it's leftmost. So the first symbol in the string is the first symbol of the leftmost NT symbol in S.\n\nIf S is split into NT82 and NT22, then NT82's first symbol would be 't29', since NT82 -> 't29'. But the string starts with 't31', so that's a problem.\n\nSo maybe the other option for S: S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nThen the first symbol is NT40, which should produce 't31'. So looking for NT40 -> 't31'. But checking the productions, NT40 appears multiple times but doesn't directly go to 't31'. Wait, actually, looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nIn the grammar: NT40 -> 't28', NT40 -> 't15', etc. Wait, perhaps I missed some.\n\nLooking at the given productions:\n\nNT40: \n- S -> NT40 NT77\n\nInside the rules, NT40 could be:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> NT48 NT98\nNT40 -> 't28'\nNT40 -> 't39' (wait, looking at the list, actually NT40 has several NT dependencies but also some terminal productions. Wait, checking:\n\nAh, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT40 appears as a terminal in two places:\n- NT40 -> 't28'\n- NT40 -> 't39'\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the beginning of the given grammar:\n\nYes, two lines:\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> NT48 NT98\nNT40 -> 't28'\nNT40 -> 't39'\n\nSo NT40 can generate either 't28' or 't39'.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with 't31', which would have to be generated by a different NT, but the S options only give us NT82 and NT22 in the first case, or NT40 and NT77 in the second. So T82 can't produce 't31', nor can T77.\n\nWait a minute, this suggests that the first token in the string can't be produced by the grammar. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe 't31' is from NT12, so that NT12 must come from one of the productions in S. Let me see how S can generate NT12. But in the given grammar, S only leads to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the NT12 is not directly under S but under those other productions. Thus, NT12 must come from the expansion of NT82 or NT22 in S.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the S rule is S -> NT... So S produces NT82 NT22 as two symbols. So for example, if S is NT82 NT22, then the string's first token comes from NT82.\n\nSo, that would imply that NT82 must produce 't31', but in the given grammar, NT82 only produces 't29' (twice). So that's impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if S is NT40 NT77, the first token comes from NT40. But NT40 doesn't produce 't31'.\n\nSo that suggests that the string can't start with 't31' because the start symbol S leads to NT82 or NT40, and neither generate 't31'.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the string starts with t31, so unless my analysis is wrong, but then it's impossible. But that might not be the case.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. Perhaps I missed that NT12 is part of a chain from other non-terminals. Let me see: NT12 appears as an option in other productions. For example, NT48 -> 't21' or could NT22 split into other things.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token must be derived from the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll note the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, meaning every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol is S, and the grammar has several non-terminals and terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S starts with NT and digits, like NT82 NT22 and similar. My initial thought is to try to break down the string into parts that correspond to the productions. \n\nThe string given is quite long, and each token must be part of a derivation from S. Since the grammar is quite complex, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to split the string into components that fit the productions. \n\nOne approach is to see if the string can be broken down into a series of terminals, potentially splitting at each production rule. But given that the grammar has many non-terminals, each step would produce two parts. Since the start symbol is S, which initially produces two NTs followed by numbers, but looking closely, the grammar seems to start with S \u2192 NT followed by a two-digit number, but wait, no, looking again, the production is S \u2192 NT82 NT22.

Let's see if we can split it into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nSince S starts with NT, and looking at the productions, the first step is to expand S into two parts, which are each NTs. For example, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, so NT82 and NT22.\n\nNT82 and NT22 are each non-terminals, which then expand further. Let's see what NT82 and NT22 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29 (from the given rules, I see NT82 \u2192 t29)\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nNT82 is listed in the productions as:\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29\nNT22 \u2192 t12, t23, etc.\n\nWait, hold on, the list of productions provided is a bit confusing, but I think the user listed all the productions with their right-hand sides. Let me scan through again.\n\nLooking at the given productions, some NT have productions that can produce terminals or other NTs. Let's list all the productions for each NT.\n\nStarting with NT82:\n\nNT82 -> t29 (from: NT82 -> t29, as per the user's list)\n\nWait, looking back, the user's list includes:\n- NT82 is produced by NT82 -> t29\n- NT72 is produced by NT72 -> t71 or t21?\nWait, in the user's list, there are multiple productions for some NTs. For example, NT72 has two productions: NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35 and NT72 \u2192 t8.\n\nSo, let me go through each NT and list all possible productions.\n\nLet me create a list for each NT with their possible right-hand sides (RHS):\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n   S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\n2. NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n\n3. NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, or 't22' (but in the given list, NT22's productions are: NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, and NT22 \u2192 't23', and NT22 \u2192 't22'? Wait, from the user's list, NT22 is:\n\n   NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n   NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n   NT22 \u2192 't23'\n\nWait, no. Looking at the user's list:\n\nThe lines are:\n\nS -> NT82 NT82\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\nNT72 -> NT82 NT35\nNT3 -> NT91 NT94\nNT12 -> NT48 NT74\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT94 -> NT9 NT12\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\nNT22 -> NT68 NT97\nNT94 -> NT72 NT95\nNT12 -> 't31'\nNT22 -> 't23'\n\nWait, perhaps the user's list is split across multiple lines. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\n- NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\n- NT12 \u2192 't31'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n\nWait, that seems like only 15 productions, some terminals. But in a Chomsky normal form, each production should have exactly two symbols on the RHS. But some of these seem to end in terminals. For example, NT12 \u2192 't31' is a single terminal, which would make it not in CNF form. Wait, that can't be. But perhaps it's a typo, and perhaps some lines are split incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the productions to be in pairs, but the way it's written is causing confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the last few lines are meant to be grouped under each NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT's productions are as follows:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, and then there's another production for NT22: NT68 NT97, and also 't23' and 't22'? Wait, that doesn't make sense because in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals. So, perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the productions.\n\nWait, maybe the user included some terminal productions, but in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So any production that ends with a terminal and has only one symbol on the RHS is okay. Wait no, because a terminal is a single symbol. So in CNF, a production can be A \u2192 a, which is allowed because a is a terminal, and it's considered a single symbol.\n\nWait, but then looking at the productions, for example, NT22 has:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\nNT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\nNT22 \u2192 't23'\n\nBut 't23' is a single terminal. That's allowed. Similarly, NT12 \u2192 't31' is allowed.

{"custom_id":"request-570","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side. \n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar consists of several non-terminals (like S, NT3, NT82, etc.) and terminals (like 't1', 't2', etc.). The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t8 t31 t33 t12 t29 t15 t23 t8 t10 t0 t31 t12 t5 t10 t36 t23 t33 t36 t15 t12 t40 t39 t21 t35 t48 t9 t0 t31 t33 t5 t38 t9 t49 t39 t5 t36 t34 t23 t10 t31`.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the process of evaluation typically involves parsing the string using a method like the CYK algorithm. However, doing the entire CYK table manually here might be time-consuming. Instead, I'll break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\nI'll start by identifying which non-terminals produce the terminals in the string. For example, looking at the production rules:\n\n- NT22 -> 't12'\n- NT22 -> 't23'\n- NT3 -> 't29'\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't40'\n- NT97 -> 't48'\n- NT48 -> 't36'\n- NT48 -> 't21'\n- NT18 -> 't19'\nWait, some of these might not be directly present. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see that some production rules produce specific terminals. For example, NT22 can become 't12' or 't23'. Similarly, NT36 can become 't35', etc. \n\nGiven the string, I can split it into tokens and see if each token can be derived from a non-terminal. Let's list the tokens in the string:\n\nt8, t31, t33, t12, t29, t15, t23, t8, t10, t0, t31, t12, t5, t10, t36, t23, t33, t36, t15, t12, t40, t39, t21, t35, t48, t9, t0, t31, t33, t5, t38, t9, t49, t39, t5, t36, t34, t23, t10, t31.\n\nNow, each of these tokens must be derived from some non-terminals in the grammar. For example, let's see:\n\n- t8: From the production rules, looking for NT that produce t8. Looking through the given rules, I see NT72 -> t8.\n- t31: Looking for non-terminals that produce t31. From the rules, NT12 -> t31 and NT22 -> t12? Wait, wait, no. Looking at the rules, NT22 has two productions: one to t12 and another to t23. NT12 is also a non-terminal, and one of its productions is -> t31. So, t31 can come from NT12.\n- t33: Looking for Non-Terminals that produce t33. NT3 can produce t33 via NT3 -> t5 and then NT5 might produce something else, but wait, actually, the rules for NT3: NT3 -> NT91 NT94. Then, looking at NT94, it can produce 't9', but wait, NT94 -> 't9' (from NT9 -> 't40', etc.). Hmm, perhaps that's not the right path. Alternatively, maybe I need to look for Direct productions where a non-terminal goes directly to t33. But in the given rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t33. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the production rules: I see NT22 has productions to t12 and t23. NT36 -> t35, etc. But I don't see any rule that produces t33 directly. So perhaps I need to follow the chain.\n\nLet me try t33.\n\nt33: So from the rules, perhaps NT94 can produce 't94' which may lead to t33. Looking at NT94's rules: NT94 -> NT9 NT12. Then NT9 -> t40, and NT12 can produce t31. Wait, but NT94 has two productions: NT94 -> NT9 NT12 and NT94 -> NT12 NT95. Wait, no, in the given rules, NT94 has NT94 -> NT91 NT95, but I don't see NT94 directly producing t33.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to find a way to derive each token step by step. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backward from the string.\n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that the grammar is B, and each production has either terminals or two non-terminals. Thus, the string can only be generated if it can be broken down into these non-terminals and terminals, respecting the grammar's rules.\n\nGiven the starting symbol S, the grammar starts with S. Looking at the production rules for S, it can produce:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo the S symbol can produce a sequence of two non-terminals. Let's check if the string starts with NT82 and NT22. The string starts with t8, which would come from NT72 (since NT72 -> t8). But wait, the first production from S is NT82 and NT22.\n\nLooking at NT82: One of the productions is NT82 -> t29. So if the first symbol is t8, that would require NT82 -> t29, but we have t8 first. That's a conflict. Alternatively, maybe the first two parts don't align.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's see: the entire string starts with t8, which must come from a non-terminal. Looking for non-terminals that produce t8: NT72 -> t8. So the first part of the string must have come from NT72. But the starting symbol S can only produce either NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77. So, can NT82 and NT22 derive t8?\n\nWait, perhaps not, because NT82 can only produce certain terminals. Let's see. NT82 can produce t29 and t34, according to the rules. So, if the first part is t8, it would have to come from NT72, but our S can't directly produce NT72. So unless there's a way to have the two non-terminals in the production for S to together produce the initial t8, but that seems impossible because NT82 and NT22 don't directly produce t8.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the derivation starts with S expanding into NT82 and NT22, which then recursively expand into the string. So, the entire string must be the result of expanding both NT82 and NT22 into sequences of non-terminals and terminals, and then concatenating their expansions.\n\nSo, the string is formed by expanding NT82 into a sequence and NT22 into another sequence, in that order, concatenated together.\n\nLooking at the string, which starts with t8, which would need to come from NT72. But how can NT82 derive t72? Because NT82 is a non-terminal, and its productions only lead to terminals like t29, t34, etc. So unless there's a way for NT82 to produce a sub-derivation that leads to NT72, which is then producing t8.\n\nBut wait, that would require that NT82 can produce a sequence that includes NT72. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the grammar's production rules, let's try to find a way for NT82 to produce a sequence that includes NT72 or another non-terminal that can lead to NT72.\n\nBut looking at the rules for NT82: NT82 can produce either 't29' or 't34'. So, since it's a single production to a terminal, it can't produce a non-terminal, so NT82 can't lead to NT72. Therefore, if the string starts with t8 (from NT72), it can't be derived from NT82, which is the first part of S's productions.\n\nAlternatively, if the entire string is produced by S through the production that includes NT40 and NT77, then perhaps the string starts with NT40"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check that rule: NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35. So NT72 is a non-terminal that can produce t8 because in the expansion of NT72, which is t8 and another NT35.\n\nWait, but the entire string must be derived from S, which starts with NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So let me see.\n\nThe input begins with t8, which could come from NT72. But NT72 is part of the S \u2192 NT72 NTsomething? Wait, the start symbols are S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then NT82 \u2192 t29, and NT22 can produce t23 or t12, etc. But that would result in t29 followed by something else, but the string starts with t8, which would have to come from NT72, which is part of the other alternative from S.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Let's see.\n\nNT40 can produce t39, t28, etc. Let's see if the string can start with t8. Wait, no. NT72 can produce t8 only when it's part of the production. So perhaps the initial step involves derivations into deeper structures.\n\nWait, maybe the string is being built in a way that uses multiple non-terminals. Let me try to parse the string step by step to see if it can be derived.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t8, t35, t21, t6.\n\nFrom S \u2192 NT72 NTsomething? Wait, no, S is initially S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So perhaps the derivation requires expanding from that.\n\nLet me simulate a possible derivation:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nNow, NT40 can produce either t39, t28, etc. Let's see if t8 can come from NT40. Looking at the rules, NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 or NT15 NT71 etc. But none of these directly produce t8, so NT40 can't produce t8 directly. Therefore, if the first symbol is t8, it can't come from NT40.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the string doesn't start with t8, unless it's produced by NT72, which is part of another production. Wait, but the initial productions from S are only NT82 NT22 and NT40 NT77. So the initial step cannot generate t8 unless it's part of NT72. But S can't produce NT72 directly.\n\nWait, unless in the expansion of NT82 or NT40, a non-terminal can lead to NT72, thus producing t8. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT97 \u2192 t48, but I'm not sure how that connects. Maybe it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to approach this is to use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But since the student is supposed to do it manually, maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be split into a sequence of productions. Since it's going to be time-consuming, perhaps a better approach is to see if it's likely.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the first symbol is t8, and I don't see a direct way for the initial productions (S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77) to derive a t8 directly, perhaps this string is not generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-581","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is produced by a context-free grammar (CFG) given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a way to structure CFGs where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplification helps in parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm, which can efficiently check if a string is generated by a grammar in CNF.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, let me check if it fits CNF. The start symbol is S, and the productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nOther non-terminals (NT) have productions that are all two non-terminals, except some have terminals:\n\nFor example, NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94, but wait, no, some produce a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74. Wait, that's a problem because in CNF, each production can only have two non-terminals or a terminal. So if any production has a mix, it's still fine, but in some cases, it's okay. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So if a production has a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74, which are both non-terminals, that's fine. Wait, no, wait. NT12 \u2192 NT48 and NT74. Wait, no, I'm looking at the given productions, and they all seem to produce either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, let me check all:\n\nWait, some of them produce a terminal and a non-terminal: For example, NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, but others like NT22 \u2192 't23' and NT94 \u2192 't34'. Oh, so in this grammar, some productions are terminals, which is allowed in CNF as a \u2192 a terminal. So, yes, this grammar is in CNF because each production on the right-hand side is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string provided is:\n\nt38 t23 t28 t40 t49 t34 t33 t9 t38 t9 t28 t6 t15 t8 t31 t36 t40 t28 t34 t28 t21 t0 t10 t8 t5 t36 t12 t17 t35 t33 t5 t35 t35 t21 t8 t21 t31 t36 t9 t31 t17.\n\nSo I need to check if this string can be derived by the given grammar.\n\nTo do this, I'll try to parse the string using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm is suitable, but I might try a more manual approach as the string is quite long.\n\nAlternatively, I can attempt to construct a derivation tree or apply the CYK algorithm step by step.\n\nLet me see the CYK algorithm steps. The CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell (i,j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nFirst, the alphabet is all the terminals (t38, t23, etc.) and the non-terminals are all NT symbols.\n\nBut given that manually building a CYK table for a string of 42 tokens is quite time-consuming, perhaps I can look for patterns or specific production rules that can help form the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the entire string can be built by applying the productions step by step, starting from S.\n\nWait, starting from S \u2192 NT82 NT22, the first step would produce a string consisting of two parts: the string derived by NT82 and the string derived by NT22. So the entire string must be the concatenation of two substrings, each corresponding to the strings generated by NT82 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the string, its first token is t38, so perhaps t38 is part of NT82's production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let me trace the possible derivations.\n\nLet me list the productions that produce t38 and see if it's part of NT82.\n\nLooking for where a production has 't38' on the RHS. Scanning the rules:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 t38.\n\nSo NT91 can produce t38. So if NT82 can derive a string that leads to t38, then NT82 must include NT91 in its productions.\n\nLooking at the production for NT82: according to the given rules, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, and looking at the other rules, I don't see NT82 directly producing anything. Instead, NT82 seems to be only on the left side of a production. Wait, let me look again:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29 is given? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t29: Yes, as per the given productions: NT82 \u2192 t29.\n\nWait, no, checking the initial list:\n\nWait, at the beginning, after the grammar, the string is given, and then the productions are listed. Wait, in the initial problem, the grammar is presented with S first, then S \u2192 NT82 NT22, and so on. Then the string follows. So the productions for NT82 are given in the rules. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT82: NT82 is referenced on the left side of these rules:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t29\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT22 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- No, wait, let's find if NT82 has any other productions beyond the initial S production.\n\nWait, reviewing the given productions:\n\nLooking for NT82 on the left side:\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nOther rules:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\n- NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\n- NT12 \u2192 't49'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- NT15 \u2192 't49'\n- NT97 \u2192 't48'\n- NT98 \u2192 't5'\n- NT18 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT82 \u2192 't29'\n- NT71 \u2192 't36'\n- NT71 \u2192 't5'\n- NT98 \u2192 't34'\n- NT22 \u2192 't12'\n- NT36 \u2192 't35'\n- NT48 \u2192 't15'\n- NT68 \u2192 't5'\n- NT35 \u2192 't29'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT94 \u2192 't0'\n- NT72 \u2192 't8'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28'\n- NT9 \u2192 't40'\n- NT18 \u2192 't9'\n- NT91 \u2192 't38'\n- NT95 \u2192 't10'\n- NT77 \u2192 't15'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT82 \u2192 't34' ???\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me organize the productions:\n\nEach production is left-hand side \u2192 right-hand side, with right-hand side either being two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, the only time a non-terminal is on the RHS without terminals is if it's part of a larger derivation.\n\nSo for NT82, from the list above, I see that NT82 appears as a production in:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- Also, from S \u2192 NT82 NT22, so S can produce strings starting with NT82 and followed by NT22.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, NT82 is only on the LHS of S and appears in the RHS of NT72.

Let me start by understanding the grammar. It looks like it's in Chomsky Normal Form, where each production is between two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: t5 t39 t38 t35 t31 t49 t39 t39 t23 t38 t29 t10 t10 t10 t5 t23 t28 t0 t5 t23 t40 t5 t28 t21 t28 t29 t9 t15 t8 t28 t5 t48 t48 t40 t10 t9 t8 t49 t17 t31 t31.\n\nHmm, that's a long string. Let's see if I can break it down. Since the grammar uses NT (non-terminals) and t followed by numbers, which are terminals, I can try to parse the string by matching the productions.\n\nStarting with the grammar's top-level rules: S can go to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Each of these leads to more splits. Let me see each part.\n\nLooking at S -> NT82 NT22: NT82 is a non-terminal. From the productions, NT82 -> t29. So that part would become t29. Then NT22 is another non-terminal; looking at its productions, NT22 can go to t12, t23, or t5.\n\nWait, but I need to see each possibility. Let me check the production for NT22: in the given grammar, the production NT22 has multiple options. Let me list them:\n\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n- NT22 -> NT68 NT97\n- NT22 -> t23\n- NT22 -> 't12'\n\nSo, both t12 and t23 are terminals, as they are in the form t followed by a number without leading letters. Now, if I take the first option, NT22 -> NT71 NT48:\n\nNT71: from the grammar, NT71 has two productions: -> t36 or t5. Similarly, NT48 has productions: -> t15 or t3.\n\nSo for NT71, if it's t36, then NT48 can be t15 or t3. So a possible subsequence would be t36 followed by t15 or t3.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have parts that might match this. Let me check the string: looking at the string, it starts with t5 t39... Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can expand into other rules. Let's try another approach. Let me pick the first alternative for S: S -> NT82 NT22. NT82 produces t29, so the first part is t29, and NT22 has several possibilities.\n\nIf NT22 produces t23, then the string starts with t29 t23. Looking at the given string: the first few tokens are t5 t39. That's not matching. So maybe S is the other option.\n\nThe other option for S is S -> NT40 NT77. Let's see NT40 and NT77.\n\nNT40 has several productions: -> t39, t28, t10, t9, t8, t49, etc. So NT40 can be t39, t28, t10, t9, t8, t49, or other options, but from the given list, the NT40 productions are:\n\n- NT40 -> t39\n- NT40 -> t28\n- NT40 -> t22? Wait, let me check the grammar. From the given grammar:\n\nLooking back, the productions are:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> t49\nNT40 -> t39\nNT40 -> t28 (from S's expansion? Wait, no, looking at each NT production:\n\nLooking specifically, NT40 has:\n\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- NT40 -> t49\n- NT40 -> t39\n- NT40 -> t28 (Wait, looking again, I think I misread. In the grammar, looking for NT40:\n\nNT40 -> t49\nNT40 -> t28\n\nWait, in the grammar, the lines are:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> t49\nNT40 -> t39\nNT40 -> t28\n\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar:\n\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- NT40 -> t49\n- NT40 -> t39\n- NT40 -> t28\n\nAh, but looking back at the initial grammar, I see:\n\n\"NT40 -> t28\" is one of the productions. So NT40 can produce t39, t28, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 is another non-terminal. Let me check the productions for NT77:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT77 in the list. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nThe given grammar is: \n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo NT77 is a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, do any other NT rule produce NT77? Let's see:\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see NT77 on the left-hand side except in S. So the only way NT77 can appear is in the expansion of S.\n\nBut now, looking at the grammar, I don't see any productions for NT77. That's odd. So NT77 is a non-terminal that's only used in S, but there's no rule for NT77. That suggests that NT77 must be able to produce something, otherwise the expansion would be incomplete.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar.

No, except in S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nWait, so is NT77 an error? Because in the given grammar, it's present as a part of S, but no production for NT77.\n\nThat's a problem. Without a production for NT77, the NT77 cannot be expanded into anything. But in the string, we have some tokens derived from NT77. For example, looking at the string, after t5, we have t39, t38, etc. I think there might be a misinterpretation here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-590","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is quite long, containing many 't's followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's a context-free grammar, so each production rule has a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. Starting with the start symbol S, which has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nI need to see if the given string can be derived from either of these.\n\nThe string is: t12 t9 t49 t48 t17 t0 t38 t9 t48 t49 t15 t38 t48 t23 t39 t38 t5 t48 t5 t21 t9 t15 t10 t36 t8 t17 t48 t49 t34 t38 t10 t6 t35 t34 t10 t34 t10 t12 t17 t5 t29 t10.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t12. I'll check the grammar rules to see if any non-terminals directly produce 't12'. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't31' (I think I saw that earlier, but wait, no\u2014the user input shows NT12 \u2192 't31' in the rules. But in the given string, the next after 't12' is 't9', which is not directly matching any of the rules for NT12. Wait, but in the rules provided, NT12 has two productions: one to 't31' and another to 't23'. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me check the rules again.\n\nIn the grammar, under NT12: NT12 \u2192 't31' and NT22 \u2192 't23' (apparently, as per the provided rules). So in the string, after t12, it's t9. So 't12' is produced by NT12, but then the next symbol is t9. But looking at the rules, after NT12, the next symbols must come from the expansion of NT12, which only gives terminal symbols. So if NT12's production is 't31', that would be t31. But in the string, after t12, it's t9, not t31, so that suggests that the grammar cannot generate this string, right? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again at the rules. The rule for NT12 is: NT12 \u2192 't31', which is a terminal. So if the string starts with 't12', it would require that the left-hand side of a production for NT12 is being expanded. But looking at the given string, after t12, the next symbol is t9. However, the only thing NT12 can produce is 't31', which is different. So perhaps this string isn't generated by this grammar because the first t12 can't lead to t9 next.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the rules. Let me check again: looking at the rules, under NT12, the production is NT12 \u2192 't31', so that's a terminal string. So how can the string have 't12 t9...' generated? Because 't12' is not an allowed terminal, unless there's a production for a non-terminal that produces 't12'.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me list all the rules to check if any produce 't12'. The rules for NT12 are:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't31'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n\nSo 't12' isn't directly produced by any production. Wait, that's a problem because the string starts with 't12', so the grammar can't generate it because 't12' isn't a terminal; it's produced by NT12, which would replace it with a terminal string.\n\nWait, no. In the given string, the first element is 't12', which would have to come from the entire NT12 production. But as per the grammar, NT12's production is only 't31', which isn't 't12'. Therefore, that suggests that the string can't be generated because the initial symbol 't12' can't be derived from any production.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the string is generated via a different path. Let me check if any other rules produce 't12'. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any other non-terminal that directly produces 't12'. So that's a problem. The string starts with 't12', which would require that the start symbol S expands into something that includes 't12' as the first symbol, but according to the given grammar, the first expansion of S is either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Both of these produce two non-terminals in the first step, meaning the first symbols would be whatever NT82 and NT22 produce. So if S \u2192 NT82 NT22, then the first two symbols would be the expansions of NT82 and NT22.\n\nLooking at NT82's production: NT82 \u2192 't29'. So first symbol would be t29, then NT22. Looking at NT22's rules, it has several productions, including \u2192 't23' and others. For example, NT22 \u2192 't23' is one option, which is a terminal. If the string starts with 't12', but NT82 produces t29, then the string can't start with t12 via that path. Alternatively, if S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then the first two symbols would be NT40 and NT77. Looking at NT40's production: NT40 \u2192 't28' (among others, but at least one terminal), so it's t28, then NT77. Looking at NT77's rules, it's \u2192 't15', so perhaps the first two symbols would be t28, t15. Again, not t12.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the string cannot start with 't12' because there's no way to derive 't12' directly from S. Therefore, the string is not generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-584","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and I'm provided with a string that I need to check against it. \n\nFirst, let me try to understand what CNF entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is useful because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm to be applied. But here, I might not need a parsing algorithm since the question doesn't mention it, but just need to see if the string can be derived.\n\nThe grammar provided has multiple productions, and each production is either combining two non-terminals into another or terminals. Let's see the structure.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's defined as S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the initial step is S, and each production leads into two non-terminals.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, it must be that the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of substitutions.\n\nLet me note that in the grammar, some non-terminals have productions that result in terminals or other non-terminals. For example, NT36 can go to NT18 NT77. But the goal is to see if through expanding each non-terminal into its components, it can build up the target string.\n\nBut the string provided is a long sequence of terminals: \n\nt39, t38, t38, t12, t48, t23, t12, t36, t15, t39, t40, t21, t23, t17, t15, t29, t0, t48, t33, t15, t9, t29, t31, t17, t8, t48, t0, t8, t40, t49, t21, t9, t5, t49, t31, t0, t31, t15, t49, t38, t40, t38.\n\nThat's 41 terminals. I remember that in CNF, each production is a single step, and since the string is a sequence, it might require multiple levels of expansions.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should trace if each terminal in the string can be derived from a single non-terminal in the grammar. That is, see which non-terminals have productions that include these terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see what non-terminals expand into these terminals.\n\nFor example, NT40 can expand into t28 (from S's production), but also has other productions like NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0. We also have NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71, NT97 \u2192 t48, and NT0 \u2192 t6 or t10. So, NT40 can also become t28 or t6 or t10 or combinations.\n\nWait, but let me check each terminal:\n\nLooking for each terminal in the string and seeing which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nList of terminals:\n\nt39, t38, t38, t12, t48, t23, t12, t36, t15, t39, t40, t21, t23, t17, t15, t29, t0, t48, t33, t15, t9, t29, t31, t17, t8, t48, t0, t8, t40, t49, t21, t9, t5, t49, t31, t0, t31, t15, t49, t38, t40, t38.\n\nI'll start by noting which non-terminals can produce each of these terminals.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n- t39: Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t39. Let's check. Looking through the productions, I see NT39 is not present, but maybe another non-terminal. Checking NT40 \u2192 t39? Let me see: Yes, NT40 has a production to t39, like S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and later NT40 has a production: NT40 \u2192 NT82 NT35, but I don't see a direct t39. Wait, in the given productions, is there a rule where NT40 \u2192 t39? Let me check. Looking back, the grammar shows:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nNT40 -> NT49 NT21\n\nAnd another one: NT40 \u2192 t28.\n\nWait, but where is t39 coming from? Because I don't see any production in the grammar that has t39 as a result. Hmmm. The string has t39 appearing twice, at the 10th and 11th positions. That's a problem because if no non-terminal can produce t39, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check all the productions again. Scanning all the right-hand sides for any having t39. Hmm, actually, looking at the productions, I think I only see NT40 being able to produce t39 once:\n\nSearching through the given productions, is there any rule that produces t39? Yes, NT40 \u2192 t39.\n\nWait, looking at the list, the rule NT40 \u2192 t39 is present: line 4: \"NT40 -> NT97 NT0\", line 12: \"NT40 -> NT15 NT71\", line 15: \"NT40 -> NT49 NT21\", line 19: \"NT40 -> t28\", and line 25: \"NT40 --> t28\". Wait, no, actually, looking back at the given grammar, the lines are:\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's written as a list of productions.

{"custom_id":"request-601","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is quite long, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that every production rule be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit CNF because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) consist of either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the structure is correct for CNF.\n\nNext, the goal is to check if the string `t10 t29 t38 t21 t39 t17 t35 t10 t17 t36 t21 t48 t35 t36 t9 t28 t36 t39 t9 t23 t33 t0 t34 t40 t21 t0 t33 t21 t10 t9 t21 t8 t49 t15 t12 t28 t28 t36 t6 t33 t36 t33 t34` is generated by this grammar. To do this, I'll need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of applications of the production rules.\n\nI think the best approach here is a derivation starting from S and seeing if I can match the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step will produce two symbols, so the number of steps needed will correspond to the length of the string divided by 2. Let's see, the string has 74 tokens. Hmm, wait, each step produces two symbols, so for 74 tokens, that would require 73 production steps. That seems a bit hard to manage manually, but maybe I can look for patterns or key nodes where the string's structure can be broken down.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to check if the string can be built upwards by the grammar. Alternatively, maybe looking for the presence of certain terminals in the grammar that correspond to the string. Let me list the terminals in the string: t10, t29, t38, t21, t39, t17, t35, t10, t17, t36, t21, t48, t35, t36, t9, t28, t36, t39, t9, t23, t33, t0, t34, t40, t21, t0, t33, t21, t10, t9, t21, t8, t49, t15, t12, t28, t28, t36, t6, t33, t36, t33, t34.\n\nLooking through these, I notice that some terminals appear multiple times, while others are unique. Let me try to see if any of these terminals can be at the start or end.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S. From the production rules, S can produce two options: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the initial productions from S will involve NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77. Therefore, the first two non-terminals in the derivation must be either NT82 and NT22 or NT40 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t10 and t29. Let me see what each production of NT starts with. For example, the production for NT82 is 't29', so if NT82 is part of the production, then NT82 \u2192 t29. Similarly, NT36 \u2192 t35, which is not the first symbol here. Let me check the productions for NT40 and others.\n\nWait, looking at the NTs and their productions:\n\n- NT22 has productions like 't23', 't5', 't28', etc.\n- NT82 \u2192 't29'.\n- NT40 has various terminal productions, including 't39', 't28', etc.\n- So, for the first symbols in the string, t10 and t29.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that NT10 is produced by NT97 and NT0, as per NT97 \u2192 t48 and NT0 \u2192 t6, and also NT94 \u2192 t0. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see that some rules have multiple non-terminals on the RHS. For example, NT77 can produce t15, but that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a top-down approach. Since the string starts with t10 t29, let me see if S can derive these.\n\nS can produce NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77. Let's see what NT82 and NT22 can produce. From the rules, NT82 \u2192 't29' when the next part is NT82. So if the first part is NT82, the first symbol is t29, which matches the second symbol of the string.\n\nSo if the string starts with NT82 t29, but the first two symbols are t10 t29. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, because NT82's production is 't29', which is a single terminal. So S \u2192 NT82 NT22 would mean that the first production is NT82 and NT22, which would be t29 followed by NT22's production.\n\nBut the first symbol is t10, not t29. So S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Let's see if NT40 can produce t10 as its first terminal.\n\nLooking at NT40's productions:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT40 \u2192 NT48 NT97\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT9\n- NT40 \u2192 NT18 NT9\n- NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT36\n- NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT71\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT0\n- Other productions for NT40 involve NT17 and NT58, not for t10.\n\nSo, looking for a production of NT40 that starts with t10. None of the rules for NT40 have a t10 as the terminal. Let me check all the RHS terminals for NTs:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't48'\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT82 \u2192 't29'\n- NT71 \u2192 't36' or 't5' depending on NT71 rules\n- NT48 \u2192 't15', 't21', etc.\n- NT35 \u2192 't29'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23', 't5', 't10' etc.\n\nWait, I'm looking for a production where NT40 produces a terminal t10. But none of NT40's productions directly produce t10. Instead, NT22 can produce t10. So maybe S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and then NT40 produces t10 via some derivation.\n\nWait, but NT40's production must be a combination of two non-terminals. So I can't directly get a terminal t10 from NT40. That suggests that the first symbol in the string must be from a non-terminal that can expand to t10, possibly after several steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbols in the string must be generated by a different production path. Let's consider that S can produce NT40 and NT77, so looking at NT40's productions, perhaps NT40 can derive to a sequence that includes t10.\n\nWait, but since each step produces two symbols, maybe I can model this as a tree, but it's getting complicated. Another approach is to model the string as a sequence and see if it can be split into pairs that match the production rules.\n\nThe string has 74 tokens. Since each production in CNF adds one symbol (each rule replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal), starting from S, after n steps, the total number of symbols would be 2^n. But we have 74 symbols, which is not a power of two. Wait, 2^6=64, 2^7=128. 74 is between. That suggests that this approach might not be feasible, but perhaps some non-terminals can produce multiple symbols. Wait, no, in a derivation using CNF, each non-terminal expands into two symbols at a time, so the number of symbols increases as 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 8, etc. So 74 isn't a multiple of 2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-595","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a series of `t` followed by numbers, like `t31 t29 t29 ...` and so on. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A CFG is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that all the rules on the left-hand side (LHS) are non-terminals, and the right-hand side (RHS) consist of exactly one or two non-terminals, except some have numbers. Wait, actually, in the rules like NT22 \u2192 't31', those are terminal productions where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, in this case, the grammar allows for both types of productions: A \u2192 BC and A \u2192 a. But since it's in CNF, the multi-step productions (with more than two symbols on the RHS) shouldn't be allowed. But looking closer, some rules like NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95 have two non-terminals, which is fine, but others like S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77 also have two non-terminals on the RHS. So the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, and each non-terminal on the LHS of the grammar's rules produces either another pair or a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of tokens, each starting with 't' and followed by a number, and some are just 't' followed by a number without a space, or maybe it's tokenized with spaces. I need to parse this string according to the grammar.\n\nI remember that to check if a string is generated by a grammar, especially in CNF, the most efficient way is to use the CYK algorithm. But since I'm doing this manually, perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t31`. Let's see which rules produce `t31`. Scanning through the RHS rules, I see NT12 \u2192 't31' and NT22 \u2192 't23', but wait, NT22 also has other productions. Let me check:\n\nWait, the rules for NT12 are:\nNT12 \u2192 't31'\nand elsewhere, NT12 appears in the RHS as well, like in NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, etc. So NT12 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal `t31` directly.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the string, the first token is `t31`, which must come from NT12 \u2192 't31'.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is matched by NT12.\n\nNow, looking at the next token: `t29`. What NT can produce `t29`? From the rules:\nNT3 has `t29` because NT3 \u2192 't5' in another production, but wait, no, looking at the rules again, I see NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, and somewhere else, maybe NT48 \u2192 't21', but `t29` would come from NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77 if one production of NT18 is 't33', or another rule? Wait, looking again.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each rule on the RHS is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77.

So, if NT72 is on one side, it will split into NT82 and NT35, which can be t29 and t15.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t10.

Let's suppose S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nNow, nt40 and nt77:\n\n- NT40 has productions like NT94 nt0, nt9, nt10, etc.\n- NT77 has production NT77 \u2192 NT74 and NT77 \u2192 NT74.\n\nWait, let's see. NT77 can be broken down into NT74 and NT74.\n\nThen NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98.\n\nWait, NT58 is a production: NT58 \u2192 NT57? No, wait the productions are mostly 2-terminals or two non-terminals. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the production NT74 is \u2192 NT58 NT98. So that would split into NT58 and NT98. Both are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT98: it can be either 't5' or 't34'. Also, NT98 \u2192 't5' in one production and another is NT98 \u2192 NT5, which seems incomplete. Wait, no:\n\nLooking back: NT98 is NT98 \u2192 t5 or NT98 \u2192 t34.\n\nSo NT98 can produce t5 or t34.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 \u2192 I don't see any production listed for NT58, so perhaps a typo? Wait, in the grammar, NT58's productions: Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT58: NT58 is listed in multiple production rules, but some have 't' endings. Wait, no: looking through the productions, I don't see NT58 as a non-terminal with multiple options. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nLooking again:\n\nYes, at the bottom, I see:\n\nNT58 \u2192 t17.\n\nAh, NT58 \u2192 t17.\n\nSo NT58 can produce 't17'. Similarly, NT35 \u2192 t29, NT57 \u2192 t49, etc.\n\nWait, so now, let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT74 NT74.\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98.\n\nSo, each NT74 becomes NT58 and NT98.

{"custom_id":"request-612","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar provided consists of several production rules. Each non-terminal symbol like S, NT, etc., expands into two other symbols. Some of these symbols are terminals, represented by 't' followed by a number, and others are non-terminals that need to be further expanded.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t0 t8 t17 t15 t5 t15 t15 t28 t28 t6 t9 t36 t28 t12 t39 t5 t31 t39 t39 t8 t28 t29 t38 t36 t12 t35 t33 t15 t39 t40 t38 t29 t39 t33 t12 t21 t5 t33 t8 t12 t28`.\n\nMy task is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nI remember that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal? No, wait, some are non-terminal plus terminal, but perhaps that complicates things. Wait, maybe I should double-check.\n\nWait, looking again, all the productions seem to be of the form A \u2192 B C, where B and C are non-terminals. Or some have a terminal on the right side? For example, looking at NT36 -> NT18 NT77, that's two non-terminals. But another rule like NT3 -> 't5' is a terminal. So, this seems to be a modified Chomsky Normal Form, maybe extended, because some productions include terminals.\n\nHmm, if that's the case, the grammar might generate strings by replacing non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nNow, the string provided is a sequence of t's. So, I need to see if this sequence can be produced by expanding the start symbol S.\n\nLet me outline the approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So, any string generated by this grammar should have a length that is a power of 2, considering the expansion steps.\n\nWait, the initial rule S has two symbols: NT82 and NT22. So each application of a rule increases the number of symbols by one. Let me check the length of the given string. The string is: t0 t8 t17 t15 t5 t15 t15 t28 t28 t6 t9 t36 t28 t12 t39 t5 t31 t39 t39 t8 t28 t29 t38 t36 t12 t35 t33 t15 t39 t40 t38 t29 t39 t33 t12 t21 t5 t33 t8 t12 t28.\n\nCounting the number of t's: let me count them:\n\n1. t0\n2. t8\n3. t17\n4. t15\n5. t5\n6. t15\n7. t15\n8. t28\n9. t28\n10. t6\n11. t9\n12. t36\n13. t28\n14. t12\n15. t39\n16. t5\n17. t31\n18. t39\n19. t39\n20. t8\n21. t28\n22. t29\n23. t38\n24. t36\n25. t12\n26. t35\n27. t33\n28. t15\n29. t39\n30. t40\n31. t38\n32. t29\n33. t39\n34. t33\n35. t12\n36. t21\n37. t5\n38. t33\n39. t8\n40. t12\n41. t28\n\nThat's 41 symbols. Wait, 41 is an odd number. But in a CNF grammar, each production step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, so the number of symbols should start at 2 (for the start symbol S) and double at each step. Thus, the length should be 2^k for some k.\n\nBut 41 is not a power of 2. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So, this suggests that the string is of length 41, which isn't possible because starting from S (length 2), each step increases length by 1 (since A->BC is replacing one symbol with two, so length increases by 1). Wait, but actually, when you expand via CNF, the length increases by one each time. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nIn CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. When replacing A with BC, the number of symbols increases by 1 (from 1 to 2). So for a given string, if it has m symbols, the derivation length is m-2 (since each step increases by 1, starting from S which is 2 symbols after 0 steps). So the total number of steps is m-2.\n\nSo the length of the string, 41, means m=41, so the number of steps is 39. Since each production increases the count by 1, the length must be 2 + 39 = 41.\n\nBut in this case, the grammar includes rules that can produce terminals. So, perhaps the string has more than just a chain of non-terminals. It's possible that the string is built by expanding non-terminals until we get terminals, and the overall length is the sum of the lengths of all terminal sequences.\n\nWait, but if each production step increases the count by 1, the total number of symbols should be 2 + (number of productions performed). Since each step adds one symbol, the length of the string should be 2 + n, where n is the number of production steps. So for a string of length L, L = 2 + n, so n = L - 2. For L=41, n=39.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the grammar includes non-terminals whose productions produce other non-terminals, so some symbols may not be terminals until they're expanded further. So, each non-terminal in the string must have a production that eventually terminates in terminals.\n\nTherefore, the string must be a fully expanded sequence where all non-terminals have been resolved. But the issue is that the string's length is 41, which isn't 2^(k), but it's possible that the expansion steps can mix non-terminals and terminals, leading to an arbitrary length. Wait, is that possible? Or is the length strictly determined by the number of steps, which would make it 2^k.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider. Let me take an example. Suppose the start symbol is S -> NT82 NT22, which produces two symbols, each potentially being a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nCase 1: If both NT82 and NT22 produce terminals, then the string would be length 2. So, S expands to two terminals.\n\nCase 2: If, say, NT82 is non-terminal and NT22 is a terminal, then S would produce two symbols, one being a terminal and the other a non-terminal, so the length would be 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again: in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal turning into two symbols. So, if I have a string of length L, it must have been derived by (L - 2) production steps starting from S, each production increasing the number of symbols by 1.\n\nWait, no, wait: each production step increases the count by 1 symbol (since 1 \u2192 2). So, for the initial string (length 2), 0 steps. After 1 step, length 3. After 2 steps, length 4. So generally, the length is n + 2, where n is the number of steps. So, the possible lengths are all integers \u2265 2. Wait, but in reality, every step adds one, so the possible lengths are 2, 3, 4, etc. Wait, no, no, wait: initial length is 2 (S is two non-terminals). Each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols, so each step increases the total count by 1, turning 2 into 3, then either 2+1=3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-631","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has rules defined for non-terminals (NT) that expand into other symbols or terminals ('t' followed by numbers), and the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these tokens.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF for a CFG requires that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that the left-hand side can also produce a terminal symbol. Wait, no, actually in pure CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But looking back, the user's grammar has some rules that produce multiple terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, which produces two terminals. Hmm, is that allowed in CNF? I think in CNF, each production can only derive two non-terminals, none of which are terminals. So terminals can't be on the right-hand side. But in the given grammar, some NT productions have terminal symbols on the right, like NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, but others have a mix of NT and terminal symbols. For example, NT22 can go to NT71 NT48 or 't23'. So 't23' is a terminal, and that's a production that's allowed because in CNF, you can have a production where a non-terminal expands into a terminal and a non-terminal (since a terminal is a single symbol). So each production is two symbols on the right.\n\nWait, but the right-hand side of a production can have any combination of non-terminals and terminals as long as it's directly producing a single symbol (terminal) or two symbols (non-terminals or a mix). So the grammar is in CNF because each production is A \u2192 BC (two symbols, terms or non-terminals), except when B or C is a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, it's usually that all productions are either two non-terminals or one terminal. That's correct. So in this case, all the productions are of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 t, except possibly when a production is two non-terminals and\/or terminals. Hmm, actually, the given grammar has some rules like NT0 -> 't6', so that's a single terminal. Another rule like NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, which is two non-terminals. Others like NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3, which would be a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, so the right-hand side has a mix of NT and terminals. Does that still count as CNF?\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and 'a' is a terminal symbol. So in this case, thegrammar allows for productions where two symbols are on the RHS, but those symbols can be a mix of NTs and terminals. That's not strictly CNF because CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals, not allowing terminals. So perhaps this grammar isn't in CNF? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the rules. Let me see the grammar again. The production rules are:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\n\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\n\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\n\nNT72 -> NT82 NT35\n\nNT3 -> NT91 NT94\n\nNT12 -> NT48 NT74\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nNT94 -> NT9 NT12\n\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\n\nNT22 -> NT68 NT97\n\nNT94 -> NT72 NT95\n\nNT12 -> 't31'\n\nNT22 -> 't23'\n\nNT15 -> 't49'\n\nNT97 -> 't48'\n\nNT98 -> 't5'\n\nNT18 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't5'\n\nNT0 -> 't6'\n\nNT82 -> 't29'\n\nNT71 -> 't36'\n\nNT71 -> 't5'\n\nNT98 -> 't34'\n\nNT22 -> 't12'\n\nNT36 -> 't35'\n\nNT48 -> 't15'\n\nNT68 -> 't5'\n\nNT35 -> 't29'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT94 -> 't0'\n\nNT72 -> 't8'\n\nNT40 -> 't28'\n\nNT9 -> 't40'\n\nNT18 -> 't9'\n\nNT91 -> 't38'\n\nNT95 -> 't10'\n\nNT77 -> 't15'\n\nNT40 -> 't39'\n\nNT82 -> 't34'\n\nNT48 -> 't21'\n\nNT74 -> 't17'\n\nNT58 -> 't17'\n\nWait a second, some of these productions have terminals on the RHS. For example, NT12 becomes 't31', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT22 can be 't23' or other combinations. So the production NT71 has two rules: NT71 -> 't36' and NT71 -> 't5'. So these are two separate productions, each producing a terminal. So in this grammar, the production is allowed to have a single terminal, which is permissible in CNF as a B \u2192 a production.\n\nHowever, in CNF, each production must produce either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So all rules must conform to that. In the given grammar, some rules have two non-terminals, some have a mix of a terminal and a non-terminal, and some are two terminals. For instance, looking at NT48 -> NT36 NT3: this is a non-terminal expanding into a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT3 is 't5', which is a terminal. So this production is NT48 -> NT36 and 't3', so it's NT36 followed by a terminal. Is that allowed in CNF? I think in CNF, the right-hand side must be a pair of non-terminals or a terminal. But NT48 -> NT36 and 't3' would allow that. So, for example, if you have A -> BC, then B and C can each be a non-terminal. Alternatively, A can produce a terminal. But in this case, the production is A -> B a, where B is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. That's allowed because in CNF, the productions are of the form A\u2192BC, A\u2192B a, etc., as long as it's a pair of two symbols on the RHS.\n\nWait, but no, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions must be two symbols on RHS, either two non-terminals or two terminals. Wait, no, no\u2014actually, the productions can be of two symbols, which can consist of one terminal and one non-terminal. So, for example, A \u2192 aB is allowed in CNF, where a is a terminal and B is a non-terminal. So as per this, the given grammar is in CNF because all production rules produce exactly two symbols, either both non-terminals, both terminals, or a mix of the two.\n\nTherefore, the given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nNow, the string to analyze is: t29 t10 t17 t29 t36 t10 t49 t23 t31 t17 t40 t33 t33 t38 t33 t34 t21 t31 t31 t12 t33 t21 t28 t38 t17 t28 t38 t36 t15 t23 t28 t6 t23 t34 t35 t29 t8 t28 t5 t35 t23 t38 t28 t40 t0 t10\n\nSo, this is a sequence of tokens, each being either a 't' followed by a number, which I assume matches the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nMy approach is to parse the string using the given CFG. Parsing such strings can be done by starting from the top symbol and breaking it down according to the grammar rules. Alternatively, I can build a parse tree from the string to see if it's possible to derive the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's quite long, so it's going to be a bit tedious. Maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is: t29 t10 t17 t29 t36 t10 t49 t23 t31 t17 t40 t33 t33 t38 t33 t34 t21 t31 t31 t12 t33 t21 t28 t38 t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That should make parsing easier, maybe a recursive descent approach or something similar.

The non-terminals are like NT36, NT22, etc. So the process would involve replacing non-terminals with their productions until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, to parse the string, perhaps I need to see if I can split the string into chunks that match the productions. Each production is either A->B C or A-> terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production has two non-terminals on the RHS, except maybe for the top-level production which could have terminals. Wait no, CNF requires all productions to be of the form A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal. So in this grammar, the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, but in the given grammar, some productions have non-terminals, others have terminals. Like NT36 -> NT18 NT77, so that's two non-terminals. But other productions like NT9 -> 't40' are single terminals.\n\nWait no, looking again: The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are either A->BC or A->a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So yes, some are two non-terminals, others are terminals.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be parsed using the given productions.\n\nApproach: Try to parse the string backward, starting from the end, maybe. Because sometimes that helps. Alternatively, try to identify possible splits at each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be represented as a sequence that follows the given productions. Let me list the start symbols: S can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. But S is non-terminal; in the string, the first symbol is t10, which is a terminal. So perhaps the entire string is generated by starting with S and expanding it step by step.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t10, and S's productions start with NT82 or NT40, which are non-terminals. So how can the string start with t10? That suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and I need to think differently.\n\nWait maybe the string is generated from S, but perhaps it's a right sentential form? Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire string as the right-hand side when expanded from S. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated by a sequence of productions that ultimately derive S to the given string through intermediate steps. Let's try to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire string as the sequence of symbols, and see if it can be broken down into a series of production applications.\n\nLet me start by looking for the possible first steps. The string starts with t10. Let me check if any production's RHS starts with t10. Looking through all productions, I see NT0 -> 't6' and NT0 -> 't10' as well. Also, NT40 -> 't28' and 't39', etc.\n\nWait, but the entire string is a sequence of terminals. So perhaps there's a way to split the entire string into parts that correspond to the productions. For example, if a production is NT40 -> NT9 NT18, then if the string has a part that starts with t40, it would be followed by the two symbols derived from NT9 and NT18.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be entirely derived from S by applying productions step by step.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string from left to right, trying to match the productions.\n\nStart with the first symbol: t10.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t10 is produced by NT0 as in two places: NT0 -> 't6' and NT0 -> 't10'. So t10 can be directly generated by NT0 as a terminal.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t10, which is derived from NT0.\n\nNow, the remaining string is: t8 t39 t12 t21 t49 t36 t29 t40 t8 t48 t36 t10 t29 t17 t48 t34 t35 t17 t36 t8 t9 t17 t48 t38 t9 t29 t5 t6 t34 t28 t15 t15 t31 t21 t0 t15 t5 t36 t40 t33 t38 t5 t38 t35 t28.\n\nSo after t10, we have t8, which is the next symbol. Let's see what t8 is produced by. Looking at the productions, t8 is produced by NT71: NT71 -> 't36' and NT71 -> 't5'. Wait, no, t8 is 't8', looking at the productions, is there any NT that produces t8 directly? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the NT productions: No direct t8 production. The only terminals are the 't' followed by numbers. So none of the NT symbols directly produce t8. So perhaps t8 must be part of a larger production.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the only productions that produce terminals are those where the LHS non-terminal reduces to a single terminal. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT9 -> 't40'\nNT18 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't5'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT82 -> 't29'\nNT71 -> 't36'\nNT71 -> 't5'\nNT98 -> 't34'\nNT22 -> 't12'\nNT36 -> 't35'\nNT48 -> 't15'\nNT68 -> 't5'\nNT35 -> 't29'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT94 -> 't0'\nNT72 -> 't8'\nNT40 -> 't28'\nNT9 -> 't40'\nNT18 -> 't9'\nNT91 -> 't38'\nNT95 -> 't10'\nNT77 -> 't15'\nNT40 -> 't39'\nNT82 -> 't34'\nNT48 -> 't21'\nNT74 -> 't17'\nNT58 -> 't17'\n\nSo from this, the terminals are generated by:\n- NT72: t8\n- NT74: t17\n- NT48: t21\n- NT36: t35\n- NT9: t40\n- NT18: t9\n- NT91: t38\n- NT95: t10\n- NT15: None, wait NT15 is not a terminal; in the grammar, NT15 is on the RHS of other productions, e.g., NT40 -> NT15 NT71, which is a production of NT40.\n\nSo, to get 't8', we need to have a production that produces it."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-641","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which has specific rules: each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which initially splits into NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So every derivation starts with one of these two options. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t40 t48 t23 t35 t49 t21 t39 t35 t6 t36 t29 t12 t6 t12 t36 t29 t17 t29 t5 t8 t40 t12 t8 t21 t21 t36 t15 t28 t21 t48 t12 t29 t15 t29 t31 t31 t34 t48 t38 t0 t5 t31 t6 t23 t49 t12 t35`.\n\nLooking at this string, I notice it's a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' seems to correspond to a specific production rule where the right-hand side (RHS) is a terminal symbol. The numbers are non-terminals. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nOne approach is to check each 't' against the production rules and see if they can be derived. Since the string is quite long, this might take a while, but I'll try to spot patterns or possible derivations.\n\nStarting from the beginning: 't40 t48 t23...' Let's see what production rules generate 't40'. Looking at the grammar, under NT40, we have several productions:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\nNT40 \u2192 NT9 NT12\nNT40 \u2192 NT18 NT9\nNT40 \u2192 NT94 NT5\nWait, I'm not seeing 't40' directly in the terminals. Hmm. Let me check again. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake. The string starts with 't40', which should correspond to a production rule where NT40 is expanded to a terminal or a combination that results in terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT40 appears in several productions. For example, NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0. So if NT97 and NT0 can be terminals or go further.\n\nLooking up NT97, the production is NT97 \u2192 't40'. Oh! So NT97 directly produces 't40'. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 't6'. So the production NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 becomes 't40 t6'. Wait, that's 't40 t6', but in the string, we have 't40 t48...'. Hmm, so maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT15 \u2192 't49', but NT15 isn't used here. Let's think differently.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't40 t48 t23...'. Maybe each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal that comes from a non-terminal's production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string backward, but that's often tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can see if each 't' can be matched by a non-terminal that has that terminal as an RHS.\n\nFor example, looking at the first 't40': what non-terminal can produce 't40'? From the grammar, NT97 \u2192 't40', and maybe NT94 \u2192 't0', but not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider each token in the string and see if each can be matched by a production rule.\n\nLet me list the string as a sequence of tokens:\n\n1. t40\n2. t48\n3. t23\n4. t35\n5. t49\n6. t21\n7. t39\n8. t35\n9. t6\n10. t36\n11. t29\n12. t12\n13. t6\n14. t12\n15. t36\n16. t29\n17. t17\n18. t29\n19. t5\n20. t8\n21. t40\n22. t12\n23. t8\n24. t21\n25. t21\n26. t36\n27. t15\n28. t28\n29. t21\n30. t48\n31. t12\n32. t29\n33. t15\n34. t29\n35. t31\n36. t31\n37. t34\n38. t48\n39. t38\n40. t0\n41. t5\n42. t31\n43. t6\n44. t23\n45. t49\n46. t12\n47. t35\n\nEach of these 'tX' represents a terminal symbol. So I need to check if each 'tX' is directly produced by some non-terminal, which means looking at the RHS of a production for that non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Because each production can be recursive. So perhaps each 'tX' must be generated by a non-terminal that can directly produce 'tX' or can go further down the chain to produce 'tX'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 'tX' must be the terminal in a production that can derive directly from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about this another way. Each 'tX' in the string must correspond to exactly one production in the grammar where that terminal is part of the RHS. So I can map each 'tX' to a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut I think a better approach is to try to see if the entire string can be parsed according to the grammar. That would involve trying to derive the string step by step using the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check each part of the string to see if each 'tX' can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLet me start with the first 't40'. Looking at the grammar, is there any production that directly gives 't40'? Looking at NT40's productions:\n\nWait, looking back, the productions for NT40 are:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\nNT40 \u2192 NT9 NT12\nNT40 \u2192 NT18 NT9\nNT40 \u2192 NT94 NT5\n\nNone of these directly give 't40'. So perhaps 't40' is the result of a longer chain.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at NT97: NT97 \u2192 't40'. So if a production for NT97 includes 't40', which might be part of a chain.\n\nBut the string starts with 't40', so perhaps NT97 is the non-terminal that produces it. So maybe the first 't40' is derived from NT97 \u2192 't40'. But then where does NT97 come from?\n\nLooking up NT97, its production is NT97 \u2192 't40'. So NT97 can directly produce 't40'. So does that mean that the first 't40' in the string is from NT97 \u2192 't40'?\n\nThen, the next step is NT97 is used as part of a production. Let's see. But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the entire string as a series of steps that each non-terminal can produce a certain sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated by breaking it down into parts that correspond to the grammar's production rules.\n\nWait, let me try to go through the string token by token.\n\n1. t40: as per above, NT97 \u2192 't40', so this could be from NT97.\n\nBut then what's the source of NT97? Looking at the grammar, NT97 is only on the RHS of production NT97 \u2192 't40', so it must be derived from some other rule that includes NT97. Wait, perhaps the initial S is expanding into S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSo let's think, the entire string's first two terms are t40 and t48. So S starts with NT40, as S \u2192 NT40 NT77 is one option, or S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Let's assume S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Then NT40 would produce t40 as above, but how?

{"custom_id":"request-636","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar has a start symbol S, and the rules seem to split the non-terminals into smaller parts. It looks like each production rule on the left side is replaced by two non-terminals on the right. This setup suggests that to parse the string, we might need a bottom-up or top-down approach, but since the grammar is in CNF, a top-down parser like the CYK algorithm could be applicable. However, since I'm just checking for generation, perhaps I can break the string down step by step according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of tokens: `t33 t49 t17 t5 t36 t39 t9 t28 t5 t15 t36 t31 t23 t28 t23 t48 t8 t35 t33 t8 t38 t15 t33 t10 t10 t21 t6 t6 t28 t29 t36 t36 t49 t6 t34 t38 t48 t31 t8 t10 t10 t15 t29 t40 t6 t49 t38`.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number seems to be a terminal symbol. The grammar contains rules where non-terminals are broken down into pairs of other non-terminals or 't' symbols. For example, S -> NT82 NT22, and NT82 -> t29. So, each non-terminal can be expanded into two parts, which can continue until we reach the terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to represent the string in reverse and attempt to find the leftmost derivations or perhaps see if the entire string can be broken down according to the rules. Alternatively, since this is a CNF grammar, the length of the string should be 2^n -1 for some n, but the string here has 73 tokens, which isn't 2^n -1 (since 2^6 -1=63 and 2^7 -1=127). So that might not help directly.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a tree where each rule splits a non-terminal into two parts. Since the start symbol S has two options, the string should be two parts, each derived from one of S's rules.\n\nLooking at S -> NT82 NT22 or S -> NT40 NT77. Let me see which parts of the string can be matched.\n\nLet me try starting with each option.\n\nFirst, option S -> NT82 NT22. Then, the string needs to be split into two parts: one derived from NT82 and the other from NT22. The total length is 73, which must split into lengths l and 73 - l where l is the length produced by NT82. Similarly for NT22.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT82 -> t29\nSo NT82 is a terminal, so it must expand to t29. That would be one token in the string. Then NT22 must expand into the remaining 72 tokens.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, NT22 has two production rules: NT22 -> NT71 NT48 and NT22 -> t23.\n\nSo if NT22 is to expand into t23, that would produce a single token, but in our case, after NT82 (t29), the rest is 72 tokens. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, NT22 must expand into two non-terminals.\n\nSo let's see if the next few tokens after t29 (which is the first token) can form a valid expansion for NT22.\n\nWait, no, actually, the first token is t33, which is part of the overall string. If S expands to NT82 NT22, then the string is the concatenation of NT82's expansion and NT22's expansion. So the first token after S would be the first symbol of NT82's expansion, and the next symbol(s) would come from NT22's expansion.\n\nWait, that might not be right. Because in the string, the order is t33 t49 t17 t5 ..., which would have to be generated by NT82's expansion followed by NT22's expansion. But let me check the grammar for NT82. From the given rules:\n\nNT82 -> t29. So NT82 can only expand into one terminal token, which is t29. Therefore, if S -> NT82 NT22, the first token of the string should be t29. But in the string, the first token is t33, which doesn't match. Therefore, this S production (S -> NT82 NT22) cannot generate the string because it starts with t29. So the string must be generated by the other production of S, which is S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nSo now, the entire string must be the concatenation of NT40's expansion and NT77's expansion.\n\nLet's analyze NT40 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT40's productions:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> NT9 NT12\nNT40 -> NT18 NT9\nNT40 -> 't' something? Wait, in the grammar, look for NT40's rules. Wait, from the given rules, NT40 has several options:\n\nLooking through the grammar provided:\n\nNT40 rules:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT40 -> NT9 NT12\nNT40 -> NT18 NT9\nNT40 -> NT36 NT31 \u2014 Wait, no, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT40:\n\nFrom the provided rules:\n\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- NT40 -> NT9 NT12\n- NT40 -> NT18 NT9\n- NT40 -> NT82 NT22\n\nWait, actually, earlier I thought S->NT40 NT77, and from the grammar, NT40 can be expanded into several options, including NT82 NT22, which might further expand.\n\nBut wait, if I'm starting with S -> NT40 NT77, then the entire string is the concatenation of NT40's expansion and NT77's expansion.\n\nThe first token of the string is t33, which must come from the first part, which is NT40.

{"custom_id":"request-644","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and the productions from S are either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77. Each NT symbol seems to produce other NT symbols until the leaves have terminals like 't6' or numbers. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't's with numbers, followed by some combinations. My initial thought is that each element in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar, perhaps one production for each step from the start symbol to each terminal in the string.\n\nSo, the string is: t6 t21 t35 t36 t10 t9 t36 t12 t34 t33 t39 t48 t36 t29 t17 t33 t39 t40 t0 t12 t33 t29 t34 t8 t38 t40 t38 t6 t39 t21 t9 t21 t12 t15 t39 t34 t34 t8 t9 t39 t15 t23 t10 t34 t36 t35 t48 t0.\n\nHmm, that's quite long. I think the approach here is to parse the string using the grammar, ensuring that each part can be expanded according to the rules. But manually doing this for such a long string is error-prone, so I might look for patterns or possible splits.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in Chomsky Normal Form either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the string must be produced by a deterministic path from the start symbol, step by step. So, each symbol in the string must come from a production, either directly or via other productions.\n\nWait, another approach is to construct a parse tree for the entire string. The start symbol is S, which can be NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the first token must be either NT82 or NT40, because S can only expand into those as its first step. But looking at the string, the first token is t6. Now, I need to see which NT symbols produce t6. Looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT-> t6: Yes, NT0 -> 't6'.\n\nSo, to produce t6, we must have NT0. Now, looking back at the grammar, the NT0 production is NT0 -> 't6'. So the expansion must be possible. Now, since S->NT40 NT77 or NT82 NT22, maybe t6 comes from a different part.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is too long for a step-by-step manual approach. Maybe I can model the grammar as a context-free parser and see if the string can be accepted. Alternatively, check for any possible conflicts or ambiguity in the grammar that might cause the string to be unparseable.\n\nAnother thing is that the production rules are quite specific for each NT. Each non-terminal seems to point to exactly one production. For example, NT0 only expands to 't6', so in any parse, 't6' must come from NT0.\n\nGiven the string's first token is t6, which is from NT0, and NT0 can't expand further since it only goes to 't6', that would mean the entire string must be derived from NT0? But S can't derive from NT0 directly because S is either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me re-examine. The start symbol S can produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Therefore, the first two symbols of any string generated by S must come from expanding one of these productions.\n\nBut the given string starts with t6, which as per NT0's production is a terminal. So, unless the first expansion involves NT0, but S can't produce NT0 as a single symbol. So, maybe the initial expansion is different.\n\nWait, no, perhaps in the first step, the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals, say NT82 and NT22. Then, each of those can expand further, potentially reaching the terminals in the string.\n\nSo, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be the result of expanding some NT. So, the string must be a concatenation of expansions from S and its descendants.\n\nGiven the string starts with t6, and the only NT that produces t6 is NT0, which is a terminal, I need to see if in the parse tree, one of the leaves is NT0 producing t6, and that the entire tree can cover the whole string.\n\nBut since S cannot directly produce t6 as a terminal, it must go through some expansions. So, perhaps the string must be built in such a way that all symbols are covered by the grammar, without conflicts.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should attempt to parse the string step by step, starting from S, and see if I can find a derivation.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Let's pick the first option, S->NT82 NT22.\n\nNow, the string starts with t6, but according to the grammar, NT82's expansion could be something else. I need to check what NT82 produces. Looking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT82 -> t29 or NT48 NT36.\n\nSo, the first symbol could be t29 if NT82 expands directly, but our string starts with t6, so perhaps this option isn't right. Let's consider the other option: S->NT40 NT77.\n\nThen NT40 can expand into multiple things. Checking the productions for NT40, I see NT40 -> t28 or NT39 NT0.\n\nSo, the first symbol could be t28, but our string starts with t6, so again, this seems off.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Since the entire string consists of a long sequence of terminals, each of which must be generated by some production. Let's list all the terminals in the string and see which NTs produce them.\n\nList of terminals:\nt6, t21, t35, t36, t10, t9, t36, t12, t34, t33, t39, t48, t36, t29, t17, t33, t39, t40, t0, t12, t33, t29, t34, t8, t38, t40, t38, t6, t39, t21, t9, t21, t12, t15, t39, t34, t34, t8, t9, t39, t15, t23, t10, t34, t36, t35, t48, t0.\n\nSo, first, t6 must come from NT0.\n\nNext, after t6, the next symbol is t21. So, the production after t6 must result in t21. Let's look for what produces t21.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT48 -> t21 or NT21? Wait, no NT21 seems to be a terminal. Wait, I need to check all productions for NTs ending with t21.\n\nLooking at NT21: I don't see any NT directly producing t21 except NT48, which is NT48 -> t21 or NT36 NT29.\n\nWait, no, I think I may have missed that. Let's check:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT48 -> t15, NC? No, looking at the list again.\n\nWait, let me correct that: NT48 is listed as:\n\nNT48 -> t15\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread. Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\n- NT22 -> ...\n\nBut I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's look for NTs that can produce t21.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nAh, here we go. NT48 -> t21 is not in the grammar as per the provided rules. Wait, let me scan through all the NT productions:\n\nLooking for any production that has 't21' as a terminal. Scanning:\n\n- NT36: no\n- NT22: breaks down into other NTs\n- NT74: breaks down\n- NT58: breaks down\n- NT72: breaks down\n- NT94: breaks down except NT40 -> 't40'.\nWait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-651","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should help because each production can be broken down step by step, and the string can be parsed by looking for these substitutions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t48 t33 t35 t12 t31 t21 t35 t34 t17 t31 t36 t34 t39 t35 t6 t8 t12 t28 t38 t6 t23 t21 t49 t15 t48 t9 t8 t40 t33 t49 t40 t48 t5 t38 t5 t48 t28 t39 t38 t23 t17 t28 t23 t29 t9 t21 t39`.\n\nFirst, I think I should start by understanding how the grammar works. Since it's in CNF, each non-terminal appears on the left-hand side of a production, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals (since each production is A \u2192 NT a NT). Wait, no, wait\u2014Chomsky Normal Form allows for A \u2192 a where a is a terminal, but each production has two non-terminals on the right might be because it's often presented as A \u2192 BC. Alternatively, sometimes the CNF is defined with A \u2192 a, but in CNF, all productions except the terminals are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. Wait, maybe that's the standard: each production is either A \u2192 a (for terminals) or A \u2192 BC (for non-terminals). So in this case, the given grammar has productions like S \u2192 NT82 NT22, meaning that S can be replaced by two non-terminals. Then, each of those non-terminals can further split into other non-terminals or terminals. So I think the approach is to parse the string by matching these productions.\n\nLet me look at the string and see if I can find any terminals. The string is composed of all terminals, so every part after S would be replaced by a series of non-terminals and terminals. Hmm, but the string has a lot of 't's followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals. So I need to map these 't' strings to the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some of the non-terminals have productions that end in terminals. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, which then each can be replaced. But if I'm trying to match the string, perhaps I should start from the beginning and see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, but manually expanding this would take a long time, so maybe I can think about the grammar as a series of production rules and see if each part of the string matches a rule or can be broken down into the required parts.\n\nI think a better approach is to model the derivation of the string step by step, starting from S and replacing non-terminals with their productions until I get to the string of terminals. Alternatively, since it's a bottom-up parser, I can split the string into parts and see if they correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as follows: the string is a sequence of terminals, which must be produced by the grammar. So each part of the string should be generated by the grammar through a series of substitutions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. But looking at the given grammar, many of the productions are of the form NTxxx \u2192 NTyyyy NTzzzz, so each of those non-terminals can be split until we reach terminals.\n\nWait, but each production in the grammar is either S \u2192 NTxxx NTyyyy or NTxxx \u2192 NTyyyy NTzzzz, etc. So the entire string must be built up starting from S, replacing S with two non-terminals, each of those non-terminals replaced as needed until we get down to the terminals.\n\nSo perhaps I should try to parse the string backward, splitting it into chunks that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe the better way is to model the string as a list and try to match possible non-terminal productions.\n\nLet me consider the entire string and try to find possible splits.\n\nThe string is: t8 t48 t33 t35 t12 t31 t21 t35 t34 t17 t31 t36 t34 t39 t35 t6 t8 t12 t28 t38 t6 t23 t21 t49 t15 t48 t9 t8 t40 t33 t49 t40 t48 t5 t38 t5 t48 t28 t39 t38 t23 t17 t28 t23 t29 t9 t21 t39.\n\nI think I can approach this by starting from the beginning and trying to match the first production.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols: t8 and t48. So perhaps this corresponds to S \u2192 NT82 NT22, but wait, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So S starts with NT82 or NT40.\n\nBut the first part of the string is t8, which is a terminal. So wait, maybe the first part is 't8', but S starts with NT, which is a non-terminal. Hmm, that might be a problem because S is a non-terminal, so the first split should be from S, which would produce two non-terminals, but the first part starts with a terminal. So perhaps that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the structure. Maybe each production is either a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me look again. The example grammar has S \u2192 NT82 NT22, so S can be split into NT82 and NT22. Each of those non-terminals can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for example, if I have 't8' as the first symbol, it must come from a production that starts with a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal's production either ends in another non-terminal or a terminal. For example, NT68 \u2192 t5, so that's a production that results in a single terminal. Similarly, NT31 \u2192 t31 is a production that directly gives the terminal 't31'.\n\nSo the plan is: start with the entire string. We can attempt to split it into two parts from the left or the right, each part matching a non-terminal's production.\n\nAlternatively, let's try the leftmost derivation: start from S and replace S with its possible productions.\n\nThe string starts with 't8', which could correspond to a production where a non-terminal is replaced by 't8'. Looking at the grammar, are there any NTs that produce 't8'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t29\n- NT40 \u2192 t40\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT22 \u2192 t12 or t23\n- NT74 \u2192 t17\n- NT58 \u2192 t17\n- NT72 \u2192 t8\n- NT15 \u2192 t49\n- NT97 \u2192 t48\n- NT98 \u2192 t5\n- NT18 \u2192 t33\n- NT3 \u2192 t5\n- NT0 \u2192 t6\n- etc.\n\nWait, I see NT72 \u2192 t8. So the production NT72 can produce t8.\n\nSo, the string starts with t8, which could come from NT72 \u2192 t8. So, if S starts with NT72, then the next step is to split the string after 't8' into another non-terminal's production.\n\nSo the string would be t8 followed by the rest: t48 t33 t35 t12 t31 t21 t35 t34 t17 t31 t36 t34 t39 t35 t6 t8 t12 t28 t38 t6 t23 t21 t49 t15 t48 t9 t8 t40 t33 t49 t40 t48 t5 t38 t5 t48 t28 t39 t38 t23 t17 t28 t23 t29 t9 t21 t39.\n\nWait, but NT72 is part of the production S \u2192 NT72 NT... Wait, looking back at the grammar, S's possible productions are S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77.

{"custom_id":"request-661","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> terminal. That should make parsing easier since we can use algorithms like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent with memoization.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of productions. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, except for 'S', 'N', or 'T', which are non-terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, I see that 'S' is the start symbol, and other NTs are non-terminals, but in the string, I see things like 't35', 't23', etc.\n\nSo, the string is all terminals, which are specific 't' values. The CFG's productions start with S -> NT... and all the terminals in the string must be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nMy plan is to represent the grammar in a tree structure and see if the given string can be derived. Alternatively, using the CYK algorithm might work, but I'm not sure about the specifics here.\n\nLet me start by mapping each 't' in the string to a production. For example, 't35' appears twice. Looking at the grammar, 't35' comes from NT35, which is defined by NT36 and NT22: NT36 -> NT18 NT77 and look into that.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n- NT18 -> 't33', so NT36 would produce 't33' and NT77. Then NT77 looks up its productions: NT77 -> NT40 NT98. Then NT40 can go to several things, like 't49' or 't39', etc.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe I can approach it step by step.\n\nEach production in the string must expand to the right symbols. Let's parse the string as if it's a leftmost derivation. The string starts with 't35', which comes from NT35. Wait, looking at the grammar, there is an NT35 rule: NT35 -> NT29 NT33. Wait no, NT48 -> 't15' is one rule, but in the given grammar, I need to check each NT.\n\nWait, let me list all possible NTs and their productions to find where each 't' can come from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NTs that correspond to each 't' must have a production that ends in that 't'. For example:\n\n- 't35' is generated by NT48: NT48 -> NT36 NT3. NT36 -> NT18 NT77, NT18->t33, so NT48 becomes t33 and something. Wait, no, NT48's rules are: NT48 -> NT36 NT3, and maybe others. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT48 -> NT36 NT3? Or am I mixing up the rules. Wait no, looking at the given grammar:\n\nThe production for NT48 is: NT48 -> NT36 NT3. So NT48 expands into NT36 and NT3.\n\nThen, NT36 -> NT18 NT77. NT18 -> t33, so that's how 't33' comes into play.\n\nWait, but the string has 't35' and 't39'. Let's see where 't35' comes from.\n\nLooking at NT35. Wait, do any NTs produce 't35'? Yes, NT35-> NT29 NT33? No, wait. Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking for NT that have 't35' in their body. For example, NT48 -> NT36 NT3. NT36 is another NT, so let's see: NT36-> NT18 NT77, NT18->t33, and NT77-> NT40 NT98. Then NT40 could be 't49' or another NT. Let's see NT98: the rule for 98 is NT98-> NT5 NT9. Wait, 5 is 't5', which is 't10'? Wait, no. Let's get back.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each 't' must be the result of a production that starts with it.\n\nLooking at the string: 't35 t28 t21 t23 t5 t31 t29 t29 t10 t39 t17 t33 t10 t28 t49 t21 t39 t21 t0 t34 t35 t38 t33 t40 t21 t5 t49 t5 t48 t9 t35 t33 t15 t15 t9 t31 t36 t28 t36 t39 t40 t6 t36 t10 t6 t17 t38 t9 t39'.\n\nThat's a long string. Breaking it down element by element:\n\n1. t35: So, which NT produces 't35' as a terminal? Looking through the grammar, I see that NT48 -> NT36 NT3. NT3 is 't5' or something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a tree from the top-down approach. Starting with S-> NT36 NT22 (or another alternative, but let's say NT36 NT22 for the first step).\n\nSo, S expands into NT36 and NT22. NT36 then can expand into NT18 NT77, which then can expand into t33 and something, but 't35' is not directly in that path. Hmm, perhaps I'm barking up the wrong tree.\n\nAnother approach: Each non-terminal must branch into other non-terminals, and terminals are the end points. So the string must be a sequence of terminal symbols that arise from expanding the non-terminals.\n\nPerhaps it's better to try to parse the string using a recursive descent parser, but that would require building an analysis table, which might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is at most two non-terminals, we can try to check if the string can be built by starting from S and expanding step by step.\n\nBut considering time, perhaps I can pick the first few tokens and see if they can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated by S->NT36 NT22. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the string starting with 't35'. Suppose the string starts with a derivation from NT35. So, NT35->? Well, according to the grammar, I don't see NT35 as a production. Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see any NT35 production. Wait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\n- S -> NT36 NT22\n- S -> NT40 NT77\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n- NT72 -> NT82 NT35\n- NT3 -> NT91 NT94\n- NT12 -> NT48 NT74\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT94 -> NT9 NT12\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- NT48 -> NT36 NT3\n- NT22 -> NT68 NT97\n- NT94 -> NT72 NT95\n- NT12 -> 't31'\n- NT22 -> 't23'\n- NT15 -> 't49'\n- NT97 -> 't48'\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT18 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT82 -> 't29'\n- NT71 -> 't36'\n- NT71 -> 't5'\n- NT98 -> 't34'\n- NT22 -> 't12'\n- NT36 -> 't35'\n- NT48 -> 't15'\n- NT74 -> 't17'\n- NT58 -> 't17'\n\nWait a second, looking through the grammar rules, I notice that some Nts directly produce terminals. For example, NT0 -> t6, NT3->t5, NT82->t29, etc.\n\nSo, each of these Nts that produce terminals can be considered as leaf nodes in the parse tree. So, when building the parse tree, these Nts will expand into the corresponding 't's.\n\nNow, looking at the string: I see 't35' appears twice. So, where does 't35' come from?

Let's note that both options start with NT followed by numbers, so the string must start accordingly.\n\nLooking at the first token of the string: 't8'. I'll check which non-terminals can produce 't8'.\n\nLooking through the grammar's non-terminals:\n- NT82: produces 't29', according to some rules. Wait, NT82 \u2192 t29, right? So, NT82 cannot produce 't8'; that's a problem.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t8. Let me check which non-terminals can derive t8.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 t5, NT22 \u2192 t12. Wait, but do any non-terminals directly produce t8?\n\nLooking at the rules: I don't see a direct production for t8. Let me check all productions:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t5\n- NT22 \u2192 t12 (multiple options)\n- NT82 \u2192 t29 (once)\n- NT36 \u2192 t35\n- NT40 \u2192 t28, t39, etc.\n- NT71 \u2192 t36, t5\n- NT77 \u2192 t15\n- NT18 \u2192 t33\n- NT3 \u2192 t5\n- NT0 \u2192 t6\n- NT94 \u2192 t9, t0, etc.\nWait, is there a non-terminal that produces 't8'? Let me scan all the right-hand sides.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 t5, NT22 \u2192 t12, NT36 \u2192 t35, NT40 \u2192 t28, t39, t48, t15, t71, etc. NT82 \u2192 t29, NT48 \u2192 t21, NT74 \u2192 t17, etc. Hmm, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t8. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The initial production for S is S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSo, if S turns into NT82 and NT22, the first tokens in the string should be whatever NT82 and NT22 can produce. But the example starts with t8. \n\nIf NT82 can't produce t8, then maybe it's impossible for S to derive t8. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a production that allows a non-terminal to derive t8.\n\nWait, let's check each non-terminal again:\n\nLooking through all the rules, every right-hand side is either a terminal or has two non-terminals. So, only the productions with terminals can contribute to the string.\n\nTo get 't8', we need a production where A \u2192 a where a is t8, but in the given grammar, I don't see such a production. Because all the terminals are 't' followed by digits, but none correspond to 8, except maybe in the right-hand sides.\n\nWait, looking again at the rules, I notice that NT82 \u2192 t29, and NT48 \u2192 t21, NT22 \u2192 t12, etc. I don't see any non-terminal that produces t8. So, if the string starts with t8, it's impossible because no rule allows a non-terminal to produce t8 as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-667","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of symbols like \"t31 t12 t38...\" and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions where each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Wait, no, wait. CNF is more specific: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Additionally, the start symbol cannot be on the right-hand side of any production except for the initial step.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that most rules are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, which fits the first part of CNF where each production is two non-terminals. Some rules directly produce terminals, like NT12 \u2192 't31', which aligns with the second part of CNF where a non-terminal can produce a terminal symbol. The start symbol is S, and the productions for S are S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. None of these have any terminals on the right, so they fit the non-terminal-only rule in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: \n\n`t31 t12 t38 t0 t12 t34 t6 t9 t12 t48 t36 t6 t12 t9 t34 t39 t12 t29 t5 t29 t8 t6 t29 t35 t33 t34 t21 t36 t15 t17 t5 t5 t48 t10 t12 t12 t36 t38 t23 t31 t39 t15 t31 t28 t6 t49 t48 t38 t39 t48`.\n\nMy approach is to use a top-down parsing method, such as the CYK algorithm, or to manually check if the string can be generated by the grammar by breaking down the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the string's length should be 2^n where n is the number of productions applied. But let's see: the string length here is 102 tokens. 2^6 is 64, 2^7 is 128. Wait, 102 is not a power of two. Hmm, but that might not be immediately helpful because in a leftmost derivation, each step can vary in how much it consumes the string.\n\nWait, but for a string generated by a CNF grammar, its length should be of the form (number of productions)^k, but actually, let's think about the possible derivation. Since each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each step can potentially increase the string's length by 1 if a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, or by 1 if a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, if a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, that step would produce a string of length 2, but the original step was a single non-terminal, so the overall string would increase by 1. However, when replacing non-terminals with more non-terminals, the number of non-terminals increases, and terminals can be produced at any point.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to see if the string can be split into valid constituent substrings according to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me note down some key points from the grammar:\n\n- NT12 can produce 't31', which is why the string has 't31' multiple times.\n- NT22 can produce 't12' via \"NT22 \u2192 t12\".\n- NT94 can produce 't9', seen in 't9' in the string.\n- Also, other terminals are present like 't0', 't5', etc.\n\nSo, let's look for occurrences of these terminals that match the productions.\n\nLet me start from the beginning:\n\nThe string starts with 't31 t12'. So, first, is 't31' produced by any rule? Yes, NT12 \u2192 t31. Then, 't12' is produced by NT12. So, the first part could be generated by NT12 \u2192 t31 t12.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT12 has a production rule as NT12 \u2192 't31' and another as NT12 \u2192 't12'. Wait, no, let's check the grammar:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, under NT15 there's a rule, but under NT12, the production is:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't31' \n\nand that's it. Wait no, checking the provided grammar, under NT12, it's:\n\nNT12 -> 't31'\n\nAnd another line says NT22 -> 't12' (twice, once under NT22 and once under NT12? No, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT22, line 6 is:\n\nNT22 -> 't12'\n\nThen, under NT3, we have something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. It looks like every rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, which is characteristic of Chomsky normal form. The start symbol is S, and it seems to expand into multiple non-terminals. The production rules are a bit lengthy, so I need to see how they can lead to the string in question.\n\nThe string is `t29 t23`. Since this is a sequence of two terminal symbols, I think I need to find a way for the grammar to generate this pair. Each 't' followed by a number probably represents a terminal symbol, and the numbers themselves are just labels. So, I'll break it down into `t29` and `t23`.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that S can expand into NT82 NT22 or other similar options. My goal is to see if these non-terminals can produce t29 and t23 respectively.\n\nStarting with the first part, t29. From the rules, I see that NT82 is a non-terminal that expands into 't29'. So, if one of the NT82's can become t29, that's good. Then, the other part is t23, which corresponds to NT22. Now, I need to check if NT22 can become t23.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT22, I see two possibilities: NT22 -> NT71 NT48 or NT22 -> 't23'. Wait, that's interesting. So, NT22 can directly produce 't23' without needing to expand further. So, if I can have NT22 generate 't23' directly, that would work.\n\nSo, putting this together, starting from S, I expand S -> NT82 NT22. Then, NT82 becomes 't29', and NT22 becomes 't23'. Therefore, the string 't29 t23' should be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if the NT22 rule is correct. Looking again, yes, there's a production NT22 -> 't23', so that's a direct derivation. Similarly, NT82 is directly 't29'. Therefore, the derivation path is:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22  \nNT82 -> 't29'  \nNT22 -> 't23'  \n\nSo, the string is formed as 't29 t23', which matches the given string.

{"custom_id":"request-10","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the string `t28 t15` can be generated by the given context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar. It consists of a set of production rules that rewrite non-terminal symbols (NTx) into other symbols. Terminals are the strings of digits prefixed by 't' like t28, t15, etc. Since the input string is `t28 t15`, I need to see if these terms can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the first production rule from S gives:\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, from S, we can derive either of these two pairs. The string we're checking is `t28 t15`, which is two terminals. Each of these must come from a derivation of the respective NT pairs.\n\nLet's process each part of the string separately.\n\n1. Handling `t28`:\nLooking for the production rules that produce t28. Scanning through the NT82 production rules, I notice:\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\nNT82 -> NT34 (two places, but same terminal)\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, there's an NT82 -> NT34. So NT82 can derive t34, but wait, no, in the rules, NT82 is represented as NT82 -> t29. Wait, no, looking back, no, I think I misread. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see:\nNT82 -> t29\nWait, no, the rules list multiple productions for each NT:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\nNT12 -> 't31'\nNT22 -> 't23'\n\nSo, for NT82, it's present in the list as:\nNT82 -> t29 as a production rule? Let me check:\n\nYes, here's a line:\nNT82 -> NT34\nAnd another line:\nNT82 -> t29.\n\nSo, NT82 can be either t29 or NT34. But the string has `t28`, so let's see if NT82 can derive t28. Wait, there's no rule where NT82 directly becomes t28. So maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe NT82 is part of a longer derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Each production rule either gives a terminal or another non-terminal. Let me think about the structure.\n\nLooking at the string `t28 t15`, each 't' is a terminal, but according to the rules, NT82 can produce t29 or NT34. Since t28 is not directly produced, maybe I have to look deeper into the tree.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The string is composed of two terminals, so both must be leaves in the parse tree. So each 't28' and 't15' must be the result of some derivation from their respective NTs.\n\nLet me tackle `t28` first.\n\nLooking for production rules where a terminal starts with 28:\n\nFrom the rules, NT40 has a production rule where it generates t28:\nLooking for 't28', I see:\nNT40 -> t28 (I think... Let's scan the list:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT40 -> t28 isn't directly there. Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT40 has a production rule:\nNT40 -> NT71 NT0\nAnd another:\nNT40 -> t28?\n\nWait, no, let me go through each line:\n\nHere are some lines:\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT48 -> t15\nNT40 -> t28 (Wait, is that correct? Let me check again.)\n\nWait, looking through all the rules:\n\nYes, in the rules:\nNT40 -> t28\n\nSo, NT40 can produce t28. Therefore, `t28` could come from NT40. So, if I derive NT40 -> t28, that's fine. But how do we get `t28 t15`? Probably as two separate NT productions.\n\nSo for `t28`, the possible NT is NT40 (as NT40 can produce t28). For `t15`, looking for NT productions that can produce t15.\n\nLooking for t15 in the rules:\n\nLooking through each line, I see:\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT48 -> t15\nNT24 isn't there, but looking further, I see:\nNT48 -> t15\n\nWait, let me make sure. Looking at the rules line by line:\n\nHere's a line:\nNT48 -> t15\n\nYes, so NT48 can produce t15. So `t15` can come from NT48.\n\nSo, putting this together, for the string `t28 t15`, the possible derivation is:\n\nStart with S -> NT40 NT77, then NT40 -> t28 and NT77 -> t15.\n\nWait, but NT77 can produce t15? Let me confirm. Looking at the NT77 rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, does NT77 have any production that leads to t15?\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT77 -> t15 directly. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT77-> t15. Hmm, I don't see that in the rules provided. So is that a problem? Because according to the rules, if NT40 -> t28 (from the rule NT40->t28), then NT77 needs to produce t15.\n\nBut looking at the rules, I don't see NT77 producing t15. Let me scan all the NT77 rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT77 lines:\nI see:\nNT77 -> t15\n\nWait, no, wait, in the list of rules, I see:\n\nLooking carefully, under the NT production rules:\n\nThere's an entry:\nNT77 -> t15\n\nWait, yes, here it is:\n\nNT77 -> t15\n\nSo, from NT77, you can get t15. Therefore, if NT77 is one of the parts, it can produce t15.\n\nWait, but in the cases above, when I parsed S -> NT40 NT77, then NT40 would produce t28 and NT77 would produce t15, which would result in t28 t15.\n\nSo that seems possible.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that NT40 produces t28, which is correct, and if NT40 is applied, then it's fine. \n\nBut wait, I need to think about the way the productions chain together. Let me create the parse tree in my mind.\n\nThe string is `t28 t15`, which is two tokens. So the parse would be for S to produce two NTs, each of which can generate a terminal.\n\nSo, starting with S:\n\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nThen, NT40 -> t28\n\nNT77 -> t15\n\nWhich gives the string t28 t15. Yes, that would be the case. So this should be a valid derivation.\n\nBut wait, I'm seeing another possible way: The other production for S is NT82 NT22. Let's see what happens there.\n\nIf we take S -> NT82 NT22, then NT82 must generate t28 and NT22 must generate t15.\n\nBut looking at the rules, does NT82 produce t28?\n\nI think earlier I thought that NT40 produces t28. But let me check again. The rules:\n\nLooking for NT82 -> t28:\n\nNo, in the rules, NT82 can be produced in two ways:\nNT82 -> NT34\nNT82 -> t29 (I think, from the list, but no, wait a second. Let me look again.)\n\nWait, in the rules, under NT82, is there a production that generates t28?\n\nLooking again, I think I confused NT82. Let me see all the production rules for NT82:\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\nLooking for NT82:\nLine: NT82 -> NT34\n\nLine: NT82 -> t29\n\nSo, from NT82, you can get either t29 or NT34.\n\nSo, if S is derived as NT82 NT22, then NT82 must produce t28. But does it? No, as NT82 can produce t29 or NT34. So unless NT34 can produce t28, which I don't think it does.\n\nWait, let's see where NT34 can go. Wait, looking at the rules, NT34 may not exist; perhaps I meant NT36. Wait, let me correct.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT36:\n\nYes, NT36 has a production rule:\nNT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by looking at the grammar and the string. \n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a. Here, the terminals are the `t` followed by numbers, like `t29`, `t5`, etc. The non-terminals are all the other symbols, like S, NT, and various NTxx.\n\nThe string we have is `t29 t5 t48`. Each of these is a separate token. Since the grammar is in CNF, each token must have been derived by a production that produces two symbols at a time, but since this is a single token, each `tX` must come from a production that directly produces that token. So, I need to check if each `tX` in the string is a terminal and if there's a production that allows this.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- `t29` appears as a terminal in NT82, NT48, and NT35. So NT82 -> t29, NT48 -> t29, NT35 -> t29.\n\n- `t5` is a terminal in NT18, NT07, etc. Wait, looking back: NT0 has productions to t6 and others, but also looking for t5.

So t5 comes from NT98.\n\nIs there a production in the grammar that generates `t5`? Yes, NT98 -> t5.\n\nSimilarly, `t48` is a terminal in NT74 and NT72.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals produce t48. NT48 has a production: NT48 -> t49 and NT48 -> t15? Wait, no:\n\nWait, let me look:\n\nLooking for t48, the productions are:\n\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3 \u2192 But this would be a non-terminal production. But the string has t48 as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me parse the grammar correctly. Each line is a production. So, for example, S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So S can be split into NT82 and NT22.\n\nBut to get the string `t29 t5 t48`, each of these t-values must be terminals that appear in the grammar.

I see that NT97 \u2192 't48'. So NT97 can produce t48. \n\nSo, the string has three tokens: t29, t5, t48.\n\nEach of these must be the result of some NT production. So, t29 is in NT82 or NT48, t5 is in NT18, NT0, or NT98, and t48 is in NT97 or NT94. \n\nNow, the way the string is generated in the grammar would require that each of these terminals is produced by the grammar in such a way that they combine to form the string. So, we need to see if we can derive the string step by step.\n\nSince it's in CNF, the process goes bottom-up, starting from the start symbol and building up to the string, or top-down, starting from the start symbol and trying to match the string.

So starting from S, each step splits into two, so the depth of the derivation would be two steps. Let's see:\n\nFirst step: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S\u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nSuppose the first step is S \u2192 NT82 NT22.

{"custom_id":"request-32","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t49 t36 t15` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Alright, let's start by looking at the grammar structure and seeing how it can derive strings, especially the ones that start with terminals like t followed by numbers.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is either a single non-terminal symbol or produces two non-terminal symbols. In CNF, each production on the left side leads to exactly two symbols on the right. This structure might help me parse the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The given grammar for S has two productions:\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must come from either of these two paths. Thus, the string `t49 t36 t15` must be derived from one of these.\n\nLet me see how S can start the process. Starting with S -> NT40 NT77 might be a good path because NT40 eventually leads to t49 via NT18. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at NT40:\nNT40 can produce either NT97 NT0 or NT15 NT71. Then NT15 goes to t49, which matches the first term 't49'. So the second part should handle NT77.\n\nWait, NT77's productions: NT77 can only produce NT40 NT35, but looking back, the grammar shows NT77's production as S->NT40 NT77, which might mean NT77 is used to produce more terms. But looking more closely, I think there might be a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar shows S -> NT40 NT77, and within the production rules for NT77, it's only listed as NT77 -> ... but when I look through all the rules, I don't see NT77 having a direct production except for possibly another rule. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT74, NT94, etc., but no NT77 except for S. So maybe I need to see how NT77 can be expanded.\n\nWait, actually, in the given rules, the non-terminals have various productions. For NT77, checking all the rules, it's only in the S->NT40 NT77, but looking at the rest, I don't see NT77 having any further productions. That can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, wait, the rules list each non-terminal and their productions. Let me look for NT77. From the list, I don't see NT77 having any productions except S. It seems like NT77 is only in the start symbol and nowhere else. That would be a problem because if I try to expand NT77, I don't have any rules for it, meaning it's a terminal already. But that doesn't make sense because in the string, it's part of a sequence like NT40 NT77, which the string breaks into t49 t36 t15. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the rules. Let me list all the productions more clearly:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nThen the other non-terminals:\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\nNT72 -> NT82 NT35\nNT3 -> NT91 NT94\nNT12 -> NT48 NT74\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT94 -> NT9 NT12\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\nNT22 -> NT68 NT97\nNT94 -> NT72 NT95\nNT12 -> 't31'\nNT22 -> 't23'\nNT15 -> 't49'\nNT97 -> 't48'\nNT98 -> 't5'\nNT35 -> 't29'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT82 -> 't29'\nNT71 -> 't36'\nNT71 -> 't5'\nNT98 -> 't34'\nNT22 -> 't12'\nNT36 -> 't35'\nNT48 -> 't15'\nNT68 -> 't5'\nNT35 -> 't29'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT94 -> 't0'\nNT72 -> 't8'\nNT40 -> 't28'\nNT9 -> 't40'\nNT18 -> 't9'\nNT91 -> 't38'\nNT95 -> 't10'\nNT77 -> 'something'?\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT77 having any direct productions except S. So is NT77 a terminal? Or perhaps there's a typo because in the S production, S -> NT40 NT77, but NT77 is not defined further. If NT77 is a terminal, then that would be 't...something', but according to the string, it's 't36' and 't15', so that can't be NT77.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me go through the rules carefully:\n\nLooking at all the rules, the only N terminals are those that have direct expansions into strings of terminals. For example:\n\nNT15 -> 't49'\nNT97 -> 't48'\nNT94 -> 't0'\nNT72 -> 't8'\nNT36 -> 't35'\nNT48 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't23'\nNT9 -> 't40'\nNT18 -> 't9'\nNT91 -> 't38'\nNT95 -> 't10'\nAnd others with rules that expand to 't' followed by numbers, like:\n\nS->NT40 NT77, and in NT77 perhaps it's supposed to have a production, but maybe I missed it. Alternatively, maybe the way the rules are written, some are missing.\n\nWait, perhaps the production for NT77 is missing. Because in the rules, I don't see NT77 having any expansions, except for S using it. That would mean NT77 is a terminal, but then why use it in a production if it's a terminal? So perhaps the grammar is invalid or perhaps a mistake was made.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way the rules are presented is causing confusion. Let me try to structure them better:\n\nThe N terminals are all those that have rules leading to strings of terminals. For example:\n\nLooking for NT77 in the rules, I don't see it producing anything. That would mean NT77 is a leaf node in the grammar, so it's treated as a terminal according to the rules. If that's the case, then in the string `t49 t36 t15`, the third part is 't15', which would come from NT15. So the production chain would involve NT40 NT77 becoming, for the first part, NT40 expanding to NT15 NT71, then NT15 becomes 't49', and NT77 would then need to become 't36' or something, but in the string, the next term is 't36', but wait, the string is t49 t36 t15, which would correspond to the order of the productions.\n\nWait, actually, let's consider how S -> NT40 NT77 could lead to the string.\n\nFirst, substitute NT40 and NT77 with their expansions:\n\nNT40 can produce NT97 NT0 or NT15 NT71. Let's pick the path that leads to 't49' because the first token in the string is 't49'.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT15: NT15 -> 't49'. So if NT40 expands to NT15 NT71, then NT15 is 't49', and NT71 is perhaps 't36'? Because in the string, after \"t49\" comes \"t36\".\n\nWait, but NT71 has two productions: NT71 -> 't36' or NT71 -> 't5'. So option 1: NT71 can become 't36', which would fit the next token 't36', and then NT77 would need to produce 't15', but wait, NT77 is supposed to be a terminal that's 't...' but I don't see NT77 having a production. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT77 doesn't need to expand, but I thought it does. Wait, maybe I've misunderstood the structure. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the S production's NT77 is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-48","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the string `t34 t36 t35 t5` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's see. First, I'll try to understand the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. Since all productions have two nonterminals (except maybe when terminals are involved), it's a good starting point. CNF helps in using parsers and makes derivations easier because each step produces two symbols.\n\nThe string is `t34 t36 t35 t5`. Since these are all terminals, I should check if there's a way to derive this sequence step by step.\n\nI think I'll work backwards using a top-down approach. Starting from the start symbol S, let's see how the string can be derived. The start symbol S can produce two different nonterminals: NT82 NT22 and NT40 NT77. So, any string derived from S will start with the first symbol of each of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t34. Let's see which productions can produce t34. I'll check the productions where the right-hand side (RHS) starts with t34.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71 (No, starts with NT15)\n- NT82 -> t29 NT71 (Wait, no. NT82 is a nonterminal that produces t29 and NT71. But t29 is a terminal. So, NT82 -> t29 followed by NT71. Hmm, but t34 isn't t29 either.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for productions where the first symbol of the RHS is t34. But looking through the productions:\n\n- NT82 -> t29 NT71 \u2014 the first symbol is t29, not t34.\n- NT48 -> t15 NT17 \u2014 first symbol is t15.\n- NT94 -> t9 NT12 \u2014 t9.\n- NT77 -> t15 \u2014 since it's a single terminal, does that mean it's just t15?\n- NT58 -> t17 \u2014 same issue.\n- NT68 -> t5 \u2014 single terminal.\n\nLooking again, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let's check all the productions more carefully.\n\nLooking at each production's RHS:\n\n- S -> NT82 NT22: Both NT82 and NT22 produce two nonterminals initially, but maybe I can get to terminals.\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77: Both NT18 and NT77. NT18: NT18 -> t33, so that's a terminal. NT77 -> t15 (since NT77 is defined as -> t15). So NT36 can derive t33 t15.\n- NT22 has multiple productions. For example, NT22 -> t23 is a terminal, but others like NT22 -> NT71 NT48. NT48 -> t15 and NT71 is another NT71 (from production NT71 -> t36 or t5?), wait no. Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking at NT71 -> t36 and also NT71 -> t5. So NT71 can produce either t36 or t5.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 -> t15, NT94 -> t0, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to break down the string into possible steps.\n\nThe string is t34, t36, t35, t5.\n\nLet me consider each symbol:\n\n1. The first symbol is t34. So the first part of the derivation must produce t34.\n\nLooking for which NTs can produce t34. Let's check each production where t34 appears in the RHS.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT77 is a terminal. No, it's a single terminal 't15', so that's not t34.\n- NT40 -> t28 is a single terminal. No.\n- NT82 -> t29, so that's not t34 either. Wait, NT82 -> t29 NT71, so first symbol is t29, which is not t34.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not looking correctly. Let me check all productions where the RHS starts with t34.\n\nLooking through all productions:\n\n- NT74 -> t17: No.\n- NT68 -> t5: No.\n- NT94 -> t0: No.\n- NT97 -> t38: No.\n- NT91 -> t38: No.\n- NT68 -> t5: No.\n- Wait, none of the RHS start directly with t34, except maybe when a nonterminal produces t34. But looking through the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing t34. Hmm, that's a problem because that means the first symbol t34 can't be produced by any NT except perhaps through some complex derivations.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check each production again carefully. Sometimes, in CNF, if the RHS is a single terminal (like NT36 -> NT18 NT77, where NT18 produces t33 and NT77 produces t15), so the combined RHS is t33 t15. Similarly, any production that leads to a terminal is essentially two steps at each point where a single terminal is produced.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. Maybe the start symbol S can produce S -> NT82 NT22 and S -> NT40 NT77. So, the string must be derived from one of these.\n\nLet's take the first option: NT82 followed by NT22.\n\nNT82's right-hand side: NT82 -> t29 NT71. So, NT82 produces t29 and NT71. Now, t29 is a terminal, so that handles part of our string. Then, NT71 can be split as NT71 -> t36 or t5. So, the first symbol is t34, but in this case, we have t29 followed by either t36 or t5. But our string starts with t34, so this cannot be the way.\n\nSo, the string cannot be derived from S's first production. So, let's look at the second production: S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nNT40 has several productions:\n\n- NT40 -> t28: a single terminal, but our string starts with t34, so no.\n- NT48 -> t15: no.\n- NT77 -> t15: no.\n\nWait, so neither of the initial productions from S can directly produce t34 as the first symbol because looking through all the RHS of NT40 and NT97 (since NT77 is a terminal 't15' and others don't have t34 as a terminal).\n\nWait, this suggests that perhaps t34 can't be produced. But that's strange because the user is providing a string, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the productions more carefully to spot any I missed where a derivation can lead to a terminal like t34.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe productions I have provided are a bit numerous. Let me list all the NTs and their productions to see where t34 comes from.\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\n- NT36: produce t33, followed by NT77 (which is t15), so it's t33 t15.\n- NT22 has multiple productions: some terminals, some nonterminals. For example, NT22 can be t23, or other combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about how each symbol in the string is generated.\n\nLet me try to parse the string `t34 t36 t35 t5` from left to right, trying to match each symbol with a production.\n\nFirst symbol: t34.\n\nI need to find a path where a NT produces t34 as the first symbol. But looking at all the productions, does any NT have a production that starts with t34? From the list:\n\n- NT36's RHS is two nonterminals: so if NT36 -> NT18 NT77, then we need to see where NT18 and NT77 produce the necessary symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps if I can find a sequence that after several steps arrives at t34. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not possible because none of the NTs produce t34 as the first symbol, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t34 directly or in a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at NT74 which has:\n\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98: Then NT58 -> NT17 NT17. And NT98 produces t5 or t34?\n\nWait, NT98 has production NT98 -> t3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-63","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is \"t34 t5 t9 t15 t5\", and the grammar consists of several production rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a string to be generated by a grammar. CNF grammars have each production rule on the left-hand side (LHS) as a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols. Some terminals can also appear, but each production has two symbols on the RHS. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice all the production rules end with two non-terminals or non-terminals and terminals, except for a few where a terminal directly follows. For example, NT40 -> NT97 NT0, and NT0 -> 't6', so in this case, one side can produce a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t34 t5 t9 t15 t5\". I'll need to break this down into tokens and see if they can be formed by the grammar. Since it's a leftmost derivation, I need to find a way to derive this string starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol S, I see two possible productions:\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, the first step is to choose one of these productions to start with. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nFirst possibility: S -> NT82 NT22\n\nNT82 and NT22 are non-terminals. Now, I need to see if NT82 can derive 't34' and NT22 can derive 't5 t9 t15 t5 t6'? Wait, no, because NT22 is just a single symbol, but the string has five tokens. Maybe I should think more carefully.\n\nWait, the string is five tokens: t34, t5, t9, t15, t5. Let's consider the product S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nSo, NT82 must derive the first token, which is 't34', and NT22 must derive the rest: 't5 t9 t15 t5'. Alternatively, maybe NT82 produces multiple tokens, but since NT82 is one non-terminal, each production can only expand one symbol at a time.\n\nWait, no. Each production is a replacement for a non-terminal. So each non-terminal must expand into the next part of the string. So, NT82 needs to expand into 't34' and then NT22 needs to expand into the remaining tokens. But NT22 is a single symbol, but the string after 't34' is four more tokens: 't5 t9 t15 t5'.\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT82 NT22, NT82 must somehow produce 't34 t5 t9 t15 t5' and NT22 must produce 't5', but that might not fit because NT22 has its own productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S -> NT40 NT77 is the correct path. Let me check that. NT40 and NT77. So, NT40 must produce the first token 't34' and then NT77 must produce the rest.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT40: \n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT97 -> 't48'\nNT0 -> 't6'\n\nSo, NT40 expands as NT97 NT0, which would produce 't48 t6'. But we need the first token to be 't34', not 't48 t6', so that might not work. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong because I might have gone past the first token. Let me retrace.\n\nSo, the string is 't34 t5 t9 t15 t5'.\n\nIf I take S -> NT82 NT22, then NT82 must derive 't34' and NT22 must derive 't5 t9 t15 t5'. So let's see what NT82 produces.\n\nLooking at NT82's productions:\n\nNT82 -> NT71 NT48\nNT71 -> 't36' or 't5'\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT18 -> 't33' or 't9'\nNT77 -> 't15'\n\nWait, this seems convoluted. Let me write down the possible expansions step by step.\n\nStarting with NT82:\n\nNT82 can go to NT71 NT48.\n\nNT71 has two possibilities: 't36' or 't5'. If it's 't5', then NT48 is next.\n\nIf NT71 -> 't5', then NT48 is next.\n\nNT48's production is NT36 NT3.\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT18 can be 't33' or 't9'.\nNT77 -> 't15'\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nNT82 -> NT71 NT48\nNT71 -> 't5'\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT18 -> 't9'\nNT77 -> 't15'\n\nSo, the expansion would be 't5 t15'.\n\nBut we needed 't34' as the first token. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT71 -> 't36', which is 't36', and then NT48 -> 't36' would produce 't36 t36' or further?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production is a two-symbol expansion, so each step in the derivation consumes one symbol.\n\nSo, in the string, the first symbol is 't34', which must come from NT82 expanding as 't34'. But looking at NT82's productions, there is no rule where NT82 directly produces a terminal. The first step for NT82 is to produce NT71 and NT48.\n\nSo, NT82 can't directly produce 't34' because its productions only lead to other non-terminals. Therefore, the first symbol 't34' must come from the expansion of NT82 via multiple steps.\n\nWait, but that would mean that NT82's expansion must result in 't34' as the first symbol. Let me check the productions for NT82 again.\n\nLooking at NT82's production: NT82 -> NT71 NT48.\n\nSo, to get a terminal, both NT71 and NT48 must expand into terminals. But neither NT71 nor NT48 directly produce a terminal in their immediate productions.\n\nNT71 can be 't36' or 't5' directly.\n\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3, which then would expand further.\n\nSo, the sequence would be:\n\nNT82 -> NT71 NT48\n\nIf NT71 is 't5', then NT48 would go to NT36 NT3.\n\nThen NT36 -> NT18 NT77.\n\nNT18 can be 't33' or 't9'.\n\nNT77 -> 't15'.\n\nSo, the expansion would be 't5 t36 t3 ...' Wait, no.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider building the string step by step from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to match is 5 symbols long: 't34 t5 t9 t15 t5'.\n\nWe have two possible starting productions: S -> NT82 NT22 or S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nLet's explore both.\n\nFirst, S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nNow, NT82 and NT22 each need to produce a certain number of symbols. Let's see if NT82 can produce the first two terms and NT22 can produce the rest, or vice versa. Wait, but NT82 is a single non-terminal, so each production step replaces it with two symbols, but each of those could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT82 can expand into multiple symbols, and I need to see if it can produce the sequence leading up to 't34'.\n\nFrom NT82, the first expansion is to NT71 NT48.\n\nNT71 can be 't36' or 't5'. If it's 't5', then NT48 is next.\n\nNT48's production is NT36 NT3.\n\nNow, NT36 -> NT18 NT77.\n\nNT18 -> 't33' or 't9'.\n\nNT77 -> 't15'.\n\nSo, starting from NT82:\n\nT1: t5\n\nThen, NT48 expands into NT36 NT3.\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77.\n\nNT18 -> t33 or t9.\n\nNT77 -> t15.\n\nSo, T2 could be t33 or t9, and T3 would be t15.\n\nWait, this seems like"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-66","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break it down. First, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar has these productions, and the string to evaluate is \"t29 t36 t35 t38 t0\". I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce two things: NT82 NT22 and NT40 NT77. So the first step is to see how the string could start. Let's consider each option.\n\nFirst option: S -> NT82 NT22. So the string starts with \"t29\". Let me check if NT82 can produce \"t29\". Looking at the productions for NT82, yes, NT82 -> t29. That's one spot filled.\n\nNow, the next part is NT22 producing \"t36\". Wait, the second token is \"t36\", so does NT22 have a production that starts with \"t36\"? Yes, look at the productions: NT22 -> NT71 NT48. So NT22 will break into NT71 and NT48. Now, the string after the first part is \"t36 t35...\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, after NT82 gives \"t29\", the next symbol is \"t36\". So let me clarify: the string is t29 t36 t35 t38 t0. So after the initial NT82 gives t29, the next part is NT22 giving \"t36\". But looking at NT22's productions, I can see:\n\n- NT22 -> t12 (so possibly \"t12\")\n- NT22 -> t23\n- NT22 -> t5 (wait, earlier it was t5 as well)\nWait, but in the given string, the second token is t36, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string step by step. The string is \"t29 t36 t35 t38 t0\", which has five tokens. So each non-terminal in the grammar expansion should correspond to one token in the string. So the initial S produces two non-terminals: NT82 and NT22, which produce t29 and t36 respectively. That takes care of the first two tokens.\n\nWait, but that can't be because S -> NT82 NT22 would produce t29 t36, which are the first two symbols, then we have t35, t38, t0 left. But that's only two symbols generated, leaving three more to produce. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait no, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step. Let me start with S.\n\nThe string is t29 t36 t35 t38 t0. So S must expand into NT82 NT22, because that's the only way to get a t29, which comes from NT82. So that gives t29, and then NT22 needs to produce the rest.\n\nWait, but NT22 can expand into either NT71 NT48 or other terminals. Wait, looking at the production rules for NT22: yes, NT22 -> NT71 NT48 is one option. So that would give us two more non-terminals. Let me see:\n\nAfter NT82 gives t29, NT22 gives NT71 and NT48. Now, the string so far is t29, followed by whatever NT71 produces.\n\nLooking at NT71's productions: NT71 -> t36 or NT5 of some sort? Wait, the productions for NT71 are: NT71 -> t36, NT71 -> t5. So can NT71 produce a t36? Yes, that's one of its options. So the next symbol t36 would be from NT71 -> t36.\n\nSo now we have t29, t36, and the remaining tokens are t35, t38, t0. Now, looking at NT48's production: NT48 can produce t15 or ...? Let's check.\n\nLooking at NT48: NT48 -> t15, or looking at other rules: Does NT48 have more options? Wait, looking back, I think NT48 has multiple productions. Let me check:\n\nAh, the grammar has:\n\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\nNT48 -> t15\n\nSo one of the options is t15. But in our case, after NT71 gives t36, NT48 would need to produce t35, t38, or something else? Wait, no, because the next token after t36 is t35, so we have:\n\nt29, t36 (from NT71) and then we have NT48, which can either produce t15 or further expand into NT36 and NT3.\n\nWait, but t35 is the next token, so maybe NT48 has to produce t35 through another path. Looking at the productions, does any non-terminal lead to t35? Let me check.\n\nLooking down the list, NT35: Wait, NT35 is part of NT48's production: NT48 -> NT36 NT3. So perhaps NT36 can produce t35.\n\nWait, but NT36's productions are:\n\nNT36 -> NT35\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nWait, no. Let me actually list all the productions for NT36:\n\n NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n NT36 -> NT35\n NT36 -> NT91 NT94\n So yes, NT36 can produce NT35. So if we take NT36 -> NT35, that gives us t35 as the next token. So then, after t36, we have t35.\n\nSo next in the string is t35, which comes from NT36 -> NT35. Then, the next token is t38.\n\nWait, but if NT48 -> NT36 NT3, and we have just consumed the NT36 producing t35, then we need to handle the remaining part. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try building the parse tree step by step, ensuring that each part of the string matches the derived symbols.\n\nLet me start with S -> NT82 NT22. \n\n- NT82 -> t29, which matches the first token.\n\n- Now, NT22 needs to produce the rest of the string after t29, which is t36 t35 t38 t0. So NT22 must produce t36 t35 t38 t0, which requires that NT22 can expand into t36 followed by t35, t38, t0. But looking at the productions for NT22, it either expands into NT71 NT48 or other terminals.\n\nWait, but terminal symbols can only generate themselves. So if NT22 has a production that can produce a terminal, that's a possibility. Looking back, I see that NT22 also produces 't23' and 't12'. So maybe NT22 can generate 't23' directly, but the second token is 't36', so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, NT22 can produce t36 by first producing NT71, which can then produce t36.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nThe string is t29 t36 t35 t38 t0.\n\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n\n   NT82 -> t29 (matches first token).\n\n   Remaining: t36 t35 t38 t0.\n\n   So now we have to derive t36 t35 t38 t0 from NT22.\n\n   But NT22's productions are mostly non-terminals except for a few terminals:\n\n   NT22 -> t12\n   NT22 -> t23\n   NT22 -> t5 (wait, earlier I thought it was t5, but in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nLooking back, here are some productions:\n\nNT22 -> t12\nNT22 -> 't23'\nNT22 -> 't5'\n\nSo some options for NT22 give terminals like t12, t23, t5. But the second token is t36, which isn't one of those. So that can't be right.\n\nWait a minute, that suggests that my initial approach is incorrect because NT22 doesn't produce t36 directly. So perhaps the initial grammar expansion is wrong, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT22 also has the production NT22 -> NT71 NT48.

The string to evaluate is `t29 t36 t35 t38 t40 t31`. Hmm, right. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific characteristics: each production rule has either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. That might help in parsing the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, there are several production rules. The start symbol is S, and it immediately branches into NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the string we're evaluating starts with t29 and t36. Let me look at where these come from.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that NT82 and NT22 are each terminals. Specifically, NT82 becomes 't29' and NT22 can be multiple things: NT71 NT48, 't12', or 't23'. Wait, our string starts with t29 and t36. Hmm, but S starts with NT82 NT22. So the first part of the string should be t29 (from NT82) followed by whatever NT22 produces.\n\nLooking at NT22, the first option is NT71 NT48. The next options are 't12' or 't23'. But our string's second element is t36. Wait, that doesn't match. NT22 doesn't have a production that gives t36 directly. The second part of the production is NT22, but the options are NT71 NT48, 't12', or 't23'. So that doesn't give t36. But in the string, after t29 comes t36. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I need to backtrack. Maybe I'm mixing up the parts. S is NT82 NT22, so the string is t29 (from NT82) followed by the expansion of NT22. But the second element in the string is t36, not t22. So that might not fit. Unless I've misunderstood something.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the string is being generated in a different order. But no, in this case, the production starts from S and branches out, so the order is fixed as per the leftmost derivation. So the string must start with t29 followed by whatever NT22 can produce in one step.\n\nLooking at NT22's production: NT22 can be broken down into NT71 NT48, 't12', or 't23'. None of these produce t36. So that seems impossible. Unless I'm missing some other production that could lead to t36 somewhere else.\n\nWait, but maybe the second part is not directly NT22. Let me think about the overall structure. The string is t29 t36 t35 t38 t40 t31. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStart with S -> NT82 NT22 \u2192 t29 followed by NT22.\n\nNT22 can be 't23' (if the second production is 't23'), but the second element is t36, so that doesn't match. Alternatively, if NT22 is NT71 NT48, then the next elements would be t71 and t48. But t36 isn't there, so that's no good.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different way the string can be generated? Or perhaps I'm looking at the production in the wrong way. Let me check all the NTs again.\n\nLooking at NT74: no, that's 't17'. NT72: 't8'. NT22: 't12' or 't23'. NT35: 't29'. NT48: 't15' or 't41'? No, looking back, NT48 can produce 't15' when it splits into NT68 NT97, which becomes 't5' and 't8', but that's perhaps too far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with S as NT40 NT77. Wait, no, no, because the first symbol in the string is t29, which comes from NT82, as S's first production is NT82 NT22, which gives t29 and whatever NT22 gives.\n\nWait, but S could also produce NT40 NT77. However, the first symbol in the string is t29, which doesn't come from NT40 or NT77, because NT40 is 't28' or 't15' from some rules, and NT77 is 't15', but that doesn't help. So the string can't start with t29 if S is NT40 NT77.\n\nSo the only possibility is that S is NT82 NT22. Therefore, the first symbol is t29, followed by the production of NT22. But the next symbol is t36, which isn't among the options of NT22's production. Therefore, this string can't be generated by the given grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake in the order. Let me double-check the grammar. S can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. The first part is definitely NT82, giving t29, then NT22, but the second symbol is t36, which isn't in NT22's options.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. Each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, which has two productions: S -> NT82 NT22 and S -> NT40 NT77. So, the initial expansion starts with either NT82 and NT22 or NT40 and NT77.\n\nThe string we're checking is a sequence of terminals: t34, t5, t9, t15, t38, t0. Since the grammar only has NT and t terminals, the string should consist solely of t's with numbers as subscripts. Each t must have been expanded from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, each non-terminal either splits into two other non-terminals or a terminal. Let's try to see how the string can be derived.\n\nThe string has six terms. Starting from S, which is two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can produce another two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each expansion step can potentially double the number of symbols, but since we're dealing with a specific string, the structure must match exactly.\n\nLet me map the string step by step:\n\n1. The string starts with t34, which must match a production of a non-terminal. Looking at the productions, NT34 doesn't exist, but wait, the string is t34, so perhaps NT34 is part of a production. Wait, checking the productions, I see NT48 -> t15, NT74 -> NT58 NT98, etc., but nothing directly for t34. Wait, looking at the NT rules, for example, NT48 can produce 't15', but in the string, we have t34 first. Let's see where t34 comes from.\n\nLooking through all NT rules, I see that NT36 -> NT18 NT77, and NT74 -> NT58 NT98. Hmm, perhaps t34 is derived from NT48 -> t15, but wait, t15 is part of the string as well. Maybe the string comes from expanding S and each step correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string backward. Each step in the derivation must produce the next part.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, let's see:\n\n- t34: Is there an NT that can produce t34? Looking through the productions, I see NT34 isn't present. But wait, the NT rules include NT82 -> t29, so that's a t29, not t34. Similarly, looking for t34, maybe it's produced by NT82 -> t29, but no, that's t29. So maybe t34 comes from NT58 or another NT. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, in the NT production list, I see:\n- NT48 -> t15\n- NT68 -> t5\n- NT35 -> t29\n- NT82 -> t29\nSo, none directly produce t34. Wait, perhaps t34 is part of a higher-level NT that produces two symbols which then produce the required terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too short or the order of terminals doesn't match any possible derivation.\n\nWait, another approach: Each non-terminal can only produce two symbols (non-terminals or terminals). So the initial expansion from S gives two non-terminals, say X and Y. Each of X and Y will expand into two more, giving four symbols. Then, each of those expansions will give eight symbols, but we have six, so maybe it's a leftmost derivation?\n\nWait, let's look at the string length. The string has six t's. Maybe it's a minimal derivation, but I'm not sure. Let me see if I can find a sequence of expansions that leads to exactly t34 t5 t9 t15 t38 t0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if each part of the string can be matched.\n\nLooking at t34 as the first symbol. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t34. Looking through all NT production rules, I see that none of the NTs directly produce t34. For example:\n\n- NT40 -> 't28' and other non-terminals.\n- NT48 -> 't15'\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n- NT98 -> 't34' directly? Wait, no, looking at NT98's rules: NT98 -> NT9 NT12. But I see that in the rules, there's NT94 -> 't0', but nothing for t34. Wait, let me check the NT production list again:\n\nLooking through all NT rules, I don't see any that produce t34. So that's a problem because the first symbol is t34, which must come from an NT production that produces t34. But none of the NTs in the rules do that. So maybe the string cannot be generated because the first symbol doesn't match any NT's direct terminal production.\n\nWait, that would mean the answer is 'No' because the first symbol t34 isn't produced by any NT in the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe NT98 -> 't34' is present, but in the rules, it says:\n\nHere are some rules:\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\nNT22 -> NT68 NT97\n\nNT77 -> 't15'\n\nNT98 -> 't34' actually, I think I missed that earlier.\n\nWait, in the user-provided grammar, under NT98, there's \"NT98 -> 't5' NT22\" and \"NT98 -> NT72 NT95\". So no, NT98 doesn't produce t34. Wait, I need to check all NT rules carefully.\n\nLooking back, the NT production list as given is:\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\n\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\n\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\n\nNT58 -> NT17 NT68\n\nNT68 -> NT5\n\nNT35 -> NT29 NT9\n\nNT0 -> NT10\n\nNT82 -> NT29 NT3\n\nWait, I'm probably missing some rules. Let me list all the NT productions carefully:\n\nFrom the user input:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\nNT58 -> NT17 NT68\nNT68 -> NT5\nNT35 -> NT29 NT9\nNT0 -> NT10\nNT82 -> NT29 NT3\nNT71 \u2192 t36, t5\nNT71 \u2192 t5\nNT98 \u2192 t34 \u2192 Wait, no, from the user input, under NT98: \"NT98 -> NT9 NT12\", \"NT98 -> NT72 NT95\"\n\nSo, no, NT98 doesn't produce t34 as a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the NT rules, let me check each:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28', 't15', etc.\n\nLooking for t34 in any NT's productions:\n\nWait, the only place t34 appears is under NT71: \"t36, t5\", no, that's not t34.\n\nWait, no, in the rules, under NT71: \"NT71 -> t36\", \"NT71 -> t5\" \u2014 no, it's producing t36 and t5, but not t34.\n\nWait, looking through all NT rules for 't34' \u2014 it seems none of the NTs directly produce t34. So, the initial step can't produce t34 because no NT has a production with 't34' as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the given string starts with 't34', which can't be generated by any production in the grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar here seems to have non-terminals like S, NT36, NT22, etc., leading up to terminals like 't34', 't36', etc.\n\nThe string to check is \"t34 t36 t9 t15 t38 t8 t10\". I think I need to parse this string to see if it can be generated by the grammar. Parsing context-free grammars usually involves breaking down the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nI'll start by looking at the first terminal, 't34'. I need to find a production that produces 't34'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT48 \u2192 t15. But wait, is there a production that directly gives t34? I see NT72 \u2192 t8 and NT94 \u2192 t0, but not directly t34. Hmm, perhaps 't34' comes from a non-terminal that eventually leads to it.\n\nWait, let me look more closely. The grammar has NT72 \u2192 t8, NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98. Oh, and NT58 \u2192 NT17 NT17? No, wait, NT58 appears in the rules but doesn't directly produce a terminal. Looking back, I think I might have misremembered some productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the productions that produce terminals to see where they come from.

NT98 \u2192 't34' \u2014 There's another production for NT98 \u2192 t34.\n27. NT22 \u2192 't12'\n28. NT36 \u2192 't35'\n29. NT48 \u2192 't15'\n30. NT68 \u2192 't5'\n31. NT35 \u2192 't29'\n32.

NT77 \u2192 't15'\n\nWait, I think I misread some earlier. Let's correct this:\n\nLooking again, NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98, and NT58 isn't a terminal. So 't34' must come from NT98 \u2192 t34, which is rule 26.\n\nSo in the string, the first 't34' can be produced by NT98. So we can take NT98 and expand it to 't34'.\n\nNow, the string after substitution is: t34 [remaining string].\n\nWhat was before 't34'? The entire string is \"t34 t36 t9 t15 t38 t8 t10\".\n\nAfter the first 't34', we have \"t36 t9 t15 t38 t8 t10\". But wait, in the original string, it's a single token, meaning it's the result of one production. So when we substitute 't34', it's the entire string. So perhaps the string is entirely generated by expanding S.\n\nWait, let me see. The string is seven terminals, so the derivation should have steps that sum up to seven productions.\n\nStarting with S. Let's see how S can be expanded.\n\nLook at the grammar rules for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo S can only be expanded into two non-terminals. Since the string is seven tokens, and S produces two non-terminals, each of which could be terminals or more non-terminals, we need to see if any of these can combine to produce the string.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nLet's see what NT82 and NT22 can produce.\n\nFrom the productions:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't29'\n\nSo NT82 is 't29'. Good.\n\nNow, NT22 can produce 't23' or other things. So in the string, after 't29', the next part is 't36', which should come from NT22. Wait, wait, no: S \u2192 NT82 NT22, so the expansion is [NT82's string] [NT22's string]. So the entire string would be \"t29\" concatenated with the string from NT22.\n\nBut looking at the string, after 't29' comes 't36', which isn't matching NT22's productions directly. Let me check: NT22's productions are:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\nNT22 \u2192 't23'\nNT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\nNT22 \u2192 't12'\n\nBut none of these directly produce 't36'. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps S \u2192 NT82 NT22 is not the right path.\n\nWait, another S production is S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nLet's check that.\n\nNT40 can produce several things: looking at the productions:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT40 \u2192 't28'\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\nNT40 \u2192 't49'\nNT40 \u2192 't28'\n\nWait, some of these are terminals. For example, NT40 \u2192 't28' is a terminal. So if S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then NT40 can produce 't28', and NT77 can produce something.\n\nWhat's NT77's production? Looking back, NT77 \u2192 't15'.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT40 NT77, the expansion would be [\"something\"] \"t15\".\n\nBut in our string, the last part is 't10', not 't15'. So that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the right path either.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if other NT40 productions might help.\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0: NT97 is 't48', and NT0 \u2192 't6'. So NT40 can produce 't48 t6'.\n\nWait, then S \u2192 NT40 NT77 would expand to ['t48 t6'] followed by 't15' from NT77, making a string of \"t48 t6 t15\", but the given string is 't34 t36 t9 t15 t38 t8 t10', which is seven tokens, not matching.\n\nAnother option: NT40 could produce 't28' (from NT40 \u2192 't28'), so S \u2192 NT40 NT77 would be 't28' followed by 't15', so \"t28 t15\", which is only two tokens, not matching the seven.\n\nHmm. So perhaps neither S \u2192 NT82 NT22 nor S \u2192 NT40 NT77 can produce the entire seven-token string in one step. So maybe the string is built by further expanding these non-terminals.\n\nLet's go"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each production expands a symbol into two parts, which could be terminals or non-terminals. The task is to see if the string can be derived by expanding the starting symbol S through these rules.\n\nThe string given has seven tokens: t34, t5, t35, t38, t29, t29, t10. Since each production except for S->NT... in the grammar seems to be terminals or pairs of terminals and non-terminals, I might need to check if each substring in the string can be derived.\n\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two symbols (which can be terminals or non-terminals). So the parsing process would involve trying to break down the string into such pairs starting from the beginning.\n\nLet me list out the possible steps. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if it can be formed by expanding non-terminals into their respective right-hand sides.\n\nStarting with the first token, t34. Does any non-terminal expand into t34? Looking through the rules, I see NT74 -> t17 and NT40->t28. But NT74's expansion is t17, not t34. NT82 has t34 on the right. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT that expand to t34. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT -> a, where a is a terminal and a is t34? Or perhaps a production where a rule starts with t34.

NT98 -> t34. So the first part could be part of NT98. But the next token is t5, so maybe the production has t34 followed by t5. Wait, but in CNF, each production is two symbols. So if I have a string that begins with t34 t5 t35..., is there a production that starts with t34 and t5?\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT that expands into t34 and t5 as its two symbols. So perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the first t34 is part of a production's end.\n\nWait, but maybe the first symbol t34 is from a production that starts with another symbol. Let me check.\n\nLooking for a production where NT98 -> t34. So the right-hand side of NT98 is t34. So if I have a production NT98 -> t34 NTsomething, then perhaps t34 can be the first symbol. But in this case, t34 is the first symbol in the string, so it must be derived from a non-terminal that directly produces t34.\n\nBut looking back, I see NT94 -> t72 and NT98->t5, not t34. Wait, no, NT98 has two productions: NT98->t5 and NT98->t34. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, looking at the list again, I see:\n\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's go step by step.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides:\n\nEach production has a left-hand side and a right-hand side. I need to find if the string can be generated by any sequence of these productions.\n\nSo the string is t34 t5 t35 t38 t29 t29 t10.\n\nLet me check if any production can generate t34 followed by t5. So checking if any NT's production starts with t34 and t5.\n\nLooking through all production rules, none have t34 and t5 as the right-hand side of a left-hand side NT. So the first two symbols can't come directly from a single NT production. Therefore, maybe the first t34 is part of a larger production that requires splitting.\n\nWait, perhaps the first t34 comes from a production that has t34 followed by another symbol, and then the next t5 comes from a different production.\n\nFor example, suppose the initial step is:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22 \u2192 which would require that NT82 produces t34 and then NT22 produces t5, but looking at NT82's production: NT82->t29. So it's just t29, which isn't t34. So that won't work.\n\nAnother option: S -> NT40 NT77. Let's see nt40's production: NT40 can produce t28 or other Nts, but let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, earlier I saw that NT40 has multiple productions:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\n\nWait, let's double-check.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules:\n\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\n- NT97 -> t48\n\n- NT98 -> t5\n\n- NT15->t49\n\nWait, so NT40 can produce two Nts, and perhaps from there, we can expand further.\n\nWait, but the initial productions from S are:\n\nS can split into either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nSo starting with S, perhaps the string is supposed to be split into two parts, first NT82 and then NT22, each generating some parts. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, NT82 -> t29. So the first symbol is t34 but NT82 only produces t29, which doesn't match t34. So that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, S could generate NT40 NT77. Let's check NT40 and NT77.\n\nNT40 can produce several things:\n\nNT40->t28 (from NT97->t48 and then NT97->t48?), or via NT97->t48 and NT0->t6, leading to t48 t6, or via other rules.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, starting from the initial symbol.\n\nSo let's try to see if the string can be generated.\n\nGiven the string is 7 tokens: t34, t5, t35, t38, t29, t29, t10.\n\nI'll attempt to break it down.\n\nLooking for possible splits:\n\nLet me consider possible NT expansions.\n\nFirst, check if any production starts with t34 followed by anything.\n\nLooking for a production NT -> t34 and something. Looking through all the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT98->t34, but then NT98 also has another production? Wait, no, in the rules list, I think NT98 only has one production: NT98->t5. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules again:\n\nWait, the user input the grammar as a list of rules.

{"custom_id":"request-120","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine whether a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the grammar, making it easier to analyze using certain parsing techniques or by constructing a parse tree.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. Looking at the production rules, the start symbol is S, and it has two initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar will start with either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77. Let's look at the target string: `t34 t36 t33 t15 t38 t40 t21 t17`.\n\nSince this is a context-free grammar, each symbol in the string (like NT82, NT22, etc.) can be thought of as a non-terminal that needs to be broken down further until we reach terminal symbols (the 't' tokens) that form the string.\n\nI need to check if the string can be derived by systematically replacing non-terminals with their productions. Each production rule uses exactly two non-terminals, so each application of a rule replaces a single non-terminal with two others. \n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe first two symbols are t34 and t36. But wait, t34 and t36 are terminal symbols. That means they don't correspond to any production rules; they're the leaves in the parse tree. So, the first non-terminal we have to derive is either NT82 or NT40 based on the start symbol.\n\nLet me see if either of the initial S productions can lead to the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So after S, we have NT82 and NT22. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nLooking at NT82's productions:\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29 or nt71 \u2192 perhaps wait, no, in the given grammar, I need to look for NT82's productions. From the given, NT82 \u2192 NT71 NT35. Oh wait, no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT71 NT35\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The given productions have:\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29 ? Wait, no. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT82 is not a non-terminal that produces t29 because the productions for NT82 are:\n\nLooking back: OH! I think I might be getting this wrong. Let me list the productions properly.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nNow for each NT:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\n- NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\n- NT12 \u2192 't31'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- NT15 \u2192 't49'\n- NT97 \u2192 't48'\n- NT98 \u2192 't5'\n- NT18 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT82 \u2192 't29'\n- NT71 \u2192 't36'\n- NT71 \u2192 't5'\n- NT98 \u2192 't34'\n- NT22 \u2192 't12'\n- NT36 \u2192 't35'\n- NT48 \u2192 't15'\n- NT68 \u2192 't5'\n- NT35 \u2192 't29'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT94 \u2192 't0'\n- NT72 \u2192 't8'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28'\n- NT9 \u2192 't40'\n- NT18 \u2192 't9'\n- NT91 \u2192 't38'\n- NT95 \u2192 't10'\n- NT77 \u2192 't15'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n- NT82 \u2192 't34'\n- NT48 \u2192 't21'\n- NT74 \u2192 't17'\n- NT58 \u2192 't17'\n\nWait, I think I need to represent this correctly. Each production is either two non-terminals (left-hand side) or a terminal (right-hand side). So some of these entries might be conflicting or perhaps I made a mistake in reading them.\n\nWait, looking back, each production is either:\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, meaning S is replaced by NT82 followed by NT22.\n\nSimilarly, NT82 \u2192 NT71 NT35 means NT82 is replaced by NT71 and NT35.\n\nAnd some of these are terminals, like NT12 \u2192 't31', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer if I list each non-terminal and its possible productions.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS can produce either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77.\n\nSo when analyzing the string, if the first two symbols are t34 and t36, that might not directly correspond to the initial S production because after S, it's either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77, which would produce two non-terminals each. But in the string, we have eight terminal symbols. So perhaps the process will involve splitting these into subtrees that eventually produce all terminals.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, let me check if the sequence t34 t36 t33 t15 t38 t40 t21 t17 can be built from the grammar by seeing if each terminal can be associated with the correct production.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is: t34 t36 t33 t15 t38 t40 t21 t17.\n\nSince the grammar starts with two non-terminals, the parse tree should have two initial children, each of which will be expanded until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut since it's a binary tree, each non-terminal branches into two, recursively.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string must be the result of expanding either S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT82 and NT22 or by NT40 and NT77.\n\nSo the string can be divided into two parts: the first X terminals and then another Y terminals, where X and Y sum to 8. Each part needs to be the expansion of one non-terminal pair.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, S produces two non-terminals, each of which could themselves produce a string of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is part of a single expansion path of the grammar.\n\nBut given the target string is only eight terminals, it's likely from a single expansion path starting at S, and each step produces two non-terminals until all become terminals.\n\nGiven that, let's see:\n\nThe entire string is t34 t36 t33 t15 t38 t40 t21 t17.\n\nWhich is 8 tokens, meaning that during parsing, each step of non-terminal expansion needs to account for these. Let's consider the possibilities.\n\nFirst, the initial step is S \u2192 either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT82 NT22, then the two non-terminals NT82 and NT22 must produce exactly four tokens each. Because 4 from NT82 and 4 from NT22 would make 8 total.\n\nAlternatively, if S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then NT40 and NT77 must produce a certain number of tokens. Let's calculate how many tokens each could produce.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if each token in the string can be mapped to a production path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to check each terminal and see if they can be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string, let's try to find the root.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which expands into two non-terminals. So the first two tokens in the string are t34 and t36. Hmm, but since S produces two non-terminals, T1 and T2, perhaps the string's first part must be T1, and the second part T2.\n\nAlternatively, each of T1 and T2 would produce a string, and their concatenation is the overall string.\n\nSo, the string t34 t36 t33 t15 t38 t40 t21 t17 can"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to see how the string can be broken down into the non-terminals of the grammar using the productions. Each 't' followed by a number in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My plan is to parse the string step by step, replacing the non-terminals with their corresponding terminals as I go.\n\nThe string is `t29 t5 t35 t38 t40 t35 t5 t17`. Let's list out the terminals:\n\n1. t29\n2. t5\n3. t35\n4. t38\n5. t40\n6. t35\n7. t5\n8. t17\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to find which non-terminals correspond to these terminals. For example, 't29' must come from a non-terminal that expands into t29, and so on.\n\nLet's start with the first part: t29. Checking the grammar, I see that NT82 produces 't29' (NT82 -> 't29'). Similarly, NT35 -> 't35', so t35 comes from NT35. NT38 -> 't38' since there's a production NT38 -> 't38'. \n\nSo the first four elements could potentially be from NT82, NT35, NT38, and NT40. But wait, looking closer, the grammar doesn't have a direct production for NT38. Hmm, maybe I need to check if that's a typo or if there's another way to get 't38'.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see that NT72 -> 't8' and NT74->'t17', etc. Let me check again for NT38. Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't38'. Maybe that's a problem? Or perhaps I misread a production. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT77 -> 't15', NT74 -> 't17', NT58 -> 't17', etc., but nothing for NT38. That's an issue because 't38' isn't in any of the productions. Is 't38' even part of any production? Let me confirm.\n\nLooking at all the grammar rules, I don't see any NT that expands to 't38'. That means 't38' can't be part of any string generated by this grammar. However, in the given string, we have 't38' as the fourth element. That immediately suggests that the string can't be generated by this grammar since 't38' isn't a possible terminal from any non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the productions again.\n\nLooking through the production rules: \n\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98 : so that's not a terminal.\n- NT68 -> t5, yes, but 't68' isn't mentioned. Wait, no, 't68' isn't in the grammar as a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT68 is a non-terminal that produces 't5' (from NT68 -> t5). So the terminal 't5' comes from NT68. But 't68' isn't in the list of possible terminals. Hmm, maybe I misread. Wait, no, the rules have NT68 -> t5, so the terminal for NT68 is 't5'.\n\nWait, the rules have:\n\nNT0 -> t6\nNT3 -> t5\nNT68 -> t5\nNT22 -> t12\nNT36 -> t35\nNT48 -> t15\nNT68 -> t5\nOthers produce specific 't' followed by numbers.\n\nBut in the given string, there's a 't38', which is not present anywhere in the productions. That must be the issue. Because none of the NT's produce 't38', so the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me be careful. Did I count correctly?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with one terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is quite extensive with 52 rules. The string consists of a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol 'S' using the grammar.\n\nLet me try to break down the string and see how it might match the productions. Starting from the left:\n\n1. `t29`: Looking at the rules, 't29' can be either from 'NT82' or 'NT35'\u2014both derive to 't29'. So this could be covered by either S-> NT82 NT22 or S-> NT40 NT77, depending on how the rule is applied.\n\nBut looking further, the next token is `t5`. Let's see the rules that produce 't5'. Checking the rules, I see that 't5' comes from 'NT98' and 'NT77' also. Hmm, perhaps we need a recursive approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe working backwards from the string to the start symbol would be better. Let's consider that each step in the string corresponds to a production rule. Each terminal in the string must be matched by some rule, so let's map each terminal to the possible productions.\n\nLet me list the string again: t29, t5, t33, t15, t38, t40, t35, t5, t17.\n\nStarting with t29, possible sources: NT82 (from S->NT82 NT22) or NT35 (from NT36->NT18 NT77).\n\nIf I start with NT82, it produces t29. Then the next symbol is t5, which needs to be produced by NT22, as NT22 can produce t5 (from S->NT82 NT22; NT22 is part of that production). Wait, let me check: S->NT82 NT22, so NT82 would produce t29, and NT22 would produce t5.\n\nSo after S, we have NT82 producing t29 and NT22 producing t5. Next is t33. Looking at the rules for t33, it's produced by NT3 as NT3->t33. So I need to see how NT3 is derived.\n\nNT3 has the production NT3->OT10, which further breaks down into NT91 and t38. Wait, no, looking back, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar provided has rules for some NT and OTs. Wait, looking at the given rules, I notice that some rules are from NT to other NTs, and others have t followed by numbers, indicating terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT36-> NT18 NT77, which are non-terminals. So each production either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal (like 't29').\n\nSo, when analyzing the string, each terminal must come directly from a production that ends with that terminal.\n\nLet me start from the beginning:\n\nt29 is from NT82 or NT35.\n\nt5 is from NT77 (since looking at the rules, NT77 can produce t15, which is part of the string, but wait, t15 is earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each terminal to its possible non-terminals.\n\nLet's make a list:\n\nt29: NT82 (from S) or NT35 (from NT36->NT18 NT77, but NT36 can't produce t29. Wait, no. Wait, NT35 is in the production NT48->NT36 NT3, but t33 is from NT3. Hmm, maybe it's better to build a map.\n\nLet me create a dictionary where each terminal and NT that can produce it. So:\n\n- t29: NT82, NT35\n- t5: NT98, NT77\n- t33: NT3\n- t15: NT97, NT68, NT35, NT0, NT48, NT18, NT40, NT74, NT58\n- t38: NT74\n- t40: NT40, NT94, NT72, etc. (Looking for where t40 is produced. From the rules, NT40 can produce t40 and other things. Wait, looking at the rules, NT40 has several productions. For example:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\n\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\n\nNT40 -> NT48 NT3\n\nNT40 -> NT9 NT12\n\nAnd according to the rules, NT40 also directly produces t40 when S->NT40 NT77. So t40 can come from either NT40 or from other NTs.\n\nWait, no. The rules list for NT40 are:\n\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0: So NT40 can split into these two non-terminals.\n\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71: Again, NTs.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, after t38 (which is from NT74), the next is t40. So how does t40 come in?\n\nLooking into the possible NTs that can produce t40:\n\nLooking through the rules, is there any NT that directly produces t40?\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT40: yes, S can produce NT40 NT77, and NT40 can also directly produce t40? Wait, no. Wait, in the rules, the productions are all two-symbol on the left except when a terminal is on the right. So for NT40, is there a production where NT40->t40?\n\nWait, in the given rules, I look:\n\nNT40->NT97 NT0: So it's producing two non-terminals.\n\nBut then, elsewhere, do any rules have NT40 on the left with a terminal on the right? Looking through, I don't see any rules where NT40 is on the left with a terminal. So NT40 can only produce non-terminals, not terminals. So how can the string have 't40' as a symbol?\n\nWait, that seems like a problem.

{"custom_id":"request-142","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the string `t29 t36 t35 t38 t40 t33 t15 t5 t17` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works and what it can produce. The grammar has a starting symbol S, which is rewritten into two non-terminals, NT82 and NT22 in the first production, and NT40 and NT77 in the second. So, S must be expanded in such a way that eventually, each non-terminal in the expansion is replaced by a terminal symbol (like the 't's and numbers here) or another non-terminal that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. So, I need to see if this sequence is a possible derivation from one of the S productions. Since the string is built from terminals, each production in the derivation must end up generating these terminals directly.\n\nI should probably start by parsing the string from the longest possible leftmost or rightmost derivation. But Chomsky normal form productions have two non-terminals each, so it's likely that each step produces pairs that can be traced back to the original productions. But wait, the string seems to have nine elements, and each production at each step replaces a non-terminal into two non-terminals, so parsing might take several steps.\n\nLet me consider the starting point. The string is `t29 t36 t35 t38 t40 t33 t15 t5 t17`. That's nine tokens. Let's think about the structure. Since each production after the first can only produce two non-terminals, the total number of productions needed to expand should relate to the length. Wait, but this might not directly help because the string is all terminals, so each non-terminal must be expanded into these terminals.\n\nLet me look for the possible starting expansions. The first two productions for S are:\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, S expands into two non-terminals, each of which will eventually expand into strings. Each step in the expansion will replace a non-terminal with two others, which then get expanded until all are terminals.\n\nI think the key here is to work backwards from the given string. Since all the string's elements are terminals, perhaps each token is the result of a production chain. Let's try to find the possible paths from each terminal back to S.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if each token can be found as a production, and then see if I can chain the productions in a way that the string can be formed.\n\nFor example, let's see what the productions can generate. Starting from S, it goes to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So, the string must be a combination of NT82 and NT22 terminals or NT40 and NT77 terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t29. I need to see if t29 can be generated by NT82 or NT40.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nFor NT82, is there a production where it generates t29? Let's check the rules. I see:\n\n- NT82 -> t29. Yes, that's a production. So NT82 can directly become t29.\n\nSimilarly, for NT22, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> t23 (from the rules, but wait, in the list, I think the rules for NT22 are:\n  - NT22 -> NT71 NT48 and also NT22 -> 't23'. So yes, NT22 can produce t23.\n\nAnother production for NT22 is 't12', but that's the second rule. So NT22 can become t23 or t12. Similarly, NT82 can become t29.\n\nSimilarly, looking at other NTs:\n\n- Let's check each terminal in the string and see if it's a production of some non-terminal.\n\nt36: Is there any production for a non-terminal leading directly to t36? Looking at the rules, I see NT36 -> NT18 NT77. But not directly t36.\n\nWait, I might have to approach this differently. Let's consider each token in the string and see which NT production can generate it.\n\nWait, no. Each NT may have multiple rules. So perhaps each of these terminals is a direct production of some NT. For example, t36 could come from NT36, which then expands into other NTs that eventually lead to t36, but in this string, each token is a single terminal, so each must be directly produced by their NT.\n\nWait no, because if a NT has a production that includes a terminal, it can directly generate that terminal. So for example, if NT36 produces t35 via some rule (wait, looking back, I see NT36 -> NT18 NT77, but looking for terminal t36... maybe I missed it. Wait no, looking through the list:\n\nLooking at the given rules, I don't see any NT producing t36 directly. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let me go through all the rules again:\n\nThe grammar productions given are as follows (I'll list only the ones that might be relevant):\n\n- NT82 -> t29\n- NT22 -> t23 or t12\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77 (no terminal)\n- NT40 has several rules, including NT40 -> t28, t39, etc.\n- NT94 -> t9, etc.\n\nWait, looking through all the production rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces t36, t35, etc., except maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, wait, let's go through each non-terminal and their possible terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for the productions that produce terminals, like NT94 -> t9, etc.\n\nLet me try to find each token in the string and see if any NT can produce that token directly.\n\nThe string is: t29 t36 t35 t38 t40 t33 t15 t5 t17.\n\nStarting with t29: Yes, NT82 can produce t29 directly, as per production.\n\nNext, t36: Looking at the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t36. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rules. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the list includes for NT18 -> t33, NT3 -> t5, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps t36 comes from NT36, but does NT36 have a production that ends with t36?\n\nLooking back, I don't see NT36 directly producing t36. Let me check:\n\nFrom the given rules: NT36 -> NT18 NT77. But that's an internal production, so it can't directly produce a terminal. So I'm confused. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how to look for direct productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of these tokens is a terminal that can be generated by some NT in a single step. So if I can trace from each token back to an NT in one step, and that chain should eventually connect back to S via the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe a better approach is to attempt a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe string is t29 t36 t35 t38 t40 t33 t15 t5 t17.\n\nSo, starting from S, which can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nLet me see if the string starts with t29 t36...\n\nLooking at the first two tokens, t29 and t36.\n\nIf the leftmost derivation starts with S -> NT82 NT22, then the first two elements of the string should match the terminals generated by NT82 and NT22.\n\nWait, but NT82 can produce t29, which is the first token. Then NT22 needs to produce t36, but looking at the NT22 productions: NT22 can produce t23 or t12. So t36 cannot come from NT22, which only has t23 or t12 as terminals.\n\nAlternatively, if S expands via the other production: S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nThen, the first NT40 would produce the first token, t29, and NT77 would produce the second token, t36.\n\nLooking at NT40, do we have a production that ends with t29? Yes, NT40 -> t28, t29, etc. So yes, NT40 can produce t29.\n\nNow, looking at NT77: Do we have a production for NT77 that includes t36? Looking at the given rules, I don't see NT77 directly producing t36.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77. So NT36 can produce NT18 and NT77, but not directly t36.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Alternatively, maybe all rules lead to S, but I think each production starts with S.\n\nWait, looking closer, the grammar as presented has multiple S productions, but perhaps only one is relevant since the string starts with t34, which must come from a terminal rule for some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first symbol is t34. Let me check which non-terminal's production ends with t34. Scanning through the rules:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98 (t17 when 98 is 98's rule; but 98's rules end with t5, t34, etc. Wait, no, the terminals are for NT74: NT58 and NT98. I'm looking for a rule that when expanded, includes t34.\n\nLooking through the terminals:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98. NT58 isn't terminal, it goes to NT17. So NT74 \u2192 NT17 NT98. But NT98 has a rule like \u2192 NT5, t5, or t34. Wait, no, NT98's rules: NT98 \u2192 NT40 NT5. Then NT40 is another rule, and so on.\n\nWait, that might not be the right path. Alternatively, let's look for the last non-terminals that produce t34.\n\nIn the rules, I see:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t21\n- NT74 \u2192 t17\n- Wait, no, let me look: NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98, and NT58 \u2192 NT17, which leads to terminals maybe. Or wait, looking at NT48: it produces t21 (from NT48 \u2192 t15 NT15 \u2192 then t15 is another production rule). Hmm, perhaps that's a dead end.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps looking for t34 in any NT's productions.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t12 (from NT22 \u2192 t12?), no, wait, some of the rules for NT22 are:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, then NT71 might produce t36 or t5. Another option is NT22 \u2192 t12, which is a direct production.\n\nWait, for NT22: it has rules like NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, NT22 \u2192 t12, NT22 \u2192 t23 (another direct rule). Similarly, other NTs have rules ending with t34.\n\nLooking further, I see:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 t34 (because the rule is NT98 \u2192 t34). No, wait, in the given grammar, the production for NT98 is \u2192 t5 and some other rule. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT98's production is:\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT9 NT12. Hmm, so not directly t34. Or maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up NT and t. Each rule's RHS is two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So I need to track which non-terminal productions result in a terminal.\n\nLet me make a list of all terminals and their sources. For example:\n\n- t34: which NT produces t34? Looking through all the rules, I spot:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98, but NT58 \u2192 NT17, which when looked up, isn't terminal. Alternatively, looking deeper: NT98 might produce t34? Wait, maybe in another rule. Let me check all the terminal productions.\n\nWait, the grammar has several lines, so I'll list them:\n\n- S has multiple rules, but let's focus on non-terminals and their productions.\n\nCheck each non-terminal and see if it can derive a terminal 't34':\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT48 \u2192 t21\n- Wait, no, wait: The terminal 't21' is produced by NT48. But the rule is NT48 \u2192 t15 NT15 \u2192 but maybe not. Wait, perhaps I'm missing.\n\nWait, looking through the rules more carefully:\n\nLooking for any NT production where the RHS includes t34.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98 (which might produce t34 if any of the downstream rules do)\n- NT18 \u2192 t33\n- NT71 \u2192 t36 or t5\n- Wait, looking further down, I see:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, NT97 \u2192 t48, NT0 \u2192 t6. Hmm, not t34.\n- NT48 \u2192 t15 NT15: so t15 is from NT15's rules, which is \u2192 t5. So that's just t15, so maybe NT48 produces t15 t5, which isn't t34.\n- NT68 \u2192 t5\n- NT35 \u2192 t29 (from NT35 \u2192 t29)\n- Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for t34 in the RHS of any production.\n\nAh, here's one: NT98 \u2192 t5 or t34? Wait, no, NT98's rule is:\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nWait, but looking further, NT9's rule is NT18 \u2192 t40 or NT97 \u2192 t48, etc. Maybe I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, check all production rules for terminals.\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\n- NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 \u2192 which leads to t6\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12 \u2192 which leads to NT97 (t48)\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35 \u2192 both lead to NT82 (which is a rule: NT82 \u2192 t29)\nWait, perhaps I should list all possible terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal rules for each non-terminal. Let's see:\n\n- NT74: production is NT58 NT98. I don't see NT74 directly producing any terminals, so it must derive into other NTs until it reaches terminals.\n\nBut let's list the production rules where terminals appear:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t15 NT15 \u2192 so if NT15 produces t5, then NT48 \u2192 t15 t5. But earlier I thought NT15 \u2192 t5, so that becomes t15 t5. Not t34.\n\n- NT71 \u2192 t36 or t5.\n\n- NT98's rules: Not directly, but via NT9 and NT12.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The given string is 10 tokens. Each production in CNF can generate two terminals at each step, but in this case, each step can produce one terminal if the NTs are properly expanded. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is two symbols. So the length of the string will be the number of production steps until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. If the start symbol is S, and the string length is 10, then the depth of the parse tree would be 9.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step, from the start.\n\nStart: S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-186","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t29 t36 t33 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t5 t17 t5`. \n\nFirst, I recall that context-free grammars (CFGs) use production rules to generate strings. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which has productions like S -> NT82 NT22 and S -> NT40 NT77. These NT symbols are non-terminals, so the first step is to break down the string into these non-terminal productions.\n\nLet me list the string again: `t29 t36 t33 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t5 t17 t5`. Since CFGs can be represented as trees, each production leads to a node that produces two symbols. So I'll try to parse the string from left to right using these productions.\n\nStarting with S, it can produce NT82 and NT22. Let's see what the first two symbols in the string are: `t29 t36`. Looking at the grammar, I need to find if any rule produces t29 followed by t36.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, NT82 can be derived as 't29', and after NT82, there's NT22, which is 't22' or another production. But in the string, after t29 comes t36. So I check if there's a rule that combines t29 and t36. Hmm, looking through the grammar, I don't see a rule that directly produces t36. Wait, maybe I need to look at the productions for NT82. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT22->'t23' and NT82->'t29'. But t36 comes next, so perhaps I need to consider another starting rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial rule isn't S->NT82 NT22. Let's consider the other option, S->NT40 NT77. The string starts with t29, so if S produces NT40 and NT77, then t29 would have to come from either NT40 or NT77. Looking at NT40, its productions include 't40' and 't28'. Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is t29, which doesn't match any immediate production of NT40 or NT77. So maybe S->NT82 NT22 is the correct initial step, and t29 comes from NT82.\n\nWait, let me double-check. NT82 can be produced as 't29', so that's good. Then after NT82, the next symbol is t36, which should come from NT22, since NT22 is 't23' or another production. But wait, if NT22 is 't12' or 't23', neither is t36. So that path doesn't seem to work. That can't be right.\n\nMaybe I'm miscalculating. Let's list all the NT productions and their terminal outputs to see which can produce the string.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT3 -> 't5', 't9' (wait, let's list all the rules for each NT to their terminals).\n\nNT36: 't35', 't18'?\nWait, let me parse the grammar properly.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to be written as S -> NT82 NT22, and each NT has multiple productions. Let me list the rules for each NT:\n\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77 or 't35' (since I see NT36 -> NT18 NT77 and NT36 -> NT35). Wait, looking again:\n\nNT36: \n- NT18 NT77\n- NT35\n\nBut in the string, I need to see if any non-terminal can derive a sequence. It's getting a bit complex, so maybe a better approach is to consider that each step in the grammar derivation splits a non-terminal into two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So the whole string must be a result of expanding the start symbol S, replacing each non-terminal step by step until all are terminals.\n\nGiven the string's length is 11 tokens, the derivation must involve several splits. Let's attempt to build a parse tree.\n\nStarting with S, which can split into two NTs. Let's consider the first option: S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nSo the first step would produce [NT82, NT22]. The string starts with t29, so let's see what NT82 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT82's rules: \n- NT82 can split into NT71 and NT48 or produce 't29'.\n\nSo if NT82->'t29', then the first token is t29. Then, the next symbol is t36, which would have to come from NT22. Let's check NT22's productions:\n\nNT22 can become 't23', 't71', 't12', 't23', etc. Wait, looking at the grammar rules for NT22:\n\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\nNT22 -> 't23'\nNT22 -> 't12'\n\nSo, from NT22, we can produce 't23' or 't12'. But the string has t36 after t29, so that path might not work because NT22 doesn't have a rule that directly produces t36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first rule is S->NT40 NT77, and NT40 can produce 't40' or 't28'. The string starts with t29, which doesn't match. So that initial rule might not be correct.\n\nWait, maybe the initial S->NT82 NT22 is correct, and the first step is NT82 -> 't29' (so t29 is the first token). Then the next symbol is t36, which would need to come from NT22. But looking at NT22's production, the only terminals are 't23' and 't12', none of which is t36. That suggests a problem. But maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe the NT22 can produce a non-terminal that can further expand into t36. Let's see NT22 has a production to NT71 NT48. So if NT22 is split into NT71 and NT48, then the next step would produce two symbols: whatever NT71 and NT48 produce. But the string has t36 immediately after t29, so if NT22 is split into NT71 and NT48, maybe NT71 can produce t36?\n\nLooking at NT71's rules: NT71 -> 't31', 't5' from the grammar, wait no, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I saw that NT71 has rules like -> 't36' and -> 't5'. Wait, no. Let me list each NT's rules carefully.\n\nActually, stepping back, perhaps it's better to list all the NT productions clearly:\n\n1. NT36 -> NT18 NT77 | NT35\n   - NT18 -> NT33 | 't9' (from NT18 -> 't33' and NT18->'t9')\n   - Wait, looking at the grammar:\n   NT18 -> 't33' and NT18->'t9'?\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT18 -> NT33\n- NT3 -> NT9\n- Other rules for NT18: Wait, I'm getting confused. It's better to list each rule line by line.\n\nLooking at each production line in the grammar:\n\n- S -> NT82 NT22\n- S -> NT40 NT77\n- NT36 -> NT18 NT77\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n- NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n- NT72 -> NT82 NT35\n- NT3 -> NT91 NT94\n- NT12 -> NT48 NT74\n- NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n- NT94 -> NT9 NT12\n- NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n- NT48 -> NT36 NT3\n- NT22 -> NT68 NT97\n- NT94 -> NT72 NT95\n- NT12 -> 't31'\n- NT22 -> 't23'\n- NT15 -> 't49'\n- NT97 -> 't48'\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT18 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is S, so I'll need to see how S can expand into the given string. \n\nLooking at the first production rules for S:\n- S -> NT82 NT22\n- S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo S can be expanded into either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77.

But in the string, the first token is 't34', which doesn't match 't29'. So maybe this path isn't correct unless there's another way to get 't34'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again. Let me list all the production rules and their possible 't' outputs.\n\nFrom NT40:\n- NT40 -> t39\n- NT40 -> t28\n- NT40 -> t10 (Wait, looking back, NT40 has multiple productions.

NT40 can produce t10 directly (t10), then NT77 needs to produce the rest.\n\nWait, but the string first token is 't34', which isn't t10, so that might not be the way. Alternatively, let's try S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nNT82 -> t29, but the string starts with t34, so that might not fit unless there's a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this as a parsing problem, applying the grammar rules step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a way to derive the string by recursively expanding the grammar.\n\nLet's consider the entire string and break it down:\n\nThe string is t34 t36 t35 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t8 t10 t17.\n\nI'll try to match this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking for possible NT symbols and their productions.\n\nStart with NT40, because the string starts with t34.\n\nWait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken down as follows:\n\nLooking for the start symbol S, which expands to NT40 NT77. So the first part is NT40 producing 't34', then NT77 producing the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, but NT40 has the production NT40 -> t39, t28, t10, among others. There's also NT40 -> NT97 NT0, which produces t9 (from NT97) and t10 (from NT0). So if NT40 produces t34 directly, that's not among its productions. Wait, looking back: from NT40, the direct 't' productions are t39, t28, and t10. So 't34' is not a direct production of NT40. Therefore, the first production can't be S -> NT40 NT77 because the first 't' is 't34' which isn't produced by NT40.\n\nSo perhaps the first production is S -> NT82 NT22. Then NT82 -> t29. But the string starts with 't34', which isn't 't29'. So that doesn't fit either. Hmm, perhaps that's impossible, but let me double-check NT82's productions.\n\nLooking at NT82:\n\nNT82 -> NT71 NT5\nWait, looking back: in the provided grammar, the production for NT82 is only NT82 -> t29. So no, NT82 can't produce anything else except 't29'. Therefore, if the string starts with 't34', and NT82 can't produce 't34', then S -> NT82 NT22 isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the productions. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S -> NT82 NT22\n- S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo S splits into either NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77.\n\nFrom NT40, as above, the only direct 't's are t39, t28, t10. So 't34' is not among them.\n\nFrom NT82, the only direct 't' is t29, which doesn't match the first token 't34'.\n\nThis suggests that S either produces t29 followed by something, which isn't the case because the string starts with t34. Alternatively, perhaps there's a more complex derivation involving more non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT82 can produce t29, and after that, the NT22 can produce more tokens. But the string starts with t34, so that's impossible unless NT82 somehow can produce t34, which it can't as per the given rules.\n\nThis suggests that the first production S->NT82 NT22 can't lead to the string because the first 't' is t34, which isn't produced by NT82.\n\nSimilarly, S->NT40 NT77 would need to produce t34 as the first symbol, but NT40's direct productions don't produce t34. So that seems impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing a chain. Let me think recursively. Maybe the NT symbols can produce other NT symbols that eventually lead to 't's.\n\nLooking at NT36, for example:\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT94\n\nThen NT18 -> t33\n\nMT94-> t0\n\nSo that route can produce t33 and t0, but that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken down differently.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. However, in this grammar, I see that some productions have a non-terminal and a terminal, while others have two non-terminals. Wait, that might not be CNF anymore because in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals, not a mix. Hmm, am I missing something? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking closer, I see rules like `S -> NT82 NT22`, which fit CNF, but there are also rules like `NT3 -> 't9'`, where the right-hand side is a terminal. So this grammar is in a mix of CNF because some productions have terminals, making it not a strict standard form anymore. But that's okay; I can still try to parse the string with this grammar.\n\nNow, the string consists of a sequence of terminals: t34, t36, t9, t15, t38, t40, t35, t38, t34, t29, t10, t17. These are all terminals, meaning that each symbol in the string must be directly derived by a production that produces that terminal.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to build the string from the start symbol S by following the productions that lead to the terminals.\n\nStarting with S, which in CNF usually produces two non-terminals. The given grammar starts S with two NT rules: S -> NT82 NT22 and S -> NT40 NT77. So, the first step is to choose one of these two options.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t34. So, I need to find a production of NT that leads to t34. Let me look through the grammar for NT36 -> t35, NT48 -> t15, NT68 -> t5, etc. Wait, not seeing that yet. Let's look for which NT production ends with t34.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT48 -> t15 NT17, but that's a mix of terminal and non-terminal. Wait, no: NT48 -> 't21', NT48 -> 't15 NT17', but maybe I'm not looking right.\n\nWait, let me go rule by rule.\n\nLooking through NT productions:\n\n- NT3 -> t5\n- NT82 -> t29\n- NT40 -> t28\n- NT94 -> t0\n- NT9 -> t40\n- NT18 -> t9\n- NT91 -> t38\n- NT95 -> t10\n- NT74 -> t17\n- NT58 -> t17\n- NT72 -> t8\n- NT36 -> t35\n- NT71 -> t36 t71? Wait, NT71 can produce t36? Let me check: NT71 -> t36, and also elsewhere, like in NT22 -> NT71 and NT97 -> t48.\n\nWait, let me go through each NT that could produce a terminal matching the string.\n\nAnother approach is to work backward from the string, building a parse tree such that each step combines two symbols into one non-terminal, working up to the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t34 t36 t9 t15 t38 t40 t35 t38 t34 t29 t10 t17.\n\nLet me reverse the string to see if the bottom-up approach could work, but maybe it's easier to go top-down.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a chain of productions matching the string step by step.\n\nLet me start with the first symbol t34. Which NTs produce t34?\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT91 -> t38, which isn't t34 directly.\n- NT40 -> t39 (another production), no.\nWait, actually, the NT productions only look on the right side. Let me re-examine:\n\nWait, look for NT where the right-hand side can produce t34.\n\nLooking at the given productions:\n\n- NT3 -> t5\n- NT82 -> t29\n- NT40 -> t28, t15, t39, etc.\n- NT94 -> t9, and t0.\n- NT9 -> t40.\n- NT18 -> t9.\n- NT91 -> t38.\n- NT95 -> t10.\n- NT74 -> t17.\n- NT58 -> t17.\n- NT72 -> t8.\n- NT36 -> t35.\n- NT71 -> t36 and t5 (from NT71's productions: NT71 -> t36, and from another production, NT71 is in NT22 and NT97).\n\nWait, I think I might have a rule that's not correctly written. Check if NT71 has multiple productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT71 -> t36\n- NT71 -> t5\n\nAnd also:\n\n- NT22 -> NT71 and NT48, etc.\n- NT97 -> t48\n- Also, an earlier production was NT97 -> t48, and later NT97 -> t8?\n\nWait, looking through the list, under NT91, it's -> t38.\n\nWait, no.

Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, all the productions are either two non-terminals or terminals. That makes sense since it's in CNF. The start symbol is S, and it has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo the first step is to expand S into one of these, and then continue expanding non-terminals until we get terminals. The provided string is a series of terminals, so each symbol in the string should correspond to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me list the string again: t29, t5, t35, t38, t40, t35, t38, t40, t21, t17, t34, t17, t5.\n\nWait, I should probably count how many symbols there are. There are 13 t's, each with a number. So the derivation should produce exactly these 13 terminals in the correct order.\n\nLooking at the grammar productions for each non-terminal to see if they produce the required terminals.\n\nLet me start by seeing what each production can generate.\n\nFor example, NT40 appears in two productions: one is S \u2192 NT40 NT77, and another is NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 and also NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71 and NT40 \u2192 t28. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I see NT40 has several productions, but let me check:\n\nLooking back, the grammar includes:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\nNT40 \u2192 t28\n\nSo depending on which path is taken, NT40 can produce t28, or the first two which are two non-terminals. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 t15 and also maybe something else? Let me check: in the given grammar, NT77 \u2192 t15.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 t15\n\nYes, so NT77 can directly produce 't15'. Similarly, NT74 \u2192 t17, and NT98 \u2192 t5, etc.\n\nSo, looking at the string, the first symbol is t29. Let me see which non-terminals produce t29.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29\nNT35 \u2192 t29\n\nSo, t29 can come from either NT82 or NT35.\n\nSimilarly, t5 is in the string. What produces t5?\n\nNT0 \u2192 t6, but that's t6. Wait, NT98 \u2192 t5, because in the productions, NT98 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo t5 must come from NT98.\n\nLooking further, t35 can come from NT35, which is a production like NT35 \u2192 t35. Wait, wait, in the grammar, is there an NT35 \u2192 t35?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT35 \u2192 t35.\n\nYes: ND35 \u2192 t29? Wait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nLet me list all the productions where a non-terminal ends up as a terminal:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t29\n- NT35 \u2192 t35\n- NT71 \u2192 t36 and t5? Wait, no: NT71 has two productions: one is production NT71 \u2192 t36, and another is NT71 \u2192 t5?\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT71 appears in several places. For example, NT71 \u2192 t36 and NT71 \u2192 t5. Yes, so NT71 can produce either 't36' or 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 \u2192 t17 and NT97 \u2192 t40.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar again.\n\nSo, the string is: t29 t5 t35 t38 t40 t35 t38 t40 t21 t17 t34 t17 t5.\n\nLet me parse this step by step, maybe using a top-down approach starting from S.\n\nOption 1: S produces NT82 NT22.\n\nIf the first symbol is t29, which could come from NT82 or NT35.\n\nIf from NT82, then NT82 must produce t29. Alternatively, perhaps NT35 produces t35, etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to try to see if each part of the string corresponds to a production.\n\nAlternatively, since it's 13 symbols, maybe the derivation has several steps.\n\nWait, but each application of a production introduces at least one new terminal, but in some cases, non-terminals may introduce more steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can break the string into components that match the productions.\n\nLet me try breaking the string into possible parts.\n\n- First symbol t29: comes from NT82 or NT35.\n\nLooking at option 1: S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nSo, NT82 \u2192 t29, then the next part is NT22. Which can produce t5? Let's see NT22. In the grammar, NT22 can produce multiple things, including t5? Looking: Yes, in the productions, NT22 \u2192 't23', NT22 \u2192 't12', and others, but none of those are t5. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT22 \u2192 t23? Or am I mixing things up? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given grammar production list:\n\nNT22 -> 't23'\nNT22 -> 't12'\n\nWait no, in the given productions, it's:\n\nNT22 -> 't23'\nNT22 -> 't12'\n\nWait, that's in the list. So the symbol 't23' is from NT22, and 't12' as well. So 't23' and 't12' are terminals. But in the string, after t29 comes t5, then t35, etc. So unless there's a 't5' in NT22, which isn't the case. So perhaps S \u2192 NT82 NT22 leads to t29 followed by a non-terminal that can't produce t5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Let's see.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then the first part is NT40 and the second is NT77.\n\nNow, in the string, the first symbol is t29, which could come from NT82 or NT35. But since NT40 is the first non-terminal, it's either producing t29 or t35, but depending on whether it's the left or right part.\n\nWait, no, each production is a single non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals. So for S \u2192 NT40 NT77, we have a production that produces two non-terminals: NT40 and NT77.\n\nSo in the string, if the first symbol is t29 from NT40, then NT40 must produce t29, which would be a terminal. Alternatively, NT40 could produce another non-terminal, but each production for NT40 either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT40 has several productions:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n\nNT40 \u2192 t28\n\nAnd possibly others.\n\nWait, in the given list, under NT40, I see:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n\nWait, that might not be correct.

Hmm, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so my job is to parse this string according to the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in CNF, every production is of the form A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a terminal. So, all the productions here are in that form. That makes parsing easier using methods like the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can do a simpler step-by-step approach since the string is not too long.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S, which has the following productions:\n1. S -> NT82 NT22\n2. S -> NT40 NT77\n\nSo, to derive the string from S, we'll need to split it into two parts that match NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77, and then recursively check each part.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts, A and B, separated by a non-terminal. Since all productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right, each part must expand into a string with an even number of terminals. Wait, but the entire string has 14 tokens. But the starting symbol S produces two non-terminals, so each expansion step produces two non-terminals, making the string length double each time. Hmm, maybe that's not the best way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to see if the string can be split into sequences that match the immediate productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t34. Let's check which productions can derive to t34.\n\nFrom the given rules, I see that t34 appears as the terminal in two places:\n- NT48 -> t21 via NT82->t29 NT74->t17, but no, wait, let me check directly.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see:\n- NT82 -> t29 (but that's a terminal)\nWait, perhaps I should list all the productions with their rules:\n\nLet's list all the productions:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\nNT72 -> NT82 NT35\nNT3 -> NT91 NT94\nNT12 -> NT48 NT74\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT94 -> NT9 NT12\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\nNT22 -> NT68 NT97\nNT94 -> NT72 NT95\nNT12 -> 't31'\nNT22 -> 't23'\nNT15 -> 't49'\nNT97 -> 't48'\nNT98 -> 't5'\nNT18 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't5'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT82 -> 't29'\nNT71 -> 't36'\nNT71 -> 't5'\nNT98 -> 't34'\nNT22 -> 't12'\nNT36 -> 't35'\nNT48 -> 't15'\nNT68 -> 't5'\nNT35 -> 't29'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT94 -> 't0'\nNT72 -> 't8'\nNT40 -> 't28'\nNT9 -> 't40'\nNT18 -> 't9'\nNT91 -> 't38'\nNT95 -> 't10'\nNT77 -> 't15'\nNT40 -> 't39'\nNT82 -> 't34'\nNT48 -> 't21'\nNT74 -> 't17'\nNT58 -> 't17'\n\nOkay, so first, the string starts with t34. Looking at the productions, where does t34 come from?\n\nFrom the rules, t34 is the terminal part of NT74 and NT82.\n\nWait, let me check the NT74 production:\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98. So, NT74 produces two terminals: 58 and 98? Wait, no, NT58 is a non-terminal, right? Or maybe I'm mixing up NT and t terms. Wait, no, in the grammar, NTs are non-terminals, and some of them produce terminals. So, for example, NT22 -> 't23' means that NT22 can be expanded into the terminal 't23'. Similarly, NT82 -> 't29' and NT98 -> 't34'.\n\nSo, looking back, NT74 -> NT58 NT98. Neither NT58 nor NT98 are terminals. So, that's a problem because t34 in the string would have to come from a terminal production.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t34. So, which non-terminal can produce t34 directly? Checking the list:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is just t34.\n\nLooking through, I don't see a production like NTsomething -> t34. Instead, NT74 -> NT58 NT98 and NT98 -> 't34'. So, NT98 can be t34. So, t34 can come from NT98, which is via NT98 -> t34? Or is it NT98 -> NT72 NT95?\n\nWait, NT98's production is: NT98 -> 't5' and NT98 -> NT72 NT95.\n\nWait, no, from the given rules, NT98 has two productions:\n\nLook again: The given NT98 is in two places:\n\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT98 -> 't34'\n\nWait, no, looking at the list:\n\nLooking for NT98, I see:\n\nNT98 -> 't5' and also, wait, in the given list, is there another rule for NT98? Let me check:\n\nYes, here's the list for NT98:\n\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT98 -> NT72 NT95\n\nSo, NT98 can be 't5' or the combination of NT72 and NT95.\n\nBut in the string, t34 comes first. So, where is t34 produced?\n\nLooking at the list, NT94 -> 't0' and also, NT74 -> NT58 NT98, and NT98 -> 't34' as another rule, wait, no, actually, in the list I see:\n\nNT98 -> 't5' and NT98 -> NT72 NT95.\n\nWait, but looking again, no, I think that the NT98 only has two rules: one is to 't5', and the other is to 't34'.

The given grammar looks like it's in CNF since all the rules are either two non-terminals or terminal symbols on the right side.\n\nThe grammar has the start symbol S, and the string to evaluate is \u201ct34 t5 t33 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t40 t21 t17 t17 t34\u201d. I need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should parse the string into tokens because it's a list of terms separated by spaces. So the tokens are: t34, t5, t33, t15, t38, t40, t33, t15, t38, t40, t21, t17, t17, t34.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a terminal. So each rule contributes either two non-terminals or a terminal in the string. Therefore, the string must form a parse tree where each internal node is either a non-terminal production with two children, or a terminal.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77.

{"custom_id":"request-262","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. First, I need to understand what the grammar looks like and how it works. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S can be rewritten in two ways: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the sentence will start with one of these combinations. Let me note that down:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nNow, the string we need to evaluate is: `t29 t36 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t21 t17 t5 t17 t5`\n\nLooking at this string, it's a sequence of t's followed by numbers. Each 't' represents a terminal symbol, and the numbers might be either non-terminals or constants. \n\nI think I should break down the string into a sequence of these terminals and numbers and see if each can be generated from the grammar rules provided. \n\nLet me list out the sequence for clarity:\n\nt29, t36, t9, t15, t38, t40, t9, t15, t38, t40, t21, t17, t5, t17, t5\n\nEach of these should correspond to a node in a parse tree starting from S.\n\nSo, starting with S, which can produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. Let's take each option and see which one can generate the string.\n\nFirst option: S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So the string starts with NT82 followed by NT22.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT82 is a non-terminal that can be rewritten. Checking the rules, NT82 appears on the right-hand side of:\n\n- NT82 -> t29\n\nSo NT82 can only produce t29. That means in the first part, after expanding, we get t29.\n\nThen after NT82, we have NT22. Looking at the rules, NT22 can produce several things:\n\n- NT22 -> NT71 NT48\n- NT22 -> NT68 NT97\n- NT22 -> t12\n- NT22 -> t23\n\nSo NT22 can either be two non-terminals, t12, or t23. Let's see which of these could fit into our string.\n\nThe second part of the string after t29 is t36 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t21 t17 t5 t17 t5.\n\nWait, but after S \u2192 NT82 NT22, we get t29 from NT82, and then NT22 needs to produce the rest. So after t29, we have NT22, which should be expanded and then produce more t's.\n\nLooking at the next terminal in the string after t29 is t36. But NT22 cannot directly produce t36. It can only produce t12 or t23, or other combinations of non-terminals that expand to t's. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. NT22 is a non-terminal, and each occurrence must be replaced according to the grammar rules. So if S \u2192 NT82 NT22, then the derived string up to now would be t29 (from NT82), followed by what NT22 becomes.\n\nBut looking at the string, after t29 comes t36, but NT22 can't produce t36 directly. So perhaps this path is not leading us correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT40 NT77, because using NT82 leading to t29 followed by something might not align with the rest of the string.\n\nLet me explore the second option: S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nFirst, NT40 can expand as per the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT40:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT40 \u2192 NT18 NT94\n- NT40 \u2192 t28\n- etc.\n\nHmm, looking at the string, after S, we have t29, then t36, etc.\n\nWait, no, if we're taking S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then the initial symbols would be whatever NT40 produces and whatever NT77 produces.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me first list out all the non-terminals and terminals, and then create a dependency graph to see how the string can be generated.\n\nThe string is: t29 t36 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t21 t17 t5 t17 t5\n\nLet me represent this as a list: [t29, t36, t9, t15, t38, t40, t9, t15, t38, t40, t21, t17, t5, t17, t5]\n\nEach t followed by a number is a terminal, and any other symbol (like S, NT, numbers without t) are non-terminals.\n\nSo first, let's see what S can produce. It can produce either NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77. So the first two symbols of the string must match either:\n\nCase 1:\n- NT82 \u2192 t29\n- NT22 \u2192 t12 or t23 or some combination of non-terminals leading to t's\n\nOR\n\nCase 2:\n- NT40 \u2192 t28 or other t's\n- NT77 \u2192 t15 or other t's\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first symbol is t29. Let's see if that can come from NT82.\n\nFrom the rules, NT82 can only produce t29, so NT82 \u2192 t29. That would make sense for the first symbol.\n\nSo in Case 1, after NT82 \u2192 t29, we have NT22. Now, the next symbol is t36, which must come from NT22.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT22 can be:\n\n- NT71 NT48\n- NT68 NT97\n- t12\n- t23\n\nNone of these directly produce t36, so this path might not work. Let me check if expanding NT22 further could lead to t36.\n\nBut NT22 is a non-terminal, and in the rules, it expands into other non-terminals, not terminals. So the only way for NT22 to produce a terminal is if it directly matches a number with a t, like t12 or t23. Since t36 is not among these, this path might not be viable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Each expansion of a non-terminal might produce a terminal and a non-terminal in some combination. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the rules, each production for a non-terminal either ends with a terminal or is a combination of two non-terminals. So for NT22, the productions are:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT22 \u2192 t12\n- NT22 \u2192 t23\n\nSo, for NT22 to produce t36, there's no rule that does that. Therefore, after t29 (from NT82), the next symbol must come from NT22, which cannot produce t36. So this path (Case 1) doesn't work.\n\nSo let me consider the other option: S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nThe first symbol is t29. Let's see if NT40 can produce t29.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT40:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT40 \u2192 NT18 NT94\n- NT40 \u2192 t28\n- etc.\n\nNone of these directly produce t29, except for one possibility: if any of these non-terminals expand to t29 through further productions. Let me check each rule:\n\n1. NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0: So, NT97 and NT0. Let's see what each can produce.\n\nLooking at NT97: From the rules, NT97 \u2192 t40.\n\nSo NT97 \u2192 t40.\n\nLooking at NT0: The rules for NT0 are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t6\n- Others involve NT40 and others, but from the rules, only NT0 \u2192 t6.\n\nSo if NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, then this would expand to t40 t6, which is not our initial t29."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the rules, I don't see any rule directly producing t34 from the left-hand side. Instead, many of these rules produce strings composed of non-terminals that expand into t's. So, to get a terminal like t34, it must be the result of expanding non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production rule in the grammar is of the form NTa -> NTb NTc, where a, b, c are numbers. So each rule breaks down a non-terminal into two others until we reach terminals. So, to reach the string, we need a series of expansions that ultimately result in these t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the grammar as a tree and see how the string can be generated. But that might be complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see which parts of the string can be produced by each production.\n\nLooking at the string: t34 t5 t33 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t40 t15 t17 t34 t17 t34.\n\nI need to see if this forms a parse tree starting from S.\n\nSince S can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77 in two ways.\n\nLet me check if the first part could be derived from S -> NT82 NT22.\n\nSuppose we take the first symbol as t34, which comes from NT74, as I thought earlier. Wait, in the grammar, NT74 -> NT58 NT98. NT58 is NT17 and NT98 is NT5. NT58 is derived from NT49, which is NT6 and NT... Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the production rules that can produce the first symbol, t34. Let's look for any rule in the grammar where a non-terminal produces t34. But looking through the rules, I don't see any. So that means t34 must be the result of expanding a non-terminal on the left side of a production.\n\nSo, in other words, the non-terminals that expand to a terminal string must produce t34. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t34.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT74 and NT82 and NT48 and NT22 and NT36 and NT18 and others. Wait, I don't see any rule that has a terminal on the right-hand side except those where the non-terminals expand to terminals. For example, NT12 -> 't31', so if a production has NT12 on the right, it can produce 't31'.\n\nWait, but in this grammar, many non-terminals have productions that result in terminals. So, perhaps I can find the terminal symbols by looking at the productions where a non-terminal directly expands to a single terminal. Let's list all the production rules that produce a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT9 -> 't40'\n\nNT18 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't5'\n\nNT12 -> 't31'\n\nNT22 -> 't23'\n\nNT40 -> 't6'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT94 -> 't0'\n\nNT72 -> 't8'\n\nNT40 -> 't28'\n\nNT77 -> 't15'\n\nNT48 -> 't17'\n\nNT74 -> 't17'\n\nNT58 -> 't17'\n\nSo these non-terminals can produce terminals directly.\n\nFor example, NT12 -> 't31', but in the string, I have t34 t5 t33..., so perhaps I need to combine these. But looking at the string, the first symbol is t34, so t34 must come from a production of NT74 (since NT74 -> NT58 NT98, and NT58 is 't5' and NT98 is 't34').\n\nWait, let's clarify: NT74's production is NT58 NT98. So if NT58 is 't5' and NT98 is 't34', then NT74 -> 't5' 't34'. Or does NT58 produce a terminal? NT58 is defined as NT17, which in turn is 't17'. So maybe my earlier thought was incorrect.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT58 -> NT17\n\nNT17 -> 't17'\n\nSo if NT58 is NT17, and then NT17 is 't17', so NT17 actually expands to 't17'. Therefore, NT58 is 't17'.\n\nWait, but NT98 is 't34' because NT98 is in the list of NTs that directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n NT98 -> 't34' according to the rule NT98 -> 't34'.\n\nSo, putting this together, if a production includes NT74, which produces NT58 NT98, then that part would be NT58 (which is 't17') and NT98 ('t34'), so NT74 -> 't17' 't34' which is 't17 t34'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first two symbols are t34 t5. That doesn't fit with 't17 t34'. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first production is from NT82. NT82 -> 't34', so if a production uses NT82, then it would contribute 't34'. But looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT82, it has:\n\n S -> NT82 NT22\n NT82 -> 't29'\n So, in this case, if NT82 is directly a terminal 't29', then S can produce 't29' 't23' if NT22 is 't23'.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't34 t5', so S can't produce 't29' because the first token is t34, which doesn't match. Therefore, the first production must come from S -> NT40 NT77.\n\nLooking at NT40 and NT77:\n\n NT40 can have multiple productions:\n NT40 -> NT97 NT0\n NT40 -> NT15 NT71\n NT48 -> NT36 NT3\n NT22 -> NT68 NT97\n NT74 -> NT58 NT98\n Etc.\n\nWait, I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at nt74's rule: NT74 -> NT58 NT98, which then, as we saw, is 't17' and 't34', so t17 t34. Maybe I'm looking at the NT12 and NT22 rules to find how t31 and t23 fit, but the initial string is t34 t5, so I need to see where the t34 comes first.\n\nWait, another way: maybe the string starts with S's expansion. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t34, t5, t33, t15, t38, t40, t33, t15, t38, t40, t15, t17, t34, t17, t34.\n\nPerhaps t34 begins a chain. Let's see if t34 can come from any NT's production.\n\nLooking at NT74, it produces two NTs: NT58 and NT98. NT98 is 't34', NT58 is 't17'. So NT74 -> 't17' 't34'.

The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens. \n\nFirst, I remember that CFGs in CNF have production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. Each production has exactly two symbols on the right side, which could be two non-terminals or a mix. Since this grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string given is: `t34 t36 t33 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t35 t38 t0 t17 t17 t34`.\n\nI need to check if this string could be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules. \n\nI'll start by analyzing the structure of the grammar and the string. The string begins with `t34`, and looking at the production rules, I see that `t34` is on the right side of the rule `NT72 -> NT82 NT35`. So, `t34` must come from NT82 and NT35. But wait, looking at the grammar, `NT35` is another production. Let me check: `NT35 -> NT29 NT16` (I think, but actually, in the given grammar, looking at `NT35`... Hmm, wait, the given grammar doesn't have NT35 as a production. Let me re-examine the provided grammar.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I don't see `NT35`.

So `t35` is directly terminal, derived from NT35.\n\nBut wait, the production `NT72->NT82 NT35`. So in the string, the first part after S is `t34 t36 ...`. \n\nWait, the string starts with `t34 t36 t33 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t35 t38 t0 t17 t17 t34`.\n\nSo, starting from S, which can be split into S->NT82 NT22 or S->NT40 NT77.\n\nLet's see where `t34` comes from. Looking through the rules, `t34` is in the right-hand side of NT72 and NT94. So, either NT72 or NT94 can produce `t34`.\n\nSo, in the first step, S can produce NT82 and NT22, or NT40 and NT77. But `t34` is the first token. So, the first symbol comes from either NT82 or NT40.\n\nWait, because the first production is S->NT82 NT22, which gives the first symbols as the expansion of NT82 and NT22. So, the string starts with NT82 and NT22. So, the first symbols would be derived from NT82, then NT22.\n\nAlternatively, if S->NT40 NT77, then the first symbols would be from NT40 and NT77, but in the string, the first symbol is `t34`, which isn't a terminal from NT40 or NT77 directly.

The string to evaluate is `t29 t36 t33 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t5 t17 t5 t17`.\n\nFirst, I remember that a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar has productions where non-terminals are replaced by exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B are non-terminals and C is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that all the rules are either of the form X \u2192 YZ where Y and Z are non-terminals or X \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe task is to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. Parsing in CNF can be approached with a recursive descent parser or a top-down method where for each non-terminal, we generate all possible pairs of symbols it can yield and check if the string can be derived from it.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t29, t36, t33, t15, t38, t40, t33, t15, t38, t40, t9, t15, t5, t17, t5, t17.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to find a derivation of the string starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking back at the grammar's start symbols:\n\nS can produce NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nI should try to see if the string can be derived from either of these.\n\nSo, let's consider S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then NT82 and NT22 must produce the beginning of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t29. Let's see what NT82 \u2192 t29. Checking the grammar rules, looking for NT82 \u2192 something that can produce t29.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT82: there's NT82 \u2192 t29. Oh, actually, according to the grammar, NT82 is a terminal because of NT82 -> 't29'. So, S \u2192 NT82 t29, but in the string, the first symbol is t29. So, NT82 would produce t29, which matches the first token. Then, the next symbol is t36, so we need NT22 to produce t36 or something that can derive down to t36 followed by other symbols.\n\nWait, wait no. Wait, S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So, starting with S, it's NT82, followed by NT22. So, NT82 is t29, which matches the first symbol. Then the next part is NT22, which should derive the rest: t36, t33, t15, etc.\n\nBut wait, does each symbol in the string need to be matched step by step? Or does it generate two non-terminals at a time, and I need to track if the entire string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nMaybe an alternative way is to process the string as a series of productions. Let's try:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So, the string must be NT82 followed by NT22. \n\nNT82 \u2192 t29. So the first token is t29. Now, what's left is the string starting from the second token: t36, t33, t15, t38, t40, t33, t15, t38, t40, t9, t15, t5, t17, t5, t17.\n\nNow, we have NT22, which must derive the rest. So, what can NT22 produce?\n\nLooking at NT22's rules:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48 or NT22 \u2192 't23'.\n\nBut the remaining string starts with t36, which isn't a terminal for NT22. So, NT22 must be rewritten into non-terminals that eventually produce t36, but t36 is a terminal for NT82 and NT36.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if t36 can be generated by NT22 via some derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT22: The production NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48. So, NT22 is followed by NT71 and NT48.\n\nBut in the string, after t29 (NT82), the next is t36, but if NT22 leads to NT71 and NT48, then after t29, we have something that could be NT71 and NT48. So, we need to check if t36 can be reached from NT71 or NT48.\n\nLooking at NT71's rules:\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT5 NT17 (Production 1)\nNT71 \u2192 't36' (Production 2)\nWait, no, checking the rules, looking for NT71:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT71 -> NT5 NT17\nWait, but in the list of rules, NT71 is also 't5' (from NT97 -> NT75?

Or are there others?\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, I think NT71 only has that one rule as a non-terminal and 't36' is not a terminal for NT71. Wait, no, looking back at the provided rules:\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT82 NT22, then all the rest are NT-based.\n\nWait, I think I'm misreading. Let me list all the productions again to clarify.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT82 NT22\nS -> NT40 NT77\n\nNT36 -> NT18 NT77\nNT22 -> NT71 NT48\nNT74 -> NT58 NT98\nNT72 -> NT82 NT35\nNT3 -> NT91 NT94\nNT12 -> NT48 NT74\nNT40 -> NT97 NT0\nNT94 -> NT9 NT12\nNT40 -> NT15 NT71\nNT48 -> NT36 NT3\nNT22 -> NT68 NT97\nNT94 -> NT72 NT95\nNT12 -> 't31'\nNT22 -> 't23'\nNT15 -> 't49'\nNT97 -> 't48'\nNT98 -> 't5'\nNT18 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't5'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT82 -> 't29'\nNT71 -> 't36'  --> Wait, does NT71 have a production to 't36'?

The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string can be derived from the grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. That simplifies some things because when generating strings, each production of a symbol reduces the number of symbols by one. Also, each step in the derivation introduces one terminal, so for a string of length n, the depth of the derivation tree would be n.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t29 t36 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t35 t38 t0 t17 t5 t17 t5`. Let's count the tokens here. Starting from the first, there's 17 tokens. Wait, no, wait: t29 is the first, then t36, t9, t15, t38, t40, t9, t15, t38, t40, t35, t38, t0, t17, t5, t17, t5. So that's 17 tokens. But wait, no, starting from the first, it's 17: positions 1 to 17. So the string is 17 symbols long.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in a leftmost derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one. The start symbol is S, which is a non-terminal. The string is composed of terminals, and we have to see if S can be expanded through a series of productions to produce exactly these terminals in the correct order.\n\nGiven that the grammar is small, perhaps the string can be checked by following a sequence of productions that generates each token in the string.\n\nI'll try to think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll note the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo the start symbol S can produce two possible pairs: NT82 followed by NT22, or NT40 followed by NT77. So each of these will need to be expanded further.\n\nI need to check if the given string can be formed by expanding these non-terminals step by step until all are terminals. Each expansion step must produce a terminal, and the entire string must match.\n\nLet me start with the first production: S \u2192 NT82 NT22. If the string starts with t29, which is part of NT82, because looking at the NT82 rules, NT82 \u2192 t29. Wait, yes, under NT82's productions, there's NT82 \u2192 t29. So NT82 can produce t29.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol in the string is t29, which is exactly what NT82 can produce. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT82 NT22, then NT82 \u2192 t29. So the first token is t29. Then, the next part is NT22.\n\nLooking at the NT22 productions, I see multiple options, but in the string, the next token after t29 is t36. So we need to see if NT22 can produce t36.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, after the first step, S \u2192 NT82 NT22 becomes t29 followed by NT22. Now, NT22 can produce several things: nt23, nt74, etc. Looking at NT22's productions:\n\nLooking at NT22's rules:\n\nNT22 \u2192 t23, but in the string, after t29, it's t36. Maybe I'm mistaken. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT22 \u2192 t23, but that's in the given productions. But wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nThe user provided:\n\nNT22 \u2192 t23\n\nSo NT22 can produce t23 as a terminal. So the string after t29 is t36. So perhaps the first production is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I'm not seeing all the options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some NT22 rules, but looking at the provided grammar, under NT22, there are multiple options, including NT22 \u2192 t23, and others, but the immediate match after t29 is t36. So perhaps I need to see if NT22 can produce t36 as a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT22 producing t36 directly. Let me check.\n\nLooking back, under NT22, the productions include:\n\nNT22 \u2192 t23, and other options like NT71 \u2192 t36, but wait, no, NT22 cannot produce t36 directly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the NT22's productions again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT22, the productions are:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t23\n\nBut wait, in the initial list, it's written as:\n\nNT22 -> 't23'\n\nOther options for NT22 are:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t71 (because in the rules, I see 't36' under NT71's productions, but NT22 can go to t71 as well.\n\nWait, wait, let's list all NT22 productions:\n\nLooking back, from the given grammar:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t23\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t71 NT48\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t68 NT97\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't23' again (duplicate)\n\nSo, the options are t23, t71 plus NT48, t68 plus NT97, and t12.\n\nWait, but t12 is another terminal, so NT22 can produce t12 as well.\n\nBut the string after t29 is t36. So perhaps the initial production was wrong. Because after t29, NT22 would produce t36.\n\nWait, maybe the initial expansion is wrong. So let's re-examine: The string starts with t29, which is from N T82, so S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nThen, after t29, we have t36. So NT22 must produce t36. But looking at NT22's productions, I don't see t36 as a direct terminal. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that after S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So perhaps starting with NT40, which can produce t40, and then NT77, which can produce t15?\n\nWait, but the string starts with t29, not t40. So perhaps I should check both branches, but that might complicate things. Maybe starting with the first branch, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, and see if it's possible to reach the string.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29.\n\nThen, NT22 must expand to start with t36. But in the NT22's options, I don't see t36 as a direct terminal. So perhaps I made an error. Let me check the NT22 rules again.\n\nWait, under NT22's productions, I have:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t23\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t71 NT48\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t68 NT97\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t12\n\nHmm, none of these directly produce t36. So maybe the initial production is not NT22, but something else. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the NT22's production may have a rule that leads to t36 through further expansion.\n\nSo, maybe NT22's first production is t23, which is a terminal, but t23 is different from t36, so that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the NT82 and NT22.\n\nWait, maybe after NT82 \u2192 t29, then the next symbol should come from NT22. So we have t29 followed by t36, which is from NT22. So, the question is: can NT22 derive t36?\n\nLooking at NT22 again, can NT22 eventually produce t36 through some expansion?\n\nLet me consider possible expansions.\n\nFirst, in the grammar, NT22 can produce NT71 NT48.\n\nIf we take NT71 \u2192 t36, then NT71 can produce t36. So, does NT71 produce t36? Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT71, it seems that in NT22's expansion, we have NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48.

The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to figure out if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Wait, actually, the grammar is structured in CNF because every production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So that checks out.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \"t29 t5 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t0 t17 t17 t34\". \n\nI need to work backwards from the string, reconstructing possible derivations using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces a single terminal or two non-terminals. This likely leads to the string being built from the start symbol S through a series of steps where each step involves replacing non-terminals with two others or terminals.\n\nStarting with the entire string, I'll try to split it into parts that correspond to the productions, starting from S. The string's length is 17 tokens. In CNF, the derivation tree would be a binary tree since each production splits a symbol into two. So, the number of symbols (terminals and non-terminals) at each step increases by one, leading to the starting point of one symbol.\n\nI'll approach this recursively, trying to find possible splits of the string into two parts that each can be derived from the left-hand side of some production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions starting from S are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the entire string can be split into two parts that match either of these.\n\nThe string has 17 tokens. Split after the k-th token, where k ranges from 1 to 16. Let's consider both S productions.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT82 is a terminal (t29). So, after NT82, the rest of the string should correspond to NT22.\n\nLet me check the string from position 2 onward: t5 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t0 t17 t17 t34.\n\nI need to see if this can be NT22 \u2192 t5 t9 ... ?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT22 appears in a few productions. The productions for NT22 include:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n\nSo, NT22 can be a terminal (t23) or a combination of two non-terminals. Since the rest of the string starts with t5, which isn't t23, we'll have to see if t5 can be part of a production that leads to NT22.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first split of the string isn't correct, and I should try the other S production.\n\nLet me try S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nLooking at NT40's productions:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT40 \u2192 't49'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39'\n\nSo, NT40 can be a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t29, which is NT82. So after S \u2192 NT40 NT77, the string starts with t29, which is part of NT82. Wait, but NT40 is a different non-terminal, so perhaps this approach isn't matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when reconstructing the string, each production S \u2192 AB would mean the entire string should split into A and B, each of which must be the corresponding non-terminals. So for the first S production, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, the string should split into NT82 and NT22, each derived from the left and right parts.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t29, which matches NT82 directly. So that's a match. Then, the remaining tokens are from t5 onward until the end. That's 16 tokens. Now, I need to see if this can be derived from NT22.\n\nLooking at NT22's productions, it can expand to 't23', or to combinations of non-terminals. Since the string starts with t5, maybe t5 is part of a non-terminal production. Let me check the possible NT22 productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't23' \u2192 but the string starts with t5, so that wouldn't match unless t5 is t23, which it isn't.\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n\nHmm, none of these directly yield t5 as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. In the grammar, the non-terminals can expand into other non-terminals, so I might need to split further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this recursively. Let me try to see if the substring after t29 (which is t5 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t0 t17 t17 t34) can be derived from NT22.\n\nLooking at the substrings, I can consider possible splits:\n\nIs the entire substring a terminal? The last token is t34. From the grammar, I can see if any production of NT22 can derive up to t34. Alternatively, perhaps the substring is generated by NT22, which might itself be built from other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial split isn't correct. Maybe I should try the other S production.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nLooking at the first token t29 (NT82) doesn't match NT40, so that can't be. Unless perhaps I'm misunderstanding the productions. Wait, wait. In the grammar, the productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22\n\nS \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nSo, S can produce either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is NT82 (t29). So, if S produces NT82 NT22, that would mean the string starts with NT82 and the rest should be NT22.\n\nIf S instead were to produce NT40 NT77, then the first token should be NT40. Since the string starts with NT82, the S \u2192 NT40 NT77 production can't be used here.\n\nTherefore, the first production must be used: S \u2192 NT82 NT22. So, the string is t29 followed by the string that NT22 must derive.\n\nSo, focusing on the substring after t29: t5 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t0 t17 t17 t34.\n\nNow, let's check if this can be derived from NT22.

Oh, yes: NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77, NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94, and specifically, NT3 leads to 't5'? Or wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list out the rules where terminals appear.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals are 't29', 't36', 't33', 't15', 't38', 't40', 't9', 't17', 't10', 't5' \u2014 these are all the terminals in the string, each corresponding to a specific production. So I need to see if each 't' is produced correctly.\n\nLooking for 't29': NT82 and NT36 have productions that include 't29'. Let me check:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t29 (in the string, but wait, in the grammar rule, NT82 is produced by NT82 \u2192 t29, so actually NT82 \u2192 't29'? Yes. Similarly, NT36 \u2192 't35' or 't36'? Wait, let's look at NT36's rules. NT36 has \u2192 NT18 NT77, which doesn't directly produce 't36', but another NT36 production is \u2192 NT73 NT48, which isn't relevant. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, let me check each rule to see where the terminals are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22 \u2192 so S can derive to t29 and t22?\n\nWait, no. Let's list all terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77: not terminal.\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, so NT22 can derive to NT71 and NT48, but looking for terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should list each terminal symbol and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- 't29' comes from NT82 \u2192 t29.\n- 't36' comes from NT94 \u2192 't36'? Let me check: NT94 \u2192 't36'? Wait, according to the rules, NT94 is either \u2192 NT3 NT12 or \u2192 't40'. Hmm, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, let's go through each rule to see where each terminal comes from:\n\n1. NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77 (no terminal)\n2. NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48 (no terminal)\n3. NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98 (no terminal)\n4. NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35 (no terminal)\n5. NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12 (no terminal)\n6. NT71 \u2192 t36 (Wait, no: looking for 't36' in the rules. Here's a production where a terminal appears: NT94 \u2192 't21'? Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list each terminal as a production rule.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I find the following terminal productions:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 't17' (from NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98, but wait, actually NT74 isn't a terminal. Wait, the terminals in the string are 't29', 't36', 't33', etc., so each must be generated by some production.\n\nFrom the given rules, the terminals appear as:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t29: So, NT82 can produce 't29'.\n- NT71 \u2192 t36: Not present, but wait, NT18 \u2192 t33? Let's check NT18's productions: NT18 \u2192 NT33 (another production) or NT9 (another production). Wait, NT18: looking back, in the rules: NT18 is produced by \u2192 NT33 (from NT36's rule) and \u2192 NT9. So NT18 can produce 't33'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each terminal to the production rule that produces it.\n\nLet me go through each rule and check for terminals:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22: Now, NT82's productions include \u2192 t29, and NT22's productions include \u2192 t31, t23, etc.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I find that:\n\n- NT3 leads to 't5' (from NT3's last rule: NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94 \u2192 but wait, no, in the given rules, NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94, and those are non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check each rule for where a terminal appears.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT82 has \u2192 t29.\n- NT36 has \u2192 t33 (Wait, no: looking at the rules again. Let me check each N Ts for terminals.\n\nIt seems that NT36's only production is to other non-terminals. Similarly:\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT82 has \u2192 t29 at the end: yes.\n- NT36: Only rules where it's produced as NT18 NT77, not terminals.\n- NT22: Has two rules ending with 't31' and 't23', so:\n  - NT22 \u2192 t31 and t23. So those are terminals.\n- NT74: Ends with t5. Wait, looking at the rules: I don't see 't5' as a terminal in NT74's production. Wait, perhaps NT98 \u2192 t5, as per another rule.\n- NT22 has a production to 't9' (NT9 \u2192 t40; no, that's a non-terminal. Wait, I'm getting lost.\n\nLet me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule where a production ends with a terminal symbol.\n\nHere's a list:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n2. S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-329","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the grammar and the string are.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which can produce two NT symbols. For example, S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Then, each NT symbol can be rewritten into other NT symbols until we reach terminal characters (like 't31', 't23', etc.) or numbers.\n\nThe string to check is: t29 t5 t9 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t8 t10 t17 t17 t5.\n\nFirst, I should parse this string to see if it follows the production rules of the grammar, starting from S.\n\nLet me outline the approach. Each production in the grammar splits the left-hand side into two parts, and each part can be non-terminals or terminals. The process of parsing involves replacing the non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain, which should match the string.\n\nTo parse, I can use a recursive descent approach or the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is small, maybe I can do it manually by looking for how the string can be broken down.\n\nLet me see the string step by step. The string is 19 elements long. Starting from S, which can split into two parts: for example, S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then each of these can split again, so I need to check if the string can be divided accordingly.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps the first two elements are NT82 and something else. But the string starts with t29, which corresponds to NT82? Wait, no, looking back, NT82 is a terminal 't29', yes. So the first production is S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nSo the string starts with t29 (NT82) followed by t5. Wait, but according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Wait, no: looking again, the grammar S is NT82 NT22? Wait, no, the grammar for S is S \u2192 NT82 NT22 or S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So S consists of two non-terminals.\n\nSo the string must start with two NT symbols, which then each are split into more NT symbols until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of this as the entire string is a series of terminals, and I need to see if it can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nLet me try to parse from the left. The entire string is structured as a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo the first step is to split the string into possible non-terminals, working from the top level.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to look for the structure of the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is a single non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals, until the bottom where non-terminals become terminals.\n\nSo to generate the string, each non-terminal must produce two parts, each of which must match the corresponding parts of the string when decomposed.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two parts. Let's see if the string starts with S's two components.\n\nSuppose S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then the first part is NT82, which should correspond to 't29' (since NT82 is 't29'), so the first element of the string is 't29' as expected. The second part of S is NT22, which should be the rest of the string after 't29'.\n\nWait, but the string after 't29' is 't5 t9 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t8 t10 t17 t17 t5'.\n\nBut according to S \u2192 NT82 NT22, NT22 must expand into 't5... t5' as per the grammar. Wait, let's see NT22's productions. Looking at the grammar, NT22 can be 't23' or split into other NTs. Wait, let's check the productions for NT22.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT22 has multiple productions:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n\nNT22 \u2192 't23'\n\nWait, but in the string after 't29' is 't5' which is a terminal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Because if S is NT82 (which is 't29') and NT22, which is 't23', then the entire string should be t29 followed by t23. But the given string is longer than that. So maybe S is expanding into something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nWait, let's check NT77's productions. NT77 is in the grammar, and the productions for it are:\n\nNT77 -> NT58 NT98\n\nLooking at NT58, it's in the grammar as:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT17 NT17\n\nSo, NT77 can expand into NT58 NT98, which then expand into (NT17 NT17) and NT98.\n\nBut wait, the string has some t elements that might correspond to these. Let me see.\n\nBut before getting into this, perhaps another approach is to look for the entire string and see if it can be structured by the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother idea: the entire string's length is 19, which is an odd number, but each production step increases the number of symbols by 1 (since each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols). Starting from S, which is two symbols, then after each step, the number of symbols increases by one. So for a string of length n, the number of steps needed is n-2. For n=19, that's 17 steps, which is possible.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider that for a string to be generated by a grammar in CNF, its derivation must consist of a leftmost derivation where each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this using parsing: see if the given string can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nLet's attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nGiven string: t29 t5 t9 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t8 t10 t17 t17 t5\n\nFirst, the string starts with t29.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT82 NT22, which is t29 followed by NT22. So if the string starts with t29, perhaps NT22 could expand into the rest.\n\nBut NT22 has several options: 't23', or NT71 NT48, or NT68 NT97, or 't23'.\n\nIf NT22 is 't23', the string would be t29 t23, but the actual string is much longer, so that can't be the case. Therefore, NT22 must be expanding into NT71 NT48 or NT68 NT97 or something else.\n\nLet's check the grammar for NT22:\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n\nSo, perhaps NT22 is expanding into NT71 and NT48. Then, the string after t29 is t5, which would be NT71? Or maybe not. Let's see the productions for NT71.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT71 has productions:\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 NT36\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT48 NT74\n\nWait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, the NT71's productions:\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, there's:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n\nNT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

For example, NT12 has production NT48 NT74 and also 't31'. Similarly, NT22 has multiple terminals. But in CNF, each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the approach to generate the string is to see if it can be built up from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let me note that the grammar starts with S, which has two production rules: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the initial step would be to expand S into one of these options, which are non-terminals multiplied by another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nGiven that the target string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if there's a way to expand S into a string of terminals that matches the given string. Since the string is quite long, with 19 tokens, I need to see if it can be built up by splitting it into parts according to the grammar.\n\nLet me write the target string as a list: [t29, t5, t9, t15, t38, t40, t33, t15, t38, t40, t9, t15, t38, t29, t29, t10, t17, t17, t5]\n\nNow, starting from S, each production can generate two non-terminals. So the first step is to pick one of the two productions of S and see if either can lead to the target string.\n\nLet me consider the first production of S: NT82 NT22.\n\nExpanding S via S \u2192 NT82 NT22:\n\n- Now, we have to derive t29, t5, etc., starting with NT82 and NT22.\n\nBut wait, NT82 can be a terminal or further expanded. Looking at NT82 rules, in the provided grammar, NT82 \u2192 't29', as per rule 23 and 42. So NT82 is 't29'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT22: From the provided grammar, NT22 has several productions, some of which are terminals and some non-terminals. For example, NT22 \u2192 't23' is one production, but also NT22 \u2192 't12' (rule 27). But in our target string, the first two tokens are 't29' and 't5'. So let's see how that could be generated.\n\nWait, the first token is 't29'. Let's see which NT can derive 't29'. From the grammar, both NT82 (rule 23) and NT36 (rule 38 and 31) can be 't29'. But wait, in the given grammar, is there any NT that can derive 't29'?\n\nLooking through the rules, yes:\n\n- NT36 (rules 31 and 38) \u2192 't29'\n\n- NTT36 also has NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77 (rule 3). So perhaps one path is NT82 \u2192 't29', and then NT22 being able to derive the rest.\n\nBut let me map this out more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to apply the CYK algorithm to the string. The CYK algorithm is designed to determine if a string can be generated by a grammar in CNF. Since it's quite involved, but perhaps manageable here.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell represents a substring of the input, and at each step, it tries to find a production that matches the corresponding substring.\n\nThe steps for CYK:\n\n1. Initialize a table where each position corresponds to a substring of the input string.\n2. For each position, check if the substring can be derived from any non-terminal using a production rule in CNF.\n3. Proceed filling the table by expanding non-terminals in a bottom-up manner.\n4. If the entire string can be derived from the start symbol at the last step, the answer is Yes.\n\nGiven that, let's try to construct the table for the input string.\n\nFirst, the input string is: t29 t5 t9 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t29 t29 t10 t17 t17 t5\n\nLet me represent this as a list: tokens = [t29, t5, t9, t15, t38, t40, t33, t15, t38, t40, t9, t15, t38, t29, t29, t10, t17, t17, t5]\n\nThe length of the string is 19 tokens. So the table will be 19 rows, each representing the start and end positions of the substring. The first step is to fill the table for substrings of length 1 (each single token), then 2, up to 19.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, and considering that I'm doing this manually, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to find"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I notice that each rule starts with a capital letter, like S, NT..., and the terminals are everything else, like t34, NT36, etc. The string we're evaluating consists of a sequence of terminals, all lowercase t's followed by numbers. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar rules to see how these terminals can be formed. Each rule is either a production to two other non-terminals or a terminal. So, for the string to be generated, each part of it must correspond to a path in the grammar.\n\nLet's list the rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT82 NT22 and S \u2192 NT40 NT77. If the string starts with t34, which is part of 't34 t5 ...', I need to see how these can be reached. \n\nLooking for t34, I check the rules and see that:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t15 (from NT48 \u2192 t15, which is a terminal)\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98, which might lead to t17 because NT58 \u2192 t17 and NT98 \u2192 t34, but wait, NT98 has two rules: NT98 \u2192 t34 and NT98 \u2192 t5. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t34, t5, t35, t38, t40, t9, t15, t38, t40, t35, t38, t40, t33, t15, t38, t0, t17, t17, t17.\n\nThat's 19 tokens. Let me see how the grammar can generate this. Each step in the derivation will split into non-terminals until all leaves are terminals.\n\nStarting from S, which can go to NT82 NT22 or NT40 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t34. Let me see which non-terminals can produce t34.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t17 and tsomething, wait, NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98. The NT58 and NT98: Wait, looking closely, some rules have terminal symbols. Let me find rules where the result is 't34' or similar.\n\nWait, the rules are given as:\n\nFor example, NT74 -> NT58 NT98\nNT48 -> t15\nNT98 -> t34\nNT18 -> t33\nNT36 -> t35\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, t34 can be derived from NT98. So, if a production like NT98 \u2192 t34 is used.\n\nAlso, looking at NT48 \u2192 t15, which is another way to get t15.\n\nAlso, NT0 \u2192 t6, but that doesn't help here.\n\nSo, let's try to see the entire string as a series of these steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can approach the problem by building a parse tree for the string and see if it can fit into the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the CYK algorithm, which is a parsing algorithm for context-free grammars in Chomsky normal form. But since this is a thought process, I'll try to proceed step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to represent each position of the string as nodes and see which non-terminals can produce the required substring. But that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can map each terminal in the string to the rule that produces it.\n\nLet's list the terminals in order:\n\n1. t34\n2. t5\n3. t35\n4. t38\n5. t40\n6. t9\n7. t15\n8. t38\n9. t40\n10. t35\n11. t38\n12. t40\n13. t33\n14. t15\n15. t38\n16. t0\n17. t17\n18. t17\n19. t17\n\nWait, but the string is 19 tokens, which could correspond to 10 steps since some rules split into two non-terminals each time. But let's think about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can try to look for possible leftmost derivations.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT40 NT77. Let's take S and expand it into NT40 NT77.\n\nNow, the first symbol is t34. So, let's see how t34 is generated. Looking at the rules, t34 is the result of NT98. So, maybe NT77 can produce t5, and NT40 can produce t34, but wait, NT40 can produce two things.\n\nLooking at NT40:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0 (so that would produce two non-terminals)\nAND also NT40 \u2192 t28 (another terminal)\n\nWait, in the rules, it's listed as:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\nand it also seems to have another rule: looking back, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, and also elsewhere, NT40 is involved in other productions. Let me check all NT40 rules.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- Is there another NT40 rule? Wait, yes: NT40 \u2192 t28 is the second rule under NT40. So, NT40 can produce either the non-terminals NT97 and NT0, or the terminal t28.\n\nBut our string starts with t34, which is derived from NT98. So, perhaps NT77 needs to produce t5, and NT40 needs to produce something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Let me think again.\n\nIf S is being expanded as S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then after the first step, the string is [t34, ...], so perhaps NT40 produces the first two symbols?\n\nWait, no. In context-free grammars, the string is the concatenation of the terminals produced by each non-terminal in the derivation.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then in the first step, we have NT40 NT77. Each of these is a non-terminal, which will be expanded further.\n\nSo, in the first step, we get a string like (something) (something), where each 'something' is the expansion of NT40 and NT77.\n\nBut our string starts with t34, which is a terminal. So, perhaps the NT77 is producing some terminals, and the NT40 is producing others.\n\nWait, NT77 can be expanded into NT48 BT? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at NT77, perhaps it's defined elsewhere. Wait, the provided rules include:\n\nNT77: I don't see NT77's rules listed here. Wait, looking back, I only see up to NT99, but perhaps I missed NT77.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of rules with NTs like S, NT36, NT22, etc., but in the list above, I see NT77 is present as per \"NT77 -> t15\" perhaps? Wait, let me go through it.\n\nLooking at the rules, I find:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t15? Or wait, after checking, I think:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT77 is not a terminal but perhaps is derived from other non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-371","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is `t29 t36 t9 t15 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t40 t35 t38 t40 t35 t38 t40 t31 t17 t17 t17 t34`, which we can split into tokens: [t29, t36, t9, t15, t38, t40, t33, t15, t38, t40, t35, t38, t40, t35, t38, t40, t31, t17, t17, t17, t34].\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right-hand side. Looking at the grammar rules, they all fit this structure. So, parsing can be done using the CYK algorithm or recursive descent, but since the string is relatively short, perhaps a substitution approach or backtracking might be manageable.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a tree. Each token must be derived from S through a series of production rules. Since the string consists entirely of terminals, all non-terminals must have been fully expanded by the time we reach the leaves (the terminals).\n\nLet me list the possible production rules that can generate each token. I'll look for each 'tX' token and find which rule, when expanded, can produce it.\n\n1. t29: Looking for any rule that has t29. Yes, NT82 \u2192 t29 and NT35 \u2192 t29. So, possible sources are NT82 or NT35.\n\n2. t36: Found in NT36 \u2192 t36.\n\n3. t9: NT9 \u2192 t9.\n\n4. t15: NT15 \u2192 t15.\n\n5. t38: Multiple rules produce t38. For example, NT74 \u2192 t17, but that might not help here. Wait, no: looking at the rules, NT77 \u2192 t15. Wait, no, another approach: let's check each production where the right-hand side could result in a terminal.\n\nWait, I think I need to better structure this. Let me list each terminal and see which production can produce it:\n\n- t29: From NT82 and NT35 (NT35 \u2192 t29)\n- t36: From NT36\n- t9: From NT9 (NT9 \u2192 t9)\n- t15: From NT15 (NT15 \u2192 t15)\n- t38: Looking at the rules, is there a production starting with NT that can produce t38? Let me check. NT77 \u2192 t15, which isn't t38. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Looking more carefully:\n\nWait, I'm seeing rules like NT76 \u2192 NT68 NT97, but t38 isn't directly produced. Let me double-check. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's better to use a step-by-step approach, trying to build the string by possible subtrees.\n\nAnother idea: construct a parse tree bottom-up or top-down. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, we can try to see if the entire string can be covered by a single S production.\n\nLooking at the top-level rules: S \u2192 NT82 NT22, S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So any string generated by S must start with either NT82 followed by NT22 or NT40 followed by NT77. The given string starts with t29, which is part of NT82 or NT35. But in the top-level rules, S produces two non-terminals, each expanding into parts of the string. Wait, but in the given string, the first token is t29, which is part of NT82 (as per NT82 \u2192 t29). So perhaps the top-level production used is S \u2192 NT82 NT22. Then, the part after t29 should be NT22 producing t36, t9, etc., but wait, no: S \u2192 NT82 NT22 would mean the string starts with NT82 (t29) followed by NT22. But looking at the second token in the input, it's t36. Now, NT22 can produce multiple things, like t5, t12, t23, etc. Let me check NT22 \u2192 t5 or t12, because t36 is a terminal, and from the grammar, NT36 \u2192 t36. So, perhaps after NT82 (t29), the next part is NT22, which should then have a production that can lead to t36 as a terminal. Looking at the production for NT22, we see NT22 \u2192 t23, which is different. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a more systematic approach.\n\nI think the better approach is to use the fact that each non-terminal is either a terminal or can be replaced by its productions. So, starting from the left, I can try to see which production generates the starting tokens, then proceed recursively.\n\nLet me start with the first token, t29. From the grammar, t29 can come from NT82 or NT35.\n\nLooking at the string: t29 t36 t9...\n\nCase 1: t29 comes from NT82. Then, NT82 \u2192 t29, and the remaining string after t29 is t36 t9...\n\nWait, no, it's actually that the entire string must be generated by S starting with the first production. So, if S uses the first rule NT82 NT22, then after t29, the next tokens should come from NT22. So, the second token is t36. Let's see what NT22 can produce. Looking at the productions for NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, NT22 \u2192 t23, NT22 \u2192 t12, NT22 \u2192 t5.\n\nWait, but t36 is a terminal, so NT22 must produce a terminal in this case. The only way is if NT22 has a production ending with t36, but looking at the production rules given, I don't see NT22 \u2192 t36. Instead, NT22's productions include t5, t12, t23, but not t36. So that's a problem. So, perhaps the production used is not NT82 NT22, because after NT82 (t29), the next non-terminal is NT22, which can't produce t36 as a terminal directly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is generated using the other top-level production S \u2192 NT40 NT77. So the string starts with t29 followed by t36, but that would require NT40 producing t29, which it doesn't. Because NT40's productions are: NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71, etc. None of these produce t29. So that approach might not work.\n\nHmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me check the productions again more carefully. Let me list all the NT productions:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t5, t12, t23, or NT71 NT48, NT68 NT97, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine the productions line by line:\n\n- S \u2192 NT82 NT22\n- S \u2192 NT40 NT77\n\nThen, NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48, or t23, or t12.\n\nNT15 \u2192 t15.\n\nWait, yes, so NT22 can produce t23 or t12. So, in the case where the string starts with t29 from NT82, the next token is t36, which is generated by NT36. So, if after NT82 (t29), the next part is NT36 (t36). Let me see: S \u2192 NT82 NT22, but wait, that would mean after NT82, it's NT22, not NT36. So the next token would have to come from NT22, but that doesn't produce t36. Hence, maybe S is using the other production, S \u2192 NT40 NT77.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT40 NT77, then the first token should come from NT40. Looking for which rule starts with NT40: Rules include NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0, NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71, etc. The only terminals here are 0,97,15,71. Our string starts with t29, not a terminal from NT40. So that contradicts, which suggests that the string might not start with S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Also, NT48 has other productions like \u2192NT36 NT3, \u2192NT3, \u2192t15, \u2192t21, \u2192t23.\n\nSo, NT48 can produce t15, t21, t23, or further NT productions.\n\nSimilarly, I need to see if the string contains t34.\n\nLooking at the string: t34 t5 t35 t38 t40 t35 t38 t40 t35 t38 t40 t33 t15 t38 t40 t21 t17 t5 t17 t5 t17 t17.\n\nSo, the first token is t34.

So to get t29, I need a non-terminal that produces t29. Let's look for that. I see that NT35 \u2192 t29. So for a production to give t29, that non-terminal must be NT35. And to get NT35, someone must produce NT35 from another production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see a production where NT35 is on the left side of the arrow. Wait, I think I might have misread. The production for NT35 is listed as:\n\nNT35 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking through the grammar provided:\n\nNT35 is not directly produced by any production listed. The productions end with NT58 \u2192 NT17 NT17.\n\nWait, let me check each production line:\n\nI think I might have missed where NT35 comes from. Wait, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\n- NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\n- NT12 \u2192 't31'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- NT15 \u2192 't49'\n- NT97 \u2192 't48'\n- NT98 \u2192 't5'\n- NT18 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT82 \u2192 't29'\n- NT71 \u2192 't36'\n- NT71 \u2192 't5' (Wait, duplicate? Or maybe it's a typo, maybe the second NT71 \u2192 t5 is correct.)\n- NT98 \u2192 't34'\n- NT22 \u2192 't12'\n- NT36 \u2192 't35'\n- NT48 \u2192 't15'\n- NT68 \u2192 't5'\n- NT35 \u2192 't29' (Wait, actually, looking again, NT35 is on the left side, but its production is: Does it lead to 't29'? Let me check the list again.)\n\nLooking through each NT, I see NT35 is on the left side? No, wait, in the given grammar, most of the NTs lead to other NTs or directly to strings. I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me list each production correctly.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- NT74 \u2192 NT58 NT98\n- NT72 \u2192 NT82 NT35\n- NT3 \u2192 NT91 NT94\n- NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT74\n- NT40 \u2192 NT97 NT0\n- NT94 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT40 \u2192 NT15 NT71\n- NT48 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68 NT97\n- NT94 \u2192 NT72 NT95\n- NT12 \u2192 't31'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- NT15 \u2192 't49'\n- NT97 \u2192 't48'\n- NT98 \u2192 't5'\n- NT18 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT82 \u2192 't29'\n- NT71 \u2192 't36'\n- NT71 \u2192 't5'\n- NT98 \u2192 't34'\n- NT22 \u2192 't12'\n- NT36 \u2192 't35'\n- NT48 \u2192 't15'\n- NT68 \u2192 't5'\n- NT35 \u2192 't29' (Wait, I think I saw that somewhere. So NT35 directly produces t29. So if a non-terminal can produce NT35, then that contributes to a 't29' in the string.)\n\nSo going back to the start symbol S, which has two main branches.\n\nFirst branch: S \u2192 NT82 NT22.\n\nLet's see how that translates.\n\nNT82 \u2192 t29\n\nNT22 \u2192 possibilities: 't23', 't12', 't5', 't97', etc., depending on which production it uses.\n\nIn our string, the next token after t29 is t5. So let's see: t29 is from NT82, then we have t5.\n\nSo after NT82, which is t29, what's NT22? We need the next token to be t5, so maybe NT22 produces t5.\n\nLooking at NT22's productions:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n\nNT71 can be 't36' or 't5'\n\nSo if NT71 is 't5', then NT48 could produce 't15' or other things.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, S \u2192 NT82 NT22, which gives us t29 followed by whatever NT22 produces.\n\nWe need the second token to be t5, so NT22 must produce 't5'. Let's see how that can happen.\n\nLooking at NT22's productions:\n\nNT22 can go to 't23' or 't12' or 't5' (from the given list: NT22 \u2192 't23', 't12', 't5').\n\nSo if NT22 \u2192 't5', then after t29, we get t5, which matches the string. That's good.\n\nSo so far, the first two tokens are t29 and t5. Now, the string continues from t5 onwards, so from t5, the next tokens depend on the productions of NT22.\n\nWait, no, the first term is S \u2192 NT82 NT22, which is t29 followed by NT22's expansion.\n\nSo the initial part is t29, t5, t33, etc.\n\nWait, let me break down the given string step by step:\n\nThe string is: t29 t5 t33 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t9 t15 t38 t40 t35 t38 t40 t31 t17 t34 t17 t17.\n\nSo the tokens are: t29, t5, t33, t15, t38, t40, t9, t15, t3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
