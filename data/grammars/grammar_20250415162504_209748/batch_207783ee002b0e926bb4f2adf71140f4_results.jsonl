{"custom_id":"request-2","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this task where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string 't8' to check if it's generated by the grammar. Let me try to figure out how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules provided, indeed, each production seems to be either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the string to check is 't8'. So I need to see if 't8' can be derived from S through some sequence of productions.\n\nLet's break it down. The string is just 't8', so it's a single terminal symbol. Looking at the given non-terminals, I should see if any non-terminal directly produces 't8'. Scanning through the production rules, I notice:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't47'\n- NT8 isn't present, so nothing directly gives 't8'.\n\nWait, but NT8 isn't even a non-terminal here. Let me check all the productions. Looking through NT0 to NT9, I don't see any rule where the left-hand side is a non-terminal and the right-hand side is just 't8'. So the direct productions don't include 't8' as a result of any non-terminal.\n\nBut perhaps I can look for a way to derive 't8' through more steps. Maybe some chain of productions leads up to it. Alternatively, maybe 't8' is a terminal that's never reachable through the given rules. Let me map it out.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first rule is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So to get 't8', I would need both NT0 and NT1 to produce something that can combine into 't8'. Let's see.\n\nNT0 can produce several things:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nSo if NT0 becomes NT9 and NT4, then let's see what NT9 and NT4 produce.\n\nLooking at NT9, it can produce several things:\n- If NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT4\nBut that seems recursive. Alternatively, NT9 can produce 't68', 't64', 't52', etc. Wait, looking through the rules more carefully:\n\nLooking at NT9:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- NT9 \u2192 't52'\n- etc.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions where NT9 is the left side:\n\nNT9 can produce:\n- NT1 NT5\n- NT0 NT4\n- 't68'\n- 't52'\n- 't36'\n- 't58'\n- 't44'\n- 't41'\n- 't36' (again)\n- 't47'\n- 't42'\n\nWait, no, maybe I miscounted. Let me list each rule where NT9 is on the left:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT0 NT1\nNT9 \u2192 NT0 NT4\nNT9 \u2192 't68'\nNT9 \u2192 't52'\nNT9 \u2192 't64' (appearing twice)\nNT9 \u2192 't41'\nNT9 \u2192 't58'\nNT9 \u2192 't50'\nWait, maybe I need to check each production line:\n\nThe productions starting with NT9:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- NT9 \u2192 't52'\n- NT9 \u2192 't64'\n- NT9 \u2192 't41'\n- NT9 \u2192 't58'\n- NT9 \u2192 't50'\nWait, but each line is separate. So, for example, line 3 is NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, etc. So specific line numbers:\n\nLooking again at the list:\n\nLines starting with NT9:\n\n1. NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT1 (line 3)\n2. NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT4 (line 6)\n3. NT9 \u2192 't68' (line 2)\n4. NT9 \u2192 't52' (line 9)\n5. NT9 \u2192 't64' (line 10)\n6. NT9 \u2192 't52' again? Or similar. Wait, the lines go from 1 to 34 or so.

NT5 can directly produce 't8'. That explains a lot.\n\nSo, now looking at the string 't8', it's a terminal symbol, so we need to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't8'.\n\nFrom the rules, NT5 \u2192 't8' is present. So if in the derivation, we can get to NT5 and then use that rule, we can get 't8'.\n\nBut let's think about how the start symbol S can lead to NT5. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, perhaps NT0 or NT1 can derive to NT5.\n\nWait, but S expands to NT0 and NT1. So to get 't8', we need both NT0 and NT1 to produce something that can lead to 't8'. Alternatively, maybe one of them can produce NT5, which then outputs 't8'.\n\nWait, no, 't8' is a single terminal. The grammar is such that each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step adds two symbols or a terminal. To get a single terminal, we need a path that builds up to it.\n\nWait, the string is 't8' which is just a single terminal. How can that happen? Because each production either appends two symbols or a terminal. So, maybe through some combination of productions where each non-terminal eventually ends up producing a terminal, and their concatenation forms 't8'.\n\nWait, but 't8' is a single symbol, so the only way it can be in the string is if exactly one non-terminal somewhere directly produces 't8', and all others in the rule string are either gone or produce empty. Wait, but in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, so the start symbol"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, any string generated by this grammar must be the concatenation of whatever NT0 generates and whatever NT1 generates.\n\nNow, looking at NT1. From the rules, NT1 seems to have two productions: it can become 't12' or 't42'. So, the string 't80' must have either 't12' or 't42' as part of it.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are left-linear and each production has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Looking at the grammar, it uses non-terminals like S, NT0, NT1, etc., and terminals like 't40', 't5', etc.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. All non-terminals must have productions that eventually lead to terminals through a series of steps. \n\nThe string we need to check is \"t40 t5\". Let me break it down into individual tokens: \"t40\", \"t5\". Each of these is a terminal symbol. So, the string has two terminals.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of a string of length n will take n-1 steps, where each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we have only terminals.\n\nStarting with S, which can only be derived as NT0 NT1 (since S \u2192 NT0 NT1). So the first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Now, we have two non-terminals, NT0 and NT1. Each needs to be expanded into terminals.\n\nLooking at NT1: in the grammar, NT1 can go to 't67' or 't46', 't80', etc. Wait, no, let me check the productions for NT1:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, under NT1, the productions are:\n- NT1 \u2192 't67'\n- NT1 \u2192 't46'\n- NT1 \u2192 't80'\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nThe productions listed under NT1 are:\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT1 -> 't67'\n- NT1 -> 't46'\n- NT1 -> 't80'\n\nSo, NT1 can be replaced by any of these four terminals directly. So NT1 can produce \"t12\", \"t67\", \"t46\", or \"t80\". \n\nNow, looking at NT0: the productions for NT0 are quite a lot. Let me list them to see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT1\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't36'\n- NT0 \u2192 't47'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't51'\n- NT0 \u2192 't71'\n- etc. (several others)\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. But our string starts with \"t40 t5\", but from the grammar, the NT0 and NT1 might produce certain tokens.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is \"t40\". Let me check if NT0 can produce \"t40\".\n\nLooking through NT0's productions, one is NT0 \u2192 't40' right? Let me check:\n\nIn the given grammar, under NT0, there is:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n\nYes, so NT0 can directly produce \"t40\".\n\nSimilarly, the second part of the string is \"t5\". So, NT1 must produce \"t5\". Let me check NT1's productions:\n\nThe possible terminals from NT1 are \"t12\", \"t67\", \"t46\", and \"t80\". Wait, I don't see \"t5\" in any of these. So is there a way for NT1 to produce \"t5\"?\n\nHmm, perhaps I missed something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, maybe I missed NT1 having a production that leads to another non-terminal that eventually becomes \"t5\". Let me re-examine the grammar's NT1 rules:\n\nFrom the given data, under NT1, we have:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT1 -> 't67'\nNT1 -> 't46'\nNT1 -> 't80'\n\nI don't see any further productions for NT1, so perhaps NT1 can only produce terminals, and none of them are \"t5\". So if the string requires \"t5\" as the second part, but NT1 can't produce it, then perhaps the string isn't derivable.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way to get \"t5\" from another non-terminal. Let me check NT5, perhaps, since it's in the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT5, the productions are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT5 \u2192 't74'\n- NT5 \u2192 't71'\n- NT5 \u2192 't8'\n- NT5 \u2192 't17'\n- NT5 \u2192 't55'\n- etc. (multiple productions)\n\nWait, no: let's list all under NT5:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT5 \u2192 't17'\n- NT5 \u2192 't71'\n- NT5 \u2192 't8'\n- NT5 \u2192 't74'\n- NT5 \u2192 't84'\n- NT5 \u2192 't54'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0' (probably 't0' instead of 0? Or is it 't0' as a symbol)\n- NT5 \u2192 't82'\n- NT5 \u2192 't44'\n- NT5 \u2192 't58'\n\nSo from NT5, it can produce several terminals. Let me see if \"t5\" is among these. Scanning through, I don't see \"t5\" there. So NT5 can't produce \"t5\".\n\nWhat about NT9? Let's check NT9's productions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68? Wait, but in the grammar it's written as \"t68\", right? So it's a terminal 't68'.\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT64\n- NT9 \u2192 't64'\n- NT9 \u2192 't47'\n- etc.\n\nWait, let me list all NT9 productions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 (but perhaps it's 't68')\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT64\n- NT9 \u2192 't64'\n- NT9 \u2192 't47'\n- NT9 \u2192 't52'\n- NT9 \u2192 't69'\n- NT9 \u2192 't73'\n- NT9 \u2192 't24'\n- NT9 \u2192 't43'\n- NT9 \u2192 't67'\n- NT9 \u2192 't58'\n- etc. Hmm, but none of these seem to include \"t5\".\n\nWait, perhaps a deeper analysis. Maybe \"t5\" isn't directly a terminal in any non-terminal's productions, so the string \"t40 t5\" can't be generated.\n\nWait, another angle: The string has two tokens, so in the grammar, the derivation from S would generate two non-terminals, each expanded into the required terminals.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Then, NT0 must produce \"t40\", and NT1 must produce \"t5\". \n\nBut as I saw, NT1 can't produce \"t5\". So perhaps no. Alternatively, maybe there's a path through other non-terminals that I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that some non-terminals can derive into more non-terminals, which then derive into the required terminal. Let's think: For the first part, NT0 can produce \"t40\" directly, so that's fine. But for the second part, NT1 needs to produce \"t5\", which it can't, as per the given productions.\n\nWait, unless I'm miscalculating the productions for NT5. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through NT5's productions: \n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT5 \u2192 't74'\n- NT5 \u2192 't71'\n- NT5 \u2192 't8'\n- etc. No 't5' there.\n\nSo, seems like NT1 can't produce \"t5\". Therefore, the string \"t40 t5\" can't be produced by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm mistaken. Is there any way to get \"t5\" through another path? Maybe via NT5, but as per the productions, NT5 doesn't produce \"t5\". Alternatively, maybe through another non-terminal.\n\nWait, what about S \u2192 NT0 NT1, NT0 \u2192 \"t40\", NT1 needs to produce \"t5\". Maybe NT1 can be \"t5\" via another path?

This form is useful for parsing and for proving certain properties about the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that all production rules seem to fit the CNF structure. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT1 is a production where S is replaced by the combination of two non-terminals. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5 is another two-nonterminal production, and some rules directly replace a non-terminal with a single terminal like NT9 \u2192 't68' or NT0 \u2192 't10'. So, this confirms that the grammar is indeed in Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is \"t0 t12\". That's two terminals with a space. Let me parse that as \"t0 t12\", meaning two separate tokens: the first is 't0' and the second is 't12'. Wait, but how does that relate to the grammar?\n\nThe starting symbol is S, so the derivation must start from S. Let's see what S produces. S -> NT0 NT1, which is a pair of non-terminals. So, in order to derive the string, we need NT0 to produce 't0' and NT1 to produce 't12'. Alternatively, perhaps NT0 and NT1 can produce these through some combination of steps.\n\nLet me check what NT0 can produce. From the rules, NT0 has several options: NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, NT5 NT4, etc. Let me list out all NT0 productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (Wait, is this a typo? Looking again, wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking back, the grammar provided lists several rules for NT0. Let me list them all properly.\n\nWait, the grammar provided is a bit cluttered, so perhaps I should list all the rules for each non-terminal.\n\nLooking again, the grammar is as follows:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\nNT9 \u2192 't68'\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\nNT1 \u2192 't12'\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\nNT3 \u2192 't47'\nNT4 \u2192 't47'\nNT5 \u2192 't11'\nNT0 \u2192 't64'\nNT1 \u2192 't51'\nNT9 \u2192 't64'\nNT0 \u2192 't4'\nNT9 \u2192 't69'\nNT0 \u2192 't73'\nNT0 \u2192 't24'\nNT3 \u2192 't43'\nNT1 \u2192 't67'\nNT5 \u2192 't74'\nNT9 \u2192 't52'\nNT5 \u2192 't71'\nNT5 \u2192 't8'\nNT0 \u2192 't71'\nNT3 \u2192 't4'\nNT4 \u2192 't54'\nNT3 \u2192 't71'\nNT1 \u2192 't46'\nNT1 \u2192 't80'\nNT3 \u2192 't51'\nNT9 \u2192 't36'\nNT9 \u2192 't58'\nNT5 \u2192 't84'\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT9 \u2192 't66'\nNT4 \u2192 't82'\nNT3 \u2192 't42'\nNT0 \u2192 't79'\nNT9 \u2192 't78'\nNT0 \u2192 't36'\nNT0 \u2192 't47'\nNT5 \u2192 't17'\nNT4 \u2192 't55'\nNT9 \u2192 't63'\nNT4 \u2192 't13'\nNT5 \u2192 't50'\nNT5 \u2192 't76'\nNT9 \u2192 't44'\nNT4 \u2192 't58'\nNT9 \u2192 't41'\nNT3 \u2192 't50'\nNT1 \u2192 't73'\nNT3 \u2192 't40'\nNT5 \u2192 't80'\nNT0 \u2192 't5'\nNT1 \u2192 't42'\n\nWow, that's a lot. Let me parse this carefully. So, NT0 can produce various combinations of non-terminals. For example, NT0 can be NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, etc. Each of these further breaks down into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, we need to figure out if the string \"t0 t12\" can be a result of a leftmost derivation starting from S.\n\nWait, let me break down the string. It's two tokens, so in the derivation, the S must split into NT0 and NT1, each expanding to t0 and t12, respectively.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, then NT0 must expand to 't0' and NT1 must expand to 't12'. Let's check the rules for NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at NT0: Do any of its productions directly give 't0'? Let's see. scrolling through the NT0 productions, I see 't10', 't64', 't4', 't24', 't71', etc. Wait, I don't see 't0' as a terminal directly from NT0. Then, perhaps NT0 must produce a chain of non-terminals that eventually results in 't0'.\n\nChecking the NT0 rules again, for example: NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4 \u2192 then perhaps NT5 could produce 't0'. Looking at NT5 rules: NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1. Wait, so NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4, and NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1, but that would mean NT5 is two NT1s. Hmm, but NT5 can also produce 't11' or 't71' or 't8'? Wait, looking at NT5's rules:\n\nWait, the grammar has NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1, as well as other rules like NT5 \u2192 't11', NT5 \u2192 't71', and so on. Wait, but that can't be right because in CNF, each production must have exactly one terminal or two non-terminals. So, in the given grammar, NT5 only has one rule for each combination. Wait, no, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, actually, let me list all the NT5 rules properly. From the given grammar, the rules for NT5 include:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n\nAlso, in the list above, NT5 has multiple rules, such as:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't17', 't71', 't8', 't11', 't74', 't44', 't58', etc.\n\nWait, so for NT5, possible expansions include single terminals like 't17', 't74', 't44', etc., or two non-terminals like 't11' (if it's written as NT5 \u2192 't11') or 't71', etc. Wait, no, wait: the grammar as given, each production is a substitution. So for example, looking for NT5 \u2192 't17' is incorrect because 't17' is a single terminal, making NT5 \u2192 't17' a valid production only if the grammar allows terminals in the productions. Wait, but in CNF, productions are either non-terminals or terminals, not a mix. So NT5 can either produce a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT5 has multiple production rules, some of which produce single terminals, like NT5 \u2192 't17', NT5 \u2192 't71', 't8', 't11', etc. Wait, wait: that would mean NT5 can have productions that are single terminals, which is acceptable in CNF, because in CNF, the right-hand side can be a single terminal as well as a pair of non-terminals.\n\nSo, for NT0, let's see: The production is NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4. So, when expanding NT0, it produces NT5 and NT4. Now, for NT5, let's see what possibilities it can have.\n\nNT5 can produce 't17', 't71', etc., as single terminals, or through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but if NT5 can produce 't0', then that would be great. But looking through the rules, I don't see 't0' as a terminal for NT5. So perhaps NT5 must expand further into non-terminals until a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, but looking more carefully, I see that NT4 \u2192 't0' is a production. So NT4 can produce 't0' directly.\n\nSo, if the string is 't0 t12', perhaps NT0 needs to produce 't0' and NT1 needs to produce 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-44","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure should help because each production step replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see S is the start symbol. The productions from S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\nS \u2192 NT9 NT4\nWait, no, actually the first line says S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Or is there more? Wait, the user probably wrote only one production. Let me double-check: The first line is \"S -> NT0 NT1\", then the next line is \"NT9 -> NT1 NT5\", followed by others. So S only has one production: S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nSo the start symbol S can only be replaced by NT0 and NT1. Each of these NT symbols can be non-terminals or terminals, depending on their productions.\n\nNow the string to evaluate is `t5 t73 t10`. Let's split this into tokens: [\"t5\", \"t73\", \"t10\"]. So the string consists of three tokens.\n\nGiven that each production in the grammar either produces two symbols or a terminal, I need to find a way to derive this string using the grammar.\n\nLet me try to look at the possible ways each token can be generated.\n\nStarting with the first token, \"t5\". Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see NT0, NT1, etc., directly producing \"t5\". Let's check each rule:\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n- NT5: It has productions like NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1 and NT5 \u2192 t74 (from \"NT5 -> 't74'\"). So \"t74\" can be produced by NT5.\n\n- NT0: It has several productions. For example, NT0 \u2192 't10' (from \"NT0 -> 't10'\"), which is our \"t10\" token. So NT0 can directly produce \"t10\".\n\n- NT9: Has productions like NT9 \u2192 't68', 't64', etc. So it can't produce t5.\n\n- NT3: Has \"t2\", \"t47\", \"t73\", etc. So NT3 can produce \"t73\".\n\n- NT1: Has \"t12\", \"t51\", etc. So it can't directly produce t5.\n\nSo \"t5\" must come from a non-terminal NT that has a production rule resulting in \"t5\". Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing \"t5\". Maybe through some derivations.\n\nSo that's a problem because \"t5\" isn't directly produced by any rule. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nLooking for where \"t5\" is mentioned:\n\nLooking through all the productions, under NT9 we have \"t64\", \"t68\", etc., but nothing that produces \"t5\". NT0 produces \"t10\", \"t4\", etc., but not \"t5\".\n\nWait, maybe NT5 can produce \"t5\"? Looking through the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 \"t47\", \"t54\", \"t58\", \"t80\", etc. NT5's productions include \"t71\", \"t17\", \"t55\", \"t74\", \"t50\", but not \"t5\".\n\nSo there's no non-terminal that can directly produce \"t5\". This is a problem because the string starts with \"t5\".\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for some intermediate steps or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a production that can generate t5.\n\nLooking again through all the rules:\n\n- NT4: NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT5, but \"t47\" comes from NT3 \u2192 \"t47\". Wait, no, looking back, NT4 has \"t47\" as a terminal. Also, NT4 \u2192 \"t54\", \"t58\", \"t80\", etc.\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't68'\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\nNT1 \u2192 't12'\nNT3 \u2192 't2', 't47'\nNT5 \u2192 't11', 't51', 't74', 't5', 't55', 't50', 't71', 't84', 't0', 't73', 't42', 't82', 't36', 't58', 't84', 't4', 't17', 't46', 't80', 't4', 't82', 't42', 't58', 't47', 't50', 't80', 't13', 't55', 't98', 't44', 't5', 't66', 't13', 't51', 't98', 't83', 't54', 't74', etc.\n\nWait, I think I missed a terminal for NT5. Looking at the list:\n\nYes, indeed, I see NT5 has a production \"t5\" as per \"NT5 -> 't5'\". So NT5 can generate \"t5\".\n\nAh, that's the key. So \"t5\" can be produced by NT5. Great, so the first token is possible.\n\nNow, the string is \"t5 t73 t10\". So we have three tokens: \"t5\", \"t73\", \"t10\".\n\nWe need to see how each of these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's plan the steps:\n\n1. The start symbol is S, which must produce two non-terminals: NT0 and NT1.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nSo we can model the derivation as:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1 \u2192 (NT0 A) (B NT1) etc., but perhaps a better approach is to think of each of the tokens in the string and see how they can be generated from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the entire string as a sequence of three terminals, so the derivation would require that each terminal is derived in sequence.\n\nBut S starts as NT0 and NT1. So perhaps the NT0 can produce the first terminal, NT1 the second, and then the third token must be generated from somewhere else? Wait, that doesn't quite fit.\n\nWait, no. Let's think of the entire string as three tokens: T1, T2, T3. So they have to be generated in some way from the grammar.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So perhaps NT0 can produce T1 and T2, and NT1 can produce T3?\n\nOr perhaps the NT0 can produce T1 and T3, and NT1 can produce T2? Or some combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is derived via right- or left-derivations. Let me think.\n\nEach step in the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (which can themselves be non-terminals or terminals).\n\nSo perhaps we can look for a leftmost derivation.\n\nBut with the string having three tokens, I need a way to generate three terminals.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the derivation would have to happen in a way that the non-terminals NT0 and NT1 expand into parts of the string.\n\nOne approach is to see if there's a way that NT0 and NT1 can each produce parts of the string.\n\nBut the string is three tokens, so perhaps the initial NT0 expands into two tokens, and the NT1 expands into one token, making three in total? But wait, each production is two symbols, so each non-terminal can expand into two symbols. But the string is three tokens, which is odd.\n\nWait, the number of terminals in a derivation can be constructed as follows: For each non-terminal, each production contributes two symbols. Starting from S, the first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which is two non-terminals. Then, each non-terminal can be expanded into either two non-terminals or a terminal. The total number of terminals can vary.\n\nBut to get three terminals, perhaps two of the non-terminals in the expansion produce two terminals, and the third one? No, because each expansion from a non-terminal can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, perhaps the derivation could look like this:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nThen, NT0 \u2192 T1 T2 (where T1 and T2 are terminals, so \"t5\" and \"t73\")\n\nNT1 \u2192 T3 (terminal, \"t10\")\n\nSo that would give us \"t5 t73 t10\".\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet me check if NT0 can produce \"t5\" and \"t73\", and NT1 can produce \"t10\".\n\nLooking at NT0:\n\nFrom the production rules, NT0 can be derived via NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two symbols (could be terminals or non-terminals) on the right. The grammar starts with S, and from there, I need to see how each part of the string can be derived.\n\nLet's look at the string: t69 t80 t84. Since it's a sequence of terminals, each part must correspond to a terminal symbol. I'll start from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is t69. Looking at the rules, NT0 can produce t69, along with other options. Similarly, NT9 can produce t69 as well. So, the first step is to choose either NT0 or NT9 to produce t69.\n\nSuppose I choose NT0. Then, according to the grammar, NT0 can be decomposed into two parts. Looking back, NT0 has several production rules. One of them is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4. Wait, but t69 is from NT0, so maybe I need to look for how NT0 can be split.\n\nWait, no.

So, the first part t69 can come from NT9 or NT0.\n\nSimilarly, the second symbol is t80, which can be produced by NT5 (since NT5 \u2192 't80'), and the third symbol t84 can be produced by NT5 as well (since NT5 \u2192 't84').\n\nSo, the last two symbols in the string are both derived from NT5.

That seems impossible under CNF, because each non-terminal generates exactly two symbols, so two non-terminals would produce four symbols when expanded. Unless one of them is expanded into a terminal plus another non-terminal, but wait, CNF requires each production to have exactly two symbols, so perhaps the initial expansion would have four symbols unless one of the non-terminals is a terminal.\n\nWait, in our case, the initial S expansion is NT0 and NT1. So, the string we get is the combination of NT0's expansion and NT1's expansion. So, each of them could produce a certain number of symbols.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and then each of those non-terminals could be expanded into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nSo, our string has three symbols: [t69, t80, t84].

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string should derive from S using these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So, the string generated must reduce to NT0 NT1. Let me check the string: it's four tokens, t76, t69, t63, t17. Wait, that's four tokens. Since the initial rule gives two non-terminals, each of which will eventually produce some number of terminals, we'll have to see how each of these non-terminals expands.\n\nLet's list the non-terminals and see where they point:\n\n- NT0 has several productions, including NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, NT0 \u2192 't10', etc. It seems NT0 can go to various other non-terminals, including 't5' and others. But importantly, some of these produce terminals, like NT0 \u2192 't5'.\n\n- NT1 has several productions, with examples like NT1 \u2192 't12', NT1 \u2192 't51', etc. But notably, NT1 can produce 't67'.\n\nWait, in the string, we have t76. So looking at the productions, where does t76 come from? Let me check all the rules for t.\n\nLooking through the rules, it seems that some non-terminals can produce 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT5 can produce 't74', NT9 can produce 't64' and 't52'. Wait, let me list each production that ends with a 't':\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT5 \u2192 't54'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT9 \u2192 't69'\n- NT0 \u2192 't73'\n- NT0 \u2192 't24'\n- NT3 \u2192 't43'\n- NT1 \u2192 't67'\n- NT5 \u2192 't74'\n- NT9 \u2192 't52'\n- NT0 \u2192 't71'\n- NT3 \u2192 't4'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n- NT3 \u2192 't71'\n- NT1 \u2192 't80'\n- NT3 \u2192 't51'\n- NT9 \u2192 't36'\n- NT9 \u2192 't58'\n- NT5 \u2192 't84'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT9 \u2192 't66'\n- NT4 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't42'\n- NT0 \u2192 't79'\n- NT9 \u2192 't78'\n- NT0 \u2192 't36'\n- NT0 \u2192 't47'\n- NT5 \u2192 't17'\n- NT4 \u2192 't55'\n- NT9 \u2192 't63'\n- NT4 \u2192 't13'\n- NT5 \u2192 't50'\n- NT5 \u2192 't76'\n- NT9 \u2192 't44'\n- NT4 \u2192 't58'\n- NT9 \u2192 't41'\n- NT3 \u2192 't50'\n- NT1 \u2192 't73'\n- NT3 \u2192 't40'\n- NT5 \u2192 't80'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT1 \u2192 't42'\n\nLooking for where a non-terminal directly produces 't76', it seems that NT5 \u2192 't76' is one such rule. So, in the string, one of the tokens must come from NT5. Similarly, let's check the other tokens.\n\nLooking at the string: t76, t69, t63, t17.\n\nt76 is produced by NT5 \u2192 't76', so one part is covered.\n\nt69: Looking for rules that produce 't69'. From the list, NT0 \u2192 't69' and NT5 \u2192 't64' is not. Wait, I see NT0 has a production NT0 \u2192 't69'. So that could be either NT0 or another NT. But in the string, the next token after t76 is t69, so perhaps that is from NT0.\n\nt63: Looking for rules that produce 't63'. In the given grammar, NT5 \u2192 't63' is one. So perhaps that's NT5.\n\nt17: That seems to come from NT5 \u2192 't17'. So we have two NT5s producing 't17' and other tokens.\n\nWait, let me map this out.\n\nThe string is t76 t69 t63 t17.\n\nThis would have to be the result of S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So, to get four terminals, each of NT0 and NT1 must derive to two terminals each. Let's assign:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t76 t69\n\nNT1 \u2192 t63 t17\n\nWait, but that's four. Alternatively, perhaps both NT0 and NT1 each produce two terminals, but maybe in different combinations.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that:\n\nNT0 produces t76 and t69, and NT1 produces t63 and t17?\n\nBut wait, each non-terminal in the grammar can only produce a single terminal at a time, right? No, because each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So when doing a parse, each production in a step takes one non-terminal and replaces it with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, if NT0 is expanded, it could go through a series of steps, each time splitting into more symbols until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, but the string given is four terminals, so I think that each of NT0 and NT1 must each produce two terminals. Let me check:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT0 NT1, then NT0 must derive to two terminals (t76 and t69) and NT1 must derive to two terminals (t63 and t17). So, that would give four in total.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, NT0 \u2192 't76' followed by something? Or does it have to produce t76 and something else.\n\nWait, no. Each non-terminal must derive a sequence of terminals. So, for instance, if NT0 \u2192 't76', then it would stop there, giving one terminal, but in our case, we need it to produce two. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, I'm maybe misunderstanding. When a non-terminal is expanded, it's replaced by its productions. So, for example, if NT0 is in the string and it has a production NT0 \u2192 NT5, then in the parse tree, we can go further down until we get a production that ends with a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps I should model the entire derivation step by step.\n\nLet me attempt to break down each token:\n\n1. t76: It must come from an NT that has a production ending with t76. Looking through, NT5 \u2192 't76' is direct, so one possibility is that this comes from NT5.\n\n2. t69: Looking at the productions, NT0 \u2192 't69' is a direct production, so this could come from NT0.\n\n3. t63: Looking at NT9 \u2192 't63'? Wait, in the list earlier, I think NT5 \u2192 't63' is the correct one. So, that could come from NT5.\n\n4. t17: NT5 \u2192 't17' is a direct production, so that would also come from NT5.\n\nSo, putting it together, if we have NT0 \u2192 't69' and then NT1 \u2192 't63 t17', but that doesn't fit because each NT can only produce one terminal directly. Wait, actually, no, each non-terminal must expand into a string of symbols. So for example, if NT0 is replaced by a production that goes through multiple steps, each step potentially adding more non-terminals until we get to terminals.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to try to construct a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each of the four tokens in the string must be generated by some combination of the non-terminals. Let's consider that S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and that each NT0 and NT1 must produce two terminals each, but that's not the case because NT0 \u2192 't76' is a single terminal, which would only give one token unless it's part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let's look at the possible steps.\n\nThe string is t76 t69 t63 t17. So, four tokens.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has only two non-terminals on the left side or a single terminal. That should make things a bit easier because CNF has nice properties for parsing, but I'm just evaluating one string here, so maybe I can do it manually.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the grammar looks like. The start symbol is S, and S produces NT0 NT1. So, the first step is that S must split into two parts: NT0 (from the first production) and NT1 (from the second).\n\nNT1 has only one production, which is 't12'. So, that part is straightforward\u2014it must produce t12. So, the string starts with t12, and the rest comes from NT0.\n\nNow, looking at NT0, it has multiple productions.

So, the first part is t80, which is the second part of NT1?\n\nWait no, S produces NT0 NT1, and NT1 produces 't12'. So the first part of the string is t12, which should come from NT1. Then the other part comes from NT0, which must produce 't80 t63'. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. The whole string is t80 t63 t12 t52, which is four terminals. So the NT0 part must produce t80 t63, and the NT1 part produces t12 t52?\n\nWait no, because NT1 only produces 't12' in its only production. Looking back: NT1 can only go to 't12' because NT1 -> 't12' is its only production. So in the S production, NT1 is 't12' in the string. But in the string we have 't12' and another 't52'. Wait, that's two parts. So the S production is NT0 NT1, so the entire string must be (from NT0) followed by (NT1's productions). So S must expand into two parts: NT0's expansion is some string, and NT1's expansion is 't12'.\n\nBut the given string has four tokens: t80 t63 t12 t52. That can't be because NT1 only produces 't12' as a single token. So unless the NT1 part can produce a longer string, which it can't. Then that would imply that the entire string should be NT0's expansion followed by 't12', but the given string is longer, which suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the grammar structure.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's double-check the grammar. S -> NT0 NT1, and each of NT0 and NT1 is a single non-terminal. Then NT1 has only the production of 't12', so NT1 must directly produce 't12'. So the string generated by S would be (expansion of NT0) followed by t12. Therefore, the input string must be of the form (NT0 string) t12. So the given string is four tokens: t80 t63 t12 t52. So the t12 is the last token. Wait, but that can't be because then the NT1 only produces t12, and the entire string should be t12 plus (NT0's expansion). But the given string starts with t80 t63 t12 t52, which is four tokens. Unless there is a way to have a longer string from NT1, but from the grammar, it's fixed: NT1 only produces 't12'.\n\nTherefore, perhaps this string is not possible. Unless I made a mistake in looking at the grammar.\n\nWait, the given grammar has these productions:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNo, that's the only one. So NT1 can only generate t12 as a single token. So the string should have exactly one instance of t12. Therefore, the input string has a t52 as well, which means that after the t12, there's an additional t52, which would require that the NT1 production somehow produces more symbols. But that's not the case.\n\nWait, but maybe the string has another part. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nThe string is `t80 t63 t12 t52`. So if S is producing NT0 and NT1, the entire expansion would be the concatenation of NT0's expansion and 't12'. So the initial part is NT0's expansion, and then comes 't12'. Therefore, the string must be of the form <NT0 expansion> t12. Since the given string is four tokens, the first three tokens must form the expansion from NT0, and the last token must be 't12', but in the string, the fourth token is 't52', not 't12'.

{"custom_id":"request-83","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t17 t0 t46 t71 t4`, and the grammar is a bit complex with a bunch of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left-hand side, and the right-hand side can be either one terminal or two non-terminals. This structure is useful for parsing algorithms, so maybe that's a clue on how to approach this.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with the start symbol S which produces NT0 NT1. So the string must start with symbols derived from NT0 and NT1. The given string starts with `t17`, which I assume is a terminal symbol. Now, I need to figure out how these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me break down each part step by step. Starting with the string `t17 t0 t46 t71 t4`. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, I can consider that each of these components comes from NT0 and NT1. So, for the string to be valid, both parts derived from NT0 and NT1 should match the sequence of their respective symbols.\n\nLooking at NT0, I'll explore all its production rules to see how it can yield the symbols `t17`, `t0`, `t46`, `t71`, and `t4`. Similarly, NT1 will be analyzed for the symbols `t0`, `t46`, `t71`, and `t4`.\n\nWait, but the string is five terminals long, which is odd. In CNF, each production either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals. So a string of length n will require n-1 productions, each adding one terminal. Since S is at the root level, starting at S \u2192 NT0 NT1, each non-terminal must produce its own sequence of terminals.\n\nSo the entire string is four symbols if S directly produces to terminals, but here it's five, which could mean each of NT0 and NT1 expand into two or more symbols. So the breakdown is: NT0 produces a sequence that contributes `t17` followed by other symbols, and NT1 contributes the rest.\n\nLet me look at NT0. It has several productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (again)\n- NT0 \u2192 't64' (terminal)\n- NT0 \u2192 't4' (terminal)\n- ... (many more productions)\n\nI need to find if NT0 can produce a sequence that starts with t17. Looking at the productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't17' \u2014 yes, there's a direct production.\n\nSo assuming that NT0 \u2192 t17, that's the first part. Then the next symbol is t0, which comes from NT1. Let's look at NT1:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT1 \u2192 't12' (a terminal)\n- NT1 \u2192 't46' (another terminal)\n- NT1 \u2192 't67'\n- \u2026 (multiple productions)\n\nSo for NT1 to produce 't0', but wait, in the given string, the second symbol is t0. Wait, that can't be right. Because according to the initial decomposition, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the first symbol comes from NT0, and the second from NT1.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is t17, which we've covered with NT0. The second symbol is t0. So we need to see if NT1 can produce t0.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions, none of the terminals are 't0' directly. Let me check.\n\nThe productions for NT1 are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT1 \u2192 't46'\n- NT1 \u2192 't67'\n- NT1 \u2192 't80'\n- NT1 \u2192 't4'\n- ... (others that might produce terminals but not 't0')\n\nWait, does NT1 have a production that directly results in 't0'? From the given rules, I don't see 't0' being a terminal for NT1. The closest is 't12', 't46', 't4', etc. So that's a problem. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nNT1 -> 't12' | 't46' | 't67' | 't80' | 't4' | ... There's nothing for 't0' under NT1.\n\nSo if the string starts with `t17 t0`, the second symbol t0 can't come from NT1 because there's no production rule from NT1 that directly yields 't0'. That's a red flag. But wait, perhaps t0 is coming from an intermediate production that eventually reduces to 't0'. But looking at NT1, all its productions either go to non-terminals or to specific terminals. There's no path from NT1 to 't0' except through NT1 itself, which doesn't directly produce 't0' and all its other terminal options are different.\n\nLet me verify the NT1 rules again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The grammar includes:\n\nNT1 -> 't12' | 't46' | 't67' | 't80' | 't4' | ... (and others that might be non-terminals or other terminals but no 't0'). So no, NT1 doesn't produce 't0' directly or indirectly. That suggests that the string `t17 t0 ...` can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, let's consider that maybe I'm miscounting the string length or the way the non-terminals expand. The string is `t17 t0 t46 t71 t4`, which is five terminals. So the decompositions should be:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT0 \u2192 t17 (and maybe more symbols)\nNT1 \u2192 t0 (and others)\n\nWait, no. If S \u2192 NT0 NT1, then NT0's production must account for the first symbol t17, and NT1 must account for t0. But as per the grammar, NT1 doesn't have a production to 't0' or any terminal that is possible after expansion. So if the second symbol is t0, it's not possible because NT1 can't generate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm looking at the NT terms. Maybe the string is being parsed in a way where the non-terminals from S lead into t17 and then the remaining parts come from NT1 expanded multiple times, but that would require the second symbol to be derived from NT1's expansion. But as we saw, that doesn't generate t0.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe S produces NT0 NT1, which then each produce sequences that together form the string. So if the string is t17 t0 t46 t71 t4, then:\n\n- NT0 must derive t17 followed by some sequence, and NT1 must derive t0, followed by a sequence, but how?\n\nBut in the grammar, NT0 has a direct production to 't17' which is the first symbol, so that works. Then, NT1 needs to derive 't0' followed by whatever the next symbols are. But NT1 doesn't have a production that includes 't0', so that seems impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't0' is part of a longer sequence derived from a non-terminal that can produce 't0'. Let me check NT0's other productions.\n\nAfter the direct 't17' production, NT0 has several rules like NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, which could lead to other terminals. For example, NT9 can produce 't68' and 't4', etc. But how does that help with 't0'? Maybe I'm confusing something.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second symbol is t0, which must come from NT1's production. But there's no rule for NT1 to produce t0. So unless t0 is a result of a production that doesn't directly produce it, but given the grammar, that doesn't seem possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is incorrectly passed, or perhaps I've mis parsed the grammar. Let me check NT0 again: it has 't17' as a direct production, so in NT0, the first symbol is t17, and the remaining symbols in the string must come from the expansion of NT1.\n\nLooking after t17, the next symbol is t0, so that's the first symbol of NT1's expansion. But NT1 doesn't have a terminal t0, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the NT1 rules. Let me check again:\n\nNT1's productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't12' \n- NT1 \u2192 't46' \n- NT1 \u2192 't67' \n- NT1 \u2192 't80' \n- NT1 \u2192 't4' \n... and some others?\n\nNo, no 't0' seems in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-81","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm still a bit new to this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. From what I remember, a context-free grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. So, all production rules must have either two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see several production rules. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. That fits the first part of CNF because it's two non-terminals. Then, NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, which is two non-terminals again. Okay, so far so good.\n\nBut wait, there's a part that might be concerning: NT0 \u2192 't10'. Here, a production rule has a single terminal symbol on the right side. I think this is still allowed because in CNF, any production can have a single terminal as the RHS. So, as long as all other productions meet the conditions, it's okay. Let me check another one: NT5 \u2192 't11'. That's also a single terminal, which is fine. Hmm, seems okay.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is `t55 t46 t43 t58 t76`. I need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nOne approach is to work backwards: start from the start symbol and try to expand until I reach the string. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string using the grammar rules. Let me try the parsing approach.\n\nThe string has five tokens: t55, t46, t43, t58, t76. So, it's a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal, and each step replaces one non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces the number of symbols by one. So, starting from the start symbol S, which produces NT0 NT1, that's two non-terminals. Then, each NT0 and NT1 would need to be expanded. Each expansion could produce either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, another thing to note is that in CNF, the left-hand side of each production is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side can be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nBut in the given grammar, every production seems to fit that structure. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT1 is a production of the form A \u2192 BC. NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5 is also A \u2192 BC. NT0 \u2192 't10' is A \u2192 a, and the same for others. So yes, this is a CNF grammar.\n\nNow, the string has five terminals. Each step in the derivation reduces the count by 1 when replacing a non-terminal with terminals. The length of the string is 5, so the derivation must have taken how many steps? Starting from S (which is one symbol), each expansion can replace one non-terminal with two or a terminal. But since it's a derivation from S to the string, the number of steps would be such that the string length is equal to the number of rules applied plus one.\n\nWait, actually, the number of symbols increases by one each time a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals. If a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, the count doesn't change.\n\nBut perhaps it's getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach is better: see if each token in the string can be generated by the grammar, considering the possible leftmost derivations.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite short, maybe I can try to see if there's a way to produce each token step by step.\n\nLet me list the tokens: t55, t46, t43, t58, t76.\n\nFirst, the string is `t55 t46 t43 t58 t76`. In a context-free grammar, the string is a sequence of productions, so in a leftmost derivation, we'd have S \u2192 NT0 NT1 \u2192 ... and so on, building up the string step by step.\n\nBut since the string length is 5, which is odd, maybe it's a bit difficult because the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, so any string derived from it would have an even number of symbols unless some symbols are replaced by terminals.\n\nWait a minute, hold on: the start symbol S is non-terminal, and it produces NT0 and NT1. So, the first step replaces S with NT0 NT1, making the leftmost part of the string. Then, depending on how each NT is expanded, the string will be built.\n\nBut each NT production either expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for each NT (like NT0, NT1, etc.), if we choose to expand it into terminals, it would contribute some single token(s) to the string. But if we expand into two non-terminals, more rules would have to be applied.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see if the given string can be generated without looking into the entire derivation tree. Let's map each token to possible NT's.\n\nSo, the string is t55, t46, t43, t58, t76.\n\nEach of these must come from a production of an NT.\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce each of these tokens:\n\nt55: Let's look at which NTs can produce 't55'. From the given grammar, I'll check the rules where the RHS is 't55' or if any NT can derive it.\n\nLooking at NTs, the only one that might be directly producing a terminal is NT5 \u2192 't11', NT4 \u2192 't54', etc. Wait, I need to look at the rules for each NT.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't64', etc. (Multiple options)\n- NT1 \u2192 't12', 't80', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't68', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't2', etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 't47', 't54', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't11', 't17', 't55', 't58', 't71', etc.\nWait, actually, I should check each production for NTs to see if they can produce 't55'.\n\nLooking back, in the given grammar, NT5 can produce 't55' because I see a rule: NT5 \u2192 't55' (from the list provided). So, NT5 \u2192 't55' is a production.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the other tokens:\n\nt46: Looking for which NT can produce this. Scanning the productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't46' as per the given rules: NT1 \u2192 't46'.\n- NT5 \u2192 't58', etc. Wait, but in the given rules, NT1 has a production NT1 \u2192 't46', so that's an option.\n\nNext, t43: Looking for NT that can produce 't43'. Scanning the rules, I see NT1 \u2192 't43' is one of the options. So, NT1 \u2192 't43'.\n\nt58: Looking for NT that can produce 't58'. In the given grammar, NT5 \u2192 't58' and NT5 \u2192 't74' (twice?), wait, checking the exact rules: Let me list all NT5's rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't84'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT5 \u2192 't17'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n- NT9 \u2192 't58'\n\nSo, NT9 \u2192 't58' is also a production. Alternatively, NT5 can produce 't58'.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I see multiple NT5 rules: let me check.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT5 has these productions:\n- NT5 \u2192 't84'\n- NT5 \u2192 't17'\n- NT5 \u2192 't55'\n- NT5 \u2192 't58'\n- NT5 \u2192 't71'\n- NT5 \u2192 't58' (Wait, no, maybe I'm miscounting.)\n\nWait, looking again, the NT5 productions are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't84'\n- NT5 \u2192 't17'\n- NT5 \u2192 't55'\n- NT5 \u2192 't58'\n- NT5 \u2192 't71'\n- Wait, another line: 'NT5 \u2192 't8' no, that's not NT5.

I need to determine if the given string `t0 t46 t17 t58 t46 t74` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal is either generating a terminal or two non-terminals. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The goal is to parse the string using these productions.\n\nI'll look at the given grammar. It has several non-terminals (S, NT0, NT1, etc.) and terminals (t0, t46, etc.). The start symbol is S, but looking at S's productions: all of them start with NT0 and NT1. So S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Therefore, any string generated by this grammar must start with this.\n\nNow, the string we're evaluating is `t0 t46 t17 t58 t46 t74`. It starts with t0, which is a terminal, not a non-terminal. So that's concerning because S's first production produces NT0 NT1, which are non-terminals, so the very first thing after S would have to be a production of NT0, which must generate a sequence, not a terminal directly. So the first terminal t0 in the string can't come from S directly. That seems off. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding.\n\nWait, let me check S's productions again. The start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. NT0 and NT1 are non-terminals, so the very first step in the derivation would replace S with a sequence of NT0 and NT1. So the first symbol in the string should be from NT0. But the first symbol is t0, which is a terminal, so maybe that\u2019s a problem. Did I get it wrong?\n\nLet me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at S: S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So S cannot directly produce t0. Therefore, the only way t0 can appear in the string is ifNT0 can produce a terminal at some point. So perhaps NT0 can expand to something that includes t0.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT1 NT4\nWait, actually from the given grammar, looking back:\n\nWait, let me list all NT0 productions:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-108","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out whether the given string `t40 t10 t63 t36 t54 t13 t73` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar's productions all seem to fit this structure, with only a single terminal on the right side except for the productions where a terminal is followed by another.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if this sequence can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S has the production S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the first step is to see if the string can be divided into two parts, each derived from NT0 and NT1 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, it's seven terms long: t40, t10, t63, t36, t54, t13, t73. Since each production is a single terminal or two non-terminals, the number of steps would depend on the depth of the derivation. However, the string has seven terms, which would require intermediate steps that might be missing in this simple approach.\n\nNext, I'll try to break down each terminal in the string and see if they can be produced by the respective non-terminals. Let's list each terminal and its position in the string:\n\n1. t40\n2. t10\n3. t63\n4. t36\n5. t54\n6. t13\n7. t73\n\nSince the string starts with t40, let's look at where t40 is defined. Scanning the productions, I see that NT3 \u2192 't43', but that's not t40. Other NT3 productions are to 't4', 't2', 't47', 't51', etc. Wait, looking back, the given grammar has NT3 with several productions: NT3 \u2192 't2', 't47', 't3', etc. Let me check all NT3 productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' (t2)\n- NT3 \u2192 't47'\n- NT3 \u2192 't4' (t4)\n- NT3 \u2192 't51'\n- NT3 \u2192 't43' \u2192 Wait, that's 't43', but we have t40 not present here.\n\nHmm, so t40 isn't directly produced by NT3. Similarly, checking for t10, the production NT1 \u2192 't12' and NT0 \u2192 't10'. So t10 is produced by NT0.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT0 can produce t10, so the first non-terminal NT0 should produce 't10', which is the second term in the first part of the string. Wait, no, wait: the entire string is a concatenation of two parts from NT0 and NT1. So the initial S \u2192 NT0 NT1 would split the string into a left part (from NT0) and a right part (from NT1). But this string has seven parts, which are a combination of NT0 and NT1 productions. So perhaps the string is split into multiple steps, each step handling a pair of symbols.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as a bottom-up approach: Starting from the string and trying to reduce it to S using the grammar's productions. Alternatively, top-down: expanding S step by step to see if we can reach the string.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, the string can be broken down into factors (segments) each derived from a production. The string length must be equal to 2^n -1 for some n, but 7 is 2^3-1, which might imply three production steps.\n\nWait, let's see: The starting symbol S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So, to derive the string, we might have:\n\nNT0 \u2192 something that produces, say, t40 and more; NT1 \u2192 something that produces t10 and more.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to check each terminal in the string and see if it's in the right place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a parse tree. Let me think.\n\nThe string is t40 t10 t63 t36 t54 t13 t73.\n\nFirst, the initial step is S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nSo the string is divided as NT0 (some part) and NT1 (some part). But it's a flat string, so how do we split it into NT0 and NT1 productions.\n\nWait, another thought: Since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the string has to generate all the NT0 symbols followed by the NT1 symbols. However, the string is just a string of terminals, so perhaps the NT0 part ends with t10, which is t10 being the end of NT0, and NT1 starts with t40? No, that doesn't make sense because the order would be reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this as the string is produced by a series of non-terminals expanding into terminals. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting from S, each step can replace a non-terminal.\n\nBut with seven terminals, the derivation must involve several steps.\n\nHowever, this might get complex. Let's instead consider each terminal and see if they can be part of a derived string.\n\nFirst, let's mark each terminal in the string and see which NTs produce them.\n\n- t40: Looking at the productions, which NTs produce t40? Looking through the NTs:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't43' (so no)\nNT0 \u2192 several, but does any produce t40? Let's see: Looking through NT0 productions, I don't see 't40' as a terminal in any production. So t40 must come from a production where a non-terminal is split into two non-terminals, which then expand to produce t40.\n\nWait, looking through all NT0 productions: I see NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, and other similar.

No t40.\n\nNT5\u2192 't11', 't74', 't55', 't80', 't13', etc. No t40.\n\nNT9: As above.\n\nWait, maybe t40 is part of a longer production. Let's see where t40 appears in the grammar.\n\nLooking through all productions, t40 doesn't appear as a terminal in any production except in cases where a non-terminal can split into parts that eventually produce it.

The string is `t64 t42 t55 t0 t42 t47 t68`, and I need to determine if it's generated by the grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It consists of non-terminals S, NT0, NT1, NT9, and various other NTs. Each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, which fits Chomsky normal form.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. That means the string starts with whatever NT0 and NT1 produce.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t64. Let's find which NT can produce t64:\n- NT0 has multiple production rules that directly produce t64. Specifically, NT0 -> 't64' and NT0 -> 't4' leading to other paths, but t4 leads to t54 etc., so t64 is directly produced by NT0.\n- Also, NT9 can produce t68 (among others), which is the last token in the string. So the last rule must come from NT9.\n\nSo the string is t64 followed by t42, t55, t0, t42, t47, and ending with t68.\n\nWait, no, the string is `t64 t42 t55 t0 t42 t47 t68`. So the order matters. Let's parse from left to right.\n\nThe start symbol S is NT0 NT1, so both NT0 and NT1 must generate parts of the string.\n\nFirst, NT0 produces t64, which is straightforward. Now, the next two tokens after t64 are t42 and t55, so let's see what NT0 can produce after t64.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules:\n- NT0 -> 't64' (so that's exhausted).\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4. So if the next is t42 and t55, perhaps NT0 took the path through NT9 and NT4.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The first token is t64 from NT0. Next, the second token is t42, which comes from NT0 or NT1? Wait, the string is parsed as t64 (NT0), then t42, which could be from NT1, but NT1's productions are more limited.\n\nWait, NT0 and NT1 both start the productions differently. Let me see: NT0 can produce 't64', and NT1 can produce 't12' directly, among others. But in the string, after t64, we have t42, which isn't 't12'. So that can't be NT1's production. Therefore, the second token, t42, must come from NT0's other rules.\n\nWait, but NT0's other rules are combinations, so maybe NT0 took a production that leads us down the t42 path. Let me see the possible ways:\n\nNT0's options are:\n- 't64' (already used)\n- NT9 NT4\n- NT0 NT5\n- NT0 NT4 \u2192 Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, NT0 has:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> NT0 NT5\nWait, no, in the given grammar, for NT0, I think it's:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT0-> NT3 NT5\n- NT0-> NT9 NT4\n- NT0-> NT0 NT5\n- NT0-> 't10'\n- NT0-> 't4'\n- etc.\n\nWait, the initial grammar listing is:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> NT0 NT5\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the NT0 rules are:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> NT0 NT5\nWait, no, wait\u2014let me look again at the grammar provided:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\nNT9 -> 't68'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT3 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't64'\nNT1 -> 't51'\nNT9 -> 't64'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT9 -> 't69'\nNT0 -> 't73'\nNT0 -> 't24'\nNT3 -> 't43'\nNT1 -> 't67'\nNT5 -> 't74'\nNT9 -> 't52'\nNT5 -> 't71'\nNT5 -> 't8'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nNT3 -> 't4'\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT3 -> 't71'\nNT1 -> 't46'\nNT1 -> 't80'\nNT3 -> 't51'\nNT9 -> 't36'\nNT9 -> 't58'\nNT5 -> 't84'\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT9 -> 't66'\nNT4 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't42'\nNT0 -> 't79'\nNT9 -> 't78'\nNT0 -> 't36'\nNT0 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't17'\nNT4 -> 't55'\nNT9 -> 't63'\nNT4 -> 't13'\nNT5 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't76'\nNT9 -> 't44'\nNT4 -> 't58'\nNT9 -> 't41'\nNT3 -> 't50'\nNT1 -> 't73'\nNT3 -> 't40'\nNT5 -> 't80'\nNT0 -> 't5'\nNT1 -> 't42'\n\nSo corrections: NT0's rules include NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, and then a list of 't's: 't10', 't4', etc. So the terminal rules for NT0 include 't64' (from 't64' directly), 't10', 't4', etc. So when S starts with NT0, the first character of the string is t64, so NT0 uses its 't64' production, and then we proceed to parse the rest.\n\nNow, the next token after t64 is t42, which is part of the string. So after t64, the remaining string is t42 t55 t0 t42 t47 t68.\n\nNow, since we're dealing with Chomsky normal form, which uses only binary productions, we can build a parse tree incrementally.\n\nLet me try to see the possible derivation.\n\nStarting with S -> NT0 NT1.\n\nAfter S, we have to derive the entire string. So:\n\n1. S -> NT0 NT1\n2. The first character is NT0's 't64', so NT0 becomes 't64', and we're left with NT1 to derive the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but the string after t64 is t42, t55, t0, t42, t47, t68. So after NT0 being 't64', NT1 needs to generate the remaining tokens: t42, t55, t0, t42, t47, t68.\n\nWait, but actually, the order is t64 followed by t42, which is produced by NT1, then t55, which would likely come from NT0 or another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think about the structure.\n\nSince the entire string is generated by S -> NT0 NT1, we have to see how both NT0 and NT1 contribute to the entire sequence.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. The first token is t64, so the NT0 must have produced 't64' as a terminal symbol. Looking at NT0's rules, 't64' is one of the terminals.\n\n2. So the string is now: [t64, t42, t55, t0, t42, t47, t68], and the grammar's S has produced NT0 (t64) and NT1. Now, we need to generate the rest of the string from NT1.\n\n3. Wait, no. Actually, the entire string is derived from NT0 NT1, so after the first token t64 (from NT0), the remaining tokens (t42, t55, t0, t42, t47, t68) should be generated by NT1.\n\nBut wait, no.

Looking at the production rules, 't80' can come from NT1, specifically NT1 -> 't80' is one of the rules. Also, 't11' comes directly from NT5 (NT5 -> 't11'). So S starts as NT0 NT1, so NT0 and NT1 should each produce their respective tokens.\n\nNow, NT0 needs to generate 't80' and 't11'? Wait, that can't be right because NT0 and NT1 each generate a symbol each. Wait no: actually, NT0 and NT1 each produce a sequence, but in this case, the entire S starts as NT0 NT1, so the first token comes from NT0 and the second from NT1. Wait, no, I think each symbol in the string is generated by the non-terminals, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string as a sequence, it's eight tokens. So the entire string must be generated through the grammar. Each non-terminal in the production must resolve to a terminal sequence. Let's break down the string token by token.\n\nThe first token is 't80'. Looking at the rules, 't80' can be generated by NT1 (rule: NT1 -> 't80'), so the first part must come from NT1, which starts as NT1. Since S->NT0 NT1, the first part is NT0 and the second is NT1. Wait no, S produces NT0 followed by NT1. So the entire string is the concatenation of what NT0 generates and NT1 generates. Wait, no: S->NT0 NT1, so the entire string is the concatenation of NT0's derivation and NT1's. So the string is [NT0 derivation][NT1 derivation] in that order.\n\nSo the first two symbols of the string are 't80' and 't11'. Wait, but that can't be because S starts as NT0 NT1, so each of NT0 and NT1 would produce a terminal string. So after expanding S, we should have NT0 derivation followed by NT1 derivation.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Suppose S -> NT0 NT1. Then, when we derive S, we have NT0's derived string followed by NT1's derived string. So in the input string, the entire 't80 t11 t4 t13 t68 t2 t5 t4' should be the concatenation of NT0's string and NT1's string.\n\nSo, first, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me write out the string as a list: ['t80', 't11', 't4', 't13', 't68', 't2', 't5', 't4'].\n\nBut I think I need to model this as the entire string being a concatenation of the derivations of NT0 and NT1. So perhaps the first part is from NT0 and the second from NT1. Wait, because S->NT0 NT1, so the entire string is NT0's expansion followed by NT1's expansion.\n\nSo, for example, if NT0 expands to 'a' and NT1 expands to 'b', then S would produce 'ab'.\n\nSo, the string should be the concatenation of NT0's derived string and NT1's. Let me check each part.\n\nFirst, let's see the start: 't80 t11'. So I think the first token comes from S's NT0 and the second from NT1's NT1.\n\nWait, no: NT0 is the first, so NT0 generates its own string, then NT1 generates its own. So in the entire string, the first part is NT0's derived symbols, and the latter part is NT1's.\n\nSo for example, if NT0 generates 't80 t13' and NT1 generates 't68 t2 t5 t4', then the entire string would be 't80 t13 t68 t2 t5 t4'.\n\nBut the given string is 't80 t11 t4 t13 t68 t2 t5 t4'. So that has 8 tokens, so perhaps NT0 and NT1 each generate certain parts. Let's consider that.\n\nBut looking at the initial parts:\n\nFirst, the entire string is 't80 t11 t4 t13 t68 t2 t5 t4'. So I need to see if it's possible that the first part (from NT0) and the second part (from NT1) can each be derived from NT0 and NT1 respectively.\n\nBut let me consider each non-terminal:\n\nStarting with NT0.

NT0 -> 't73'\n8. ... and many others, but also there are some via other non-terminals, so perhaps it's better to focus on the rules where NT0 directly expands to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, some NT0 productions directly expand to a single token.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- The start symbol is S.\n- S produces NT0 NT1.\n- So the string must be derived from S, meaning the string should start with the symbols generated by NT0 and NT1.\n\nLet me list the NT0 and NT1 productions and see what they can generate.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the first two symbols in the generated string should be part of NT0 and NT1, respectively? Wait, actually, no\u2014since it's a context-free grammar, the productions are applied in parallel. So the entire string is built by expanding S into NT0 NT1, then each of those non-terminals is expanded further, until all are terminals.\n\nSo the string `t69 t8 t13 t50 t76 t47 t55 t64` has 8 symbols, which is an even number, implying a derivation where the start symbol has been expanded to a sequence of even non-terminals, each eventually producing two terminals. But I need to map each symbol in the string to a terminal, and trace back the productions.\n\nLooking at each symbol in the string:\n\n1. t69\n2. t8\n3. t13\n4. t50\n5. t76\n6. t47\n7. t55\n8. t64\n\nNow, let's see what each of these terminals can result from.\n\nStarting with t69: Looking through the NT rules, I see NT9 \u2192 't68', 't69', 't52', etc. So 't69' can come from NT9.\n\nSimilarly, t8: NT4 has a rule NT4 \u2192 't8', so it's terminal.\n\nt13: Looking at the NT rules, I don't see 't13' explicitly as a terminal. Hmm, but wait, perhaps it's produced by some non-terminal. Wait, let's check the rules again. Oh, NT1 has a production NT1 \u2192 't12', but not t13. Wait, actually, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking back, I notice that NT1 has rules like NT1 \u2192 't12', 't67', 't46', 't80', 't42', 't67', etc. Oh, but t13 isn't listed as a terminal. That's a problem because if t13 isn't a terminal in any rule, then how can it appear in the generated string? Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check all the NT rules again to see if any NT node leads to 't13' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I don't see any NT production that ends with 't13'. The closest is perhaps a rule like NT3 \u2192 't51', 't43', 't71', etc., but not t13. So that suggests that 't13' isn't a terminal symbol in this grammar. Therefore, the string contains a symbol that can't be produced by the grammar, so the overall string can't be derived.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each NT's terminal productions:\n\n- NT0: It has rules like 't10', 't4', 't64', 't73', etc. But does it have 't13'? No.\n- NT1: 't12', 't67', 't46', 't80', 't67', 't51', 't42'. No t13.\n- NT3: 't2', 't47', 't34' (I think), 't51', 't71', 't43'. No t13.\n- NT4: 't47', 't54', 't58', 't82'. No t13.\n- NT5: 't11', 't17', 't19', 't21', 't24', 't58', 't71', 't74', 't84', 't8', and others. No t13.\n- NT9: 't68', 't69', 't52', 't64', 't76', 't78', 't84'. Oh, t68, t69, etc., but no t13.\n\nSo indeed, none of the non-terminals have a direct production to 't13'. Therefore, 't13' can't be part of the generated string because it's not a terminal symbol, and there's no NT derivation that ends with t13.\n\nTherefore, the given string contains a symbol that can't be produced by the grammar. So the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-122","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF is a way of structuring grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it's already in CNF because every rule on the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side has either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That helps because I can apply the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but since the string is short, I might be able to do it manually by constructing a parse tree.\n\nThe given string is `t68 t40 t71 t40 t67 t40 t58 t41 t8`. Let me break it down. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so I need to find a way to derive this string from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S produces NT0 NT1. So the string must start with something that can derive from NT0 followed by NT1. That means the first part of the string should be generated by NT0, and the second part by NT1, with the NT0's expansion followed by NT1's.\n\nNow, looking at NT1, the productions are:\nNT1 -> 't12' \nand \nNT1 -> 't67'\n\nSo the second part of the string should be 't67' or 't12'. The string ends with 't8', so that's not either. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT1's productions again. Yes, NT1 only directly produces 't12' or 't67'. The string ends with 't41 t8', but I think I misread the string. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the string is `t68 t40 t71 t40 t67 t40 t58 t41 t8`. Oh, the last part is 't41 t8'. 't41' is a terminal. So let me see which NT1 productions include 't41' or 't8'.\n\nLooking back, NT9 can produce 't68' and 't64' among others. Wait, maybe I need to consider how these NTs connect.\n\nLet me try to see if the last token is 't8'. In the grammar, the non-terminal NT4 can produce 't47', 't13', 't55', etc. Wait, 't8' is a terminal. Does any NT produce 't8'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT5 -> 't8'. So that's possible. So the last part might come from NT5. But the last token is 't8', so if NT5 produces 't8', then the last part is just 't8', which would be matched by NT5.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, the S is NT0 NT1. So after S, we have NT0 followed by NT1. So the string must be the result of NT0 expanding into something and NT1 expanding into something else.\n\nWait, but in the string, after NT0's expansion, we have 't40 t71 t40 t58 t41 t8'. That's a long string. Maybe I should consider that each NT0 and NT1 can produce more than one symbol, and the string could be built from multiple expansions.\n\nLet me try to find how 't68' can be derived. Looking at NT9 -> 't68', so that's simple. So if NT0 can produce NT9, then 't68' can be part of NT0's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: \n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT4 (but that's redundant since it's already a non-terminal)\n- Other NT0 productions, like NT0 -> NT3 NT5, etc.\n\nSo, if NT0 can produce NT3 and NT5, which might in turn produce terminals.\n\nLet me see if NT3 can produce some of the required terminals. NT3's productions:\n- NT3 -> 't2' \n- NT3 -> 't47'\n\nSo 't2' is in NT3's productions, and so is 't47'. So maybe 't40 t71 t40 t58' is built from some combination of NT3 and NT5.\n\nWait, let's take a step back. The string is `t68 t40 t71 t40 t67 t40 t58 t41 t8`.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- The first 't68' comes from NT9 -> 't68'.\n- Then the next part starts with 't40', 't71', 't40', 't67', 't40', 't58', 't41', 't8'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to construct a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, perhaps I should check if each symbol can be traced back to the grammar. Let's check each step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT0 NT1.\n\nSo the first part comes from NT0, and the second from NT1.\n\nNT1 can be 't12' or 't67'.\n\nLooking at the string, the last symbol is 't8', which is produced by NT5. But that's part of the NT1 production, meaning that the last part of the string should come from NT1's expansion. Wait, that's a problem because NT1 doesn't produce 't8'.\n\nWait, the string is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the string must be NT0's expansion followed by NT1's expansion.\n\nSo after S, the next symbols should be the result of NT0's expansion and then NT1's.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is 't68', which is from NT9. So S's NT0 must derive 't68', meaning that NT0 must eventually produce NT9, which is 't68'. So the first part is okay.\n\nNow the remaining symbols after 't68' are 't40 t71 t40 t67 t40 t58 t41 t8'.\n\nNow, the second part of S is NT1. NT1 can produce 't12' or 't67'. 't67' is in there, which is one of the symbols in the string.\n\nWait, the string after 't68' starts with 't40' which could be from NT4 or NT0, but since NT0 is producing something now, maybe it's NT0 -> NT0 NT1 again, but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string after 't68' is the result of NT1's expansion. But NT1 can't directly produce all those symbols, so maybe NT1 branches into NT5 or some other NT that can produce them.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the entire string can be divided into two parts: one generated by NT0 and another by NT1. Let's try to split the string into two parts, first part from NT0, second from NT1.\n\nThe first symbol is 't68', so NT0 must produce 't68', which it does via NT9 -> 't68'. So the first part is just 't68'.\n\nThen, the rest of the string is 't40 t71 t40 t67 t40 t58 t41 t8' which must come from NT1.\n\nBut wait, the entire string is 't68 t40 t71 t40 t67 t40 t58 t41 t8', so the second part starts with 't40', which is a terminal. So the entire part after 't68' is the expansion of NT1.\n\nBut NT1 can only produce 't12' or 't67' directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken. NT1 can produce 't67', which is part of the string. But the rest are 't40', 't71', etc., which are terminals, so maybe I'm looking at the wrong approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a single NT0 production, but that can't be because S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the entire string must be NT0 \u2192 ... and NT1 \u2192 ..., connected by concatenation.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol and generates NT0 NT1, so the entire string must be the concatenation of NT0's derivation and NT1's derivation. So the first part of the string comes from NT0, and the second part from NT1.\n\nIn the example, S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nSo the string is NT0's expansion concatenated with NT1's expansion. So let's split the string accordingly.\n\nThe first part: Starting from the beginning, does it match any of NT0's possible expansions? NT0 has several productions, all starting with NT0 -> something like NT3 NT5, NT0 -> NT9 NT4, etc."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. Then, NT0 has several productions, some of which are terminals and others lead to more nonterminals. The NT1 productions are simpler, mostly going to terminals like 't12' or other NT symbols.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, so we need to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't84', so I need to see where 't84' can come from. Checking the productions for NT5, I notice one production is NT5 -> 't54', another is NT5 -> 't71', and another is NT5 -> 't84'. Since the string starts with 't84', perhaps the left-hand side is NT5. \n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with NT5, which expands to 't84'. Then, what comes next? Let's think about this step by step.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S, which is NT0 NT1. So the entire string must be derived from NT0 and NT1. Let me try to parse the string as a series of productions.\n\nBreaking down the string into individual terminals:\nt84, t10, t0, t79, t68, t44, t13, t80, t17.\n\nI'll start from the leftmost symbol, t84. Let's see if that can be derived from any nonterminal. Looking at the grammar, NT5 can go to t84. So maybe the first part is NT5 \u2192 t84.\n\nNext, the rest of the string after t84 is t10 t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17. Now, we need to see if t10 t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17 can be derived from NT0, since S is NT0 NT1, and perhaps the second symbol is NT1, which can produce t10.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions. From the grammar, NT1 has several options. For example, NT1 \u2192 't12' or NT9, or NT5 NT1, or others. But in our string, the next symbol is t10. Is there a production for NT1 that leads to t10? Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT1 \u2192 't10' directly. Hmm, so maybe we've taken the wrong approach.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the entire string has to be a sequence where both NT0 and NT1 are expanded, and their terminals are concatenated. So perhaps the string is the concatenation of what NT0 produces and what NT1 produces.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so S \u2192 [NT0's output] [NT1's output]. Therefore, the string should be split into two parts: one generated by NT0 and the other by NT1.\n\nLet's see if that holds. The string is: t84 t10 t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17.\n\nIf I split this into two parts, the first part must be generated by NT0, and the second by NT1.\n\nLooking at NT1's possible productions. The string starts with t10, so perhaps NT1 \u2192 't10'. Wait, does NT1 have a production to 't10'? Looking back, the grammar for NT1 includes options like NT5 NT1, but I don't see 't10' as one of the terminals for NT1. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the current NT1 is 't10', which is one of the immediate productions. Let me check the grammar again. \n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT1 -> 't12' (or similar), but the string starts with 't10'. There's a production NT1 -> 't10', right? Because in the grammar, the rule is NT1 -> 't10'. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 -> 't10'\nYes, that exists. So NT1 can directly produce 't10'. So the first part of the string 't10' would come from NT1 directly.\n\nTherefore, the string after 't10' is t84 followed by the rest? Wait, no. Wait, the entire string is t84 t10 t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17. So maybe NT0 produces 't84 t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17' and NT1 produces 't10'?\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the string is the concatenation of NT0's output and NT1's output. So the total string is NT0's output + NT1's output. Therefore, in the given string, the first part must be NT0's output, and the second part must be NT1's output.\n\nThe current string is t84 t10 t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17.\n\nSuppose NT1's output is t10, then NT0's output must be t84 t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17. Wait, no, that's not right because the string has t84 first, which would be part of NT0's output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so NT0's output is the first part and NT1's output is the second. So the string should start with NT0's output and continue with NT1's output. Therefore, the string is divided into two parts: NT0 produces the first part, and NT1 produces the second part.\n\nSo, in the given string:\n- The first k symbols must be the expansion of NT0.\n- The remaining (9 - k) symbols must be the expansion of NT1.\n\nWe know that NT1 can produce 't10' directly. So if the entire string after that is 't10 t0 ...' that doesn't fit well. Alternatively, perhaps NT1 can produce a longer sequence.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's suppose NT1 produces just 't10'. Then the rest of the string would need to be produced by NT0. But the rest is t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nBut wait, the string is t84 t10 t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17. So the first symbol is t84, which comes from NT5. Then the second symbol is t10 from NT1. So the string's parts are t84 (from NT5) and t10 (from NT1). But S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which would have to expand into NT0's output followed by NT1's output. So the entire string should be NT0's expansion followed by NT1's expansion. So, for example, if NT0 expands into t84 ... and NT1 expands into t10 ..., then the string could be t84 ... followed by t10 ... But in the given string, the second symbol is t10, so maybe that's NT1's first symbol. But that would imply that NT1's expansion starts at the second position.\n\nHmm, perhaps we need to parse the string as a concatenation of NT0 and NT1. So, the entire string is the concatenation of NT0's output and NT1's output.\n\nTherefore, the entire string is:\n\n[NT0's output] [NT1's output]\n\nAnd since S is NT0 NT1, that's the structure.\n\nSo, given that, the string's entire length is the sum of the lengths of NT0's output and NT1's output.\n\nLooking at our string:\n\nt84 t10 t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17 \u2192 total of 9 symbols.\n\nLet's see the possible NT1's output: Since NT1 can be an S-derivation, it might generate a specific sequence. For example, NT1 can be directly 't10', which is a single symbol. In that case, the remaining symbols (t0 t79 t68 t44 t13 t80 t17) would need to come from NT0.\n\nAlternatively, NT1 could expand further, but let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT1: the rules are:\n\nNT1 -> 't10' or 't12' or 'nt5 nt1'?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure to understand the rules. Let's list all the productions for each non-terminal:\n\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, NT0 \u2192 't64' (among others)\n- NT1 \u2192 NT1 NT5, NT1 \u2192 't67' (others are possible, but these two are relevant for the string)\n- NT3 \u2192 NT47, NT3 \u2192 't43', etc., but in the string, I don't see 't47', except in another production.\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, NT3 has several options, including 't2', 't47', 't3', etc. Also, NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1, and others for NT4 and others.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is a series of 't's: t52, t52, etc. So I'll need to see how these 't's can be generated from the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So S must produce two non-terminals, NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at NT0, it can go to NT3 NT5, or other combinations, but in the terminals, I see NT0 can produce several 't's. For example, NT0 \u2192 't79', 't78', 't2', etc. But in our string, the first token is t52.\n\nLooking at NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, and NT5 can produce 't52'. So let's see. If NT0 produces t52, does that fit?\n\nWait, looking at NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5. If NT3 is processed to produce t52, but in the grammar, does NT3 have a production to t52? Let's check the NT3 rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT43, which might mean it can go to t43? Wait, actually, in the grammar, it's written as NT3 -> 't43'. So yes, NT3 can directly produce 't43'. But that's 't43', not 't52'. Hmm.\n\nWait, then how does NT0 produce 't52'? Let me check. In the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't4' is one option, but 't43' is another. Wait, perhaps NT3 can produce 't43' as well as other terms. But 't43' is a single token. In the string, I have t52, which isn't 't43', so maybe that's not how we get t52.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT0's productions: NT0 \u2192 't78', 't79', etc., but none of the terminal productions seem to be 't52' directly. Wait, perhaps I missed that. Let me check all terminal productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT0 can produce 't64', but not 't52' directly. Let me check the NT9 productions. NT9 \u2192 't68', etc. Hmm, no 't52' there either. Wait, but there's a production NT5 \u2192 't52'. Oh! So NT5 can produce t52. So maybe NT0 can produce via NT5.\n\nLooking at NT0: one of its productions is 't4'. Another is 't71', and another is 't5'. Hmm, not 't52'. Wait, perhaps via a chain.\n\nWait, let's look at S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nIf NT0 can produce something that eventually leads to t52, and NT1 can produce another part.\n\nIf NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, and NT3 \u2192 ... but NT3 can produce 't43', which is a single token. Not t52.\n\nAlternatively, if NT0 \u2192 't79', 't78', etc., but those don't help.\n\nWait, let me first figure out if 't52' can be generated by the grammar. Since NT5 directly produces 't52' (NT5 \u2192 't52'), it's possible for a node in the derivation to become 't52' by expanding NT5. \n\nSo, to generate the string, perhaps we can do something like S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and then expand NT0 to something that becomes 't52', and NT1 to 't52' as well, since the string has two 't52's.\n\nBut let me think about that.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nIf NT0 can generate 't52' and NT1 can generate 't52', then S would produce 't52 t52' as the first two tokens.\n\nBut wait, NT1 can generate 't52'? Let's check NT1's productions.\n\nNT1 has rules like NT1 \u2192 NT1 NT5 and NT1 \u2192 't67', but also other options. Wait, in the grammar, NT1 has a production NT1 \u2192 't42', but is there a way for NT1 to produce 't52'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, does NT1 have any rule that can produce 't52'? I don't see any direct 't52' in NT1. Let me check all NT1 productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT1 \u2192 't67'\n- other options like NT1 \u2192 't12', 't42', etc.\n\nNo, NT1 doesn't directly produce 't52'. But perhaps via a combination. For example, NT1 could expand into NT1 NT5, but that would lead to more non-terminals, which could then produce terminals. But in the string, we have 't52' directly at the start, so maybe that's the root.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT1 can produce 't52' through some other way, but the direct productions don't include that. So maybe the initial 't52' comes from NT5, which is a child of NT0 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, NT5 can produce 't52' directly as per the grammar: NT5 \u2192 't52'. So that's one way to get 't52'. Now, is there a production that allows NT0 or NT1 to reach NT5?\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 can go to NT3 NT5, and possibly via NT9 as well. So if NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, then NT3 could be expanded. Does NT3 produce 't52'? Let me check: NT3's productions include 't43', 't3' (wait, NT3 has multiple options, including 't2', 't47', etc. But I don't see 't52' in NT3.\n\nWait, perhaps via a chain. If NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, and NT5 \u2192 't52', then if NT3 can produce some other terms that lead to 't52', but I don't see how that would happen.\n\nAlternatively, if NT0 can directly produce 't52' itself, but looking at NT0's productions, does it have a 't52'? Let me check: The NT0 productions are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't78', 't79', 't4', 't64', etc., but I don't see 't52' in there. So unless NT0 can expand into something that leads to 't52', but it seems not.\n\nWait, perhaps via NT9. NT9 can produce 't68', but another option is NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5. If NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, then NT1 could be something else, but NT1 cannot directly produce 't52', as we saw.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is made of 't52's and other terms, but perhaps the count matters. The string is t52, t52, t13, t69, t0, t58, t13, t17, t10, t5.\n\nLooking at the start, two 't52's. We know 't52' can come from NT5.\n\nSo for the first two tokens, 't52 t52', perhaps we have S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and then both NT0 and NT1 produce 't52's. But as we saw, NT1 can't produce 't52' directly. So maybe NT0 produces 't52' and NT1 also somehow leads to 't52', but that seems impossible unless NT1 has a path to 't52', which it doesn't seem to.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't52's come from NT0 and NT9 producing 't52's, but I don"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, the grammar structure is important. Since it's in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each token in the string should correspond to a production rule where a non-terminal is replaced by that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are multiple NT rules leading to terminals. For example, NT0 can produce 't10', 't4', 't64', etc. So, I need to find a sequence of productions that, when expanded, produce the given string step by step.\n\nThe string has 10 tokens: t82, t54, t66, t68, t66, t66, t41, t12, t13, t11. Let's list them out as positions:\n\n1: t82\n2: t54\n3: t66\n4: t68\n5: t66\n6: t66\n7: t41\n8: t12\n9: t13\n10: t11\n\nI think the way to approach this is to build the parse tree from the bottom up, starting from the string and seeing if each terminal can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLet's start from the beginning:\n\nPosition 1: t82. Looking at the grammar, where does 't82' come from? Scanning all NT rules:\n\nLooking through NT0 and NT1 production rules that yield terminals, I see NT0 can produce 't82' in some rules. For example, NT0 \u2192 't82' when NT0 is derived via certain paths.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. Yes, under NT0, there's a production: NT0 -> 't82'. Similarly, elsewhere, like NT0 -> 't82' in some lines. So t82 is directly derived from NT0. Similarly, check for each token.\n\nSo the first token t82 is from NT0. Let's assume the start symbol S can derive into NT0 NT1. S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nSo after the first part, we have NT0 expanding to t82, and then we need to see how NT1 contributes. Wait, the string is t82 t54 t66 t68..., so maybe we need to see how these are produced in sequence.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the string as a series of steps where each step in the parse generates the next token.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, perhaps the string needs to be parsed by replacing non-terminals with terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a chain of productions where each step generates the next token.\n\nAlternatively, model the process as building the string by starting from S and expanding non-terminals until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nThis might get complicated, but perhaps we can look for the shortest possible derivation or see if each token can be produced by some non-terminal that is connected through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, look at each token and check if it has a corresponding production rule. So for each token in the string, see if it can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nBut since the grammar is complex, with many rules, perhaps a better approach is to map each token to a possible non-terminal that can produce it. Then, we can see if these can be connected in such a way that they form a valid left or right derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps we can list all tokens and see which non-terminals can generate them.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- t10: NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- t4: NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- t64: NT0 \u2192 't64' (several times)\n- t9: NT0 \u2192 't9'? Wait, wait, looking back, I think the grammar has NT9 producing various terminals and also some NT0 rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to list all possible tokens and their sources.\n\nList of tokens in the string: t82, t54, t66, t68, t66, t66, t41, t12, t13, t11.\n\nNow, for each token, check which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nt82: Looking at the grammar rules, NT0 can produce t82 (NT0 \u2192 't82'). So t82 is from NT0.\n\nt54: Looking at the rules, NT0 \u2192 't54'? Wait, looking through the NT0 definitions:\n\nLooking at the NT0 rules in the grammar:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't64', etc.\n\nWait, I'm looking for where t54 comes from. Looking through all grammar rules:\n\nI don't see t54 being directly generated by any NT0 or NT1. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me check the grammar again carefully.\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nLooking for 't54':\n\n- Is there an NT rule that produces 't54'? Let's see: the grammar rules are:\n\nLooking through each NT rule line by line:\n\nLooking at NT5: several rules have 't54' as a terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 't54'.\n\nWait, yes, looking back: the NT5 production includes:\n\nNT5 -> 't54'\n\nAnd similar others like t11, t47, etc.\n\nSo 't54' is produced by NT5. So token t54 must come from NT5.\n\nTherefore, in order to have t54 in the string, there must be a non-terminal NT5, which is derived from some other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, proceeding:\n\nt66: Looking at grammar. Is there an NT rule that produces 't66'?\n\nYes, for example, NT9 \u2192 't66' in one of the rules. Let me check: NT9 \u2192 't68' in some lines, but elsewhere:\n\nLooking through the NT9 rules: NT9 \u2192 't68', and other lines show 't9'? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the NT9 rules, one of them is NT9 \u2192 't69', another is 't66'? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nNT9 rules:\n\n- NT9 -> 't9' no, wait, no, I think I might have missed it. Let me re-examine the list.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\nLooking for 't66' in NT9:\n\nYes, in the grammar: NT9 \u2192 't66' appears somewhere.\n\nWait, let me list all NT9 rules:\n\nNT9 appears in several production rules:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT1 (which is an NT NT production)\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- NT9 \u2192 't69'\n- Other lines: NT9 \u2192 't44', 't52', 't58', 't55', 't84', 't17', 't50', 't76', 't84', 't44', etc. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list, perhaps it's easier to parse section by section.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLet me pick out the NT9 productions:\n\nLooking for 'NT9 -> ...'\n\nYes, here are the lines with NT9 as the left side:\n\n1. NT9 -> NT0 NT1\n2. NT9 -> 't68'\n3. NT9 -> 't69'\n4. NT9 -> 't52'? Wait, no, the line as given:\n\nLooking more carefully, perhaps it's:\n\nLine: NT9 \u2192 't66' ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm seeing this line: \"NT9 -> 't66'\".\n\nAh, yes, I think line 23 is: NT9 -> 't66'.\n\nYes, I see: \"NT9 -> 't66'\". So t66 can be produced by NT9.\n\nSo token 3 is t66, which comes from NT9.\n\nNow, the string is t82 (from NT0), followed by t54 (from NT5), but how do these connect?\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string must be a sequence of terminals generated by expanding the grammar in a step-by-step reduction or derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to model the derivation as a chain of productions, starting from S and expanding non-terminals, ensuring that the generated string matches the given one.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if each token in the string can be linked to a specific non-terminal that can derive it, and see if a sequence exists.\n\nBut let's try to build a possible parse tree.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt82 t54 t66 t68 t66"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar isn't very big, so maybe I can parse it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grammar in a more readable format. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT0 NT1. NT0 and NT1 are non-terminals, and others like t10, t12, etc., are terminal symbols. \n\nSo the grammar structure is:\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1  \nNT0 expands to multiple options involving combinations of other non-terminals, with some terminals. The same for NT1.\n\nThe key is to see if the string can be decomposed according to these productions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t41 t17 t8 t36 t84 t40 t79 t55 t54 t43 t44`. It's a sequence of terminals, so all non-terminals (NTs) need to be expanded to these.\n\nLet me first check if the overall length matches. For a string of length n, in an CNF grammar with S \u2192 A B, each production must produce exactly two symbols (either a terminal or a non-terminal). So the number of symbols in the generated string must be 2^k, where k is the number of splits.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Each step in the derivation adds more symbols, exponentially. So for a string of length 11, which is not a power of 2 (since 2^3=8, 2^4=16), it's impossible for the grammar to generate it, because each production in CNF either produces a terminal or combines two non-terminals, which when deriving, the number of symbols doubles (except when a non-terminal is replaced by two others, but if all are replaced, it doubles each time until terminals are reached).\n\nWait a minute, the given string has 11 symbols. Let me see:\n\nThe number of symbols should start from 1 (S), then for each step, each non-terminal can expand into either 1 terminal (thereby reducing the number by 1, but I'm not sure) or two non-terminals (increasing the number by 1, but that's not correct). Actually, in CNF, each production can produce exactly two symbols. So starting from S, which is 1 symbol, after one step, it's 2. After two steps, if both are non-terminals, it's 4. Next step, 8, then 16, etc. So the length grows as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,...\n\nBut the given string has 11 symbols, which isn't a power of 2. 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16. So 11 is between those, which suggests it's impossible because the number of symbols is not a power of 2. Therefore, the answer must be No.\n\nWait, but what if some non-terminals derive into terminals and others into non-terminals? For example, could the number of symbols not necessarily double each time, potentially leading to numbers like 1, 3, 5, etc.? But in CNF, each production is either a terminal (reducing count by 1 from before if it's a non-terminal) or two non-terminals (each non-terminal would have to be further expanded, but each of them could produce two more, leading to a potentially exponential growth.\n\nWait, let me think again: Starting with S, which is 1 symbol. Each production for S splits into two non-terminals. So after the first step, there are two non-terminals. Then, each of those could either produce a terminal or split again. So suppose at the first step, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, each becomes a symbol. If NT0 and NT1 expand into two terminals each, the total is 4. If any of NT0 or NT1 expand into non-terminals, say NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 and then each of those splits further, perhaps leading to more symbols.\n\nBut for a string of length 11, which is not a power of 2, it's not possible because the number of symbols in the generated string must be a power of 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So we'll need NT0 to expand into something that starts with the first token of the string, which is 't36', and NT1 should expand to the remaining part.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions, I see NT1 \u2192 't12', 't13', 't46', 't51', 't67', 't73', 't80'. The string begins with 't36', which isn't direct from NT1's productions, unless I'm missing something. Wait, maybe NT0 needs to produce something that starts with 't36'.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, I find NT0 can expand to 't36' through the production NT0 \u2192 't36' (I think I missed that earlier). Yes, looking back at the rules: there's NT0 \u2192 't36' listed several times. So NT0 can directly produce 't36'.\n\nSo the string starts with 't36', which can come directly from NT0. Now, the next part after 't36' is 't13', 't74', etc., which needs to come from NT1. Let's look at NT1's possible expansions.\n\nNT1 can produce 't12', 't13', 't46', 't51', 't67', 't73', 't80'. The second token in the string is 't13', which is one of NT1's options. So that's promising. So far, we have NT0 \u2192 't36' and NT1 \u2192 't13', matching the first two tokens.\n\nNext, we have 't74', 't67', 't17', etc. Let's break down how the string continues from 't77' (assuming the first two tokens are 't36' and 't13').\n\nWait, the string is `t36 t13 t74 t67 t17 t11 t4 t36 t44 t5 t67`. So after 't36' 't13', the next is 't74'. So the entire NT1 must produce a sequence starting with 't74'? That might not be directly possible, so perhaps we need to look deeper.\n\nWait, I might need to consider how NT1 can produce more than one token. Because the initial step is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which are two non-terminals. Each of these can expand into multiple terms. So maybe the string is constructed by each of these non-terminals expanding further.\n\nLet's consider NT0 and NT1 as starting points. Let's say S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Then NT0 expands, say, into 't36', but wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, the productions are for single symbols, so NT0 expands into two symbols, not one. So when NT0 expands, it produces two symbols: NT3 and NT5. Similarly, NT1 expands into two symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: each production in the grammar replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting from S, the first expansion is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Now, each of these (NT0 and NT1) can themselves expand into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut to generate the string, we'll need a fully expanded string where all non-terminals have been replaced by terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals, which are the tokens given.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Now, each of NT0 and NT1 can expand further, and so on, until we get a string of terminals.\n\nThe given string is 11 tokens, so we'll need a derivation that produces exactly 11 terminals. Let's try to parse it.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree starting from S.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nNow, let's see what NT0 and NT1 can produce. Starting with NT0: looking for any production rule where the first expansion is 't36'. But in the grammar, NT0 can expand into various non-terminals and terminals. 't36' is a direct production for NT0, so that's possible.\n\nSo the first token is 't36' from NT0. Then, the next part comes from NT1. So the string after 't36' is 't13 t74 t67 ...' which suggests that NT1 is producing multiple terminals.\n\nBut wait, NT1's productions are to non-terminals or terminals, so its expansion would generate a sequence of symbols. Let's see: NT1 can expand into 't12', or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't36', the next token is 't13'. So perhaps NT1 is expanding into 't13' in a direct production. But wait, in the grammar, NT1 \u2192 't12', 't13', etc. So NT1 can produce 't13' directly.\n\nSo now, after 't36' from NT0 and 't13' from NT1, we have the first two tokens: 't36 t13'.\n\nNext, the remaining tokens in the string are t74, t67, t17, t11, t4, t36, t44, t5, t67. So that's 9 more tokens. But wait, how do these get generated? We need to see how NT0 and NT1 can produce these.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should perform a leftmost derivation step by step.\n\nLet me start:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT0 NT1\n2. Now, NT0 \u2192 't36' (using the production NT0 \u2192 't36')\n3. So after step 2, we have 't36' followed by NT1.\n\nNow, NT1 needs to expand into the remaining tokens. Let's look at NT1's possible productions: 't12', 't13', 't46', 't51', 't67', 't73', 't80', and other non-terminals. The next token after 't36' is 't13', so maybe NT1 is producing 't13'.\n\n4.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like all the non-terminals are on the left side, and each production on the right has two non-terminals (except some that produce terminal strings). Since it's in Chomsky normal form, that's good because it simplifies things a bit.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t63 t69 t74 t69 t5 t64 t52 t41 t73 t63 t80 t58`. That's 12 tokens, right? So the derived string should be a sequence of these terms.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. So whatever comes from S will be two parts: one from NT0 and one from NT1. Each of these NTs will then produce more tokens through their own productions.\n\nLet me list all the productions for the NTs. \n\nStarting with NT0:\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 has several other productions down the line (I might have missed some, let me check again).\n\nNT1:\n- NT1 -> NT67 (I guess from NT1 -> 't67')\n- NT1 has other rules if I had seen them. Wait, looking again, NT1 seems to have rules like 't12', 't67', 't51', 't80', etc.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. In the grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\nBut also, in the initial part, NT1 rules seem to include 't51', 't80', etc. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\nNT0 -> S as NT0 -> NT3 NT5, etc.\nThen,\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nOther rules for NT0 include 't10', 't5', 't9', etc.\nSimilarly, NT1 has 't12', 't3', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is such that some branches produce terminals, and others further break down into more NTs. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal into two others until terminals are produced.\n\nGiven that, the string we get must be a binary tree where each node splits into two parts until all are terminals.\n\nSo the process would be to parse the string using the grammar, possibly by reverse engineering the splits.\n\nThe string is: t63, t69, t74, t69, t5, t64, t52, t41, t73, t63, t80, t58.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct how this could have been generated.\n\nStarting from S: NT0 NT1.\n\nSo the first part comes from NT0, the second from NT1.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions, they can produce terminals directly. For example, NT1 -> 't12', 't67', 't51', 't80', etc. Let's see the string after NT1 splits:\n\nWait, the string is 12 tokens. Since S produces NT0 and NT1, each of which will produce a certain number of tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 seems to have several rules that eventually produce terminals, and some that continue. Similarly for NT1.\n\nLet me try to think about the top-down approach. Starting from S, which splits into NT0 and NT1. The NT1 part at the end of the string is `t63 t69 t74 t69 t5 t64 t52 t41 t73 t63 t80 t58`. Hmm, no, wait, the string is t63 ... t58, but the order is that the entire string comes from NT0 NT1. So the start is NT0 generates some part, and NT1 generates some part.\n\nWait, the string is a single sequence of t63 to t58, which is 12 tokens. So the entire string is the concatenation of the string derived from NT0 and the string derived from NT1. So the first part of the string comes from NT0, and the second part from NT1, but in reverse order because NT0 is first in the start symbol.\n\nWait, no, the start symbol is NT0 followed by NT1. So when derived, the NT0 part comes first in the string, followed by NT1's part. So the string is:\n\nNT0's string + NT1's string = the given string.\n\nSo I need to split the given string into two parts: the first part generated by NT0, and the second by NT1.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT1's productions include direct terminals like 't12', 't67', 't51', 't80', etc. So let's try to match the end of the given string with NT1.\n\nLet's look at the last few tokens of the string: ...t80, t58.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions, one of them is NT1 -> 't80'. So perhaps the last token 't58' can't come directly from NT1 because NT1 can't produce 't58' as a single token. Wait, let me check NT1's productions again.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nBut also, looking elsewhere:\n\nNT1 -> 't67'\n\nWait, that's another direct terminal. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the NT1 rules.

Wait, NT5 \u2192 't84' is one of the rules (rule 35). So, NT5 can produce 't84'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first symbol is 't84', which must come from NT5. Therefore, we must have derived a symbol that breaks down into NT5, which then ends up as 't84'.\n\nLooking at the string, t84 is the first symbol, so we must have a tree where the root is S, which splits into NT0 NT1. Then, perhaps NT5 is produced by one of these.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the first symbols must be some way of producing a non-terminal, then another. But the first symbol in the string is a terminal, which must come from one of the non-terminals in the NT0 or NT1.\n\nLet me try to model this step by step.\n\nThe first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nNow, we need to see how NT0 and NT1 can produce the first symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-165","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of non-terminals and terminals, and I have to check if the string \"t52 t66 t47 t55 t11 t71 t84 t69 t11 t36 t47 t44 t10\" can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the problem. The grammar is given in CNF, which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string provided is a sequence of terminals, so each token in the string should be derivable from the non-terminals in the correct order.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its production is S -> NT0 NT1. So, the string must start with the symbols generated by NT0 and NT1 in that order. Looking at the string, it starts with t52, followed by t66, t47, etc. Let's break down the string into the sequence of non-terminals that generate each token.\n\nBut wait, the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, so each token corresponds to a step in the derivation. So, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, and each terminal must be generated by a production rule in the grammar. Each step in the derivation must follow the rules, and the order must match.\n\nSo, starting with S, we have S -> NT0 NT1. So, the first two symbols in the string must come from NT0 and NT1, respectively. Let's look at the string: the first token is t52, which is a terminal. Let's check which production rules produce t52.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT5 -> 't8', but that doesn't help here. Let me search through all the NT rules for 't52'. Scanning through, I see NT9 -> 't52' and NT0 -> 't52' or 't71'?\n\nWait, checking each line:\n\nLooking at all the production rules for NT symbols ending with 't'. Hmm, looking at NT9 -> 't68', NT0 -> 't10'. Let me list all the terminals and their corresponding NT rules:\n\n- NT9 -> 't68'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT3 -> 't2', 't47'\n- NT4 -> 't47', 't54', 't0', 't58', 't55', 't50'?\nWait, NT4 has multiple rules. Let's list them:\n\nNT4:\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT9 -> 't64' (though that's an NT9 -> 't64', but that's under the NT9 rules, not NT4)\nWait, correct. The NT4 rules are:\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT4 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't58'\nNT0 -> 't64' (But that's under NT0's rules)\nWait, perhaps I should list each NT and its rules.\n\nLet's create a mapping from terminal to the NT that produces them.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT0: 't36', 't4', 't64', 't9', 't10', 't11', 't12', 't24', 't27', 't3', 't47', 't48', 't51', 't55', 't58', 't59', 't63', 't64', 't66', 't69', 't71', 't73', 't74', 't78', 't79', 't80', 't82', 't84', 't9', 't10', 't11'\n- NT1: 't12', 't14', 't51', 't67', 't71', 't80'\n- NT3: 't2', 't43', 't47', 't50', 't63', 't74'\n- NT4: 't47', 't48', 't54', 't55', 't58', 't59', 't63', 't64', 't66', 't71', 't73', 't74', 't76', 't84', 't82', 't8', 't54', 't50', 't42' (Wait, perhaps better to look at each line)\n- NT5: 't8', 't11', 't17', 't21', 't25', 't27' (Wait, check lines: NT5->'t8', 't11', 't17', 't21', 't25', 't27', etc.)\n- NT9: 't68', 't69', 't73', 't74', 't75', 't76', 't78', 't79', 't84'\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nThe string is: t52 t66 t47 t55 t11 t71 t84 t69 t11 t36 t47 t44 t10.\n\nSo, the order of terminals is:\n\n1. t52\n2. t66\n3. t47\n4. t55\n5. t11\n6. t71\n7. t84\n8. t69\n9. t11\n10. t36\n11. t47\n12. t44\n13. t10.\n\nStarting with S -> NT0 NT1. So, the first symbol must come from NT0, and the second from NT1. So, the first two tokens are t52 and t66. Wait, no. S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so first comes the string generated by NT0, then the string by NT1. So the entire string is generated by NT0 followed by NT1. Therefore, the first symbol is a terminal derived from NT0, and the last symbol is a terminal derived from NT1.\n\nWait, but NT0 and NT1 are non-terminals. So, their productions consist of other non-terminals, which in turn produce terminals. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which comes from either NT0's derivation or NT1's.\n\nSo, the first symbol, t52, must be generated by NT0, and the next symbol, t66, must be generated by NT0 as well because NT0's production is NT0 and then something else.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. S \u2192 NT0 NT1 means that the entire string is a concatenation of the symbols produced by NT0 and NT1. So, the first part of the string is whatever NT0 produces, and the second part is whatever NT1 produces.\n\nSo, the string is broken into two parts: from NT0 and then from NT1. So, the first token is part of NT0, and the last token is part of NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is t10. So, that must be generated by NT1, because S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So, the last symbol in the string is a terminal derived from NT1.\n\nSimilarly, the first symbols must be a sequence of terminals generated by NT0.\n\nNow, let's check if the last symbol, t10, is generated by NT1. Looking at the NT1 rules, do any of them directly produce t10?\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT1's rules:\n\nLooking at the lines where NT1 is the left-hand side:\n\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT1 -> 't14'\n- NT1 -> 't51'\n- NT1 -> 't67'\n- NT1 -> 't71'\n- NT1 -> 't80'\n\nHmm, none of these produce 't10'. That's a problem because the last symbol is t10, which should come from NT1. But in the grammar above, NT1 doesn't have a production rule for t10. That suggests that the string can't be generated because the last symbol isn't in NT1's productions.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Is there any production of NT1 that results in t10? Let me read all the NT1 lines again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLine: NT1 -> 't12'\nThen another: NT1 -> 't14'\nThen: NT1 -> 't51'\nThen: NT1 -> 't67'\nThen: NT1 -> 't71'\nThen: NT1 -> 't80'\n\nNope"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So if NT0 is used as 't73', then the next token in the string should be generated by NT1.\n\nThe next token is t50.\n\nDoes NT1 have t50 as a production? Looking through the productions of NT1: 't42', 't46', etc. Wait, NT1 has a production 't50' not listed? Wait, checking the list again.\n\nLooking back, do I see NT1 \u2192 t50? Looking through the list: I don't see an explicit production for NT1 \u2192 t50. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through NT1's productions: 't12', 't42', 't80', 't73'. So no, NT1 doesn't directly produce t50. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe NT1 can derive to t50 through two steps. But that might complicate things because the string is structured as a single sequence, so each non-terminal's expansion should directly contribute to the tokens without additional productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT0 \u2192 t73 and then the next non-terminal (from NT1) should directly produce t50. But looking at the productions for NT1, there's no direct 't50'. So perhaps this split isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT0 is generating more than one token. So perhaps NT0 can break down further.\n\nLet's think about NT0. NT0 can produce either NT3 NT5 or NT9 NT4.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t73 t50. So t73 followed by t50. If NT0 is 't73' via NT0 \u2192 't73', then the next token must come from NT1. But as per above, NT1 doesn't have 't50'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT0 is expanding to more tokens, like NT3 NT5 or NT9 NT4.\n\nLooking at the first token, t73 could be generated by NT0 \u2192 t73 directly. Then NT1 would generate the rest.\n\nBut as per NT1's productions, t50 is not directly possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption. Maybe S \u2192 NT0 NT1 is correct, but the parsing isn't just a simple split; perhaps the entire string is generated by a leftmost derivation of S.\n\nSo let's think of S as expanding NT0 and NT1. Each of these can then expand into sequences of terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo starting with S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNow, we need to find a leftmost derivation of the string t73 t50 t82 t79 t71 t41 t52 t68 t0 t84 t24 t52 t44.\n\nLooking at S, the first thing to expand is NT0. So let's see what NT0 can produce:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 t73\n- Other options for NT0 are longer, like t64, t4, etc.\n\nIf we take NT0 \u2192 t73, which is one of the options, then the first token is t73. Then, the remaining string is t50 t82 t79 t71 t41 t52 t68 t0 t84 t24 t52 t44.\n\nNow, for the NT1 part. We need the NT1 to generate the rest: t50 t82 t79 t71 t41 t52 t68 t0 t84 t24 t52 t44.\n\nBut looking at NT1's productions, none directly produce a t50. So perhaps this approach isn't correct. Maybe the NT0 is expanding to a longer sequence.\n\nLooking at NT0, it can also produce NT3 NT5 or NT9 NT4.\n\nTake NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5.\n\nThen, after the first token t73, the next token comes from NT3 NT5, which would be in the form of NT3 followed by NT5.\n\nBut let's see the string again: after t73, we have t50. So how can NT3 and NT5 produce the next few tokens (t50, then t82, etc.)?\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if t50 can be part of the expansion of NT1 or NT3\/NT5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check which non-terminals can produce the first"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-176","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. It consists of several production rules starting with S and involving non-terminals NT0, NT1, and so on. Chomsky Normal Form is when each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all the rules here seem to be in that form, which is good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t40 t66 t68 t10 t11 t58 t76 t44 t54 t84 t0 t46 t74 t54`. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. That means I need to check if the string can be produced by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nLet's start by identifying what each symbol is. It looks like all the symbols in the string are terminals, meaning they are just letters or numbers like 't' followed by a number. So, each symbol in the string is a terminal, and the non-terminals are the NTx symbols.\n\nNow, the top-level symbol in the grammar is S. According to the first rule, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the derivation starts with S producing NT0 followed by NT1. So, the entire string must be generated by expanding NT0 and NT1 in such a way that when we combine all the tokens from their expansions, we get the given string.\n\nLet me outline the approach. I'll need to simulate the derivations of NT0 and NT1 to see if they can produce the necessary parts of the string. Since the string has 14 tokens, I need to find a way to split this into parts that correspond to NT0 and NT1's expansions.\n\nLooking at the initial production for S: S \u2192 NT0 NT1. That means the string derived from S will consist of the string generated by NT0 followed by the string generated by NT1.\n\nSo, let's split the given string into two parts: A and B, where A is the part generated by NT0 and B is the part generated by NT1. So, the entire string should be A concatenated with B, i.e., A + B.\n\nGiven that, let's see the length of the string: 14 tokens. So, the split could be in various places. For instance, 1 and 13, 2 and 12, ..., up to 7 and 7. But I guess the splits would have to make sense according to the grammar rules.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to check the individual terminals and see if they can be derived from the non-terminals. Let's look at the grammar again and see if we can map the terminals to non-terminals.\n\nLet's list out the production rules for each non-terminal:\n\n- NT0: multiple rules, including 't10', 't2', 't47', etc.\n- NT1: 't12', 't3', etc.\n- NT3: 't2', 't43', etc.\n- NT4: 't47', 't4', etc.\n- And so on. So, each NT has several production options.\n\nOur strategy is to build parse trees step by step, starting from S, and see if each part of the string matches the expansion.\n\nLet me try to take the given string and see if the first few symbols match any production. First symbol is t40. Wait a minute, looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce t40 as a terminal. Let me check all the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through NT0: It has t36, t10, t4, t9, t16, t24, t3, etc., but not t40. NT1 has t12, t3, etc., but no t40. Similarly, other NTs like NT3,NT4,NT5, etc., all produce other terminals, none with t40.\n\nWait a minute, so t40 is a terminal that's not present in any of the non-terminals' productions. That's a problem. Because that means t40 cannot be generated by any non-terminal in the grammar. So, the first symbol in the string is t40, which cannot be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT0 has several options, including 't2', 't4', 't10', etc., but no 't40'. Similarly, NT1 has 't12','t3','t46', etc., but again, no 't40'. So, the symbol t40 is not a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to contain 't40' if it's supposed to be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but that's a critical point. If the string contains a symbol that isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, the string can't be part of the language. So, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it contains a terminal that the grammar doesn't produce.\n\nLet me confirm this by checking each symbol in the string:\n\nThe string is: t40 t66 t68 t10 t11 t58 t76 t44 t54 t84 t0 t46 t74 t54\n\nFirst symbol is t40. So, t40 is a terminal that's not present in any of the NT rules. Therefore, the entire string can't be derived from the given grammar because the first token can't be produced.\n\nHence, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each of these NTs has their own rules, mostly producing other NTs or terminal tokens like 't0', 't2', etc. So, the overall string should be a combination of these terminals connected through the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate has 15 tokens: each is a two-digit number except 't's with single digits like 't46', 't66', etc. Wait, actually, looking closer, all the tokens are of the form 'tXX' where XX are numbers. For example, t46, t66, t2, t42, etc. So each token is a terminal.\n\nSince each production in CNF has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, the string should consist of an even number of terminals if it's a valid derivation. Let me count: the string has 15 tokens, which is odd. Wait, that might be an issue. In CNF, the start symbol S can only produce two non-terminals, and each production step adds exactly one terminal. Wait, no, each production step either adds a terminal (if a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal) or two non-terminals (if replaced by two others). So the length of the string should be such that after expansions, the number of tokens could vary.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, starting from S, which produces two NTs, each production step either expands a non-terminal into two others or into a terminal. So the number of tokens can increase by one each time a non-terminal is expanded into two others, but can also decrease by replacing two NTs with a terminal. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about it differently.\n\nEach production in CNF is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, each step can either add one terminal (if A is replaced by a) or add two NTs (if A is replaced by BC). The starting symbol S is at the top level, and each replacement propagates down.\n\nThe initial number of symbols is 2 (from S \u2192 NT0 NT1). The string length can vary depending on how each non-terminal is expanded. For example, if we expand a non-terminal into a terminal, that's one token. If we expand it into two non-terminals, the count increases by one each time both are expanded. Wait, no: each time a non-terminal is replaced by two NTs, each of those could in turn be terminals or non-terminals. So the total number of terminals in the parsed string depends on how many NTs are expanded into terminals versus how many are left as NTs.\n\nSo, in this case, the user's string is 15 tokens long. Let's see if that's possible. The start symbol produces two NTs, so the first step has 2. Each expansion of a NT into two others increases the count by one if both are non-terminals. But if a NT is expanded into a terminal, the count remains the same. Wait, actually, let's model it:\n\nEach production for a non-terminal can either:\n\n- Terminate: contribute one terminal, so if the current count is n, after this step, it's n. But wait, no: if a non-terminal A is expanded into a terminal, it contributes one token. If A is expanded into two non-terminals B and C, which then each might contribute more tokens or just disappear if they are terminals.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar step by step, ensuring that the sequence of productions can lead to the exact string.\n\nLooking at the string: t46 t66 t2 t42 t5 t46 t44 t40 t0 t74 t73 t2 t44 t64 t63. That's a long string; maybe we can break it into smaller segments and see if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a parsing approach, trying to parse the string step by step, ensuring that each terminal matches a rule and non-terminals expand correctly.\n\nBut given that I'm a bit overwhelmed, maybe I should look for patterns or repetitions in the string and see if they align with the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that 't46' appears twice in a row. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the rules: NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT3 or other options. Wait, NT0 can be NT9 NT3, etc. So perhaps if a NT9 is followed by NT3, which could derive into something that includes t46.\n\nWait, looking at the NT9 rules: NT9 can go to 't68', 't66', 't64', 't47', 't52', 't58', 't71', 't66' again, etc. Hmm, so NT9 can be 't68' (but in the string, 't68' isn't present), 't66' appears and is present in the string as the second token. Also, 't66' is a possible output for NT9. So maybe the second token 't66' comes from NT9.\n\nThen, after 't66', the next token is 't2'. So in the production after NT0, we have another NT9. Let me see: let's assume that S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Then, perhaps the NT0 expands to NT9 NT3 or something else. Suppose in one case, NT0 is expanded to NT9 NT3. Then, NT9 can produce 't66' and NT3 can produce 't2'.\n\nLooking at the NT3 rules: NT3 has several options, including 't2', 't43', 't51', etc. So NT3 can directly produce 't2', which would match the third token. So that seems possible.\n\nSo that would look like:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT3\n\nNT9 \u2192 't66'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nThat gives us t66 t2, which is the start of the string. So that seems okay.\n\nNext token after that is 't42'. Wait, in the string, after t66 t2 comes t42. So in the current expansion, we have 'S \u2192 NT0 NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT3 NT1'. Now, NT1 can be 't12', 't10', etc. Looking at the NT1 rules: for example, NT1 can be 't12' (once), 't42' another option? Or does it have multiple 't12'?\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT1 has several rules, including 't12', 't46'. Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nNT0 -> NT5 NT4\n\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nNT1 -> 't10'\n\nNT9 -> 't68'\n\nNT0 -> 't64'\n\nWait, let me check each NT9's production.\n\nWait, looking at the NT9 definitions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't66'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't64' (multiple times)\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't47'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't64' again\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't52'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't58'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't71'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't52' again\n\nWait, I might be miscounting. Let me list all the NT9 rules:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT9 -> 't68'\n\n- NT9 -> 't66'\n\n- NT9 -> 't64'\n\n- NT9 -> 't47'\n\n- NT9 -> 't64'\n\n- NT9 -> 't52'\n\n- NT9 -> 't71'\n\n- NT9 -> 't52'\n\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n\n- NT9 -> 't73'\n\nWait, perhaps it's more than that. Oh well, anyway, the point is that NT9 can produce 't66' which we've already assigned.\n\nSo back to the parsing. After the initial NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT3, which produces 't66', 't2', we have the next tokens: starting with t42.\n\nLooking at the current expansion, we've derived 't66 t2', and the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Let's list out the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 can produce NT1 NT5 or be a terminal 't68'\n\nNT0 has multiple productions:\n- NT3 NT5\n- NT9 NT4\n- NT5 NT1\n- 't10' (I think it's a typo and should be NT0 -> 't10')\n- Other NT0 productions leading to various terminals like t4, t36, etc.\n\nNT1's productions include:\n- NT1 NT5\n- 't12' and other terminals like t11, t13, etc.\n\nNT3 has several terminal productions, including 't2', 't47', 't51', etc.\n\nNT4 can produce 't47', 't54', 't0', etc., and also NT5 and other combinations.\n\nNT5's productions are various, including 't8', 't17', and others, up to 't84'.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t79, which is a terminal. Let's look at which non-terminals produce 't79'. Looking through the list, NT9 and NT0 both have a production to 't79'. So either S can expand via NT0.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. If I take NT0 to produce 't79', then NT1 would need to produce the rest of the string.\n\nThe remaining string after 't79' is \"t80 t40 t11 t52 t12 t40 t36 t79 t54 t0 t69 t24 t79 t67\".\n\nWait, but the next symbol is 't80'. Let's see where 't80' comes from. Looking at the grammar, NT0 can produce 't80' if it has that production. Looking back, I see NT0 \u2192 t80, yes, under NT0's production.\n\nSo now we have S \u2192 NT0 't80' NT1. So NT0 is 't79', NT1 is 't80'... Wait, no, S is NT0 followed by NT1, and NT0 is 't79' and NT1 is 't80'?\n\nWait, no, let's correct that. The expansion of S is NT0 followed by NT1. So if NT0 is 't79', then NT1 needs to produce the rest of the string after 't79', which is \"t80 t40 t11 t52 t12 t40 t36 t79 t54 t0 t69 t24 t79 t67\".\n\nBut wait, that's a lot. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n2. NT0 \u2192 't79', so remaining is NT1 must produce the rest.\n3. NT1 can produce 't80' (from NT1 \u2192 't80'), so now after 't80', we're left with \"t40 t11 t52 t12 t40 t36 t79 t54 t0 t69 t24 t79 t67\".\n\nWait, but that leaves us with multiple symbols. Let's see. So after expanding S as NT0 't80' NT1, but actually, more accurately, S is NT0 followed by NT1. So after NT0 is 't79', then NT1 should produce everything else, which is the rest of the string.\n\nBut let's check: the original string is t79 t80 t40 t11 t52 t12 t40 t36 t79 t54 t0 t69 t24 t79 t67.\n\nSo after the initial 't79' (from NT0), the next elements are t80, which would come from NT1 \u2192 't80'. Then what remains is the rest: t40 t11 t52 t12 t40 t36 t79 t54 t0 t69 t24 t79 t67.\n\nSo now we need to see if NT1 can expand into that. Looking at NT1's productions, it can produce terminals like 't40' (from NT1 \u2192 't40') but wait, NT1 has multiple productions. Let me list NT1's possible expansions:\n\n- NT1 can be a terminal like 't12', 't11', 't13', 't52', etc.\n- Also, NT1 can be NT1 NT5 or NT5 NT1 or NT9 NT1, etc. But since we're dealing with a string that has a lot of terminals, I think it's more likely that NT1 will produce a sequence of terminals, possibly via a chain.\n\nLet me see NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 can be:\n- 't12'\n- 't40' (from NT1 \u2192 't40')\n- 't52' (from NT1 \u2192 't52')\n- 't36' (from NT1 \u2192 't36')\n- 't80' (from NT1 \u2192 't80')\n- 't47'? Wait, no, looking back, I don't see NT1 \u2192 't47', but looking at the grammar, maybe through other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Looking again, the grammar includes NT1 \u2192 't40', 't11', 't52', 't12', etc., but I don't see NT1 \u2192 't40' as a direct production. Wait, looking back, NT1's productions are:\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nAlso, NT1 can be NT1 NT5 or NT9 NT1, or something? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for NT1, the productions are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT1 \u2192 't40' (Wait, is this correct? Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking back at the production for NT1: looking for NT1 \u2192 ..., yes:\n\n\"NT1 -> 't12'\" is one, and also there's \"NT1 -> 't52'\" perhaps?

{"custom_id":"request-192","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the task and breaking it down.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given with several non-terminals on the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the productions. Each production appears to be of the form X -> Y Z, which is characteristic of CNF, except for the start symbol S, which goes to NT0 NT1. So that's fine because CNF allows the start symbol to have two terminals in the production.\n\nThe string to check is: `t52 t13 t51 t0 t82 t55 t63 t55 t52 t58 t74 t47 t79 t76 t52 t82`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar by following the productions step by step. The approach I should take is to use a parsing method suitable for CNF, like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose. However, since the string is relatively short, maybe I can do it manually or with a step-by-step simulation.\n\nLet me list out the productions again for clarity:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\n\nNT9 -> 't68'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\n\nNT3 -> 't47'\n\nNT4 -> 't47'\n\nNT5 -> 't11'\n\nNT0 -> 't64'\n\nNT1 -> 't51'\n\nNT9 -> 't64'\n\nNT0 -> 't4'\n\nNT9 -> 't69'\n\nNT0 -> 't73'\n\nNT0 -> 't24'\n\nNT3 -> 't43'\n\nNT1 -> 't67'\n\nNT5 -> 't74'\n\nNT9 -> 't52'\n\nNT5 -> 't71'\n\nNT5 -> 't8'\n\nNT0 -> 't71'\n\nNT3 -> 't4'\n\nNT4 -> 't54'\n\nNT3 -> 't71'\n\nNT1 -> 't46'\n\nNT1 -> 't80'\n\nNT3 -> 't51'\n\nNT9 -> 't36'\n\nNT9 -> 't58'\n\nNT5 -> 't84'\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT9 -> 't66'\n\nNT4 -> 't82'\n\nNT3 -> 't42'\n\nNT0 -> 't79'\n\nNT9 -> 't78'\n\nNT0 -> 't36'\n\nNT0 -> 't47'\n\nNT5 -> 't17'\n\nNT4 -> 't55'\n\nNT9 -> 't63'\n\nNT4 -> 't13'\n\nNT5 -> 't50'\n\nNT5 -> 't76'\n\nNT9 -> 't44'\n\nNT4 -> 't58'\n\nNT9 -> 't41'\n\nNT3 -> 't50'\n\nNT1 -> 't73'\n\nNT3 -> 't40'\n\nNT5 -> 't80'\n\nNT0 -> 't5'\n\nNT1 -> 't42'\n\nWait, I notice some non-terminals on the RHS, like NT9, NT0, NT1, NT5, NT3, NT4, etc. But the string consists only of terminals, so the parsing process must resolve all non-terminals into these terminals through their productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. The start symbol S starts with S->NT0 NT1, which is two non-terminals, each of which needs to be expanded into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nThe CYK algorithm proceeds in passes, considering substrings of the string, and checking possible non-terminals that can derive that substring in a certain number of steps. However, since the string might be of length 16, doing this manually could be time-consuming. But maybe I can approach it by seeing if each step can be matched with the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into possible non-terminals and terminals. Let's consider the string as a sequence of tokens and see how they could be generated.\n\nLooking at the string: t52, t13, t51, t0, t82, t55, t63, t55, t52, t58, t74, t47, t79, t76, t52, t82.\n\nI'll try to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's look for the leftmost symbols first. The start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. So the string must start with NT0 generating the first part and NT1 generating the second part.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t52, which is a terminal. So what does NT0 produce? Let me check the productions for NT0.\n\nNT0 has several productions:\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 has others like 't10', 't4', etc., but in this case, looking for a path that starts with NT0 -> something that can produce t52 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, one of them is NT0 -> 't5'. That's a direct production to the terminal. But t5 is not t52, so maybe not. Another production is NT0 -> 't64', which is also not t52. Wait, but let me check the possible non-terminals that can derive t52.\n\nLooking at the NT9 list: NT9 -> 't68', 't64', 't52', 't47', 't69', 't78', 't66', 't71', 't84', 't58', 't44', 't80', etc. Hmm, so NT9 can produce 't52'.\n\nBut how would NT9 get there? From NT0 -> NT9 NT4. So, if NT0 can produce NT9 and NT4, which can then produce t52 and something else.\n\nWait, but the leftmost derivation would require S->NT0 NT1, then NT0 and NT1 each deriving a part of the string. So let's consider NT0 first.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t52. So we need NT0's production that can produce t52 as the first symbol. Looking at the NT0 productions:\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4: So to get t52, one of the non-terminals in this pair would need to produce t52.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, one of them is NT9 -> 't52', so if we have NT0 -> NT9 NT4, then if the NT9 can produce 't52' and NT4 produces something, but then we have to see if the next symbols in the string can be generated by that.\n\nWait, but I think I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe it's better to try to parse the string step by step, trying to see if each part can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for substructures that match the productions. For example, the string contains 't52 t13 t51 t0 t82 t55 t63 t55 t52 t58 t74 t47 t79 t76 t52 t82'.\n\nLet me try to split this into possible pairs to see if they can be formed by applying the productions. Since each step in CNF can only produce two symbols, either a terminal and a terminal, a terminal and non-terminal, or two non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So to parse the string, it should be possible to split the string into pairs that match the productions.\n\nBut this is a bit tricky. Let me look for possible production steps.\n\nStarting with S->NT0 NT1. The string starts with t52. Let's see how NT0 can produce t52. Looking at NT0's productions, the only direct production leading to t52 is through NT9. Because NT0 has a production NT0 -> NT9 NT4. So if NT0 is NT9 NT4, then NT9 can produce 't52', and NT4 can produce the rest of the symbols.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first step, NT0 must produce a string that starts with NT9 ... leading to 't52'. Let me try to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this with the CYK algorithm, but I'll try a different approach. Since it's a string of 16 symbols, the maximum possible length for a derivation in CNF is 2^(16) steps, but since it's not a very large string, maybe I can find a way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the string starts with NT0 and NT1, where NT0 produces a part that starts with 't5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and either one or two non-terminals on the right. Since CNF doesn't allow terminals on the left-hand side, the start symbol S must only produce non-terminals. But in the given grammar, S -> NT0 NT1. Both NT0 and NT1 are non-terminals. So, S produces a combination of two non-terminals, each of which needs to eventually derive a terminal string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t78 t12 t50 t52 t50 t12 t52 t44 t8 t82 t64 t82 t66 t64 t46 t40 t84`.\n\nLet me first analyze how the grammar builds up terminal strings. Each production is either a two-terminals combination or more. So, each non-terminal must generate a part of the string.\n\nI think the best way is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I'll need to see if there's a leftmost derivation that leads to the string.\n\nBut parsing can be tricky. Another approach might be to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by looking at the possible productions. Let me list the productions for reference:\n\n- S -> NT0 NT1\n\nSo S starts with NT0 and NT1. Both must produce sequences of terminals, and their concatenation should form the given string.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts, left and right, corresponding to NT0 and NT1. But the split isn't obvious. Maybe I can look for possible ways to split the string into two parts, each starting with a specific terminal that can be generated by NT0 and NT1 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string: `t78 t12 t50 t52 t50 t12 t52 t44 t8 t82 t64 t82 t66 t64 t46 t40 t84`\n\nIt has 17 tokens.

If S -> NT0 NT1, then the string must be the concatenation of NT0's derivation and NT1's derivation. So, the string must be divisible into two parts, where NT0 generates the first part and NT1 generates the second.\n\nLet's suppose that NT0 generates the first k tokens and NT1 generates the remaining (17 - k) tokens. I need to find a possible k.\n\nLooking at possible productions for NT1. Let me check what NT1 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 -> 't12' (terminal)\nNT1 -> 't12' is direct, so that's possible.\n\nWait, so NT1 can directly produce 't12' or other productions that further split into non-terminals. But the direct production is 't12', so one possibility is that NT1 starts with 't12', which is the second token in the string. So, the string starts with t78, then t12, t50, etc. So if NT1 is producing 't12' directly, maybe NT1 is the second part of S.\n\nWait, but wait. If S is NT0 followed by NT1, then NT0 would have to generate the first part, and NT1 must generate the second part.

{"custom_id":"request-201","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string that I need to check if it belongs to the language defined by this grammar. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to be quite large with many rules, so it might be a bit complex, but I can manage.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t71 t80 t58 t12 t17 t79 t84 t51 t41 t13 t17 t50 t46 t46 t82 t4 t4`. Let's write it down without spaces for clarity: t71t80t58t12t17t79t84t51t41t13t17t50t46t46t82t4t4.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it consists of productions like A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. I think the standard approach here is to use the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to break it down.\n\nBut wait, the CYK algorithm could be very time-consuming here because the string is quite long. Maybe I can approach it by trying to parse the string step by step, building a parse tree.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol, which is S. The only production for S is S\u2192NT0 NT1. So the entire string must be derived from NT0 NT1. That means the string should consist of two parts: one derived from NT0 and another from NT1.\n\nBreaking the string into two parts: the first part would be everything up to NT0's production, and the second part from NT1. Wait, but in practice, since NT0 and NT1 are non-terminals, their respective productions will generate their parts.\n\nSo let's see the order of the string. The first token is t71, which might be part of NT0 or NT1. Wait, but the entire string is S\u2192NT0 NT1, so the entire string should be a sequence where NT0 generates the first part, and NT1 the second.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that NT0 and NT1 can produce multiple symbols each. So the entire string is the concatenation of what NT0 produces and what NT1 produces.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT1 has a production NT1\u2192't12', which is a terminal. So the second part of the string must include 't12'. Let me check the given string. The 4th token is t12. So position 4: t12. Then after that, we have 17 more tokens. So maybe the second part starts with t12.\n\nWait, actually, S\u2192NT0 NT1 would mean NT0 produces some string, then NT1 produces another. So the entire string is a concatenation of what NT0 and NT1 produce.\n\nWait, but the string is in the order of t71, t80, t58, t12, etc. So maybe t12 is the first symbol of NT1's production, and t71 is part of NT0. So I'll check if the string can be split into NT0's production and NT1's production.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step, starting from S.\n\nLet me look at the production rules for the non-terminals:\n\nNT0 has several productions:\n- NT0\u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0\u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0\u2192 NT9 NT4 again (same as above)\n- NT0\u2192 NT4 (terminal)\nWait, looking back, the rules for NT0 are:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (duplicate)\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 (terminal)\nNT0 \u2192 NT4 (terminal)\nWait, wait, I need to correct this.

{"custom_id":"request-216","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in its entirety, so I should look at all the production rules. Each non-terminal on the left side (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) can be replaced by the right-hand side strings. Each production seems to be of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, except for the initial S which goes to NT0 NT1. All the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string I'm supposed to check is: `t78 t54 t5 t55 t52 t11 t73 t58 t58 t5 t69 t78 t5 t69 t2 t69 t69 t76`.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens, but I can approach this by seeing if each step of the derivation can produce this string, using the given rules.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S -> NT0 NT1. So S must start the derivation with two NT0 and NT1 as the left-hand side symbols. Wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a non-terminal producing exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So when we expand S, it becomes two symbols: NT0 and NT1. Then each of these can be expanded further.\n\nSo, the initial symbol is S which becomes NT0 NT1. Then, for the string, the first token is t78. Looking at the productions, the terminals are various t followed by numbers.\n\nLet me look at each NT rule to see how they can produce terminals:\n\n- NT0 can produce several things, including 't78' in some of its rules. For example, NT0 -> 't78' is one rule (I think it's under the initial list). So if NT0 is supposed to produce t78, that could be a terminal. Similarly, NT1 might produce t5 or t11, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT0 has several productions: 't78' is one, 't5' is another. So for the first token t78, that would come from NT0, so the first symbol in the derivation would be Nt0 -> t78.\n\nWait, no, because S is NT0 NT1, so S expands to NT0 and NT1, each of which can be replaced. So in the string, we have a t78 as the first token, which would come from either NT0 or NT1. Let's check what NT0 can produce. From the rules, NT0 has:\n\n- NT0 -> 't78'\n\nYes, so one of the options is to produce 't78'.\n\nSo assuming NT0 derived t78, then NT1 would have to produce the remaining symbols.\n\nNow, the string is t78 followed by t54, t5, etc. Let's see.\n\nSo the first token is 't78' from NT0. Now, the remaining string is t54 t5 t55 t52 t11 t73 t58 t58 t5 t69 t78 t5 t69 t69 t76.\n\nSo, S expands to NT0 NT1. NT0 produces t78, so the residual part is NT1 needs to produce the rest: t54 t5 t55 t52 t11 t73 t58 t58 t5 t69 t78 t5 t69 t69 t76.\n\nWait, that might be a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the initial NT0 and NT1 each produce non-terminals that need to expand into the rest.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this as a parsing problem, where each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal with its RHS until there are only terminals left.\n\nSo, S -> NT0 NT1. Then, replacing NT0 and NT1: each non-terminal needs to be broken down until everything is terminals.\n\nSo let's try to parse the given string step by step, starting from S.\n\nBut this might take a long time, but let me try.\n\nGiven the string tokens: t78 t54 t5 t55 t52 t11 t73 t58 t58 t5 t69 t78 t5 t69 t69 t76\n\nWe start with S: NT0 NT1.\n\nWe need to see if NT0 can produce t78 and NT1 can produce the rest. Or perhaps the other way around, but let's start with NT0.\n\nLooking at NT0's production: it can produce 't78' directly. So NT0 -> t78. Now, the remaining part to parse is t54 t5 t55 t52 t11 t73 t58 t58 t5 t69 t78 t5 t69 t69 t76.\n\nNow, the residual string to parse is t54 t5 t55 t52 t11 t73 t58 t58 t5 t69 t78 t5 t69 t69 t76.\n\nNow, the initial NT1, which was part of S, needs to produce this residual string.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions. Let me list all NT1 rules:\n\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT1 -> 't11' (no, wait, no, maybe I messed up.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminal or terminal symbols. This structure simplifies parsing because each production rule is straightforward in terms of how it can generate strings.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the non-terminals on the left are simple (e.g., S, NT0, NT1, NT9, etc.), but I notice that some of them expand into two symbols. For example, S -> NT0 NT1. This means that each rule applies two steps at once, generating two symbols at a time.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminal symbols (all starting with 't'), so I need to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar's rules step by step. Parsing can be done using either a top-down or bottom-up approach, but since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or even a simple step-by-step matching might work.\n\nLet me note down the string to visualize it better:\n\nt50, t73, t47, t63, t10, t46, t8, t64, t69, t64, t64, t51, t71, t67, t10, t46, t41, t43.\n\nFirst, I'll check if the first symbol 't50' can be generated by any production rule. I'll look through all the non-terminals that can produce 't50'.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT9 -> 't68', 't9', 't64', etc. Wait, checking all the rules, I see that NT9 -> 't68' is one option. But wait, looking closer:\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice a rule for NT9: NT9 -> 't68' (yes). Also, is there any NT that directly produces 't50'? Looking:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5 (using two NTs)\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT5 -> NT1 NT1\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT5 -> NT8 (Wait, looking at the rules again, I think I might have missed something. Let me scan through all the NT9 rules.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\nNT9 -> 't68', but is there any NT that produces 't50' directly?\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT production that directly results in 't50'. So, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list all the possible NTs that can produce 't50' directly. I'll go through each rule:\n\n- S: no.\n- NT0: it expands into combinations of other NTs, except for one rule of NT0 -> 't5', which is a terminal. So 't5' is a single symbol, not 't50'.\nWait, no. Wait, I need to look again. Let me see all NT0 rules:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4 (again?)\n\nNT0 -> NT47 \u2014 wait, no, looking again, each rule is on a separate line.\n\nWait, the rules for NT0 are:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4 \u2014 wait, the same as the previous one? Or perhaps it's a typo. Let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar as given has several lines, let me list NT0's rules:\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT4\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the entire grammar correctly.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT0 NT1.\n\nThen, each NT0, NT1, etc., have their own rules. For NT0, the rules are:\n\n1. NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n2. NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n3. NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n4. NT0 -> NT4\n5. NT0 -> NT10\n6. NT0 -> NT10\n7. NT0 -> t79\nWait, no, I think I'm miscounting. Let's take it again.\n\nLooking at the entire grammar:\n\n- S -> NT0 NT1\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT5 -> NT1 NT1\n- NT9 -> 't68'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT3 -> 't47'\n- NT4 -> 't47'\n- NT5 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't64'\n- NT1 -> 't51'\n- NT9 -> 't64'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT9 -> 't69'\n- NT0 -> 't73'\n- NT0 -> 't24'\n- NT3 -> 't43'\n- NT1 -> 't67'\n- NT5 -> 't74'\n- NT9 -> 't52'\n- NT5 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't8'\nWait, this is a mess. To avoid confusion, perhaps I should note down all the production rules for each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, since I need to find which NT generates 't50', perhaps I can make a map from NT to terminal(s) they can produce directly or via rules.\n\nBut first, perhaps I need to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't50', and if so, how. But looking through the rules, I'm not seeing any NT rule that directly gives 't50'. So perhaps it's generated by combining other symbols.\n\nWait, maybe 't50' is produced by an NT that expands into two symbols, which themselves expand into the terminal symbols, leading to the 't50' in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible path to generate 't50' in the string.\n\nBut now, perhaps a better approach is to model the entire parsing process step by step.\n\nThe string is: t50, t73, t47, t63, t10, t46, t8, t64, t69, t64, t64, t51, t71, t67, t10, t46, t41, t43.\n\nBut in a grammar in CNF, each production generates exactly two symbols, so the number of symbols in the string should correspond to the number of productions applied. For S -> NT0 NT1, each application of a rule adds two symbols to the string, except the initial S, which is two symbols. Wait, in this case, S is the start symbol, which is a single NT0 and NT1, each of which will produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, no: in CNF, a rule like A -> BC would mean that when A is on the left, it's replaced by B and C. So each step of the grammar produces two symbols, hence the total number of symbols should be equal to the number of non-terminal steps plus one. Hmm, perhaps not, because initial applications may produce multiple non-terminals that then get resolved.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler to count the number of symbols in the string.\n\nThe string has 18 symbols, all 't's followed by numbers. Let's count: 18 symbols.\n\nIn a CNF grammar, starting from S (which is a single non-terminal), each production rule replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. Hence, the number of symbols produced after n steps would be 2^n - 1, because each step doubles the number of non-terminals, but starts from one. Wait, no: S is a single non-terminal, which on the first application of a rule produces two non-terminals (if that's the case), then each of those can be expanded further.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps it's better to see how the given string can be parsed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's helpful to use an approach where I parse the string step by step, keeping track of the NTs involved.\n\nBut perhaps I'll need to go back and check if 't50' can be produced by any NT.

{"custom_id":"request-220","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has a bunch of productions, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems like it's in CNF because each production either has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. So that's a good start.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t10 t5 t24 t51 t66 t80 t76 t41 t46 t78 t66 t76 t43 t4 t71 t69 t84 t41 t12`. Each of these is a terminal symbol, and the question is whether they can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, according to the given production, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So, the derivation must start with NT0 and NT1. That means the string must start with the first step expansion of NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at NT0, there are multiple productions. It can produce NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, or directly terminals. Similarly, NT1 has NT9 NT5 or directly some terminals.\n\nI should map the string step by step. Let's break down the string:\n\nt10, t5, t24, t51, t66, t80, t76, t41, t46, t78, t66, t76, t43, t4, t71, t69, t84, t41, t12.\n\nSo, perhaps the first two symbols are t10 and t5. But let's see: S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the first production of NT0 is t10, and the first production of NT1 is t5. That would make the first two symbols t10 and t5, which matches the start.\n\nSo after the first step, NT0 is t10, and NT1 is t5. So the string so far is t10 t5.\n\nNow, let's move to the next steps. After the first expansion, each non-terminal will need to be further expanded. So, maybe I should model the parsing process, using a top-down approach, but perhaps it's easier to work from the string and see if each token can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to build a parse tree for the string to see if it's possible.\n\nBut stepping back, each production either consumes a terminal or combines two non-terminals. So each step in the grammar uses two symbols to produce a new symbol if both are non-terminals, or a single terminal if one of them is a terminal.\n\nWait, in CNF, the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal, so to reduce the string step by step, each production replaces two non-terminals with one (the case where both were non-terminals), or a non-terminal with a terminal.\n\nSo for the string t10 t5 t24 t51..., perhaps we can model this as starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nSo the first step is NT0 \u2192 t10 and NT1 \u2192 t5, producing t10 t5, which matches the start of the string. Now, the remaining string is t24 t51 t66..., which needs to be derived from the next layer of the derivation tree.\n\nBut wait, in top-down parsing, we're expanding the start symbol until all symbols are generated. But in this case, maybe it's easier to work backwards, seeing if each part can be reduced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can split the string into the left and right parts each time, expanding NT0 and NT1 as needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree starting from the string.\n\nBut given the length of the string, it's going to be tedious. Maybe I can break the string into parts that correspond to the derivations of NT0 and NT1.\n\nWait, since the string starts with t10 t5, which corresponds to NT0 \u2192 t10 and NT1 \u2192 t5, but then after that, we have t24, which must come from some expansion of NT2 or NT0 or NT1.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT0 and NT1 have productions that involve other non-terminals. For example, NT0 can produce NT3 NT5, which are both non-terminals. Or it can produce directly some terminals. So for NT0 \u2192 t3 NT5, for example, t3 is a terminal, followed by NT5.\n\nSo perhaps the string can be divided into parts where each part corresponds to a specific non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, maybe the easiest way is to think about the string as a sequence of terminal symbols, and try to match them with the productions of the grammar. Starting from the left, the first two symbols are t10 and t5, which correspond to NT0 \u2192 t10 and NT1 \u2192 t5, but that's a problem because NT1 \u2192 t5 is only if t5 is a production of NT1.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check if NT1 can produce t5. Looking at NT1's productions: NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT5 or NT1 can produce directly various terminals, like 't12', 't13', 't17', etc. But from the given grammar, I don't see NT1 having a production that directly yields t5. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT5,\nNT1 -> 't12',\nNT1 -> 't13',\nNT1 -> 't17',\nNT1 -> 't18',\nNT1 -> 't19',\nNT1 -> 't27'\nWait, no, I don't see NT1 directly producing 't5'. So if NT1 can't produce t5, then the initial step t10 t5 would be a problem. Did I miss it?\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\nWait, let me list the NT1 productions:\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT5\n\nand then several others:\n\nNT1 -> 't12',\nNT1 -> 't13',\nNT1 -> 't17',\nNT1 -> 't18',\nNT1 -> 't19',\nNT1 -> 't27',\n\nHmm, so no 't5' production is listed for NT1. So NT1 cannot directly produce 't5', which is the second symbol in the string.\n\nThat suggests that the initial step t5 for NT1 is impossible because there's no production for NT1 \u2192 t5. Therefore, perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the productions. Let me make sure. The NT1 rules are:\n\nLooking back: I have\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT5\n\nand others like:\n\nNT1 -> 't12',\nNT1 -> 't13',\nNT1 -> 't17',\nNT1 -> 't18',\nNT1 -> 't19',\nNT1 -> 't27',\n\nWait, so 't5' is not listed as a production for NT1. That would mean that the second symbol can't be 't5' because NT1 can't produce 't5'. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that I'm not missing any productions. Looking again at the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n\n1. NT1 -> NT9 NT5\n2. NT1 -> 't12'\n3. NT1 -> 't13'\n4. NT1 -> 't17'\n5. NT1 -> 't18'\n6. NT1 -> 't19'\n7. NT1 -> 't27'\n\nNo, I don't see any production of NT1 yielding 't5'. So the second symbol being 't5' is impossible because NT1 can't directly produce that.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t10 (from NT0) and then t5 (from NT1), but since NT1 can't produce t5, this is impossible. Hence, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible that after the initial production S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the NT1 can produce more symbols. For example, maybe the second symbol t5 comes from some expansion.\n\nWait, but in top-down parsing, once we've expanded NT1 to t5 (a terminal), there's no way to get to another part of the grammar. Because if NT1 can only produce t5, it's done. Similarly, NT0 can only produce t10, then it's done. So the string must start with t10 t5, then both NT0 and NT1 can't produce anything else. But the actual string is longer than two symbols, so it's impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string is longer than the initial expansion. So perhaps the two NTs would produce more symbols each. For example, if NT0 is expanded beyond t10, perhaps via another production.\n\nLooking at NT0"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a restriction where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and the start symbol must be a non-terminal that can produce terminals. Oh, and there's also another condition that the start symbol cannot be on the right-hand side of a production. But looking at the given grammar, it seems each production has two non-terminals on the right, except maybe some with a mix. Wait, actually, the start symbol appears to be 'S', which is a non-terminal, and that's on the left. So that's okay.\n\nThe string given is: `t73 t79 t73 t71 t66 t73 t71 t66 t76 t10 t76 t76 t46 t36 t11 t76 t43 t36 t69 t54`.\n\nI need to see if this string is in the language defined by the grammar. So, I think the way to approach this is to try to parse the string using the given grammar rules.\n\nSince this is CNF, each production is either S \u2192 NT0 NT1 or something similar, all of which are left-hand sides, followed by two non-terminals on the right. Each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals until we get all terminals.\n\nBut since the given grammar has a lot of productions, maybe I can figure out the structure or look for patterns in the string that correspond to possible parse trees.\n\nAlternatively, I can also check if the string can be generated by the grammar by traversing the rules and seeing if each part of the string can be matched. Let me see.\n\nFirst, the string starts with multiple 't73's. Let's look at which productions produce 't73'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, 't73' appears in NT0 \u2192 't73' or NT0 \u2192 't73'. Wait, no, in NT3 \u2192 't73'? Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through all NT3's: NT0 \u2192 't73' is not in NT3. Wait, let me check again. No, in the provided grammar, under NT3, the productions are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't43' and NT3 \u2192 't2', etc. Wait, I might have missed that. Wait, let me list all NT3 entries:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT3: NT3 \u2192 't43' and NT3 \u2192 't2' among others. So 't73' isn't in NT3. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, under NT3's, they have NT3 \u2192 't43', 't2', 't47', 't43', so no 't73'. Then where is 't73' coming from? Looking back at the grammar, the string has 't73' appearing a few times.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT5 \u2192 't68' is not helpful. Wait, in NT9, some productions have 't66', 't68', etc. Wait, let me check: The provided grammar has rules like NT9 \u2192 't66', but I also see that NT3 has 't73' or 't47' or 't43', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the string's 't73's come from a rule that has 't73' in it. But looking through the grammar, I don't see 't73' on the right-hand side of any production. Let me check all the production rules.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n\nNT9 \u2192 't68' (so that's a terminal)\n\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't64'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't51'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't64'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't69'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't73' \u2014 Wait, no, I don't see that. Let me scan again:\n\nWait, under NT0: I see 't36', 't4', 't47', 't51', 't64', 't69', 't73', 't78', etc.\n\nAh, here it is: NT0 \u2192 't73' is one of the productions. So 't73' is a production of NT0.\n\nSimilarly, 't79'\u2014does NT0 produce 't79'? Looking through NT0's productions, I don't see 't79' as a terminal. So how does 't79' appear in the string? Maybe 't79' is part of another non-terminal's production.\n\nLet me check NT1's productions: Under NT1, there's 't12', 't51', 't80', etc. Hmm.\n\nLooking for 't79', I think it's possible that 't79' is produced by a different non-terminal. But I need to see if it exists in the grammar. Let me look through the rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the rules for NT1: NT1 \u2192 't12', so that's one terminal. Other productions of NT1: NT1 \u2192 't51', NT1 \u2192 't80', 't46', 't36', 't82', etc. I don't see 't79' being generated by any production.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If 't79' is in the string but the grammar doesn't have a production that results in 't79', then the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check all the productions to ensure I didn't overlook a terminal 't79'.\n\nLooking through each non-terminal's rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1 \u2014 so 't73' as a substring of 't73 t79 t73 t71 t66...' would be allowed as NT0's substring.\n\nBut then where do 't79' come from? Let's check NT0's rules again:\n\nLooking through NT0's productions: yes, NT0 \u2192 't73' and other options like 't10', 't12', 't4', 't47', 't51', 't64', 't69', 't73' as I noted. So 't79' isn't in NT0's productions.\n\nHmm, perhaps 't79' comes from NT9 or some other non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions: NT9 \u2192 't68' as a terminal, and other productions involving NT1 and NT5. Wait, I don't see 't79' in NT9's rules.\n\nHow about NT5? NT5 \u2192 't11', 't55', 't68', etc. Not 't79'. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 various terminals like 't2', 't43', 't47', etc. Not 't79'. So looking at all possible non-terminals and their terminals, none of them produce 't79'.\n\nTherefore, since the string contains 't79' but there's no production in the grammar that generates 't79' as a terminal symbol, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Thus, the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Did I perhaps misread the grammar or the string?

{"custom_id":"request-233","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if a certain string is generated by this grammar. The string to evaluate is: `t2 t36 t0 t73 t46 t73 t36 t78 t84 t8 t78 t74 t58 t0 t41 t44 t58 t52 t40 t54`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF for context-free grammars specifies certain conditions: each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's in CNF because all the production rules are either terminal productions (like NT9 -> 't68') or have two non-terminals on the right side (like S -> NT0 NT1, NT0 -> NT3 NT5, etc.). \n\nThe string in question has multiple 't' tokens concatenated, like 't2', 't36', etc. My first thought is that each 't' corresponds to a terminal symbol, and the non-terminals correspond to the variables on the left side of the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every derivation starts from the start symbol S and each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal. The process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nTo see if the string can be generated, I'll need to construct a parse tree from the start symbol S to derive the string. Alternatively, maybe I can work backwards, checking if the string can be split into substrings that correspond to each production.\n\nBut manually parsing the string would be time-consuming, especially with 20 tokens. Perhaps it's better to see if the structure of the string matches the possible combinations of the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be generated by the given grammar by trying to match it step by step. Since the string is a sequence of terms, each separated by spaces, I'll consider each token as a part of the parse.\n\nLet me start by identifying the steps. The grammar starts with S -> NT0 NT1. So the initial two symbols should be the results of NT0 and NT1.\n\nLet me look at the string:\n\nt2 t36 t0 t73 t46 t73 t36 t78 t84 t8 t78 t74 t58 t0 t41 t44 t58 t52 t40 t54\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: t2 and t36. I need to see if there's a production that can generate t2 and t36 for NT0 and NT1, respectively.\n\nLooking at the NT0 productions:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> NT47 (Wait, in the given grammar, some NT entries might have typos, like NT9 -> 't64' but in the user's grammar, it's written as NT9 -> 't64', which would be a problem. But I notice that in the provided grammar, some entries like NT0 might have multiple options.\n\nWait, looking more carefully: the initial grammar might have some inconsistencies. For example, NT0 is supposed to have multiple production rules. Let me list them:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT4 (Wait, but NT0->NT4 would require NT4 to produce something, which in the given grammar does produce a terminal, like NT4 \u2192 t54.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT4 has a production: NT4 \u2192 t54, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, if NT0 \u2192 NT4, then NT4 can produce t54. So if the first token is t2, and the second is t36, perhaps NT0 is generating these two tokens via some production.\n\nBut looking at the first two tokens: t2 is the first and t36 is the second. So NT0 is producing t2 and NT1 is producing t36. Let me check what NT1 can produce.\n\nIn the grammar, NT1 has the rule NT1 \u2192 't12', but also NT1 \u2192 't12'. Wait, actually, looking back, it seems that NT1 has a production: NT1 \u2192 't12'. So if the second token is t36, maybe that's not possible since NT1 only produces t12. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nSo that means NT1 can only produce t12 as a terminal. Therefore, if the second token is t36, that can't be generated by NT1 unless something else is happening. So perhaps the initial assumption that S starts with NT0 and NT1 is incorrect, or maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first production is different.\n\nWait, looking again: the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nThat means the first symbol derived from S will be NT0, and the second symbol will be NT1. So in the string, the first two tokens must correspond to the productions of NT0 and NT1.\n\nGiven that, in the string, the first two tokens are t2 and t36.\n\nGiven that NT1 only produces t12, which is different from t36, so perhaps t36 is not from NT1. That suggests that perhaps the initial derivation isn't starting correctly, or perhaps I've made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nSo the entire string must start with NT0 and NT1, each producing a part.\n\nSo in the given string, the first two tokens should be the results of NT0 and NT1.\n\nBut NT1 can only produce t12. Therefore, t36 can't be generated by NT1.\n\nThat would imply that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the second token is t36, which can't be produced by NT1.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because maybe I'm missing some production.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, are there any rules that allow NT1 to produce t36?\n\nLooking back: The grammar has NT1 \u2192 NT5? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nNo, NT1 has only one production rule: NT1 \u2192 't12'. So it can't generate t36.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t2 and t36, which can't be generated by the grammar's starting productions. Thus, the string cannot be generated, so the answer is No.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Perhaps I've misread the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, do I see any rule where NT1 can produce something that might derive into t36?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows for some non-trivial derivations where NT1 can generate t36 through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, but looking at the productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12'\n\nThere's no way for NT1 to produce t36 directly. So unless there's a production for NT1 that somehow ends up producing t36, which isn't present, it can't happen.\n\nTherefore, the second token being t36 means that NT1 is generating that, which is impossible because it can only produce t12.\n\nTherefore, the entire string cannot be generated by this grammar, so the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar correctly. Let me make sure.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, especially the part where NT1 is defined.\n\nIn the provided grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nYes, only that.\n\nSo unless there's another rule I missed, NT1 can only produce t12, making the second token t36 impossible. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something regarding the way non-terminals can combine. Wait, but in this case, S's first production is NT0 followed by NT1, so the entire string must be a sequence of tokens generated by NT0 and NT1 in the first two steps. If S \u2192 NT0 NT1, then the string starts with what NT0 produces and then what NT1 produces.\n\nSince NT1 can't produce t36, the entire string is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the grammar, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means it has certain simplifying properties, like all productions being binary (A \u2192 BC) or terminals.

But wait, the string starts with t36, which is a terminal. Let me check if there's a production for NT0 that starts with t36.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT0:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (duplicate)\n- Also some others, but I think I listed all of them.

No, because in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are two non-terminals or terminal. So 't4' is a direct terminal, but in Chomsky, the productions are binary. So wait, in the given grammar, some NT0 productions are to a single terminal, but that can't be because in CNF, all productions must be binary. So perhaps the user made a mistake, or maybe I'm interpreting incorrectly. Wait, the user might have written the productions incorrectly.\n\nWait, looking closer:\n\nThe grammar entries are:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 t24\nWait, that's nt0 \u2192 t24, which is a terminal. But in CNF, all productions must have two non-terminals or one terminal. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Similarly, some other productions:\n\nFor example, NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1, which is acceptable.\n\nNT4 \u2192 't47' which is a terminal. Wait, but that's a single terminal, which is not allowed in CNF, because all productions must produce two symbols. So perhaps this is a mistake, and the user intended to have NT4 as a non-terminal that produces a terminal, but in CNF, that would require it to produce something else. Alternatively, maybe the user included some \u03b5 productions (empty strings), but that's not here.\n\nWait, the given grammar includes some productions where NTs go directly to terminals, which is not allowed in CNF. So perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the grammar to be in CNF, but in their entries, they're using '...' which might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the '\u2192' between NT0 and 't24' is a mistake. Let me double-check the user's grammar:\n\nLooking back, the user wrote:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't24'\n\nWhich suggests that NT0 can directly produce the terminal 't24', but that's not allowed in Chomsky Normal Form because all productions must be two non-terminals or a terminal, but in CNF, each production must have two symbols on the right, but allowing one symbol (terminal) is allowed? Wait, no. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are in the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So, if a production for a non-terminal is directly to a terminal, that would mean the grammar is not in CNF. Because in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions (except for the start symbol possibly) must have two non-terminals on the right.\n\nWait, that's a confusion. In CNF, all productions for non-terminals must consist of exactly two non-terminals, except for the epsilon (empty string) production, which is only allowed for the start symbol. But in this case, the grammar includes productions like S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which is two non-terminals, and NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, which is two non-terminals, etc. The only issue is that some non-terminals, like NT0, have a production that goes to a single terminal, such as NT0 \u2192 't24'. This would not be allowed in CNF because it's a single terminal, not a non-terminal. So perhaps this is a mistake, and the user intended to have NT0 produce other non-terminals, but some of them are terminating directly, which is against CNF.\n\nAssuming that this is a mistake and all productions for non-terminals must be two non-terminals, I'll proceed under that assumption, ignoring those direct terminal productions. Alternatively, I can proceed with what's given.\n\nBut this could complicate things, as some non-terminals might be forced to produce terminals, which might help in the string reduction.\n\nBut maybe I should proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the string is composed of two parts: what NT0 produces and what NT1 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t36, t63, t40, t68,... so maybe NT0 produces the first part and NT1 produces the second part.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\nIt can produce NT3 NT5 or NT9 NT4. Looking at the possible leftmost symbols, the string starts with t36, which is a possible product of either NT3 or NT9, depending on which production is followed.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t36, which is a terminal. So, we need a production that allows NT3 or NT9 to produce a string that starts with t36.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2' | 't47.'\n\nWait, 't2' is not present in the string, so possibly that's irrelevant. 't47' is also in the string. But in the given string, the first token is t36, not t47.

(a lot of others, but let's check the list)\n\nLooking through the NT9 productions, I see that one of them is NT9 \u2192 't36'. Yes, in the grammar, NT9 is one of the non-terminals that can directly produce the terminal 't36'.\n\nSo if NT9 \u2192 't36', that would take care of the first symbol in the string. That's promising.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t36, which could be produced by NT9.\n\nSo, let me tentatively assign:\n\nNT0 \u2192 X, which produces t36, then NT1 \u2192 Y, which continues the string.\n\nWait, but let me check that.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two terminals on the right, except for the start symbol. \n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) for a context-free grammar has all productions in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, each rule on the left of the arrow (like S, NT9, NT0, etc.) seems to produce two non-terminals or one terminal. That confirms it's in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate consists of a sequence of terminals, each a token. To check if the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a parse tree that starts with the start symbol S and ends with this string, using the given productions.\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the parse tree must start with S having two children: NT0 and NT1.\n\nNow, breaking down the string, I'll split it into the sequence of tokens: t80, t76, t47, t46, t17, t68, t79, t50, t66, t10, t44, t44, t41, t13, t12, t2, t8, t64, t68, t41, t66.\n\nEach token must be derived from the grammar. Let me think about how these terminals are produced.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can categorize each terminal and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLet's list each terminal and see where they appear on the right-hand side of the productions:\n\n- t2 appears in NT3 \u2192 t2\n- t47 appears in NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 and others\n- t51 appears in NT1 \u2192 't51'\n- t4 \u2192 NT3 \u2192 't4'\n- t54 \u2192 NT3 \u2192 't54'\n- t64 \u2192 NT0 \u2192 't64' and others\n- t76 \u2192 NT0 \u2192 't76'\n- t80 in the string: looking at the productions, t80 is produced by NT1 \u2192 't80'\n- t17 from NT4 \u2192 't17'\n- t68 \u2192 NT0 \u2192 't68' and NT1 \u2192 't68'\n- t79 from NT0 \u2192 't79'\n- t50 appears in NT3 \u2192 't50' and in NT5 \u2192 't50'\n- t44 from NT5 \u2192 't44'\n- t41 from NT9 \u2192 't41'\n- t13 from NT5 \u2192 't13'\n- t12 from NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- t2 from NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- t8 from NT4 \u2192 't8'\n- t64 from NT0 \u2192 't64' and others\n- t68 as above\n- t41 again\n- t66 from NT0 \u2192 't66'\n\nSo each terminal in the string should correspond to one of the rules. Now, let's see how these can be assembled.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So NT0 and NT1 are the two main branches.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t80 and t76. Let's see which rules produce these.\n\nt80 is in NT1's productions (NT1 \u2192 't80'), so the right-hand side of NT1 can be 't80'.\n\nt76 is in NT0's productions (NT0 \u2192 't76'), so NT0 can be 't76'.\n\nSo, S produces t76 t80, which matches the first two tokens. So far, so good.\n\nNext, after t76 and t80, the third token is t47. Now, in the first branch, NT0, which is producing the current token sequence. Since NT0 produces two symbols, we need to see how t47 fits into that. Looking at the productions, NT0 can be NT3 NT5 or NT9 NT4 or some other combination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break it down step by step.\n\nWait, starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nFor the string, after t76 (NT0) and t80 (NT1), the next token is t47. This t47 must come from somewhere. Since the first part, NT0, after t76, the next must be derived from NT0's production. Let me see: NT0 can be t9 (which is NT9) and t5, which are NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, NT0 is defined as multiple options, one of which is NT0 \u2192 't76'. But maybe in the middle of the parsing, the NT0 would need to be expanded more.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAfter t76 (NT0) and t80 (NT1), next is t47. Since t80 is direct, but looking further, after t80, the next token is t76. Wait, no, the full string is:\n\nt80 t76 t47 t46 t17 t68 t79 t50 t66 t10 t44 t44 t41 t13 t12 t2 t8 t64 t68 t41 t66\n\nWait, that's 20 tokens. After t76 comes t47. So the first tokens are t80 (NT1), then t76 (NT0's t76), then t47. Hmm, but that's confusing because in S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the order is NT0 first, then NT1.\n\nWait, but the string is t80 (which is NT1's production) followed by t76 (which is NT0's production). So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So NT0 is the leftmost symbol, followed by NT1. So the parse should start with NT0 and then NT1. Therefore, the first token should be derived from NT0, followed by the first token from NT1, then the second token from NT0, etc.\n\nSo, in the string, the initial tokens should be from NT0 and NT1 in order. But in the given string, the first token is t80, which comes from NT1's production. That would suggest that NT1 is producing t80 as the first token, so the NT0 must produce the first token, which is t76. Thus, the string would be t76 (from NT0) followed by t80 (from NT1). But in the actual string, it's t80 (from NT1) followed by t76 (from NT0). That's the opposite. So that would mean that either the parse tree is not correctly aligned, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the parse tree as the starting symbol S is producing NT0 followed by NT1. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT0 and the expansion of NT1. So, for example, NT0's expansion would produce a sequence of tokens, followed by NT1's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t80, which, given that the starting point is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the t80 must come from NT1's expansion. So the first token is from NT1, then the next from NT0, then NT1 again, etc.\n\nWait, that can't be, because S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the first expansion is NT0, then NT1. So the first token must be from NT0's expansion.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's try to represent the string as two parts: the first part from NT0 and the second from NT1, concatenated together.\n\nSo, string = part1 (NT0's expansion) + part2 (NT1's expansion).\n\nIf that's the case, then the first tokens should belong to NT0, the next to NT1, etc. So, let's split the string in two parts: part1 is the NT0 expansion, part2 is the NT1 expansion.\n\nBut how to split them? Each NT can produce one or more terminals and other non-terminals. So perhaps I need to see which part of the string can be explained by NT0 and NT1.\n\nLet me approach it step by step.\n\nGiven S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nThe string is t80 (NT1's t80) followed by t7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-254","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string \"t68 t51 t17 t43 t67 t69 t66 t54 t42 t41 t55 t69 t58 t8 t64 t12 t84 t2 t52 t68 t17 t24\" is generated by this grammar. That's a long string with 21 tokens, so I'll need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) means. It's a set of rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. All productions have two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. The start symbol S can produce the other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which means the entire string must start with NT0 and NT1. Then, each NT (like NT0, NT1, etc.) can expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me try to map the string into the grammar step by step. The string starts with \"t68 t51\". Since S expands to NT0 NT1, I think NT0 and NT1 process the first parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the NT1 rules, I see several productions: NT1 \u2192 't12', 't17', 't43', 't67', etc. In the string, the second token is \"t51\". Wait, t51 isn't one of NT1's direct terminals. Let me check NT1's rules again: NT1 -> 't12', 't17', 't43', 't67', 't51' at production 34. Oh, yes, 't51' is an option. So NT1 could produce 't51', which would take care of the second token.\n\nSo the second part is taken care of by NT1 \u2192 t51. That leaves the first token as \"t68.\" Let's look at NT0's productions. NT0 has several options, including 't64', 't68', 't4', etc. The first token is \"t68\", which matches NT0 \u2192 t68. So the first part is NT0 \u2192 t68.\n\nNow the string continues with \"t17\", which must come from NT0. Let's check NT0's rules. Wait, NT0 starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the two NTs are used up the first two tokens. Now, the third token is \"t17\". Looking at NT0's rules, does it have t17? I don't see a rule like NT0 \u2192 t17, but NT0 can expand into other non-terminals. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (repeated)\n- etc., various other rules, but none directly produce 't17'.\n\nWait, maybe it's through expansion. For example, NT0 can go to NT9 NT4, then NT9 can go to 't68' (as one of its rules), and NT4 could go to 't47' or 't8', etc. But in this case, after NT0 \u2192 t68, the third token is \"t17\", which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the string is \"t68 t51 t17 t43 t67...\". So after S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which produces \"t68 t51\", the next is \"t17\" for NT0, which hasn't happened yet. Maybe I misunderstood the first part.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which expands to \"t68 t51\". So the third token is from NT0 expanding further. Let's see: NT0 \u2192 possible rules include NT3 NT5, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, etc.\n\nIf NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, then these non-terminals will produce the next tokens. Let's see: the third token is \"t17\". Let's look at NT3's productions. NT3 has several rules like 't2', 't47', etc. So if NT3 is \"t17\", but none of its rules produce 't17' directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps NT0 can expand into something else that can produce 't17'. For example, does any non-terminal directly produce 't17'? Looking at the productions, NT1 has a rule for 't17' ( production 15: NT1 -> 't17'). But NT1 would be generated by NT0 in the first step. Wait, but the third token is \"t17\", which would need to come from an NT that's part of the expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the second token again. The second token is \"t51\", which is from NT1 \u2192 t51. That's fine. So after NT1 is done, the first half of the string is \"t68 t51\".\n\nThen, the next token is \"t17\", which would need to come from NT0. So what rules does NT0 have? Let me check all NT0 productions:\n\n1. NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n2. NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n3. NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n4. NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4\nWait, wait no: looking back at the given grammar, the rules for NT0 are:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5 (line 3)\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4 (line 5)\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4 (line 6, same as 5)\nNT0 -> NT5 NT4 (line 7)\nThen again (line 11)\nThen NT0 -> 't79' (line 13?

The string is \"t13 t69 t68 t42 t58 t68 t76 t55 t55 t4 t74 t50 t8 t4 t11 t74 t69 t58 t13 t46 t41 t69\". \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar to understand how the non-terminals expand into terminals. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. So the string must start with something that comes from NT0 and NT1.\n\nLet me see the terminals each non-terminal can produce. For example, NT0 can produce 't10', 't4', 't9', 't24', etc. Similarly, NT1 produces 't12', 't67', 't51', and more. So the first two tokens are 't13' and 't69', but looking at the NT0 and NT1 terminals, both can produce 't13'? Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at NT1 productions: I don't see 't13' directly as a terminal, but wait\u2014NT1 has a production NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT5. Let's see what NT9 and NT5 produce. NT9 can produce 't68', 't51', 't36', etc. NT5 produces 't11', 't17', etc. Hmm, maybe not directly. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. In CNF, the non-terminals are on the left, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the given string is a sequence of terminals, so each token must come from a terminal production directly from a non-terminal or a non-terminal must expand into multiple tokens that eventually produce the terminals.\n\nSo for S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the first two symbols in the string must be from NT0 and NT1 somehow expanding into these terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step, seeing if it can be derived from S.\n\nBut parsing in CNF for an arbitrary string can be tricky. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into the non-terminals as per the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for a way to factor the string into the possible non-terminals and see if each step can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a list of terminals, perhaps I can check if each of them can be generated by some non-terminal, and whether the structure of the string allows for the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t13 t69 t68 t42 t58 t68 t76 t55 t55 t4 t74 t50 t8 t4 t11 t74 t69 t58 t13 t46 t41 t69.\n\nLet me count the tokens: 21 in total.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the first token must be generated by NT0, and the second by NT1, but wait, S \u2192 NT0 NT1 is two non-terminals, so in the string, the first two tokens should come from NT0 and NT1 somehow.\n\nWait, no. Actually, S \u2192 NT0 NT1 means that S can expand into NT0 followed by NT1. Each of these non-terminals can produce multiple terminals, so the entire string is the concatenation of the two parts generated by NT0 and NT1.\n\nSo the first part, generated by NT0, should be some sequence of terminals, and the second part by NT1. But how can NT0 and NT1 produce these sequences?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be split into two parts, one derived by NT0 and the other by NT1. Let's see.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's symmetric at the end? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built by recursively applying the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the string can be obtained by starting from S and expanding it step by step, matching the string.\n\nBut that might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the possible productions of each non-terminal and see if they can generate the token in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each token in the string can be derived from some non-terminal, and see if the sequence makes sense.\n\nLet me start from the beginning: 't13' is the first token. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't13'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT1 can't directly produce 't13'. Let's check NT3: yes, NT3 has 't13' as a terminal? Let me check the productions for NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't4', 't47', etc., but I don't see 't13' in NT3's productions. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, NT3 has several productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2', 't47', NT0, NT5, etc. Wait, NT3 can produce 't2', 't47', 't43', etc., but 't13' is not one of the terminals for NT3.\n\nWait, perhaps NT1 can derive 't13' through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at NT1:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nThen, NT9 could expand into 't68', 't51', 't36', etc. NT5 expands into 't11', 't17', etc. Neither of these directly give 't13'. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps NT9 can expand into other non-terminals that can produce 't13'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step is a single production, so each symbol is derived directly from a non-terminal.\n\nSo 't13' must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't13' directly or indirectly.\n\nLooking again, do any non-terminals produce 't13' directly?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT1: does NT1 produce 't13'? Let's see. No, NT1's productions are 't12', 't51', 't67', 't79', etc., but not 't13'.\n\n- NT3: does NT3 produce 't13'? Looking at NT3's rules: it can produce 't43', 't4', 't47', etc., but not 't13'.\n\n- Any other NT that can produce 't13'?\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, NT9's production includes 't68', 't51', etc., but not 't13'.\n\nHmm, perhaps 't13' is not directly generated by any non-terminal, which would imply that the string cannot be generated by the grammar. But wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. For example, NT5 can produce 't17', which can derive further non-terminals?\n\nWait, looking again, NT5 has these productions:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't54', 't11', 't80', 't13', etc. Oh! Wait, looking back, under NT5:\n\nThere's NT5 -> 't13'. Yes, in the list:\n\nNT5 -> 't13'\n\nYes! So NT5 can directly produce 't13'. Similarly, NT1 can produce 't13'? Wait, no, looking at the list:\n\nNT1's productions are 't12', 't51', 't67', 't79', 't74', 't8', 't41', etc., but does it have a production that leads to 't13'? No. But wait, NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT5. So if NT5 can produce 't13', then perhaps NT1 can produce 't13' indirectly? No, wait: NT1's production is NT9 and NT5. So the left-hand side is A \u2192 B C, so NT1 expands into B C. So in this case, NT1 expands into NT9 followed by NT5. Since NT5 can produce 't13', then the string 't13' can come from NT5, but what about NT1? Well, no, because NT1's expansion is NT9 and NT5, so unless NT9 can produce some terminal that, when combined with 't13', can form a part of the string, but this might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't13' is generated by NT5, so in the string, every 't13' must come from NT5.\n\nSo looking at the string, the token 't13' appears at the beginning and at the end. Let's count the 't13's: positions 1, 19. So two 't13's.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT0 NT1,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-261","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly two symbols on the right. This should make parsing or checking the string manageable.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. So, the string should start with symbols derived from NT0 and NT1. Let me parse the string into segments that should match the rules.\n\nThe string is: t24 t10 t40 t47 t41 t8 t58 t11 t82 t44 t11 t68 t63 t40 t51 t68 t17 t82 t2 t78 t51 t47 t74.\n\nI'll split this into individual tokens for easier analysis: t24, t10, t40, t47, t41, t8, t58, t11, t82, t44, t11, t68, t63, t40, t51, t68, t17, t82, t2, t78, t51, t47, t74.\n\nSince the start symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the first two tokens should be derived from NT0 and NT1, respectively.\n\nLet's start building from the start:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT0 NT1\n   So, first token should come from NT0, second from NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t24. Let's see which rule produces t24.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT0: There's NT0 \u2192 t24. So, that's direct.\n\nNow, the second token must come from NT1. The next token is t10. Let's see NT1 rules: NT1 \u2192 t12, or others. Wait, the rules for NT1 are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t12\n- nt1 -> t36 (Is this correct? Wait, in the given grammar, it's NT1 \u2192 't12'. Then, in the rules, after that, I see NT1 -> t36, but no, let me check.\n\nWait, no, the NT1 rules are:\n\nNT1 -> t12\nBut looking again, no, because in the grammar, it's:\n\nNT0 -> t2\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, the grammar rules as given are:\n\nNT0 can go to various things, including 't2' (NT0 \u2192 't2'). But looking at the rules, for example:\n\nLooking at NT0, rules include:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't2' (once)\n- NT0 \u2192 't47'\n- NT0 \u2192 't64'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't73'\n- NT0 \u2192 't24'\n- And others.\n\nWait, yes, so NT0 can directly go to 't24', which matches the first token in the string.\n\nSo the first part is satisfied: the first token t24 comes from NT0.\n\nNow, the next token is t10, which must come from NT1. Let's see what NT1 can do.\n\nLooking at NT1 rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t12\nBut the string has t10 as the third token, so perhaps I made a mistake because the second token should come from NT1, which is t10.\n\nWait, wait a minute. The string is:\n\nt24 (NT0), t10 (NT1), t40 (NT0), t47 (NT1), etc. Wait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, the start is NT0 NT1, so after S, the first two symbols should be the results of NT0 and NT1.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t24, which is from NT0, as I thought. Then the second token must be from NT1. So the second token is t10. Let's check if NT1 can produce t10.\n\nLooking at the grammar, do any NT1 rules produce t10? I don't see any rule where NT1 directly goes to t10.\n\nWait, the NT1 rules are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n\nBut that's it. So that suggests that the next token after t24 should be 't12', but the given string has 't10' as the second token, which is problematic.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck: Maybe the string's second token is supposed to come from NT1, which should yield 't10'. But in the grammar, there's no production for NT1 \u2192 t10. The closest is NT0 \u2192 't10'? No, wait.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for NT0, one of the rules is NT0 \u2192 't10' (check the rules):\n\nLooking at the grammar: \n\nYes, one of the rules is NT0 \u2192 't10'.\n\nBut since S starts as NT0 NT1, the first symbol comes from NT0, the second from NT1.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT1 is supposed to generate t12 directly. So the second token should be t12, but in the string it's t10, which suggests it's generated by NT0. That's impossible because the second token must come from NT1.\n\nThis seems to be an immediate contradiction, meaning that either the string is invalid or I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the string is structured as (t24 t10) (t40 t47) etc. But that can't be the case because S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the first two tokens are NT0 and NT1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the expansions of NT0 and NT1, but for each non-terminal in the productions of S, they're expanded simultaneously, leading to interleaving of the symbols.\n\nWait, but in standard parsing, the expansion of NT0 and NT1 occurs in parallel, so the tokens from NT0 and NT1 are interleaved.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this using the grammar's structure and try to derive the string step by step.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the string must be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT0 and NT1.\n\nSo the overall string is [String from NT0] [String from NT1].\n\nBut given the given string, let me split it into two parts. It's possible that the entire string is a single unit, but perhaps I need to see if the entire string can be generated by S.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to represent the string as a sequence of symbols and see if it can be split into two parts where the first part is generated by NT0 and the second by NT1.\n\nBut the given string seems quite long, so this might be time-consuming. Maybe a better way is to model each symbol's origin as coming from either NT0 or NT1, ensuring that the entire string is the concatenation of a NT0-derived string and a NT1-derived string.\n\nBut wait, S \u2192 NT0 NT1 means that after S expands, the resulting string is the concatenation of NT0's expansion and NT1's expansion.\n\nSo the entire string must be equal to String_0 + String_1, where String_0 is generated by NT0 and String_1 is generated by NT1.\n\nLooking at the given string: It's 23 tokens long, which is an odd number. So String_0 and String_1 can't both be non-empty unless one is empty, but that's not possible here. Wait, no: 2+23 would be 25; perhaps I'm missing where the split is.\n\nWait, actually, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, each NT can generate zero or more symbols, but in CNF, each production must have two symbols on the right, so they must each generate at least one symbol. Or is it possible for NT0 and NT1 to produce nothing? No, because all productions in CNF have exactly two symbols on the right, but they can also lead to a terminal. Wait, no, if the production is two symbols, and both could be terminals. So, NT0 could generate t24 directly, and NT1 could generate t10 directly, but that's for the case where S \u2192 t24 t10, which would mean the entire string is 't24 t10'. But in the given string, it's much longer, so I think maybe each NT's production has to result in a string that, when combined, forms the given string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me take a different approach: Try to parse the string as if it's being generated by NT0 and NT1.\n\nFirst, the entire string must be the expansion of NT0 followed by NT1.\n\nLet me represent the string as:\n\nt24 t10 t40 t47 t41 t8 t58 t11 t82 t44 t11 t68 t63 t40 t51 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each of these NT's can expand into other NT's or terminals.\n\nI should process the string step by step and try to find a derivation path that matches it.

Let's check.\n\nLooking at NT1's rules: NT1 -> 't12', 't10', 't42', 't46', 't51', 't67', 't71', 't80', 't55', 't82', 't73', 't36', 't67', 't58', 't84', etc. Wait, let me list all NT1 productions:\n\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT1 -> 't10'\n- NT1 -> 't42'\n- NT1 -> 't46'\n- NT1 -> 't51'\n- NT1 -> 't67'\n- NT1 -> 't71'\n- NT1 -> 't80'\n- NT1 -> 't55'\n- NT1 -> 't82'\n- NT1 -> 't73'\n- NT1 -> 't36'\n- NT1 -> 't67'\n- NT1 -> 't58'\n- NT1 -> 't84'\n\nSo, the first token is t36. Let's assume NT1 expands to t36. That would consume the t36 at the beginning and leave the rest of the string as t36 t41 t46 t47 t47 t84 t55 t82 t84 t54 t10 t55 t82 t12 t71 t67 t71 t66 t64 t24 t10 t13.\n\nWait, no. If S is NT0 NT1, then the string starts with NT0's expansion and then NT1's expansion. So if the string starts with t36, maybe NT0 is t36. But NT1's expansion starts with t36 as well. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nWait, let's clarify: The entire string is produced by NT0 followed by NT1. So, for example, NT0 could produce a certain part, and NT1 could produce another, and together they form the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first t36 could come from NT0. So, NT0 -> t36, which is a production. Then, NT1 must expand into the rest of the string. But wait, let's check: The rest of the string after the first t36 is t36 t41 t46 t47 t47 t84 t55 t82 t84 t54 t10 t55 t82 t12 t71 t67 t71 t66 t64 t24 t10 t13.\n\nNow, NT1 can generate t36, but that seems like it would require a very long chain, and I'm not sure if that's feasible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the initial expansion is S -> NT0 NT1, but NT0 is a longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for sequences of terminals that can be produced by NT0 and NT1 in some combination.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Let's start from the beginning.\n\n1. S expands to NT0 NT1. So, the string starts with NT0 followed by NT1.\n\nThe first symbol is t36. Let's see if t36 is generated by NT0. Yes, NT0 can be t36. So, NT0 -> t36, consuming the first token.\n\nNow, the remaining string is t36 t41 t46 t47 t47 t84 t55 t82 t84 t54 t10 t55 t82 t12 t71 t67 t71 t66 t64 t24 t10 t13.\n\nBut wait, that's 20 tokens, but after the first t36, the remaining string is 20 tokens? Let me count: The original string has 22 tokens, so after consuming the first t36, there are 21 left, but according to the given string, it's 21 tokens. Wait, the string starts with t36 t36..., which is 22 tokens. So after the first t36, 21 left.\n\nBut this approach might not be leading me anywhere. Maybe I should try another angle. Perhaps look at the string and see if it can be broken down into parts that fit the grammar.\n\nAnother idea is to look for possible expansions of NT0 and NT1. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules, some of them produce t symbols. For example, NT0 can be 't36', 't4', 't10', etc., depending on the rules. Similarly, NT1 has multiple t options.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to work backwards. Let's check if the given string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's see if the given string starts with t36 twice. Hmm, no, the string starts with t36 t36 t41, but let me check: Wait, the string is t36 t36 t41 t46 t47 t47 t84 t55 t82 t84 t54 t10 t55 t82 t12 t71 t67 t71 t66 t64 t24 t10 t13. So after the first two t36s, we have t41, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if the entire string is a concatenation of two parts, each generated by NT0 and NT1.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts and see if each part can be generated by NT0 and NT1.\n\nBut I don't know where to split. Alternatively, maybe NT0 and NT1 can each generate multiple t tokens in a sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see by looking at the production rules and the string.\n\nLet me consider each occurrence of t in the string and see if they can be obtained by the given NT's.\n\nAnother approach: Try to see if the string can be split into parts where NT0 generates a substring and NT1 generates the rest.\n\nBut this is complicated. Maybe I can model it as a parsing process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of t's and see if they match the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each rule either produces two NTs or a terminal.\n\nLet me see the structure of the grammar:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\nNT0 -> multiple NTs or terminals\nNT1 -> multiple NTs or terminals\n\nEach NT can be a combination, so each step in the expansion could produce more non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut to process the given string, I might need a recursive descent parser or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build an abstract syntax tree or some kind of structure.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see if the given string can be paired correctly.\n\nWait, let me look for the first few tokens and see if they can be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That helps because it simplifies the process, and we can apply the CYK algorithm or check derivations step by step.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t2 t67 t8 t2 t41 t2 t41 t46 t84 t13 t4 t82 t42 t46 t80 t46 t36 t46 t52 t50 t71 t46 t2`.\n\nThat's quite long, but let's see if we can find a way to parse it.

So the start is NT0 NT1. Each of these can be non-terminals that can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't4 t2...', so perhaps I should look if 't4' can be derived from NT0 or NT1.\n\nFrom NT0, the productions are:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n\nSimilarly, NT1's productions:\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT1 \u2192 't67'\n- NT1 \u2192 't46'\n- NT1 \u2192 't80'\n- NT1 \u2192 't80'\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT5?

Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think I might have misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are as provided. Let me make sure: NT1's productions are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT1 \u2192 't67'\n- NT1 \u2192 't46'\n- NT1 \u2192 't80'\n- NT1 appears later again: NT1 \u2192 't12', 't67', 't46', 't80' again.\n\nWait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nHere's the grammar again:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\nNT9 -> 't68'\nNT0 -> 't4'\n... and so on.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, looking at each rule. So NT1 has these productions: 't12', 't67', 't46', 't80'.\n\nSo possible terminals for NT1 are t12, t67, t46, t80. So in the string, starting with t4, which comes from NT0.\n\nLet me try to find the possible way to generate this string.\n\nThe string is: t4 t2 t67 t8 t2 t41 t2 t41 t46 t84 t13 t4 t82 t42 t46 t80 t46 t36 t46 t52 t50 t71 t46 t2.\n\nThat's 23 tokens. Let's split them into individual terminals.\n\nSo, the first token is 't4'. Looking at NT0, it can produce 't4' (from NT0 \u2192 't4'), so that's possible. So NT0 \u2192 't4'.\n\nThen comes 't2'. Looking at NT0, the other production for NT0 is NT3 NT5. So from NT0, we go to NT3 NT5.\n\nSo the first part: 't4' comes from NT0, and then the next part will be 't2' from NT3 or NT5 or combining via production rule.\n\nLooking at NT3, the productions are 't2' and 't47'. So NT3 can produce 't2' directly, which is the next token.\n\nSo at this point, the string is 't4 t2', which is NT0 \u2192 't4', then NT0 \u2192 NT3, which produces 't2'.\n\nThen the next token is 't67'. Looking at NT0's production: after NT3, it's NT3 NT5. So perhaps NT5 should produce 't67'.\n\nLooking at NT5's productions:\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT5 \u2192 't51'\n- NT5 \u2192 't74'\n- NT5 \u2192 't17'\n- NT5 \u2192 't55'\n- NT5 \u2192 't76'\n- NT5 \u2192 't8'\n- etc. So can any of these produce 't67'? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see NT5 \u2192 't67' as a production. Wait, checking the grammar again.\n\nLooking for NT5, the productions are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT5 \u2192 't51'\n- NT5 \u2192 't74'\n- NT5 \u2192 't17'\n- NT5 \u2192 't55'\n- NT5 \u2192 't76'\n- NT5 \u2192 't8'\nWait, no, I don't see 't67' as a terminal production from NT5. So does 't67' come from another rule?\n\nLooking at the string, after 't67' comes 't8', which would be NT0 producing 't4', but wait, the string after 't67' is t8, t2, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's parse the string step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't4 t2...' which must be NT0 producing 't4' and then NT1 producing 't2'? Wait, but NT1 can't produce 't2'. Or perhaps S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and NT0 is expanded, then NT1 is expanded. Let's see:\n\nThe first part: 't4' is from NT0 \u2192 't4'.

The CFG is in Chomsky Normal Form, and it's already given as a bunch of production rules. The string is a sequence of t-something, which are terminals, I think. Each rule seems to have two non-terminals on the left side, except for the ones where a terminal appears. For example, S -> NT0 NT1, which is two non-terminals. Then there are several rules where a non-terminal is replaced by two other non-terminals, like NT9 -> NT1 NT5, and some where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, such as NT0 -> 't10', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t11 t46 t80 t11 t12 t63 t69 t43 t64 t73 t50 t76 t47 t2 t17 t52 t5 t5 t79 t80 t5 t13 t71 t64.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. The task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The CFG can be parsed with a top-down approach using the CYK algorithm, but since I might not remember all the steps, I'll try to approach it step by step.\n\nI think the process would involve breaking down the string into smaller parts that can be generated by the rules. Since the grammar is context-free, the order of operations matters, but each production can produce two symbols, so the string length must be compatible.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 23 terminals long. Let's see: the number of terminals is 23. Since each rule either produces two non-terminals or ends with a terminal, the length of the string should be compatible with the grammar.\n\nBut I might be getting stuck. Instead, perhaps I should look for patterns or possible derivations. To start, the entire string must be derived starting from S, which according to the grammar, S -> NT0 NT1. So the first two symbols must come from NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t11 and t46. So I need to see if t11 can be produced by NT0 and t46 can be produced by NT1, or some way that the productions can be aligned.\n\nWait, but NT0 and NT1 are non-terminals in the grammar. So for the first step, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the first two symbols in the string should correspond to the first symbols of NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: NT0 can be replaced by NT9 NT4, NT0 -> 't10', or other combinations like NT0\u2192 NT9 NT4. So each step involves expanding non-terminals into pairs.\n\nSo maybe the first two symbols must be the first symbols from each of the two non-terminals generated by NT0 and NT1. But wait, NT0 can produce 't10' as a terminal. So if t11 is a direct production of NT0, then that's possible, but in the given grammar, looking back, I don't see NT0 directly producing t11.

{"custom_id":"request-282","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all the productions are either to two non-terminals or a terminal. The string to check is: `t79 t58 t69 t63 t69 t54 t46 t36 t43 t43 t42 t41 t36 t10 t79 t50 t68 t67 t43 t17 t5 t76 t41 t0 t71`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. Chomsky Normal Form has productions of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, and B \u2192 \u03b1 or C \u2192 \u03b1 where \u03b1 is a terminal string. So, each production can generate two symbols at most, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals, but since it's CNF, the right-hand side can't have more than two symbols.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. So, the first two symbols generated must be whatever NT0 and NT1 produce. NT0 is `S \u2192 NT0 NT1`, so each of these is a non-terminal, and each can produce a combination of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nI notice that the string starts with `t79`. So, I need to see if NT0 can produce `t79` or if it can produce something that eventually leads to `t79`.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT0, there are several options:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT7 (wait, no, looking again, no NT7. Let me check the productions again. Hmm, in the given grammar, NT0 has multiple production rules:\n\nLet me list the NT0 productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT7 (no, checking again, maybe not. Wait, the user's grammar shows many NT0 productions, let me list them all.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of productions for each NT, not sure if list is complete. Looking through, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT0 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT4 NT7 (no, looking in the given productions, maybe not. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT0 appears in many productions, such as:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT0 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT4\nAnd others. So, I think NT0 can lead to different paths.\n\nBut wait, looking at the given string, the first symbol is `t79`. So, either NT0 or NT9 (since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and if NT0 produces `t79`, then NT1 would produce the next symbol, which is `t58`. Alternatively, if NT0 doesn't produce `t79`, maybe NT1 does, but then NT0 would produce something else. Hmm, not sure. Let me check NT0's productions to see if any of them can derive `t79`.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5: So, that would output whatever NT3 and NT5 can produce, which might end with a terminal. Let's see NT3 and NT5:\n\nNT3 can produce `t43`, `t4`, `t36`, etc., and NT5 can produce `t11`, `t17`, `t74`, etc. So, for example, NT3 \u2192 `t43` and NT5\u2192 `t4`, giving `t43 t4`. But I'm looking for `t79`, which is more specific than that.\n\nAnother option is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4. Let's see what NT9 and NT4 produce.\n\nNT9 has productions like NT9 \u2192 't66' or NT9 \u2192 't52' or NT9 \u2192 't36' etc. So NT9 can directly produce terminals like `t66`, `t52`, `t36`, etc. Similarly, NT4 can produce `t54`, `t82`, etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT9, one of its productions is NT9 \u2192 't66' etc. So if NT9 produces `t66`, and NT4 produces, say, `t54`, then NT0 would produce 't66 t54', but that's not `t79`.\n\nWait, let me check NT0: is there any production that directly leads to `t79` as a terminal? Let me look at each NT's terminals.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT9 has NT9 \u2192 't66', 't52', 't36', 't43' etc.\n- NT5 has NT5 \u2192 't11', 't17', 't74', 't80', etc.\n- NT4 has NT4 \u2192 't54', 't82', etc.\n- NT3 has NT3 \u2192 't4', 't36', 't10', 't42', etc.\n- NT0 appears in many: for example, NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT5. But that's a recursive production.\n\nWait, looking at NT3, one of its productions is NT3 \u2192 't43'. If that's the case, perhaps NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5 could produce 't43' followed by something. But the string starts with 't79', which doesn't match 't43'.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look for a production that leads directly to 't79' as a terminal. Looking through, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't79' except maybe in a chain. So perhaps the only way to get 't79' is through a non-terminal that produces 't79' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list all the NTs and their productions for terminals:\n\n- NT9: 't66', 't52', 't36', 't43', 't68', 't76', 't44', etc.\n- NT5: 't11', 't17', 't74', 't80', 't47', etc.\n- NT4: 't54', 't82', etc.\n- NT3: 't4', 't36', 't10', 't42', etc.\n- NT1: 't12', 't43', 't67', etc.\n- And others like NT0 produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't79' as a terminal. That's a problem because if NT0 can't produce 't79' directly, then the string can't start with 't79' unless there's a longer chain that eventually produces 't79' as a terminal. But given that NT0 can only produce two symbols at a time, maybe through recursion?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me double-check the productions for each NT.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has the following NT0 productions (transcribed here for clarity):\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT7 (Wait, no, checking the list again. No, I think I got that wrong. Let me count again.\n\nActually, the user's grammar is a long list. Let me parse each line:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-285","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several non-terminals (S, NT0, NT1, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT9) and terminals. The top-level production is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So, the string we need to parse must start with the concatenation of NT0 and NT1 expansions.\n\nLooking at the input string: \"t79 t80 t80 t58 t36 t63 t50 t46 t51 t66 t55 t47 t47 t64 t79 t12 t40 t12 t78 t58 t41 t69 t67 t12 t52\".\n\nBreaking this down step by step:\n\n1. **Start with S \u2192 NT0 NT1:** The entire string must be the concatenation of what NT0 generates and what NT1 generates.\n\n2. **Analyze NT1:** Looking at the productions for NT1:\n   - NT1 \u2192 't12' (a terminal string)\n   - So, the first token in the string must be 't12', making the beginning \"t12\".\n   However, the string starts with \"t79\", which doesn't match. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the string starts with 't79', but NT1 only produces 't12' directly. That's a contradiction because NT1 can't generate 't79' unless there's a different production. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\n   Oh, I think I made a mistake. Looking at the grammar, NT1 has several productions, including one that goes to 't12'. So NT1 can generate a single 't12'. But in our case, the string has the first token as 't79', which isn't 't12'. Hmm, that suggests the string starts with 't79', which might come from NT0, right? But NT0 has several productions, one of which is 't79' (I see in the rules: NT0 \u2192 't79')? Wait, let me check the grammar provided:\n\n   Oh, yes! Looking through the grammar:\n   - NT0 has several productions, including NT0 \u2192 't79' directly. So, the first token being 't79' is possible. So, the initial step would be NT0 \u2192 't79' and NT1 would generate the rest.\n\n3. **Looking at NT1's productions:** NT1 \u2192 't12' directly. So after 't79', we should have 't12' from NT1. The next tokens are 't80', 't80', etc. Wait, the second token is 't80', but NT1 can only generate 't12' as the only terminal for NT1. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, let's think again.\n\nWait, the string provided starts with 't79', which is indeed a production of NT0. So N0 produces 't79' as one option. Then, N1 must produce the rest, which after N0 \u2192 't79', the next parts are 't80 t80 t58 ...' which must come from NT1.\n\nBut wait, NT1 only can produce 't12' as a terminal. That means the entire string after N0 is supposed to be 't12', but in this case, the string after 't79' is a long sequence, which can't be generated by NT1 alone. That seems like a contradiction because after 't79', the rest should be 't12', but it's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the structure. Let me list the entire production for NT1:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12'\n\nSo, NT1 can only produce the string 't12', no other option. Therefore, the string after 't79' should be 't12', which is only two characters. But in our case, after 't79', there are multiple tokens: 't80', 't80', etc., totaling 23 tokens after 't79'. This can't possibly match NT1's production. Therefore, the string doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way NT1 generates the rest, but from the grammar, NT1 only has 't12' as a terminal. There's no way for NT1 to produce any other sequences. So, the entire string after 't79' must be 't12', which it's not. Therefore, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but the initial assumption was that S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Maybe there's a way that NT1 can generate more than 't12', but according to the grammar, it can't.

Also, the start symbol is S, and all non-terminals are listed.\n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of production rules. Each token in the string corresponds to a single terminal, or possibly a combination like NT5 producing t5, etc.\n\nOur approach will be to start from the start symbol, S, and try to expand it step by step, trying to match the string from left to right. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent approach or a shift-reduce parser, but perhaps a simpler way is to simulate the parsing process.\n\nLet's reconstruct the possible parsing steps.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So we have two non-terminals, NT0 and NT1 that need to produce parts of the string.\n\n2. NT0 can expand into several options: NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, NT0 \u2192 NT4, NT0 \u2192 NT5, etc. Similarly, NT1 can expand into several NTs or tokens.\n\nWait, let me see the productions again. NT1 can be 't12' from the given grammar rules. So NT1 can directly produce t12. Let's check: NT1 is defined as 't12' in the grammar. So NT1 \u2192 't12'. \n\nSo the first token of the string is t5. Wait, but our first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which would lead to the string starting with what NT0 and NT1 produce. But NT1 produces t12, so the first token is t12, but the string starts with t5. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait a minute, the string we are given starts with t5, but according to the grammar, the leftmost symbol is NT0, which might produce t5? Let's check the productions for NT0.\n\nLooking back, NT0 can be 't64', 't4', 't73', etc. Wait, there's a production NT0 \u2192 't73', NT0 \u2192 't24', NT0 \u2192 't4', etc. So 't4' is one of NT0's productions. So maybe NT0 can produce 't4', which is the first token in the string. But wait, the string starts with t5, which would require NT0 to produce t5, but I don't see an NT0 \u2192 t5 production. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nAh, looking through the grammar rules, I don't see an NT0 \u2192 t5. The closest is NT3 \u2192 t51, which is for NT3, but not NT0. So how could NT0 produce t5? It seems there's a mistake here. Wait, looking back at the grammar, do I see NT0 \u2192 't5'? Let me check:\n\nYes, here's a production: NT0 \u2192 't5'. Oh, right, so NT0 \u2192 t5 is one of the options. So the first symbol in the string is t5, which can come from NT0. So then the first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and NT0 produces t5, and NT1 could produce t12 or something else. But in the string, the next token after t5 is t12. So NT1 is t12, which fits.\n\nSo after the first step, the string consumed is t5 t12, and what's left is the rest.\n\nNow, after producing t5 from NT0 and t12 from NT1, we move to the next symbols. The next symbol in the string is t10. Let's look at what comes after.\n\nThe original string is t5 t12 t10 t12 t42... and so on.\n\nWait, after t5 and t12, the next is t10. So after the initial S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which produces t5 t12, the next step is to parse the remaining string: t10 t12 t42 t67 t80... etc.\n\nBut wait, the S production is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which produces two tokens, so the entire string must be exactly two tokens? No, that's not right. Because the initial production S \u2192 NT0 NT1 produces two tokens, but the entire string is 27 tokens long. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. The initial production S \u2192 NT0 NT1 will produce two tokens at the start. So, the string starts with t5 t12, and then the rest of the string must be derived from the expansions of these two non-terminals (NT0 and NT1) further down.\n\nBut in the given grammar, NT1 can directly produce 't12', which is exactly what we have as the second token. So that works.\n\nNow, the next token after t5 t12 is t10. So after the initial two tokens, the parser needs to derive the entire string, starting with t5 t12, then t10, etc. But wait, how can S \u2192 NT0 NT1 produce all tokens correctly?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's re-express this.\n\nThe string has 27 tokens. The initial S gives NT0 and NT1, each of which can produce a series of terminals. So the overall structure is:\n\nt5 (from NT0) [something derived from NT0] t12 (from NT1) [something derived from NT1]\n\nBut the string's third token is t10, which needs to be part of what's coming from NT0 and NT1. Wait, I'm getting it wrong.\n\nActually, the initial step is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which as the entire string being generated is NT0's expansion followed by NT1's expansion. So the string should be a concatenation of NT0's expansion and NT1's expansion.\n\nIn this case, the string starts with t5 t12 t10..., so NT0 must produce t5 followed by t10, and NT1 must produce t12? No, because NT1 can only produce t12 as a single token.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me see. Each step in the expansion can produce multiple tokens, so the initial S \u2192 NT0 NT1 will generate the first tokens of NT0's expansion and then NT1's expansion. So perhaps the parser will first parse the first part of NT0 to produce t5, and then continue parsing the rest of NT0, then parse NT1 to produce t12, then the rest.\n\nBut wait, the string is t5, t12, t10, t12,... So after the initial t5 t12, the next token is t10, which must be the next token generated by NT0's expansion, because the NT1 only generates t12 as a single token. So the parser would, after producing t12 from NT1, needs to have the next token be t10, which must come from NT0's expansion.\n\nSo, after S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which produces 't5' followed by 't12' (i.e., the two initial tokens: t5 and t12), we are left with the remaining tokens starting from t10.\n\nSo, the parser needs to continue parsing the rest of NT0, which needs to generate t10 after t5. So let's see how NT0 can expand to include t10 after t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT0:\n\nNT0 can expand into several options. From the given rules, NT0 has the following productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 can also produce t4, t5, t64, etc., but let's see.\n\nSo we have so far: NT0 \u2192 t5 ... something. Wait, no: NT0 can produce t5 directly. So perhaps the initial expansion is:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\nNT0 \u2192 t5\nNT1 \u2192 t12\n\nBut then where is t10 comes into play? Because in the string, after t5 t12, the next token is t10. So maybe the string's structure is more like: t5 [something] t12 t10... No, that's not right because NT1 can't produce multiple tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Instead, let me try to model this as a parse tree. The string is a sequence of terminals. Each step of the grammar expansion produces a tree where each node is a non-terminal that has been fully expanded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is the concatenation of the right-hand sides of the productions. So for S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the initial expansion is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. CNF is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm not going to implement an algorithm right now, I'll have to find another way.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t50 t17 t58 t2 t47 t5 t80 t50 t64 t76 t41 t50 t11 t2 t68 t47 t67 t44 t41 t73 t12 t69 t44 t66 t5 t58`.\n\nI notice that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the first step should be generating sequences starting with NT0 followed by NT1. Each non-terminal can produce other non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLet me write down the productions for each non-terminal involved in the string:\n\nNT0: \n- NT3 NT5\n- NT9 NT4\n- NT0 NT4\n- NT5 NT5 (from NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT5 since NT5 has NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1, so this would chain)\nWait, no. Looking at the productions, NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1, so NT5 can't produce a terminal directly. Similarly, NT0 can go to NT9 NT4 or NT5 NT5 or NT0 NT4, etc.\n\nThe terminals in the string are t50, t17, t58, t2, t47, t5, etc. I'll note that each non-terminal and terminal needs to be matched. \n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the string starts with t50. Let's look at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 can be NT3 NT5, NT0 NT4, NT5 NT5, or NT9 NT4, etc.\n\nBut to get a terminal, we need to see if any of these non-terminals can derive a single terminal or a string matching the string.\n\nLooking at all the NT0 productions, it seems NT0 can eventually produce a terminal, but let's check the options:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5: So to get a terminal, NT3 and NT5 need to derive terminals.\n\nLooking at NT3: It can produce t2 or t47.\n\nLooking at NT5: It can produce NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1, which leads to t17 or t80.\n\nWait, let's see NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1, and NT1 \u2192 t12, so that would lead to t12 t12, but in the grammar, NT5 also has other productions like NT5 \u2192 t51, t71, t8, etc.\n\nWait, looking back, the productions for NT5 are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1 (so can derive t17 t17 if NT1 \u2192 t17, which it can)\n- Also, NT5 \u2192 t51, t71, t58, t8, etc.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the productions step by step and see which non-terminals can produce the terminals in the string.\n\nFirst, the string is t50 t17 t58 t2 t47 t5 t80 t50 t64 t76 t41 t50 t11 t2 t68 t47 t67 t44 t41 t73 t12 t69 t44 t66 t5 t58.\n\nI'll try to see how this can be split into parts corresponding to the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the first part must be NT0, and the second part NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, the first terminal is t50. Let's see if NT0 can produce t50 through some expansion.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (again)\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (duplicate)\n- Also, NT0 appears in other productions as part of larger steps.\n\nSo, for NT0, the possible direct terminal productions may vary. Let's list all NT0 to terminal steps:\n\nWait, I need to check all the NT0 productions to see if any of them directly or indirectly can produce a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the given NT0 productions, none of them directly produce terminals except where they produce NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, etc., which are still non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me check each non-terminal's productions correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Hmm, looking at the list, I don't see any direct production of a terminal from NT0. All NT0's productions involve other non-terminals.

Looking at the given grammar, all rules are either two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal, so it fits CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t13 t73 t55 t42 t42 t46 t8 t2 t36 t78 t69 t63 t58 t2 t66 t82 t64 t36 t8 t55 t84 t74 t0 t43 t2 t8 t69`.\n\nI notice there are spaces between the t's, but in the grammar rules, each production either generates a single terminal or combines two non-terminals.

Let me scan the rules for NT0.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules:\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (I don't have t10 here, but not matching t69)\n- NT0 \u2192 't96'? No, but checking the list, I see:\nWait, looking back, the grammar includes NT0 \u2192 't71'? Let me check all NT0 rules.\n\nFrom the grammar, the NT0 rules that produce terminals are:\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (no)\n- NT0 \u2192 't4' (no)\n- NT0 \u2192 't36' (twice)\n- NT0 \u2192 't47' (twice, but 't47' isn't in the string here; the string has t42, t46, t8, etc.)\n- Others produce non-terminals, so let's check the terminal options.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the last token is 't69'. Let me check if any NT can produce 't69'. Looking through the grammar rules, NT0 has 't78' and 't66' as terminals. Also, NT1 has 't73' and 't80'. Wait, I'm looking for 't69'. Maybe NT9? Let me check the NT9 rules:\n\nNT9 rules include:\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- NT9 \u2192 't64'\n- NT9 \u2192 't78' (I don't see this in my initial scan, let me check again)\nWait, in the given grammar, NT9 has:\nNT9 -> 't68' (1)\nNT9 -> 't64' (2)\nNT9 -> 't96'? No, looking back:\nWait, in the initial grammar, I see:\nLooking for 't68', 't64', other terminals. Does any rule produce 't69'? I think I might have missed it. Wait, looking at the rules:\nWait, under NT0:\nNT0 \u2192 't78', yes. And also, under NT6 (but wait, NT6 isn't a non-terminal here; looking again, the non-terminals are S, NT0, NT1, ..., NT9.

Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar as given, the rules for each non-terminal:\n\nStart with S: S -> NT0 NT1.\n\nThen NT0's rules:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- etc.\n\nNT1's rules:\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT1 \u2192 't46'\n- NT3 \u2192 't43'\n- NT3 \u2192 't47'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-examine the overall structure.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has non-terminals NT0, NT1, ..., NT9 and S. The terminals in the string are t13, t73, t55, t42, etc.\n\nI think the way to proceed is to construct a parse tree starting from the entire string, trying to break it down into the non-terminals using the grammar.\n\nBut that's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look for each token and see if it can be generated by a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: 't13 t73 t55 t42 t42 t46 t8 t2 t36 t78 t69 t63 t58 t2 t66 t82 t64 t36 t8 t55 t84 t74 t0 t43 t2 t8 t69'.\n\nI can try to process this from last token to first, matching with the grammar's rightmost derivations.\n\nSo, starting from the end:\n\nThe last token is 't69'. We need a non-terminal that can produce 't69'.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for non-terminals, are there any that produce 't69'? Let's check each non-terminal's rules.\n\n- S: produces NT0 NT1. So S can only produce sequences starting with NT0 and NT1. The terminals can only be produced by specific non-terminals.\n\nLet's look for any non-terminals that produce 't69'.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nWait, let me list all the non-terminals and their possible terminals:\n\nNT0 rules:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (No)\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't36' x2\n- NT0 \u2192 't47' x2\n- etc.\n\nWait, in NT0's rules, I don't see 't69'. Next, NT1's rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't12' (No)\n- NT1 \u2192 't73' (Yes)\n- NT1 has 't46'\n\nOther non-terminals:\n\nNT5's rules:\n- NT5 \u2192 't8' (Yes)\n- NT5 \u2192 't74' (Yes)\n- etc.\n\nWhat about NT1: it can produce 't73' (Yes) as per the rule NT1 \u2192 't73'.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 \u2192 't8' or 't74'.\n\nBut I'm looking for 't69', which seems unusual.

{"custom_id":"request-301","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule has on the left side a single non-terminal symbol, and on the right side either two non-terminals or a terminal. The string to check is a sequence of these 't' followed by numbers.\n\nFirst, let me count the tokens in the string to see if it fits the structure. The string is: `t41 t78 t44 t11 t42 t51 t40 t5 t73 t17 t5 t51 t55 t67 t79 t0 t13 t13 t51 t78 t51 t63 t12 t82 t12 t71 t63`. So, that's 27 tokens in total. Each token here is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's important to see how these terminals can be produced. The grammar starts with S -> NT0 NT1, so the string must start with the terminals generated from NT0 and NT1.\n\nBreaking down the string, the first token is t41. I look at the grammar rules to see where t41 can come from. Looking at the rules, t41 is in NT9 -> 't41'? Wait, looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the NT9 rules: Yes, NT9 can produce t41 via NT9 -> 't41'? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the rules are:\n\nNT9 -> 't68'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT3 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't64'\nNT1 -> 't51'\nNT9 -> 't64'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT9 -> 't69'\nNT0 -> 't73'\nNT0 -> 't24'\nNT3 -> 't43'\nNT1 -> 't67'\nNT5 -> 't74'\nNT9 -> 't52'\nNT5 -> 't71'\nNT5 -> 't8'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nNT3 -> 't4'\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT3 -> 't71'\nNT1 -> 't46'\nNT1 -> 't80'\nNT3 -> 't51'\nNT9 -> 't36'\nNT9 -> 't58'\nNT5 -> 't84'\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT9 -> 't66'\nNT4 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't42'\nNT0 -> 't79'\nNT9 -> 't78'\nNT0 -> 't36'\nNT0 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't17'\nNT4 -> 't55'\nNT9 -> 't63'\nNT4 -> 't13'\nNT5 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't76'\nNT9 -> 't44'\nNT4 -> 't58'\nNT9 -> 't41'\nNT3 -> 't50'\nNT1 -> 't73'\nNT3 -> 't40'\nNT5 -> 't80'\nNT0 -> 't5'\nNT1 -> 't42'\n\nWait, okay, so looking for where t41 appears. I see that NT9 -> 't41' is a production. So NT9 can directly produce t41. \n\nBut earlier in the grammar, NT9 can expand into other non-terminals, like NT9 -> NT5 NT4. Let me confirm: Yes, looking at the grammar, the rule for NT9 is:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\nnt9: NT9 can also produce NT5 NT4.\n\nWait, no, let's look again. The grammar's NT9 rules are:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT9 -> 't68'\n\nSo, NT9 can either produce NT1 followed by NT5 or directly produce 't68'. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t41, which isn't t68. So how did t41 get in there? Wait, I'm getting confused because the NT9 rule has t41 as a terminal? Wait, in the provided grammar, where is 't41'? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that \"t41\" appears only as a terminal in NT9-> 't41'. So NT9 can produce 't41' directly.\n\nWait, but in the initial production S -> NT0 NT1, which means the first step is to produce two non-terminals: NT0 and NT1.\n\nSo the string starts with t41, which would have to come from NT9, but S only produces NT0 and NT1. Hmm. So how does NT9 get involved here? Because S can't directly produce NT9, it's only in NT0 and NT1.\n\nWait, but in NT0's productions, perhaps. Let's look at NT0's rules:\n\nNT0 has several productions:\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't64'\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t41. So that can't come from NT0 unless NT0 can expand into NT9, which in turn can produce t41. But NT0 is being used in S as NT0 NT1, so that can't happen unless one of them expands into a terminal and the other into the required symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to break down the string into parts and see if I can match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t41 t78 t44 t11 t42 t51 t40 t5 t73 t17 t5 t51 t55 t67 t79 t0 t13 t13 t51 t78 t51 t63 t12 t82 t12 t71 t63\n\nSo, the first token is t41. According to the grammar, t41 is produced directly by NT9 (NT9 -> 't41'). But since S is NT0 NT1, and S produces these two, how can the first token be t41?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a mix-up in the way the productions are applied. Let me think differently: perhaps the string is the result of a series of productions, and I need to see if each part of the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the string as a series of steps where each non-terminal expands into the next token(s). For example, starting with S, we have two non-terminals, NT0 and NT1. So the first step is to expand NT0 and NT1 into their respective symbols or sub-expressions.\n\nBut looking at S-> NT0 NT1, the expansion starts with NT0 and NT1, so the first tokens would be from NT0 and NT1 production paths.\n\nSo perhaps the initial steps could produce tokens from NT0 and NT1. For example, NT0 expands into 't10', and NT1 into 't12', giving 't10 t12'. But in our string, the first token is t41, so that would require NT9 to produce t41, but S can't directly produce t41. Therefore, unless NT9 is produced by one of the NT0 or NT1 expansions.\n\nLooking at NT0's and NT1's expansions:\n\nNT0 has several options, including NT3 NT5 and NT9 NT4, and some terminals. Similarly, NT1 can produce 't12', among other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe in NT0's production, one option is to produce NT9, and then NT9 can produce t41 directly. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nLooking at NT0 -> NT9 NT4. So if NT0 is expanded as NT9 followed by NT4, then the next tokens from NT0 would be the expansion of NT9 and then the expansion of NT4.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 can produce 't12' directly, or other non-terminals like NT5, which can further expand.\n\nSo maybe the string starts with NT0 -> NT9 NT4, which would then produce a sequence of t41 (from NT9) and whatever comes from NT4. Let's explore that.\n\nSo the first two tokens would be t41 followed by whatever NT4 produces.\n\nWait, the string starts with t41 t78 t44 t11... So the second token is t78.\n\nSo if after t41 comes t78, perhaps that comes from NT4 expanding further.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT4 -> 't58'\nNT4 -> 't13'\nNT4 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. The grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Looking at the productions, the start symbol is S, and the string starts with S -> NT0 NT1. So the string must be a concatenation of two parts, one from NT0 and another from NT1.\n\nNext, I'll examine the possible expansions of NT0 and NT1. \n\nNT0 can expand into several other non-terminals:\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 can also produce some terminal symbols directly, such as t5, t4, t2, t64, t47, t67, t11, etc.\n\nNT1 can expand into:\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- Other options like NT9 NT5, NT5 NT1, etc., but the string starts with t13, so I need to see if NT1 can produce that.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t13. Let me check NT1's production rules. The only terminal for NT1 is 't12', and all the other productions are NTs. But t13 isn't listed as a terminal, so that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking closely, NT1's productions: It only has NT9, NT5, which are non-terminals, and 't12'. So how can it produce t13? Unless there's a chain of productions leading to it. Hmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, is t13 a non-terminal? No, the string is all terminals. So the first token is t13, but NT1 can't produce t13 directly. This suggests that maybe the string isn't generated by this grammar because S starts with NT0 NT1, and the first part is t13, which must come from NT0. But let's see NT0's options to produce t13.\n\nLooking at NT0, does it have a production to t13? Looking through the NT0 rules: I don't see any terminal 't13'. The terminals for NT0 are things like t5, t4, t2, t64, t47, t67, t11, etc. So t13 isn't directly produced by NT0. Then, how does t13 get into the string? It seems impossible unless there's a rule I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me check again. The grammar starts with S -> NT0 NT1. The string starts with t13, which would have to come from NT0. But looking at all the NT0 production rules, none of them produce t13 as a terminal. Only non-terminals or other terminals like 't5', 't4', etc.\n\nSo this suggests that the string can't be generated because the first character 't13' isn't present in NT0's productions.

The string to evaluate is `t80 t76 t51 t58 t51 t78 t63 t74 t17 t64 t11 t36 t64 t40 t10 t68 t71 t52 t47 t74 t80 t54 t69 t41 t68 t84 t58 t46`.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A grammar is in CNF if every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions seem to fit this structure. Each NT (non-terminal) produces either two other non-terminals or a terminal directly. So that checks out.\n\nNow, the task is to parse the string `t80 t76 t51 t58 t51 t78 t63 t74 t17 t64 t11 t36 t64 t40 t10 t68 t71 t52 t47 t74 t80 t54 t69 t41 t68 t84 t58 t46` and see if it can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nOne approach is to construct a parse tree for the string according to the grammar rules. Starting from the start symbol S, which appears to produce two NT1s, each of which then produce more symbols. The string starts with `t80`, so let's see how that can fit into the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT1 can produce `t12` directly or other combinations. But in the string, the first symbol is `t80`, which doesn't appear in any of the immediate productions of NT1. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOh, I spot that NT1 has `t12` as one of its productions. But the string starts with `t80`, so perhaps the initial S must expand into something else. Wait, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the start is two non-terminals, NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, we see various terminals like 't10', 't36', etc. And NT0 can produce 't76' as I notice. Wait, the first symbol is `t80`, so maybe NT0 can produce 't80' via one of its rules. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through NT0's productions, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't64'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't47'\n- etc.\n\nWait, I don't see 't80' in any of these. That's strange because the string starts with `t80`. So if NT0 doesn't produce `t80` directly, maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all NT0 productions:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't64'\n- NT0 \u2192 't36' (twice)\n- NT0 \u2192 't47'\n- NT0 \u2192 't51'\n- NT0 \u2192 't71'\n\nWait, I see NT0 \u2192 't51' and other terminals. But where is `t80`? It's not there. That's a problem because the string starts with `t80`, so if NT0 cannot produce that, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut let me double-check in case I missed something. Looking back at the grammar rules for NT0: no, none of the productions produce 't80'. So the initial symbol S \u2192 NT0 NT1 would start with NT0, which can't produce 't80'.

{"custom_id":"request-324","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF is a specific grammar structure where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, it seems all the rules except the terminal rules start with a non-terminal and have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. That\u2019s good. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t78 t47 t84 t5 t71 t51 t67 t74 t44 t66 t71 t24 t47 t64 t66 t73 t0 t10 t51 t43 t78 t54 t40 t84 t11 t24 t5 t54 t63.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string. Each symbol seems to be a terminal, like t78, t47, etc. So I guess each word in the string is a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, how do I check if this string can be produced by the grammar? One approach is to simulate the derivation process or use parsers. Since the grammar is small, maybe I can find a top-down approach or use a recursive descent parser. But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps the only way to parse a string is by looking for a sequence that can be split into non-terminals correctly.\n\nLet me look at the non-terminals and their productions. \n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the start symbol is S, which produces NT0 and NT1. Both of these are non-terminals that produce more symbols. \n\nSo the string must start with something that can derive to NT0 or NT1, followed by something deriving to NT1 or NT0, respectively, if I'm thinking bottom-up. But top-down starts with S.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the string as a sequence of terminals and see if I can split it into chunks that correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nBut given that the grammar has many non-terminals, maybe I can look for possible splits of the string into parts that match the rules of the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the productions again for clarity:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\nNT9 -> 't68'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT3 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't64'\nNT1 -> 't51'\nNT9 -> 't64'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT9 -> 't69'\nNT0 -> 't73'\nNT0 -> 't24'\nNT3 -> 't43'\nNT1 -> 't67'\nNT5 -> 't74'\nNT9 -> 't52'\nNT5 -> 't71'\nNT5 -> 't8'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nNT3 -> 't4'\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT3 -> 't71'\nNT1 -> 't46'\nNT1 -> 't80'\nNT3 -> 't51'\nNT9 -> 't36'\nNT9 -> 't58'\nNT5 -> 't84'\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT9 -> 't66'\nNT4 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't42'\nNT0 -> 't79'\nNT9 -> 't78'\nNT0 -> 't36'\nNT0 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't17'\nNT4 -> 't55'\nNT9 -> 't63'\nNT4 -> 't13'\nNT5 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't76'\nNT9 -> 't44'\nNT4 -> 't58'\nNT9 -> 't41'\nNT3 -> 't50'\nNT1 -> 't73'\nNT3 -> 't40'\nNT5 -> 't80'\nNT0 -> 't5'\nNT1 -> 't42'\n\nWow, that's a lot. So each non-terminal has various productions, some splitting into two other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is t78. Looking at the productions, do any non-terminals produce t78 as their only terminal? Let's scan:\n\nLooking at NT9 -> 't68' (no), NT0 -> 't10', 't4', 't64' (no), NT1 -> 't12' (no), NT5 -> 't11', 't71', 't8', 't84' (no, that's 84, not 78), NT9 -> 't52', 't78' (Yes! Look at NT9-> 't78').\n\nSo t78 comes from NT9\u2192 t78. So the first part is 't78' corresponding to NT9.\n\nSo after the first symbol, we have NT9.\n\nNext, the second symbol is t47. Let's see what NT47 is... Wait, no, wait, t47 is a terminal. Looking at the productions, which non-terminals produce t47?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't47' because NT0 -> NT4, but also NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, and NT4's rule is NT4 \u2192 't47' and others.\n\nWait, looking at the rules: NT4 has a production \u2192 't47'. So t47 is directly produced by NT4. That's right, because look:\n\nNT4 -> 't47' as well as other options.\n\nSo the second symbol, t47, comes from NT4\u2192t47.\n\nSo now we're at NT4. But wait, our main symbol is NT0 and NT1. So in the initial step, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So we have S producing two non-terminals: NT0 and NT1.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t78, which is from NT9, then t47, which is from NT4.\n\nBut NT0 is supposed to be the first non-terminal in S's production. So that seems conflicting because S \u2192 NT0 NT1 would mean the first part is NT0 and the next NT1. But here, the first part is NT9, and the next is NT4.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me structure this better.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. We need to see if this sequence can be derived from S using the grammar rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals). So the entire string is a bottom-up or top-down expansion.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to parse it top-down. Starting with S, which can produce NT0 and NT1. So the first two symbols in the string should form the first two symbols derived from NT0 and NT1.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t78. Wait, how so? Because S produces NT0 and NT1. So if the first two symbols come from NT0 and NT1, it's tX followed by tY. But the string starts with t78 and then t47. So perhaps the first non-terminal is NT9, which produces t78, and then the next non-terminal is NT4, which produces t47.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a parse tree. Let's walk through the string step by step:\n\nThe string is: t78 t47 t84 t5 t71 t51 t67 t74 t44 t66 t71 t24 t47 t64 t66 t73 t0 t10 t51 t43 t78 t54 t40 t84 t11 t24 t5 t54 t63.\n\nLet's try to parse it by splitting into the possible productions.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. The first symbol is t78. From the grammar, t78 comes from NT9\u2192t78.\n\nSo the first part must be NT9 \u2192 t78.\n\n2. Next, after NT9, according to S\u2192NT0 NT1, there should be an NT1. But looking at the string, t47 comes after. Let's check if t47 is from NT4\u2192t47. So after t78, it's t47, which is NT4\u2192t47. But according to S, the second part should be NT1, not NT4. This is a problem because the second symbol after S is supposed to be NT1, but here we have NT4. So that suggests a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm thinking about this the wrong way.

Maybe it's 't9' elsewhere.)\n\nWait, let me list all NT0 rules correctly:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> 't10' [from the list: 't10' is present in NT0]\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT0 -> 't73'\nNT0 -> 't74'\nNT0 -> 't51'\nWait, no, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking for NT0:\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT0 -> 't73'\n- NT0 -> 't74'\n- NT0 -> 't51'\nWait, no.

So that's a problem. Wait, the string starts with t58, which is the first token. In the grammar, where can t58 come from? Let's look through all the rules to see where 't58' appears.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT1 -> 't12', 't51', 't55', 't64', 't67', etc.\n\n- NT5 -> 't11', 't17', 't55', 't58' (look here, yes, NT5 has -> t58)\n\n- NT9 has several rules, including NT9 -> 't68', 't69', etc.\n\nWait, but looking for 't58' in any of the productions:\n\nLooking for each NT where a rule directly includes 't58':\n\n- NT5: Yes, NT5 has a production -> 't58'.\n\n- Any others? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules again:\n\n- NT0: doesn't have t58.\n\n- NT1: no t58, only t12, t51, t55, t64, t67, etc.\n\n- NT3: outputs t2, t43, t47, etc.\n\n- NT4: outputs t47, t54, t82, etc.\n\n- NT5: -> 't58' and others.\n\n- NT9: outputs t68, t78, t73, etc.\n\nSo only NT5 can directly produce 't58'.\n\nTherefore, the production NT0 must have generated 't58' as part of its output. But since NT0 can't directly produce t58, it must have derived it through NT5. So, breaking it down, NT0 must have a production that involves NT5. Looking at the rules for NT0, one of the rules is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4.\n\nBut wait, that's not directly producing t58. Alternatively, there\u2019s a chain where NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT1 or something else.\n\nWait, no, let's look at the rules for NT0. It can produce NT3 NT5 or NT9 NT4, or any of the terminal symbols. But from the above, t58 is only directly produced by NT5, so the only way to get t58 is through NT5.\n\nTherefore, to produce t58, NT0 must have derived it via NT5. Since NT0 can produce NT5, which can produce t58. So the chain would be NT0 \u2192 NT5 ... where NT5 produces t58.\n\nBut looking at the NT0 rules, there is no direct rule that includes NT5 combined with other terminals. NT0 has rules like NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, or NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5. So to get to t58, the path would have to be NT0 \u2192 NT5, but NT0 can't produce NT5 directly, right? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, does any rule produce NT5?\n\nLooking, NT5's rules are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't11', 't17', 't55', 't58', 't71', 't76', 't80', etc.\n\nSo NT5 can produce directly 't58' among others.\n\nSo, coming back, in the initial step, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. The first symbol is t58. So, the first part of the string is t58. How does that happen?\n\nSince S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and the string starts with t58, one of the following must be true:\n\n1. NT0 generates a sequence where the first symbol is t58, but as we saw earlier, NT0 cannot directly produce t58; thus, NT0 must generate a two-step process where perhaps it first produces NT5, which then can produce t58.\n\nBut let me check the steps:\n\nFrom NT0, one possible production is NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5. Then NT5 could produce 't58'. So, from NT0, we could have a path like NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5 \u2192 t2 t58, but that's not relevant here since the string starts with t58.\n\nWait, but this seems impossible because NT0 can't directly produce 't58', and the only way to get 't58' is via NT5.

According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the initial split of the string should into two parts: one that starts with NT0 and the other with NT1.\n\nWait, but in the string, the order is t5, t47, ... So the first two symbols are t5 and t47. Let me see how these fit.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT0 can produce several things: for example, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, etc. Similarly, NT1 has several productions.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to write down the possible terminals each NT can produce directly. Let me list the direct terminal productions for each non-terminal:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't68' |\n          't64' |\n          't47' |\n          't51' |\n          't69' |\n          't58' |\n          't84' |\n          't36' |\n          't44' |\n          't50' |\n          't58' |\n          't71' |\n          't78' |\n          't76' |\n          't41' |\n          't58' |\n          't73' |\n          't55' |\n          't58' |\n          't66' |\n          't73' |\n          't17' |\n          't80' |\n          't69' |\n          't64' |\n          't55' |\n          't76'\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let me make a list more organized:\n\nLooking at NT9:\n- 't68', 't64', 't47', 't51', 't69', 't58', 't84', 't36', 't44', 't50', 't58', 't71', 't78', 't76', 't41', 't58', 't73', 't55', 't58', 't66', 't73', 't17', 't69', 't64', 't55', 't76'\n\nWait, actually, maybe the NT9 has several production options, each producing a specific terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 can produce several things, including NT9 or NT0 itself with different terminals. It's clear that manually going through all possibilities might be complex, so perhaps I can approach this by breaking the string into valid non-terminal expansions.\n\nLet me start by splitting the string into possible first productions from S, which is NT0 NT1. So the entire string must be a combination of a NT0-derived string followed by a NT1-derived string.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of specific t's like t5 t47 t66, etc. Let's list all the terminals in order:\n\n1. t5\n2. t47\n3. t66\n4. t80\n5. t69\n6. t44\n7. t69\n8. t58\n9. t71\n10. t2\n11. t17\n12. t76\n13. t2\n14. t54\n15. t11\n16. t44\n17. t64\n18. t55\n19. t58\n20. t71\n21. t2\n22. t2\n23. t6\n24. t5\n25. t64\n26. t73\n27. t44\n28. t76\n29. t67\n30. t13\n31. t13\n32. t69\n33. t13\n34. t24\n\nSo that's 34 symbols.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT0 NT1, I need to split this string into a part that NT0 can produce and another part that NT1 can produce.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols: t5 t47.\n\nLet me see if t5 and t47 can come from NT0 NT1, but wait, S produces NT0 followed by NT1, so the first part must be NT0-derived, and the next NT1-derived.\n\nSo the first part would be the first n symbols for some n, and the second part would be the remaining 34 - n symbols. I need to find n such that the first n can be generated by NT0, and the rest by NT1.\n\nStarting with n=1: t5 as the first symbol. Does NT0 produce t5? Looking at NT0's productions: The rules for NT0 do not include a production that directly derives 't5'. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT0, the productions are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT4 \u2192 Wait, no, looking back, all seem to be binary productions except for NT0 having loops?

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my grammar rules, but let's see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grammar rules to make it clearer. The grammar starts with S and breaks down into parts:\n\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT0 has several options:\n  - NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n  - NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n  - NT0 \u2192 't10' (among others)\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT9 can also be a terminal with 't68' or other 't's\n- There are many NTX rules with 't' terminals, like NT1 \u2192 't12', NT3 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nOkay, the string to test is: t58 t73 t84 t69 t46 t42 t78 t42 t68 t17 t67 t66 t13 t76 t71 t74 t0 t79 t76 t51 t71 t63 t80 t84 t73 t13 t12 t79 t73 t63.\n\nWow, that's a lot of tokens. Each token is a 't' followed by a number.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to see if the string can be derived from S by following these production rules. Let's see what S expands to.\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nSo, the start symbol S will produce two parts: NT0 followed by NT1. Looking at NT1 rules, I see NT1 \u2192 't12'. So the first token in the string must come from NT0, and the second must be 't12'.\n\nLooking at the string, the second token is t12, which matches NT1 \u2192 't12'. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the first token is t58. So, we need to see if t58 can be derived from NT0.

But in the grammar, NT0 doesn't have a rule that directly produces 't58'. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless there's a way to derive t58 from NT0 through multiple steps, but the NT0 rules don't seem to produce 't58'.\n\nWait, unless I made a mistake in looking through the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-343","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two terminals on the right, except for the starting symbol, which might produce two non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, B \u2192 a, etc. So each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t42 t68 t10 t67 t42 t73 t73 t0 t74 t13 t52 t36 t50 t2 t78 t84 t52 t74 t11 t84 t41 t55 t0 t50 t0 t8 t41 t73 t2 t11 t41`. \n\nFirst, I should note that this string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so I need to see if it's a valid parse according to the grammar. \n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the entire string must be generated by expanding S and eventually all non-terminals must be replaced by terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, all NT non-terminals have productions that either go to two other non-terminals or a terminal. So the derivation process will involve expanding non-terminals step by step, ensuring that each step eventually reduces to terminals.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the string. It has 33 tokens, which is an odd number. Since each production either increases the count by 0 (if it's an NT \u2192 NT NT) or adds a terminal (if it's NT \u2192 a). Starting from S, which is two non-terminals, each expansion step would potentially increase the number of symbols by one if a terminal is added, or keep it the same if a non-terminal is replaced.\n\nWait, starting with S: S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the first expansion produces two NT0 and NT1. Then, each of those can be expanded further. Let's consider that the number of symbols starts at 2 (from S). Each time a terminal is produced, it adds one symbol. Each time a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, it adds one symbol (2 non-terminals replacing 1, so net +1). So the total number of symbols in the string must be equal to 1 + the number of terminals. Wait, no: starting from 1 non-terminal, each production of A \u2192 BC increases the symbol count by 1 each time a non-terminal is expanded.\n\nWait, no. Let's think in terms of parse trees. Each production either produces two non-terminals (so the count remains the same as before if those non-terminals are eventually terminals) or a terminal (which adds one to the count). But from S, we have two non-terminals. So for each NT that becomes a terminal, it contributes +1. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to see if the given string can be built by expanding the grammar step by step.\n\nGiven the string is a list of t's and numbers, I should look for a sentence that can be built by expanding the grammar.\n\nLet me look for a possible way to build this string. Maybe looking for certain patterns.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: t42.\n\nLet me see where in the grammar t42 is a terminal. Looking through the rules, t42 appears as the terminal in a few places:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t42\nNT4 \u2192 t42\nNT0 \u2192 t42 (several times)\nNT1 \u2192 t42 (twice)\nNT9 \u2192 t42 twice\nNT5 \u2192 t42 (once)\nAnd others? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, t42 is a terminal in:\n\n- NT0: t42 several times: NT0 -> t42, which happens in several places.\n- NT3: t42\n- NT4: t42\n- NT1: t42 (twice)\n- NT9: t42 (twice)\n- NT5: t42 once.\n\nSo t42 can be produced by multiple non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, the next symbol is t68.\n\nLooking for t68: it appears as a terminal in NT0: t68 appears in NT0 \u2192 t68. So that's one production.\n\nThen t10: looking through the rules, t10 appears as NT0 \u2192 t10.\n\nSo S starts as NT0 NT1. Suppose the first NT0 is t0 via NT0 \u2192 t10, and NT1 could be t1 via NT1 \u2192 t12, but that's not matching. Wait, in the string, the second symbol is t68, which is t68 from NT0. So maybe the NT0 is expanding to t68, and then maybe the NT1 is expanding to other terms.\n\nWait, the first two symbols are t42 and t68. So let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, looking at the first symbol: t42. How does it get generated? From NT0 or NT3 or others as above.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to attempt to parse the string from the grammar. So starting with S, which is NT0 NT1. Let's see if the string starts with t42.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t42 t68 t10... which would mean that the expansion of NT0 is t42 followed by something, and NT1 is t68, but wait, NT1 \u2192 t12, so that can't be. Wait, no, in the string, the second symbol is t68, which is a terminal. So perhaps NT1 needs to expand to t68. But in the grammar, looking at the rules for NT1:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12' once, but in the rules given, let's check:\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar rules provided by the user, let me list out all NT1 productions to make it clearer.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT1 rules:\n  NT1 -> 't12' \n  NT1 -> 't67' \n  NT1 -> 't42' (twice)\n  NT1 -> 't80' (once)\n  NT1 -> 't73' (twice)\nSo NT1 can produce t12, t67, t42, t80, or t73. So t68 is not directly a terminal for NT1. But in the string, after t42 comes t68, which would have to be produced by a non-terminal that eventually produces t68. Looking at the grammar, is there any NT that produces t68? Yes, NT0: several rules include t68. So maybe NT0 is expanding to t68, and the next symbol would be part of another NT. But the string is t42 t68 t10... So that would require S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and NT0 expanding to t42, and then NT1 would need to expand to t68, but NT1 cannot produce t68 directly. So perhaps this is a problem.\n\nWait, this suggests that the second symbol, t68, cannot come from NT1 because NT1's terminals are t12, t67, t42, t80, and t73. So t68 is only a terminal in NT0. Therefore, if the string starts with t42, which is from NT0, then S must expand to two NT0s, but NT0 can also produce other things. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t42 t68 t10 t67 t42 t73 t73 t0 t74 t13 t52 t36 t50 t2 t78 t84 t52 t74 t11 t84 t41 t55 t0 t50 t0 t8 t41 t73 t2 t11 t41.\n\nWait, it's 33 tokens. So 33 is an odd number, which suggests that each non-terminal expansion step contributes a terminal, starting from S being two non-terminals.\n\nEach S \u2192 NT0 NT1: each of these can be either a terminal or a non-terminal, each step potentially adding more symbols.\n\nWait, no. Each expansion could be of a non-terminal, replacing one symbol with two symbols. So each time a non-terminal is expanded, the number of symbols in the current derivation increases by one. Starting from S as one non-terminal, after expansion it's two, and each further expansion could increase the count again.\n\nLet me think about how many symbols are present. The given string has 33 symbols. The starting point is S, which is 1 symbol.\n\nEach production of a non-terminal into two non-terminals keeps the number the same (1\u21922), then when those are expanded, they become more. So to get 33 symbols, which is an odd number, we need an odd number of non-terminals in the derivation steps.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of steps in the derivation corresponds to the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, Chomsky Normal Form is that every production rule is either A->BC, A->a, or maybe S->\u03b5 for the start symbol, but in this case, looking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol S only goes to NT0 NT1, and the rest of the non-terminals produce other non-terminals or string terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll recap the grammar to understand the structure. The string is t17 t46 t36 t69 t78 t0 t78 t47 t41 t4 t68 t84 t73 t69 t67 t2 t44 t24 t51 t73 t43 t50 t84 t58 t64 t69 t54 t2 t55 t69 t82.\n\nEach production rule in the grammar seems to split non-terminals into either two other non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S -> NT0 NT1. So, the top-down parsing strategy would start with S, which then breaks down into NT0 and NT1. I need to check if, by following these production rules, the entire string can be generated.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. So each token in the string must match the results of these productions. \n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left, except for the terminals, which are single symbols. Therefore, the string needs to be a sequence of symbols that can be built up by these productions.\n\nI think the best approach is to perform a top-down parsing and see if the string can be derived. Alternatively, I can check the parse using a bottom-up approach or maybe using memoization, but since the string is quite long, a step-by-step approach may be better.\n\nAnother method is to compute the parse table usingCYK algorithm, but given the time and complexity, maybe I can look for specific patterns or see if the string can be broken down into the allowed sequences.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, perhaps I can break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which is NT0 NT1. So the first step would be to produce a sequence where the first part is from NT0 and the second from NT1. So, the string should start with the sequence of symbols that NT0 can produce followed by the symbols that NT1 can produce.\n\nLooking at the string: t17 t46 t36 t69 t78 t0 t78 t47 t41 t4 t68 t84 t73 t69 t67 t2 t44 t24 t51 t73 t43 t50 t84 t58 t64 t69 t54 t2 t55 t69 t82.\n\nFirst, S produces NT0 NT1. So the first part comes from NT0, and the latter part comes from NT1.\n\nSo the string starts with t17. Let's see what NT0 can produce. Looking at the production rules for NT0, I see:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> NT4 NT7 (Wait, is there an NT7? Let me check the rules again. Oh, no, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me check again. From the given grammar, the rules for NT0 are:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't4'\n\nWait, no, looking again, no, for NT0:\n\nLooking back, the user provided the grammar. Wait, the initial response said the grammar was:\n\nS->NT0 NT1\nNT9->NT1 NT5\nNT0->NT3 NT5\nNT0->NT9 NT4\nNT0->'t10'\nNT0->'t4'\nNT3->'t2'\nNT3->'t47'\nNT4->'t47'\nNT5->'t11'\nWait, no, in the user's message, under the grammar, the rules are listed as:\n\nNT0-> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0-> NT9 NT4\n\nNT0-> 't10' -- Wait, that was originally written as NT0 -> 't10'. But in the initial response, the user mentioned that after NT9's 't68' there are multiple NT0 productions.\n\nWait, looking back, the original grammar as provided by the user is:\n\nHere is the grammar:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT3 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't64'\nWait, no, the user listed multiple productions under each non-terminal. So for example, NA0 has:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nand then under each rule, the terminal ones are:\n\nNT0-> 't10'\nNT0-> 't4'\nNT0-> 't64'\nand so on for other NT0 productions.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the user has a lot of rules for each non-terminal.\n\nBut in any case, looking back, the string starts with 't17', so that's a terminal symbol. But in the grammar, there is no NT0 -> 't17', so how can we get 't17' from NT0?\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if the first symbol is 't17', and the grammar for NT0 (which is the first part of S after production) doesn't have a rule that produces 't17' directly, then perhaps the string cannot be generated. \n\nWait, that can't be right because the CYK algorithm builds the table by looking at possible splits, so perhaps even if a direct production isn't present, it can be built from other symbols.\n\nWait, but 't17' is a terminal; it must be produced directly by a production. So looking back, can any production produce 't17'? Let's check the user's grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for any 't17' in the rules. I see:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT3 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't11'\nNT5 -> 't74'\nWait, no, looking through all the rules, the terminals are:\n\n' t9' comes from NT9 -> 't68'\n\nLooking through the other rules, I don't see any 't17' being produced.\n\nWait, actually when I looked through all the given grammar rules after the initial S, I don't see any rule that produces 't17'.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nAfter S, NT9 starts with NT9-> NT1 NT5.\n\nThen NT0 comes with several rules:\n\nNT0-> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0-> NT9 NT4\n\nand then several 't's, like t10, t4, t64, t4, t69, t73, etc.\n\nWait, so in the grammar, where is 't17' produced? If it's not present, then the first symbol 't17' cannot be derived, hence the string can't be generated.\n\nBut before jumping to conclusions, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps 't17' is produced somewhere else? Let me check the rules again. Oh, wait, in the provided grammar, NT5 can produce 't74', which is another terminal. But is 't17' anywhere?\n\nLooking through the rules again, I don't see any NT production that yields 't17'. So if the first symbol is 't17', it's impossible under this grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but that's probably the case because 't17' is not in the list of terminal symbols that appear in the grammar's production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's part of a larger production. For example, in the string, perhaps 't17' is part of a non-terminal that eventually breaks down into a sequence that includes 't17', but in this case, since 't17' is just a single terminal, it needs to be directly produced by a production rule.\n\nSince the grammar doesn't have a rule that directly produces 't17', the string starting with 't17' cannot be generated, hence the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't17', but according to the grammar, no production directly generates 't17'.

Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a binary tree, so the expansion is straightforward.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT9 can be NT1 NT5 or can produce a terminal like 't68'. Similarly, NT0 can produce different non-terminals, which could in turn produce terminals. So, to parse the string, I might need to use a recursive descent parser or some kind of top-down approach.\n\nBut since the string is given, maybe the easiest way is to see if each part of the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part: t36 t73 t68. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So, NT0 must generate t36, and NT1 must generate t73? Wait, not necessarily, because NT0 and NT1 can generate sequences that together produce these tokens.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in reverse. The entire string is a sequence of terminals that must be generated by some sequence of non-terminals expanding until we reach all terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct a parse tree for the string using the grammar. Let's try that.\n\nThe string is: t36 t73 t68 t71 t66 t43 t63 t51 t10 t11 t82 t5 t44 t4 t74 t10 t46 t13 t5 t58 t54 t64 t55 t13 t55 t78 t74 t52 t54 t12 t46 t42.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. The first part must come from S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So, the string starts with NT0 generating some part that includes t36, and then NT1 generating another part that includes t73.\n\n2. Let's look at the first token t36. Looking at the grammar, NT9 can produce t36 (NT9 \u2192 t68 or t94? Wait, looking back, I see that NT9 has productions that produce 't68' among others. So t36 is mentioned in NT9's productions: \"NT9 -> 't36' t44 t44\" or something? Wait, actually, in the grammar, it seems that some NT9 productions produce combinations of terminals. Wait, in the given grammar, NT9's productions include:\n\n   NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\n   NT9 -> 't68'\n\nBut where is 't36'? Wait, looking back: There's a line \"NT9 -> 't36'\"? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT9 -> 't68'\n\nWait, no, the actual grammar from the user is:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\n\nNT9 -> 't68'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\n\nNT3 -> 't47'\n\nNT4 -> 't47'\n\nNT5 -> 't11'\n\nNT0 -> 't64'\n\nNT1 -> 't51'\n\nNT9 -> 't64'\n\nNT0 -> 't4'\n\nNT9 -> 't69'\n\nNT0 -> 't73'\n\nNT0 -> 't24'\n\nNT3 -> 't43'\n\nNT1 -> 't67'\n\nNT5 -> 't74'\n\nNT9 -> 't52'\n\nNT5 -> 't71'\n\nNT5 -> 't8'\n\nNT0 -> 't71'\n\nNT3 -> 't4'\n\nNT4 -> 't54'\n\nNT3 -> 't71'\n\nNT1 -> 't46'\n\nNT1 -> 't80'\n\nNT3 -> 't51'\n\nNT9 -> 't36'\n\nNT9 -> 't58'\n\nNT5 -> 't84'\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT9 -> 't66'\n\nNT4 -> 't82'\n\nNT3 -> 't42'\n\nNT0 -> 't79'\n\nNT9 -> 't78'\n\nNT0 -> 't36'\n\nNT0 -> 't47'\n\nNT5 -> 't17'\n\nNT4 -> 't55'\n\nNT9 -> 't63'\n\nNT4 -> 't13'\n\nNT5 -> 't50'\n\nNT5 -> 't76'\n\nNT9 -> 't44'\n\nNT4 -> 't58'\n\nNT9 -> 't41'\n\nNT3 -> 't50'\n\nNT1 -> 't73'\n\nNT3 -> 't40'\n\nNT5 -> 't80'\n\nNT0 -> 't5'\n\nNT1 -> 't42'\n\nWait, there's a line \"NT9 -> 't36'\", for example, in NT9's productions: \"NT9 -> 't52'\", \"NT9 -> 't66'\", etc. But I notice the user's grammar includes \"NT9 -> 't36'\", so that's one of the options.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is 't36', which can be produced directly by NT9. So, perhaps the first part of the parse is NT9 \u2192 't36'.\n\nThen, after that, what comes next? The next token is 't73'. Let's look at the grammar. What can produce 't73'? Looking at NT9's productions and other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9's productions are:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nBut that would require something like NT1 and NT5, which in turn would have to produce the next tokens. Alternatively, is there any NT that can produce 't73'? Looking at the grammar, looking for any production that outputs 't73' directly or as part of a two-step process.\n\nWait, I don't see a production that directly outputs 't73' except in the string. Looking at the terminal productions:\n\n- NT9 -> 't68'\n\n- NT3 -> 't2', 't47'\n\n- NT4 -> 't47'\n\n- NT5 -> 't11', 't17', 't54', etc.\n\nLooking, for example, NT0 can produce 't10', 't4', etc., but perhaps not t73. Similarly, NT1 can produce 't12', 't51', etc.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps the string is constructed via multiple steps. Let's think: since the grammar is CNF, each symbol is produced in two steps, so the entire string must be built by replacing S with NT0 NT1, then each of those non-terminals with their productions, and so on, until the string is fully expanded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to generate the string step by step, using the grammar.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a stack-based approach, like the CYK algorithm, which parses strings in CNF. That might be more efficient.\n\nCYK works by building a table where each cell (i,j) represents the non-terminals that can generate the substring from position i to j.\n\nFirst, let's list the string: s = ['t36', 't73', 't68', 't71', 't66', 't43', 't63', 't51', 't10', 't11', 't82', 't5', 't44', 't4', 't74', 't10', 't46', 't13', 't5', 't58', 't54', 't64"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding both the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or a terminal. There's also a sentence given string, which I need to parse using the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production rules are all two-symbol productions, which might make parsing a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t8 t46 t2 t64 t55 t4 t82 t66 t66 t64 t17 t11 t11 t47 t74 t64 t76 t36 t50 t13 t51 t73 t69 t67 t82 t11 t50 t17 t84 t40 t24`.\n\nI notice the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers.

Let me check the initial grammar:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nGrammar:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\n\nNT9 -> 't68'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\n\nNT3 -> 't47'\n\nNT4 -> 't47'\n\nNT5 -> 't11'\n\nNT0 -> 't64'\n\nNT1 -> 't51'\n\nNT9 -> 't64'\n\nNT0 -> 't4'\n\nNT9 -> 't69'\n\nNT0 -> 't73'\n\nNT0 -> 't24'\n\nNT3 -> 't43'\n\nNT1 -> 't67'\n\nNT5 -> 't74'\n\nNT9 -> 't52'\n\nNT5 -> 't71'\n\nNT5 -> 't8'\n\nNT0 -> 't71'\n\nNT3 -> 't4'\n\nNT4 -> 't54'\n\nNT3 -> 't71'\n\nNT1 -> 't46'\n\nNT1 -> 't80'\n\nNT3 -> 't51'\n\nNT9 -> 't36'\n\nNT9 -> 't58'\n\nNT5 -> 't84'\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT9 -> 't66'\n\nNT4 -> 't82'\n\nNT3 -> 't42'\n\nNT0 -> 't79'\n\nNT9 -> 't78'\n\nNT0 -> 't36'\n\nNT0 -> 't47'\n\nNT5 -> 't17'\n\nNT4 -> 't55'\n\nNT9 -> 't63'\n\nNT4 -> 't13'\n\nNT5 -> 't50'\n\nNT5 -> 't76'\n\nNT9 -> 't44'\n\nNT4 -> 't58'\n\nNT9 -> 't41'\n\nNT3 -> 't50'\n\nNT1 -> 't73'\n\nNT3 -> 't40'\n\nNT5 -> 't80'\n\nNT0 -> 't5'\n\nNT1 -> 't42'\n\nWait, that seems a lot of rules.\n\nSo for NT0, the productions are:\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because in CNF, you can only have non-terminals on the right, except possibly directly producing terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps some rules have two terminals? But in the initial grammar provided, for NT0, there's a production that goes directly to 't10'. So in the given grammar, S produces NT0 NT1, which then may produce a terminal and another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but how? Let me see:\n\nLooking closer, in the user's grammar, NT0 has the following productions:\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n\nSimilarly, NT1 might have some direct terminal outputs, like NT1 -> 't12' etc.\n\nSo each non-terminal can produce either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That's fine, as long as everything eventually expands to terminals.\n\nNow, the string is a list of t's, so each of them must come from productions that eventually expand to a single terminal.\n\nSo, the approach is to model the string as a series of steps in the grammar's leftmost derivation, checking if each symbol in the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut since it's a bit complex, maybe a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for context-free grammars in CNF to parse strings efficiently.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, that might take a while. Alternatively, maybe I can find the start symbol expansion and see if the string can be broken down into that structure.\n\nLet's first note that the start symbol is S -> NT0 NT1. So the first step is NT0 NT1.\n\nSo the string starts with 't5', so let's see what NT0 and NT1 can produce.\n\nWait, no: the string is a list of t symbols, so the entire string is a sequence of t's. So 't5 t80 t64 ...' is equivalent to t5 t80 t64 t84 ... etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each NT can produce multiple things. So each t in the string must correspond to a production from an NT.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst, the entire string is:\n\nt5 t80 t64 t84 t71 t82 t47 t11 t43 t40 t13 t58 t8 t76 t69 t2 t73 t10 t68 t13 t13 t24 t68 t42 t69 t67 t43 t13 t68 t82 t40 t76 t2\n\nThat's 35 t's in total.\n\nWe need to see if each t is in the language, i.e., each t can be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps starting from the top, let's see if the entire string can be produced by S.\n\nBut since it's a list of t's, perhaps it's better to see which non-terminals correspond to each t.\n\nAlternatively, let's list which non-terminals produce which t's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal can have multiple productions. Let's create a mapping from NT to possible t's:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t11, t74, t84, t17, t55, t80, t58, t0, t55, t58, t41, t58, t76, t82, t13, t44, t58, t41.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Maybe it's better to list all NTs and their terminal productions.\n\nLet me go through each NT and see their options:\n\nNT0 rules:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (So NT0 can produce t10)\nWait, but in the grammar, the first S production is NT0 NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-369","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. So S is the root of the parse tree. Each of these NT0 and NT1 will then produce other non-terminals, which eventually produce terminals or more non-terminals until we get to terminals only.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t55 t64 t36 t73 t2 t2 t69 t11 t47 t2 t76 t66 t46 t58 t66 t2 t36 t46 t50 t11 t44 t82 t84 t80 t63 t41 t17 t13 t40 t52 t46 t12 t51`.\n\nThat's a long string with 34 tokens. I need to see if there's a way to parse this string using the given grammar.\n\nI should start by trying to generate the string step by step, see if the non-terminals can be expanded into this sequence.\n\nLet me see the expansions:\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the entire string must be the combination of what NT0 and NT1 expand into. So the first step is to split the string into two parts: the part generated by NT0 and the part generated by NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, maybe I can find a split point. Let's count the tokens. The entire string has 34 tokens. Let's try splitting it in the middle: around 17 and 17.\n\nWait, but the expansions might be more complex. Maybe I should look for the right split by trying to see which part ends with a terminal that can be generated by NT0 and which part can be generated by NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look at the end of the string and see which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n\nNT0 can expand into several options, including 't5' via NT0 \u2192 NT24 (looking at the rules, I need to check where NT0 leads to 't5'. Wait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the NT0 productions, I see NT0 \u2192 't5' is one of them. So the last 't5' could be from NT0. So the last token is 't5', which would mean that the last symbol is generated by NT0. So that might mean that the rest of the string before this point is generated by NT0, and the initial part generated by NT1.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the initial S is NT0 NT1, so they both need to generate their parts.\n\nBut perhaps I should approach this by trying to generate the string from the start. Let's see.\n\nLet me try to work backwards. The last token is 't5'. From the grammar, NT0 \u2192 't5' is a production. So the last 't5' comes from NT0. Therefore, before that, there must be another symbol generated by NT0, which is part of the string.\n\nWait, no. Because in the production, NT0 can produce a terminal, so the last token is 't5' which comes from NT0, but before that, how was the previous part?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part starts with NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, and NT5 can produce various terminals.\n\nWait, let me try building a parse tree for the given string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be divided into parts where each part can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nBut this might take a while. Let me see if I can find some patterns or possible splits.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt55 t64 t36 t73 t2 t2 t69 t11 t47 t2 t76 t66 t46 t58 t66 t2 t36 t46 t50 t11 t44 t82 t84 t80 t63 t41 t17 t13 t40 t52 t46 t12 t51\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be split into two parts, where NT0 generates the first part and NT1 generates the second part.\n\nBecause S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the string is structured as (NT0's output) followed by (NT1's output).\n\nSo the entire string is the combination of two sequences, each generated by NT0 and NT1 respectively.\n\nSo, I'll need to find if the first part (from t55) is generated by NT0, and the second part (from t64 to t51) is generated by NT1.\n\nSo let me check the second part first. The second part starts with t64, followed by t36, t46, etc.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions: NT1 can produce 't12', 't46', 't58', 't51', etc.\n\nLooking at the second part of the string, let's see if it starts with a known production.\n\nLooking at the last token of the second part: t51. From the grammar, I see NT1 \u2192 't51' is one of the productions. So the last token of the second part is 't51', which comes from NT1. Therefore, the part before that must be generated by NT1 as well.\n\nSo let's take the second part as being generated by NT1: t64, t36, t46, t58, t66, t46, t50, t11, t44, t82, t84, t80, t63, t41, t17, t13, t40, t52, t46, t12, t51.\n\nWe can check each symbol to see if it fits the productions of NT1.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me see if I can find a way to build the parse tree for NT1's part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part can be generated by NT0.\n\nThe first token is t55. Looking at NT0's productions, can NT0 produce t55?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT0: Let's see, NT0 can produce NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, NT9 NT4, etc. Let's check the expansion possibilities.\n\nLooking through NT0's productions, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- Also, looking at the rules, I see a bunch of other productions, but let me check for any direct terminal productions from NT0.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see any direct terminal productions for NT0. So NT0 can only produce a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nSo the first token is t55, which must come from one of the non-terminals downstream from NT0. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see if 't55' can be produced via a chain of non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nFrom the given grammar, there's NT5 \u2192 't55' somewhere?\n\nWait, checking the rules, under NT5: There's NT5 \u2192 't55' in the list. Wait, no: Looking back, I see the rules for NT5 include:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't55' is one of the productions.\n\nYes, so NT5 can produce 't55' directly.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the overall structure, if NT0 can produce NT5 and another non-terminal, then 't55' would be produced.\n\nWait, looking at the rule: Is there a rule where NT0 \u2192 something that produces NT5?\n\nLooking back, I see that NT5 is present in several productions:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n\nNT5 \u2192 't55'\n\nSo yes, NT5 can produce 't55' directly.\n\nBut how would that be produced from NT0?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT0, do any of them produce NT5?\n\nHmm, looking at the NT0 productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- Others: NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, etc.\n\nYes, so NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5. Therefore, NT0 generates NT3 and NT5, which can then be processed.\n\nSo, if the first token is 't55', then from NT0 \u2192 NT5, that would be possible.\n\nSo, the first part of the string ends with 't55', which comes from NT3 NT5.\n\nWait, no: NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5. So that means NT3 and NT5 are both generated as part of NT0's expansion. So, the next tokens would be generated by NT3 and NT5.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nt55 must be the result of NT5.

{"custom_id":"request-377","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is quite long and consists of a series of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's structured with non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) and terminals, which are essentially strings (like 't10', 't12', etc.). The Chomsky normal form for context-free grammars has rules that produce two non-terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal. The rules here all look like that.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t66 t42 t12 t2 t84 t52 t42 t79 t76 t8 t74 t40 t36 t71 t84 t50 t0 t41 t46 t68 t66 t69 t50 t55 t8 t8 t54 t40 t58 t78 t5 t80 t42 t74`.\n\nI need to figure out if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I'll probably need to simulate the parsing process. Let's break down the grammar and see what it's generating.\n\nStarting with S, the initial symbol, the production is S -> NT0 NT1. That means S is the start symbol, and any derivation will begin with NT0 and NT1. So the string must start with what NT0 and NT1 can produce. \n\nLet me look at the possible productions for NT0 and NT1.\n\nFrom NT0:\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 can also sometimes go to 't10', 't64', 't4', etc., but wait, looking again, the terminal productions for NT0 are more specific: NT0 -> 't10', 't64', 't4', 't73', etc. Wait, I think I need to list all the possible terminal productions for each NT.\n\nWait, no. In the given grammar, NT0 has multiple rules, some of which are NT rules and others are terminals. Let me list them all:\n\nNT0:\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't64'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT0 -> 't73'\nNT0 -> 't24'\nNT0 -> 't4' again? Wait, maybe duplicates. So in total, NT0 can either produce two NTs or some terminal tokens.\n\nSimilarly, NT1's productions are:\n\nNT1 -> 't12', 't51', 't67', 't1', 't68'? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the user listed the grammar rules with multiple entries, some like NT0 -> 't10', others like NT1 -> 't12', and so on. So each of these is a terminal production for that non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, the grammar provided seems to have a mix of NT rules and terminal rules. So for example, S -> NT0 NT1, but NT0 can sometimes be a terminal or another combination.\n\nI think I need to list each non-terminal's rules clearly.\n\nLet me try to parse the given string, which is a sequence of tokens. Since the string is a sequence, the grammar must generate this by starting with S, expanding S into NT0 NT1, then each of those into their respective components.\n\nLet me see the entire string:\n\n`t66 t42 t12 t2 t84 t52 t42 t79 t76 t8 t74 t40 t36 t71 t84 t50 t0 t41 t46 t68 t66 t69 t50 t55 t8 t8 t54 t40 t58 t78 t5 t80 t42 t74`.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. I'll need to see if they can be broken down step by step.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT0 NT1. So the first expansion is NT0 followed by NT1.\n\nNow, looking at the string: the first token is 't66'. Let's consider where 't66' comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't66'? Let's check the rules:\n\nLooking through the list of rules, I see NT4 -> 't54', NT5 -> 't51', NT9 -> 't66'. Ah, yes, NT9 has a production NT9 -> 't66'. So 't66' can be produced by NT9.\n\nSo perhaps the first part, NT0, can produce a sequence that includes 't66'. Wait, but NT0's productions are either NT combinations or terminals. Let's see NT0's terminal options: 't10', 't64', 't4', 't73', 't24', 't4' again, 't71', 't36', 't47', and so on. Wait, I need to list all of them properly.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT0 rules:\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't64'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT0 -> 't73'\n- NT0 -> 't24'\n- NT0 -> 't4' (again, same as above)\n- NT0 -> 't73' (again, same as above)\n- NT0 -> 't8' (I think I see a 't8' rule here: NT0 -> 't8')\nWait, looking again: Yes, I see NT0 -> 't8'. So the terminal 't8' is one of the possibilities for NT0.\n\nSo possible options for NT0 are producing NT3 and NT5, or NT9 and NT4, or some specific terminals like 't10', 't64', 't4', 't73', 't24', 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, NT9's productions are:\n- NT9 -> 't68'\n- NT9 -> 't64'\n- NT9 -> 't52'\n- NT9 -> 't44'\n- NT9 -> 't71'\n- NT9 -> 't8'\n- etc. Looking back, yes, NT9 has several terminal productions.\n\nSo for example, 't66' comes from NT9: NT9 -> 't66'\n\nSo in the string, the first token is 't66', which could be from NT9. Then, the overall structure would need to see how that fits.\n\nSo S -> NT0 NT1. Let's say that in the first expansion, NT0 is producing a terminal 't66'. But looking at NT0's rules, does any of them have 't66'? No, NT0's terminals are 't10', 't64', 't4', 't73', 't24', 't8', but not 't66'. So 't66' cannot be directly from NT0. Hence, it's likely that 't66' comes from NT9, which is a direct child of S.\n\nWait, so perhaps the initial expansion is S -> NT0 NT1, where NT1 is producing 't12' as per the string. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with 't66', which as we saw, must come from NT9, which is part of the NT1 side, since S is NT0 NT1.\n\nWait, no: since S is NT0 NT1, after expansion, the first token could be from NT0 or NT1, depending on the expansion.\n\nWait, no: Each NT must be generated in sequence. So the first part is NT0's expansion, then NT1's. So if the first token is 't66', that must come from NT0's expansion, but according to NT0's rules, 't66' isn't a terminal. So the only way is that NT0 is expanding into NT9 first, and then NT1 is expanding into 't12'.\n\nWait, no, that's confusing. Let me clarify: When S expands to NT0 NT1, both NT0 and NT1 are in the output, so the tokens from NT0 come first, followed by tokens from NT1. So the string starts with what NT0 can produce, then what NT1 can produce.\n\nLooking at the first token of the string: 't66'. If that's from NT0, but NT0's only terminals are specific ones, none of which is 't66', so that's not possible. Therefore, it must be that the first token comes from NT1.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because NT0 is before NT1 in S. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parsing can proceed by trying to match the string step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to think of the string as a sequence of nodes that must be connected according to the grammar rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t41 t46 t41 t84 t8 t78 t42 t73 t41 t43 t82 t40 t13 t68 t73 t41 t11 t17 t43 t71 t73 t78 t43 t51 t52 t36 t58 t66 t5 t4 t71 t40 t73 t40.\n\nFirst, I'll list the production rules to see what's available for each non-terminal:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, 't68'\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, 't10', 't10' (duplicate), 't64', 't4', 't9', etc. Wait, let me check each NT0 production properly. It seems NT0 has multiple options:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 't10' [repeated]\nNT0 \u2192 't64', 't4', 't9', 't47', 't51', 't84', 't36', 't78', etc. Maybe I should list all unique productions for each non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly for NT1: it has several productions, including t12, t51, etc.\n\nNT5 has several: 't11', 't71', etc.\n\nI think the string provided is a sequence of terminals, so each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. So the string is a sequence of t41, t46, etc.\n\nNow, the approach is to try to parse the string using the CFG, checking step by step using the productions. But since it's a linear string, a top-down parsing approach like using the CYK algorithm might be useful, but I might have to manage the non-terminals and terminals. Alternatively, I can try to build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a long list of terminals, perhaps the way to see is to see if they can be built using the given rules.\n\nLooking at the first token, t41. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t41.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't4' (token t4)\nNT3 \u2192 't2', 't47'\nNT1 \u2192 't12', 't51'\nNT5 \u2192 't11', 't71', 't74', 't84' (from NT5)\nWait, looking back, for NT5, it's NT5\u2192 NT1 NT1, NT5\u2192t11, NT5\u2192t71, NT5\u2192t84, etc. Wait, maybe I should look in the rules provided:\n\nLooking again at the productions:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't84' is under NT5: 't84' is listed multiple times.\n\nSo, t41 is in NT9? Let me check NT9 productions: NT9 \u2192 't68', 't36', 't64', 't52', etc. So does any NT produce t41?\n\nLooking at NT3: does it produce t41? NT3 has 't4' and 't47', but no t41. NT1 has t12, t51, but not t41. NT9: does any of its productions include t41? Wait no: looking at NT9 rules: It has 't68', 't52', 't44', etc. So no. NT4: 't13', 't40', 't54', 't47', etc. No. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, in NT0: does it ever produce 't41'? Let me check. Looking through, NT0's productions are:\n\nNT0\u2192 NT3 NT5\n\nNT0\u2192 NT9 NT4\n\nNT0\u2192 't10'\n\n'... etc. No, looking through all the NT0 productions, I don't see a 't41' production. So t41 must come from NT9, NT3, NT1, NT5, or perhaps another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check all the NT9 productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't68' (multiple instances), 't52', 't44', 't71', 't36', 't78', 't74', etc. So, looking for t41 in NT9 productions. Hmm, no. So how does t41 get produced? Maybe via a non-terminal that has an expansion including t41. But in the given grammar, none of the NT's directly produce t41. So that's a problem because t41 is a terminal that isn't a production of any NT.\n\nWait, unless I made a mistake in parsing the productions. Let me re-examine each NT production:\n\nLooking at NT9: The first production is NT9\u2192 NT1 NT5. Second: 't68'. Third: NT0 NT4. Fifth: 't36', etc. So yes, no 't41' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT0: Does it have any production that includes t41? Let's check all the NT0 rules. There's a NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, which is two NTs, not terminals. The only way to get t41 is if one of the NTs in their production directly outputs it, which they don't seem to do.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the NT9 can produce t41 via a chain? But no NT has a production that includes t41 as a terminal. So if the string contains t41, which no NT can generate, that means the string can't be produced by the grammar, which would result in 'No'.\n\nBut wait a minute, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check. Let's see all NT's productions:\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce 't41':\n\n- NT9: as above, no.\n\n- NT0: let's see: NT0's rules are:\n\n1. NT0\u2192 NT3 NT5\n\n2. NT0\u2192 NT9 NT4\n\n3. NT0\u2192 't10'\n\n4. 't64'\n\n5. 't4'\n\n6. 't9' (but looking back at the user's input, 't9' is in the rules?)\n\nWait, in the user's input's grammar, the NT0 production has several options, including 't10', 't64', 't4', 't9' (maybe? Wait, looking again: the user wrote the grammar as:\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nHmm, but in the user's provided grammar, are there t9, etc., or am I miscounting? Oh wait, looking at the user's grammar, in multiple points, I see NT0 \u2192 't10' and some other options. So t10, t64, t4, t9, etc. So 't4' and 't10' are terminals. But none of them is t41.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Did I miss a production that includes t41? Let me list all the NT terminals they directly produce:\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\nNT0 produces: 't10', 't64', 't4', 't9', etc.\n\nNT1: 't12', 't51'\n\nNT3: 't2', 't47'\n\nNT4: 't13', 't40', 't54', 't47'\n\nNT5: 't11', 't71', 't74', 't84'\n\nNT9: 't68', 't52', 't44', 't71', 't36', 't78', 't74'\n\nSo no NT directly produces 't41'. So that would mean that 't41' can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated. So the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the string has 't41's that are part of a longer production? For example, if 't41' is part of a sequence that's produced by a longer rule.\n\nWait, but 't41' is a terminal, so it has to appear in the string as a single token. Since no NT can produce it directly, that token can't appear in any output of the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string contains 't41', which is not possible given the grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t8 t63 t79 t10 t67 t64 t80 t76 t68 t24 t63 t40 t82 t66 t50 t73 t36 t4 t55 t12 t24 t79 t46 t69 t67 t24 t0 t11 t55 t71 t36 t13 t55 t43 t47`.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and its only production is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the string must be composed as a sequence where the first part comes from NT0 and the second from NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t8, so let's see how t8 can be generated. I need to find the production rules that generate t8.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT0 can produce 't8' via NT0 \u2192 t8. So the first part of S will be NT0 \u2192 t8.\n\nNow, the string starts with t8, which is the beginning of NT0's expansion. The next element is t63, so after the initial t8, we need to generate t63. But wait, in CNF, each step produces one non-terminal, so the string is a series of terminals generated from the productions.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this as a parsing problem. Since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps a recursive descent parser or the CYK algorithm could help. But perhaps for a small string, I can try expanding it step by step.\n\nWait, another approach is to model this as a tree. The string must be derived from S, and each step of the grammar must produce the correct terminals in order.\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nSo the string starts with NT0's expansion. Let's see where t8 is generated. From the rules, NT0 can go directly to 't8' via the production NT0 \u2192 t8. So the initial part would be t8.\n\nThe next part after t8 is t63. Now, after NT0 produces t8, the remaining part of S is NT1, which needs to produce the rest starting with t63. But wait, S's two parts are NT0 and NT1, so the entire string is a concatenation.\n\nWait, that's not right. The whole string is a single production. Let's see, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the entire string must be NT0's output followed by NT1's output. So the string is the concatenation of two parts: the first part comes from NT0, the second from NT1.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's a flat list of terminals: after t8, it's t63, t79, etc., all the way to t47. So it's one single string where the first part is generated by NT0 and the second by NT1.\n\nSo the entire string is NT0's expansion followed by NT1's expansion.\n\nLet me now look at the string. The first symbol is t8, which is directly produced by NT0. So from S, it's NT0 \u2192 t8.\n\nNow, after t8, the next part is t63. This would have to come from whatever production NT0 uses next, but since in CNF, each production produces exactly one terminal or a non-terminal that produces terminals. So perhaps, after the first step, the next production from NT0 would generate another terminal.\n\nWait, but NT0 in the rules has several productions. For example, NT0 can produce NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, or directly t8. So t8 is generated directly, but if NT0 goes down a non-terminal path, that would require more steps.\n\nSo the string after t8 is t63, t79, t10, etc. Let me see if t63 can be generated by NT0 or NT1.\n\nWait, let's think about how the string is built. Since S starts with NT0 and NT1, the entire string is a concatenation of whatever NT0 produces and whatever NT1 produces.\n\nGiven that, let's separate the string into two parts: the part from NT0 and the part from NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is t8, which is directly from NT0. So the second part of the string (starting from t63) must come from NT1.\n\nWait, is that correct? Yes, because S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so NT0 is the first part, followed by NT1. So the entire string is the concatenation of NT0's output and NT1's output.\n\nTherefore, the first part is generated by NT0: t8, t63, ... up to t47.\n\nWait, let's split the string into two parts: from S \u2192 NT0 and then NT1.\n\nWait, the string is `t8 t63 t79 t10 t67 t64 t80 t76 t68 t24 t63 t40 t82 t66 t50 t73 t36 t4 t55 t12 t24 t79 t46 t69 t67 t24 t0 t11 t55 t71 t36 t13 t55 t43 t47`.\n\nSo total 36 elements. So if we split the first part as generated by NT0, let's see how many elements that could be.\n\nI think NT0 can have a certain number of expansions, each adding 1 or more symbols. But perhaps it's easier to try to simulate the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree where the entire string is the root, split into NT0 and NT1, then recursively check if each part can be generated by their respective non-terminals.\n\nSo starting with the whole string, we split it into [t8, t63, t79, t10, t67, t64, t80, t76, t68, t24, t63, t40, t82, t66, t50, t73, t36, t4, t55, t12, t24, t79, t46, t69, t67, t24, t0, t11, t55, t71, t36, t13, t55, t43, t47], and NT0 is the head (S \u2192 NT0 NT1), so the first element must be generated by NT0, and the rest after by NT1.\n\nBut wait, no. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the first part is NT0's expansion, followed by NT1's expansion. So the entire string is NT0's output concatenated with NT1's output. Therefore, the entire string must be derived by NT0 as the first part, then NT1 as the second.\n\nWait, that can't be right because NT0 and NT1 are non-terminals, so each can produce a sequence of terminals. Therefore, the entire string is the concatenation of the string produced by NT0 and the string produced by NT1.\n\nSo, the string starts with the production of NT0, followed by the production of NT1. Therefore, the first part is the part from NT0, and the second part is from NT1.\n\nSo, to check if the string is in the language, we can split the string into two parts, one generated by NT0 and the other by NT1.\n\nBut how many elements are in each part? That's the problem. Because NT0 can produce variable lengths. It could be 1 symbol, or more, depending on the path taken.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach this by parsing the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nSo, first, the start symbol is S, which must produce NT0 NT1. So the first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nNow, the string is the concatenation of NT0's derivation and NT1's derivation. So, the entire string is a derivation where NT0 and NT1 produce their respective strings in order.\n\nSo, the entire string is t8, t63, t79, t10,... t47.\n\nTherefore, we can split the string into two parts: part1 from NT0 and part2 from NT1.\n\nBut where to split? Since NT0 may produce the first k symbols, and NT1 may produce the remaining.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky because we don't know k. So maybe another approach is to try to find a way to derive the string using the given grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps constructing a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me create a list of the symbols in the string:\n\nSymbols: [t8, t63, t79, t10, t67, t64, t80, t76, t68, t24, t63, t40, t82,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-381","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is: `t58 t12 t58 t12 t84 t46 t13 t36 t24 t0 t46 t2 t79 t44 t80 t74 t71 t2 t51 t76 t11 t2 t40 t0 t76 t24 t64 t52 t63 t69 t24 t5 t13 t51 t66`. \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar and see how the string can be parsed using these rules. The grammar consists of several non-terminals (S, NT0, NT1, NT9, etc.) and terminals, which are the symbols like 't58', 't12', etc. \n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, which produces NT0 NT1. So the entire string must start with a sequence derived from NT0 and NT1. \n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into tokens: each token is between the spaces, like 't58', 't12', etc.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the string can be parsed into a structure that matches S \u2192 NT0 NT1. That means the string should start with something that NT0 can produce and be followed by something that NT1 can produce.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT0:\n- NT3 NT5\n- NT9 NT4\n- NT0 NT5 (but wait, is this a separate rule or a continuation? No, in CNF, each production is separate, so I think NT0 can produce NT9 NT4, NT0 NT5, NT3 NT5, and others as per the provided rules. Wait, looking back, NT0 has multiple options. Let me list them properly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 has multiple production rules. Let me make a list:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT0 NT5 (wait, is this correct? Because in Chomsky normal form, each production has exactly two non-terminals. So it's allowed to have left recursion, but in this case, it's NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT5, which is a direct left recursion. Hmm, that might complicate things because direct left recursion can't be handled directly by simple parsers, but since we're not coding, maybe we can figure it out.\n\nBut wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT0 NT5\nYes, that's one of the rules. So NT0 can produce NT0 NT5, which is a problem because it leads to recursion. However, in Chomsky normal form, sometimes we can transform left-recursive grammars into equivalent forms without left recursion. But for the purpose of checking a string, maybe I can see if the recursion can be used to generate the string.\n\nWait, but in the given string, I'm seeing that after t0 comes t46, etc. So maybe the recursion isn't used here. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if we can break it down into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nSo the string starts with NT0, then NT1. Let's see what NT0 can produce. Let's look at the possible derivations of NT0.\n\nNT0 has several options:\n- It can go to NT0 NT5, which would allow for recursion, but then we need to see if t0 is part of that. Looking at the string, after the starting NT0 and NT1, let's see how the string is structured.\n\nWait, let me approach this step by step.\n\n1. The entire string must be generated by S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the first part (NT0) and the second part (NT1) must both be derived.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts. But the string is a single list of tokens. So it's a bit tricky because the split between NT0 and NT1 isn't obvious until we parse the entire string.\n\nWait, no. The string is flat; we can't easily split it into two parts without seeing how each non-terminal generates the tokens. So perhaps it's better to model this as a parse tree where the root is S, then NT0 and NT1, and each of those can produce sequences of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a way to split the string into parts that match the productions of NT0 and NT1.\n\nLet me look for the start: After S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the string starts with some sequence that NT0 can generate.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t58, t12, t58, t12, t84, etc.\n\nWait, but that's a long string. Maybe I can try to find a way to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first part: 't58 t12'. Let's see if that can be produced by NT0 or NT1.\n\nLooking at the NT0 productions, does any of them produce 't58 t12'?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider if 't58' can come from NT0. Looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at NT0:\n\nNT0 can produce various combinations. For instance, NT0 can produce NT3 NT5. Let's see if 't58' can come from NT3 or NT5.\n\nLooking at NT3 and NT5:\n\nNT3 has production rules:\n- NT47\n- NT51\n- NT43\n- etc.\n\nNT5's productions include producing 't84', 't54', etc.\n\nWait, so for example, NT5 could produce 't84' because in the grammar, NT5 \u2192 't84'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT5 has the production 't84' as one of the options, right? Because looking at the rules, NT5 can go to 't84', 't54', 't0', etc.\n\nYes, looking back: NT5 \u2192 't84', among others.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 can produce 't58' because in the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't58' is one of its productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT3's productions, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't47', 't51', 't43', etc. Wait, does it also have a production to 't58'? Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nAfter several lines:\n...\nNT3 \u2192 't47'\nNT3 \u2192 't51'\nNT3 \u2192 't43'\n...\n\nWait, no, I don't see an explicit rule for NT3 \u2192 't58'. Wait, let me check again. The string has t58 appearing multiple times.\n\nHmm. Let me scan the grammar for NT3:\n\nLooking for NT3 in the right-hand sides:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't47'\n- NT3 \u2192 't51'\n- NT3 \u2192 't43'\n- NT3 \u2192 't4'\n- NT3 \u2192 't79'\n- NT3 \u2192 't44'\n- NT3 \u2192 't50'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't42'\n- NT3 \u2192 't51'\n\nWait, I don't see an NT3 \u2192 't58' production. So the 't58' would have to be generated by another non-terminal. So perhaps 't58' is generated by NT9.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't68', 't52', 't64', 't56', etc. Wait, wait, let's list NT9's rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 can produce several things:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- NT9 \u2192 't52'\n- NT9 \u2192 't64'\n- NT9 \u2192 't47' (from NT5's rule)\n- etc.\n\nWait, no, let me check all NT9 rules:\n\nNT9:\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- NT9 \u2192 't52'\n- NT9 \u2192 't64'\n- NT9 \u2192 't47' (Wait, does it?

The string to evaluate is `t40 t66 t44 t67 t36 t40 t69 t44 t43 t46 t40 t82 t67 t24 t76 t46 t12 t74 t40 t4 t10 t73 t79 t79 t43 t0 t55 t67 t17 t55 t55 t50 t55 t41 t82 t13`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this structure, so that's a good start.\n\nMy approach should be to try to parse the string using the given grammar rules. Since the grammar might be quite complex with many non-terminals, I'll need to see if there's a systematic way to approach this.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S, which produces NT0 NT1. So, the entire string must be a combination of these two non-terminals. Let me write down the string as a sequence of tokens and see if I can split it into two parts that can each be generated by NT0 and NT1 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string: `t40 t66 t44 t67 t36 t40 t69 t44 t43 t46 t40 t82 t67 t24 t76 t46 t12 t74 t40 t4 t10 t73 t79 t79 t43 t0 t55 t67 t17 t55 t55 t50 t55 t41 t82 t13`.\n\nI need to split this into two parts, say left and right, each generated by NT0 and NT1, respectively, or vice versa. But since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the first part should come from NT0 and the second from NT1. Alternatively, if the grammar allows, maybe NT1 can come first, but from the rules, S starts with NT0 and NT1, so probably NT0 first, then NT1.\n\nSo, I'll try to see if the first half of the string can be generated by NT0 and the second half by NT1. Alternatively, if the split isn't obvious, I might need to backtrack. But given the length of the string, it's a bit tricky. The string has 35 tokens, so the split might not be exactly in the middle. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step, applying the productions to see if I can consume all tokens.\n\nLet me start by looking at the initial symbols. The first symbol is t40. Looking at the NT0 productions, I see that NT0 can go to several things, including NT9 NT4, NT3 NT5, etc. Let me check which of these have t40 as part of their rules.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT0 (which seems odd)\n- NT0 -> NT0 NT3\n- NT0 -> NT1 NT1\nWait, I need to check the rules again. From the user's grammar, I'll list the relevant ones:\n\n- NT0 can produce NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, NT0 NT3, NT0 NT1 (from NT0 -> NT9 NT0?), but I need to look carefully.

Let me check: The user's list includes NT0 -> NT9 NT0, and NT0 -> NT0 NT3, and NT0 -> NT0 NT1. Wait, no, actually looking again, the user wrote:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nNT0 -> NT0 NT3\n\nNT9 -> 't68'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT3 -> 't2', 't47'\n\nNT4 -> 't47', 't4'\n\nNT5 -> 't11', 't17', etc.\n\nWait, under NT0, the productions are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT3 (left recursion?)\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT1 (also left recursion)\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't64' (from multiple rules, like NT0 \u2192 NT4 \u2192 't47' perhaps?)\n\nSimilarly, there are other NT0 rules.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to list all possible NT0 productions:\n\n1. NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n\n2. NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n\n3. NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT3 (this is recursive)\n\n4. NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT1 (also recursive)\n\n5. NT0 \u2192 't10'\n\n6. NT0 \u2192 't64' (I think this is through other non-terminals. Wait, for example, NT0 can go to NT4, which can go to 't47', but perhaps through another path. Wait, looking back, under 't64' it lists several NT0 rules, but perhaps 't64' is a terminal, so when NT0 produces 't64', that would be matched.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, 't64' is a terminal, so any NT0 production that directly produces 't64' is a terminal, so that's a terminal symbol. So, 't64' is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, 't4' is a terminal, etc.\n\nSo, for NT0, some of the rules are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t10 (directly, as a terminal)\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t64 (another direct terminal production)\n\n- Other recursive rules which might produce more non-terminals, but given that the string is finite, it's likely that such rules won't be used except perhaps in the initial steps.\n\nGiven that, I'll approach the string as follows:\n\nThe string starts with t40. Let's see what can produce t40.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, the only t40 would come from NT0\u2192t40? Wait, no. Looking at the NT0 rules, there is no direct production of 't40' in the given grammar. So, how do we produce t40?\n\nWait, maybe the initial S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which produces a sequence of symbols starting with what NT0 can produce. So if the string starts with t40, that must come from either NT0 or NT1, but NT1's rules are:\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't14' (I think, but let me check the user's message). Wait, under NT1, I see:\n\n- NT1\u2192 't12'\n\n- NT1\u2192t51\n\n- And others like t14, t46, etc. Wait, looking in the user's grammar, under NT1, there are several rules:\n\n- NT1\u2192t12\n\n- NT1\u2192t51\n\n- NT1\u2192t46\n\n- NT1\u2192t80\n\n- NT1\u2192t14?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all NT1 rules as per the user's message:\n\nFrom the user's message:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT1 -> 't51'\n\nNT1 -> 't46'\n\nNT1 -> 't80'\n\nWait, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me list all NT1 productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't51'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't46'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't80'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 other rules possibly, but perhaps I have to check. No, the user's messages for NT1 are: 't12', 't51', 't46', 't80', and another line says NT1\u2192't46' again (probably a typo, but perhaps not). So, in any case, the important point is that NT1 can produce certain terminals, including t46. So if the string starts with t40, but NT1 can't produce t40 directly.

CNF is useful because it simplifies parsing, but since I'm not doing parsing here, I can just look at the production rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. Then, each NT symbol (like NT0, NT1, NT9, etc.) has its own production rules, some of which are terminals and others are combinations of NT symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t74 t5 t54 t4 t36 t43 t5 t46 t73 t0 t82 t4 t66 t4 t46 t4 t46 t36 t84 t11 t44 t66 t8 t51 t82 t68 t36 t36 t36 t80 t12 t79 t69 t76 t82 t66`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like t74, t5, etc. So, each token in the string is a terminal symbol consisting of 't' followed by a number.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal. Given the right structure, the string should be a leftmost derivation from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me break down what I need to do:\n\n1. Parse the given string according to the grammar and see if it can be generated.\n\n2. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can proceed by looking for where each symbol can be split into two parts that match the left-hand side of the productions.\n\n3. I can try to split the string into symbols and see which production rules apply, ensuring that each step follows the grammar correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the terminal symbols present in the string, which are: t74, t5, t54, t4, t36, t43, t5, t46, t73, t0, t82, t4, t66, t4, t46, t4, t46, t36, t84, t11, t44, t66, t8, t51, t82, t68, t36, t36, t36, t80, t12, t79, t69, t76, t82, t66.\n\nThat's a lot of symbols. The string is quite long, which suggests that the grammar might have a long derivation sequence.\n\nI'll start from the start symbol S, which produces NT0 NT1. So, the first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nNow, let's go through each symbol step by step.\n\n1. The first symbol is t74. Let's look at the productions for NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: NT0 can produce NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, or sometimes a terminal. Let's see: NT0's rules include NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, several others, and also some specific terminals like t10, t47, etc.\n\nLooking for t74 in NT0 or NT1. Let's see NT1's productions: NT1 \u2192 t12, t43, t5, t67. Wait, that can't be because the first production for NT1 is 't12' or 't43' or 't5' or 't67'. But the first symbol is t74, which isn't any of those. So maybe I've made a mistake. Wait, no, wait: NT1's productions are as follows:\n\nWait, let me list NT1's rules from the grammar:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12' (rule 14)\nNT1 \u2192 't43' (rule 16)\nNT1 \u2192 't5' (rule 20)\nNT1 \u2192 't67' (rule 23)\n\nSo, NT1's terminal options are t12, t43, t5, t67. The first symbol is t74, which is not any of these. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless... Wait, maybe I misread NT1's rules. Let me check again.\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT1 can produce t12, t43, t5, or t67. So the first symbol t74 doesn't match any NT1 rules, meaning that if S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the first symbol of the string must come from either NT0 or NT1, depending on which symbol is first in their expansion.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, when we derive, it's leftmost derivation, so the NT0 comes first, then NT1. So the first symbol of the string should come from NT0's possible productions. Alternatively, maybe the NT1's productions could also contribute to the first symbol. Wait, no, because S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the leftmost symbol is whatever NT0 can produce first, followed by whatever NT1 can produce.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t74. Let me see where t74 appears.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see NT5 \u2192 't74' because in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't74' (probably rule 26: NT5 \u2192 't74').\n\nSo if I look for t74, it comes from NT5. So I need to get t74 in the string, which would come from NT5.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So, for S to produce t74, one of the symbols NT0 or NT1 must produce t74. Let's check the options for NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking back at NT0's rules, in the grammar:\n\nNT0 can produce NT3 NT5, or NT9 NT4, or several other non-terminals, and also has a rule: NT0 \u2192 't4' (rule 12), but that's t4, not t74.\n\nWait, but looking for NT0's rules, there's no direct t74, unless it's in another part.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should check if t74 can be produced by either NT0 or NT1. If the string's first symbol is t74, that can't come from NT1 because NT1 only produces t12, t43, t5, t67. So it must come from NT0.\n\nBut looking at NT0's rules, it seems that NT0 doesn't directly produce t74. Let's see: NT0's rules include things like NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (rule 2), and other combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a production in NT0. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT0's rules include various combinations, like NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, but no t74.\n\nWait, so unless t74 is somewhere else.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at all NT0's rules, none of them produce 't74' directly, but perhaps via combinations.\n\nWait, no. Because in the grammar, NT5 can produce 't74' as a direct terminal. So, perhaps the first t74 comes from an NT5 somewhere in the derivation, but S starts as NT0 NT1, so unless either NT0 or NT1 can produce t74, which seems neither can. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recheck the grammar. Let me list all NT symbols and see which can produce t74.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list each NT and see their possible terminal symbols:\n\n- NT3: in the rules, I see 't2' (rule 17), 't47' (rule 18), 't4' (rule 25). So t2, t47, t4.\n\n- NT4: 't47' (rule 28), 't54' (rule 29), 't58' (rules 32, 34), 't4' (rule 40), etc.\n\n- NT5: 't74' (rule 26), among others.\n\n- NT9: 't68' (rule 6), 't51' (rule 9), 't64' (multiple rules, like 10, 13, 19, 22), etc.\n\n- NT0: 't10' (rule 11), 't4' (rule 12), 't9' (rule 15, rule 24?), etc.\n\nWait, in NT5's rules, t74 is present.\n\nWait, but since S starts as NT0 NT1,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar has several non-terminals (NT) that can expand into other non-terminals or terminal symbols (like 't' followed by numbers). \n\nFirst, the string to evaluate is: `t50 t68 t66 t58 t17 t69 t36 t73 t17 t5 t82 t73 t76 t64 t58 t54 t73 t73 t4 t82 t84 t84 t0 t51 t79 t40 t5 t69 t0 t46 t71 t52 t74 t73 t79 t8 t52`.\n\nThe grammar is quite extensive, with multiple rules for each non-terminal. I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the initial production: S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the string must start with the concatenation of something from NT0 and something from NT1.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions, I see NT1 can go to 't12' or 't67'. In the string, the second token is 't68', so that's not directly from NT1. Wait, no, NT1's second expansion is 't67', but in the string, the second token is 't68', which isn't one of NT1's terminals. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's double-check. The string starts with 't50' followed by 't68'. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the string must start with whatever NT0 expands to followed by NT1's expansion.\n\nSo, looking at NT0, it has several rules. Let's list NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- And others, but let's check if the first token 't50' matches any of NT0's terminals.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules, 't10' is one of them, but the first token is 't50'. So, how can NT0 produce 't50'? Looking at all NT0's rules, I don't see 't50' as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-406","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to decide whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar. I'll start by understanding the problem and then figure out a way to approach it.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. The productions are all two symbols on the right-hand side except when the right-hand side is a single terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, the productions should have two non-terminals or a terminal, but in this case, all productions have two non-terminals except the ones where they're terminals. Looking at the grammar, I see that some rules have terminals on the right side, like NT5 \u2192 't71' or NT9 \u2192 't68'. So that's fine because CNF allows some productions to be terminals as a way to get to the terminal strings.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t54 t68 t43 t84 t17 t66 t63 t51 t80 t76 t82 t51 t66 t10 t74 t71 t79 t43 t80 t24 t74 t50 t63 t24 t13 t82 t42 t73 t80 t55 t71 t58 t43 t52 t69 t13 t71.\n\nThat's a long string, so I need a systematic way to parse it. Parsing in CNF can be done using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, perhaps I can construct a parse tree step by step or at least check the possible derivations.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the grammar and the string. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT0 NT1. So the string must be a concatenation of symbols derived from NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t54, followed by t68, t43, etc. Let's see what can produce t54. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT5 \u2192 t71, but that's not helpful. Wait, let's check each rule:\n\nNT0: several productions, one of which is NT0 \u2192 t5 from the given rules (NT0 -> 't5'). So t54 isn't produced by NT0. Hmm, perhaps I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, actually, the first symbol is t54, which should be the start of the string. The start is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the string is a concatenation of what comes from NT0 and NT1. So, let's split the string into two parts: the part from NT0 and the part from NT1.\n\nBut I need to see how the production can split. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the entire string must be the concatenation of the derivation of NT0 and NT1.\n\nLet me see what each part of the string can represent. The first symbol is t54, which is somewhere in the rules. Looking up, I see NT5 \u2192 t71, but also NT5 \u2192 t55 and others. Oh, wait, in the given grammar, NT5 \u2192 't55'. So t54 is not directly produced by NT5, but maybe it's through another rule.\n\nWait, let's list out all the rules for each NT:\n\nNT0:\n- NT3 NT5\n- NT9 NT4\n- NT0 NT3\n- 't5'\n- other rules ending with t64, t4, etc.\n\nNT1:\n- NT1 NT5\n- 't12'\n- 't47' (in several rules)\n- 't67'\n\nWait, the first symbol is t54. Let's check NT0 and NT1 to see if their productions can yield t54.\n\nLooking at the NT0 rules, one of them is NT0 \u2192 NT5 because NT0 has several rules, but looking at the given rules, I see NT5 \u2192 't55' and others, but no direct production for t54 from NT0. Similarly, NT1 has productions to terminals, e.g., 't67'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the NT0 rules:\n\n1. NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n2. NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n3. NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT3\n4. NT0 \u2192 't5'\n5. Then, other rules for NT0 like 't64', 't4', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see an NT0 \u2192 t54 in the given rules. So t54 must come from one of the NT rules that derive to t54.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check NT5: looking at the rules for NT5, I see NT5 \u2192 't71', and some others, but no 't54' directly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t54 is part of a larger derivation. For example, suppose NT0 is expanded into t34 and then t54. But I'm not seeing a rule that directly produces t54. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look more carefully. Let me list out all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, all the rules that end with a string like 't...':\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't71'\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT3 \u2192 't43', 't4', 't51', 't42', etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 't47', 't54', etc.\n- NT9 (multiple rules)\nWait, for example, NT4 has several rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT5 (from NT5 \u2192 t55?), but also NT4 \u2192 't47', 't54', 't82', etc. Wait, looking at the given rules:\n\nNT4:\n- NT5 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n- NT4 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 't55'\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, so NT4 can produce t54 directly. So, in the string, t54 must come from NT4. Then, the part before t54 is the expansion of NT0 and the part after is NT1. Wait, no: S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the entire string is from NT0 and then NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should split the string into two parts where the first part is generated by NT0 and the second by NT1.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\n1. The string is a sequence of terminals. The grammar must generate this sequence through production rules.\n\n2. The first production rule is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Therefore, the string should be a concatenation of the derivations from NT0 and NT1.\n\n3. So, the first symbol must be derived from NT0, and the last symbol must be derived from NT1.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Because the NT0 and NT1 can be at any length, as long as the entire string is the concatenation. So, maybe the first part is NT0 derived into a certain string, and the second part is NT1 derived into another string.\n\nSo, to parse the entire string, it's a leftmost derivation where S produces NT0 NT1, which then expands into a string of symbols, each step replacing a non-terminal with its productions.\n\nGiven that the string is: t54 t68 t43 t84 t17 t66 t63 t51 t80 t76 t82 t51 t66 t10 t74 t71 t79 t43 t80 t24 t74 t50 t63 t24 t13 t82 t42 t73 t80 t55 t71 t58 t43 t52 t69 t13 t71.\n\nThat's 37 symbols. So, starting from S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the entire string is the result of NT0 expanding to a certain string, then NT1 expanding to another, concatenated together.\n\nSo, perhaps I can try to split the string into two parts, each part derived from NT0 and NT1.\n\nBut first, I need to see what's possible for NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nFor NT0:\n- production rules include: NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, NT0 NT3, as well as several other rules to terminals (like 't5', 't64', 't4', etc.)\n\nFor NT1:\n- production rules include: NT1 NT5, as well as several terminal rule like 't12', 't47', 't67', etc.\n\nSo, first, I should see if 't54' is in the derived symbols of NT0."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That helps because it simplifies the way I can parse the string using a CYK algorithm or by attempting a top-down approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands into NT0 NT1 (S -> NT0 NT1). So the string must start with two non-terminals, NT0 and NT1.\n\nNext, I'll break down the string into components to see if each part can be derived from the non-terminals. The string is a sequence of tokens like t43, t12, etc., which are terminals.\n\nLet me try to outline the possible productions and see if I can match the string step by step.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT0 NT1. So the first symbol in the string should come from NT0 and the next from NT1. But wait, the string starts with t43, which is a terminal. So I need to see if t43 can be derived from NT0 or NT1.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT0 and NT1:\n\n- NT0 can produce many things like NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, etc.\n- NT1 can produce NT1 NT5 or 't12'. Wait, 't12' is a terminal. So NT1 produces t12 directly.\n\nIf NT1 can produce t12, then the second token in the string, which is t12, must come from NT1. So the second token is t12, which matches NT1 -> t12.\n\nSo the second token is 't12' which is good because NT1 -> 't12' is a production.\n\nNow, the first token is t43. So t43 must be derived from NT0. Let's check what NT0 can produce.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT0, I see NT0 -> NT3 NT4. So to get t43, I have to see if either NT3 or NT4 can produce t43.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions: NT3 -> 't43' is one of the options. So if NT3 can produce t43, then that's how the first token is generated.\n\nSo for the first token, t43 comes from NT3. So the breakdown is:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\nNT0 -> NT3 NT4\nNT3 -> t43\nSo the first part is covered.\n\nNow, moving to the next part of the string. The next token after t43 should come from what's left in NT0 and NT1. Since NT0 is now expanded into NT3 NT4, the next symbol after t43 should come from NT3 or NT4 or a combination, but actually, since NT3 is a non-terminal that expands into t43 (a terminal), it's done. So the next symbol should come from NT1, which is t12 as previously established.\n\nWait, no, after S expands to NT0 NT1, NT0 becomes NT3 NT4, which might have their own productions. Let me clarify the order.\n\nWait, S is NT0 NT1, and S generates the entire string. So the string is a sequence of symbols generated by NT0 followed by NT1.\n\nBut NT0 can produce multiple things, each of which can generate more symbols. So, perhaps it's better to split the entire string into parts corresponding to NT0 and NT1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using CYK algorithm would be a better approach here. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, the string is: t43 t12 t82 t54 t8 t44 t4 t68 t71 t43 t74 t52 t0 t11 t4 t43 t63 t12 t5 t47 t42 t46 t69 t55 t36 t55 t73 t40 t67 t2 t71 t58 t41 t42 t41 t2 t24 t24\n\nCounting the tokens: let's see, that's 38 tokens. Phew.\n\nSo, I need to create a table where rows are the symbols of the string, and columns are the positions. For each cell (i,j), I check if the substring from i to j can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nBut given the size, this might be tedious, but perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since the string starts with t43 and t12, and I know that NT1 can directly produce t12, I can tentatively say that t12 comes from NT1. Then t43 comes from NT3, which is part of NT0. \n\nLet me check other possible paths. For example, after t43, the next part is t12, which is good because NT1 can produce it directly. So the string after t43 is t12, which comes from NT1.\n\nWait, but the entire string is \"t43 t12 ...\", so after S generates NT0 NT1, the NT0 part starts with NT3 NT4, which produces t43, and then the NT1 part starts with t12. So the string is built as t43 t12 followed by what comes from the rest of the NT0 expansion and the rest of the NT1 expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t43, which must come from NT0, since S starts with NT0. The next symbol is t12, which comes from NT1.\n\nSo the first two symbols are t43 (from NT0) and t12 (from NT1), which aligns with S -> NT0 NT1. \n\nNow, let's see what's next. After t43 t12, the next symbols are t82, t54, etc. So let's see what can come after t12 from NT1.\n\nWait, NT1's productions are NT1 NT5 or 't12'. Once it produces 't12', it can no longer produce non-terminals. So after t12, the next part must be generated by the latter half of the S expansion, which is NT1, but once it has produced 't12', it can't produce more symbols unless it's generating a sequence that allows multiple non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let's recall that S -> NT0 NT1, and both NT0 and NT1 are non-terminals. So the string is built as (expansion of NT0) followed by (expansion of NT1). So after NT0 generates its symbols, NT1 continues generating the rest.\n\nSo, after the first two symbols (t43 from NT0 and t12 from NT1), the next symbols are generated by NT1's expansion, but since t12 is already a terminal, NT1 can't generate any more non-terminals after that. Wait, no, because NT1 can derive more sequences. Let's check NT1's productions again.\n\nNT1 -> 't12' is one possibility, but it can also do NT1 NT5. So after producing 't12', can it produce anything else? No, because NT1 is a single non-terminal that can only produce either 't12' or 'NT1 NT5'. But once it has produced a terminal, it can't produce further non-terminals unless it's doing something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think differently. Since S is NT0 followed by NT1, and each non-terminal can produce a string of symbols. So if NT1 can produce a series of terminals, then the part after the symbols generated by NT0 would be exactly what NT1 can produce.\n\nIn this case, the string after t43 t12 is the rest of the string. Let's check what NT1 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions: NT1 -> 't12' (terminal), or NT1 -> 'NT1 NT5'. Wait, but 'NT1 NT5' means it can produce a series of symbols: NT1 followed by NT5.\n\nNT1 NT5 would then need to generate a sequence of symbols. Let's see what NT5 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT5's productions: NT5 -> 't11', 't51', 't54', 't82', 't44', 't84', etc. It seems NT5 can produce a lot of terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT5 -> 't11', 't51', 't54', 't82', 't44', 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-416","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, Chomsky Normal Form means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? And all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe grammar given has a bunch of NT productions. Let me list out the production rules to make it clearer. Starting with the start symbol S, it's rewritten as NT0 NT1. So the string starts with NT0 followed by NT1, and each of those will eventually be transformed into terminal symbols or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. Let me count how many symbols there are. Starting from t8 and ending at t42, each symbol is a terminal. So the string has a certain number of terminals, and each should be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either a non-terminal decomposing into two non-terminals or into a single terminal. So to generate the string, each symbol must be produced directly by a non-terminal that can go to that terminal, or through a series of decompositions.\n\nFirst, I should check if the string's length is compatible with the grammar. In CNF, each production reduces the number of symbols either by replacing one non-terminal with two non-terminals (thus increasing the count) or replacing it directly to a terminal (leaving the count the same). But for the given string, each rule is two steps, so from S, which is NT0 NT1, each NT will eventually produce a series of terminals that multiply in length based on how they expand.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to parse the string with the given grammar, starting from S and recursively applying the productions to match the string.\n\nAlternatively, since this could be complex without a parser, perhaps I can model this as a top-down approach or try to see if each symbol can be matched to some NT production.\n\nLet me try to start by looking at the first symbol: t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, which non-terminal produces t8?\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT5: one of them is NT5 \u2192 t8. So NT5 can directly produce t8.\n\nBut S starts as NT0 NT1. So I suppose I need to apply production rules to NT0 and NT1 until I derive the entire string.\n\nWait, but without a parse tree or a way to track each step, this might be tricky. Perhaps I can see if the string can be split into sub-strings that correspond to the production rules of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a top-down parser, perhaps I can start by matching the entire string. But that's complicated without doing it step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each symbol can be derived by some NT. For example, t8 is directly produced by NT5. So perhaps the first part is NT5, but S is NT0 NT1, so S's production is used, so the next step is to derive NT0 and NT1.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to model possible decompositions. Let's consider the string and try to break it down.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model it as starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the string must be the concatenation of NT0's generated string and NT1's generated string. So let's see if the string can be split into two parts, one generated by NT0 and the other by NT1.\n\nBut given the string's length, let me check how long it is. Let's count: each space separates a symbol, so from the string, the count is as follows:\n\nt8 t79 t5 t84 t5 t2 t24 t47 t66 t42 t54 t44 t63 t76 t17 t54 t44 t80 t41 t51 t43 t46 t2 t24 t51 t78 t0 t54 t13 t42 t13 t52 t69 t68 t12 t80 t73 t40.\n\nThat's 37 symbols. Hmm, so we have 37 symbols. Since S is split into two NTs, NT0 and NT1, so each of those will generate a substring, and their concatenation should make up the entire 37-symbol string.\n\nSo let's consider possible splits of the 37 symbols into two parts, say, the first k symbols generated by NT0 and the rest 37 -k generated by NT1. For each possible k, check if NT0 can produce the first k symbols and NT1 can produce the rest.\n\nBut this could be a lot of possible splits. Maybe it's better to look for the top-level production S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the first symbol must be produced by NT0, and the last symbol by NT1.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t8, and looking at the grammar, only some NTs can produce t8 directly. NT5 can produce t8 via NT5 \u2192 t8. So if NT0 produces t8, then NT0 must at some point become NT5 which produces t8. But looking at the production rules, NT0 can be rewritten as:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT4 (wait, no\u2014looking back, it's NT0 \u2192 't4'? Or is that part of the productions?\n\nWait, no. Looking back, in the initial productions, I see that some NT0 rules produce terminal symbols directly. Let me list them again:\n\nAh, yes, looking at the grammar, I see that NT0 can produce several terminal symbols directly:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't4', 't64', 't69', 't0', 't5', 't10', etc. So NT0 can produce t4, t64, t69, 't0', 't5', 't10', 't24', 't47', 't66', etc. Similarly, NT1 can produce 't12', 't51', 't78', etc.\n\nWait, in the given string, the first symbol is t8, which is not listed as an immediate production for any NT. So since NT0 and NT1 can't directly produce t8, that suggests that t8 must be produced by some NT that's derived from either NT0 or NT1 through a series of decompositions, each time using the productions.\n\nBut wait, looking at the rules, NT5 can directly produce t8 via NT5 \u2192 t8. Therefore, if any NT can expand into NT5, then that path could produce t8.\n\nLooking at NT5's production rules, I see NT5 \u2192 't8' is one of them. So to produce t8, some NT must first become NT5.\n\nLooking back at NT5's production rules, it can be rewritten as:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t8 (terminal), which is direct.\nNT5 \u2192 t1 (but there's no 't1' in the string, so maybe I'm misremembering.\nWait, let me list the NT5 rules again:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t1 (doesn't exist in the string)\nNT5 \u2192 t11 (no 't11' in the string)\nWait, no, I think I misread before. Let me check again. The given rules are:\n\nLooking back at the grammar provided:\n\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\nNT5 -> t8\n\nWait, is that correct? So NT5 can go to 't8' or to NT1 NT1.\n\nSo, to produce 't8', it's possible via NT5 \u2192 t8. So if any NT can derive into NT5, then it can produce t8.\n\nSo, going back, if the string starts with t8, that suggests that either NT0 or NT1 can eventually lead to t8 via some decomposition.\n\nBut looking at the productions, NT0 and NT1 can't go directly to t8. They can't go directly because in the given grammar, looking at their production rules, they all branch into non-terminals except for when they produce certain terminals.\n\nWait, let me see: NT0's production rules are:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 ... and several others including NT4 \u2192 t47, etc.\n\nSo if, for example, NT0 could go to NT5 via its production, and then NT5 can go to t8, that would allow NT0 \u2192 NT5, which would produce t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does NT0 have a rule that produces NT5? Let me check NT0's production rules:\n\nLooking through the given rules for NT0:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> NT5 (does that exist? Let me check: from the given, yes, one of the NT5 rules is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4? Wait, looking through the rules, let's list the ones for NT0:\n\nI see:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nWait, that's a production rule where NT0 becomes NT3 and NT5.

{"custom_id":"request-425","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar problem to solve. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is good because it makes certain things easier. CNF means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a single terminal. But wait, actually, no\u2014wait, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar. The start symbol is S. Let me see: S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Then NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, and NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, etc. So, most rules have two non-terminals on the left, except some might have terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to mix both non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, which is two non-terminals. But other rules like NT5 \u2192 't11' are terminal strings. So that's fine because in Chomsky Normal Form, we can have rules that produce terminals directly.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: \"t74 t63 t71 t12 t17 t82 t76 t24 t12 t40 t2 t43 t51 t43 t11 t36 t10 t12 t17 t55 t54 t66 t79 t47 t54 t76 t63 t76 t36 t64 t76 t67 t44 t78 t63 t84 t17 t51 t46\".\n\nSo, that's a bunch of tokens. I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, since the grammar is in CNF, the string's length can be used to check if it's even possible. In CNF, each production step increases the length by one (since each rule produces two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal). So, the length of the string should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of productions. But let me remember, the start symbol S is the root. Each step replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. So, the number of terminals in the string is equal to the number of times we've expanded a non-terminal to two, starting from the initial S which is perhaps rewritten as two non-terminals.\n\nIn terms of length, the initial string after S would have two symbols, then each production would double the count, but since only some are terminals, the length increases by one each time we expand a non-terminal to two terminals. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to count how many symbols are in the string and see if it fits.\n\nWait, let me count the number of symbols in the given string. Each space separates the tokens, so the string has 38 tokens. So, the length is 38.\n\nIn the grammar, each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the start symbol S would generate two non-terminals, say NT0 and NT1. Then each of those non-terminals can generate either two more non-terminals or terminals. The number of non-terminals will be 2^k at each step, where k is the number of productions.\n\nBut to get 38 terminals, which is the string length, we need to think about how many times we can split the non-terminals. Each time we expand a non-terminal to two terminals, the number of terminal symbols increases by one, starting from 0 with the initial S (which is two non-terminals, so zero terminals yet). Wait, no: the initial S is two non-terminals, so until they expand, there are zero terminals. Each expansion of a non-terminal to two terminals would add two terminals but then each would need to expand further. Wait, perhaps I should model it as the depth of the parse tree.\n\nThe length of the final string in terms of terminal symbols is L, each non-terminal expansion contributes to the structure. The maximum number of terminals possible from a non-terminal A is 2^d, where d is the depth of A in the parse tree minus one. Wait, maybe it's better to model it as the total number of terminals in a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, in the derivation, each node in the parse tree can be a non-terminal that splits into two non-terminals or two terminals. But the string at the end is all terminals, so each non-terminal must eventually produce terminals.\n\nThe key is that the number of terminals in the string must be equal to the sum of the terminals produced by all non-terminals. Since the grammar is binary, the total number of terminals should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of non-terminals derived. Wait, no\u2014that's more for the total number of nodes in a binary tree.\n\nWait, let's step back. Let me think about the derivation process. S generates NT0 and NT1. Each of these can generate more symbols. Each non-terminal expansion adds a step where a non-terminal splits into two. The total number of steps would be related to the length of the string.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as the number of symbols being equal to 2^k, but that might not fit here. Alternatively, perhaps the length of the string is the number of productions, but that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string length is 38, so the minimal derivation would have a parse tree where the depth is such that 2^d >= 38. Let me compute log2(38) \u2248 5.23. So, d=6. That would give 2^6 = 64 possible symbols, but the string is only 38. So, that suggests it's possible to have a string of length 38 if the grammar can produce such a structure.\n\nBut perhaps I should move beyond the length and look at each symbol in the string, check which non-terminals can produce them, and trace back the derivation.\n\nBut maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look for any symbol in the string that isn't produced by any of the given rules in the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the terminals allowed are the tokens that appear after NT, like 't74', 't63', etc. So, each token in the string must be a terminal that is defined somewhere in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: each element is of the form 'tXX'\u2014so let me see which 't's are present and if the grammar generates them.\n\nIn the grammar, the NT rules have the following terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't11', 't15', 't50', 't44', 't55', 't54', 't66', 't71', 't66', 't71', etc. Wait, no: looking at the grammar:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't68', 't64', 't51', etc.\nNT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', etc.\nNT1 \u2192 't12', 't67', etc.\nNT3 \u2192 't2', 't43', etc.\nNT5 \u2192 't11', 't74', 't72', etc.\nNT4 \u2192 't54', 't4', etc.\nNT9 in the grammar has entries like NT9 \u2192 't68', 't64', etc., but also NT9 \u2192 't66', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar rules, the NT tokens have various production rules. Each NT has certain terminals defined.\n\nLooking for all the terminals in the string: let's list each symbol in the string and see if it's a terminal in any rule.\n\nThe string is: t74, t63, t71, t12, t17, t82, t76, t24, t12, t40, t2, t43, t51, t43, t11, t36, t10, t12, t17, t55, t54, t66, t79, t47, t54, t76, t63, t76, t36, t64, t76, t67, t44, t78, t63, t84, t17, t51, t46.\n\nSo, all symbols are of the form 'tXX'\u2014now, I need to check if each of these is covered in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\nFor example, NT5 \u2192 't11', 't74', etc. So 't74' is allowed because there's a rule NT5 \u2192 't74'.\n\nt63: looking through the grammar, any rules that produce 't63'? Looking through, I think in the grammar, NT4 can produce t54, t4. Wait, maybe NT7?

{"custom_id":"request-422","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what I know about CNF grammars. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol can only be on the left side, and there are no productions with two terminals on the left or more than two non-terminals on the right.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's in CNF because all the productions have either one terminal or two non-terminals on the right side. Each production is straightforward, which is good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t80 t73 t46 t66 t66 t10 t54 t51 t5 t68 t12 t64 t58 t73 t71 t51 t51 t64 t63 t54 t71 t5 t43 t80 t67 t41 t40 t64 t5 t80 t42 t80 t69 t74 t78 t13 t5 t13 t46`.\n\nHmm, each token in the string seems to correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My first thought is to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar rules to see if it can be derived.\n\nI'll start by looking at the first part of the string. The first symbol is `t80`. Looking at the grammar, I need to find all productions that produce `t80`. Scanning through the NT8* productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT9 \u2192 t66\n- NT0 \u2192 t5\n- NT1 \u2192 t42\n- NT3 \u2192 t46\n- NT1 \u2192 t80\n- NT9 \u2192 t78\n- NT5 \u2192 t84\n- NT9 \u2192 t36\n- Others don't seem to produce t80.\n\nWait, there's an NT1 \u2192 t80. So, the first step could be NT1 \u2192 t80, which matches `t80`.\n\nNext, the second symbol is `t73`. Let's see where `t73` appears. Looking through the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 t73. So perhaps a production that starts with NT3 and produces t73, but let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the NT3 productions:\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT3 \u2192 t47\n\nWait, no `t73` in NT3. Maybe it's from another NT. Let me double-check. Oh, no, perhaps it's part of a non-terminal production. Maybe there's a longer string, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this as a top-down parsing, starting from the start symbol S and trying to match the string. Let's see:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1 (S \u2192 NT0 NT1). So, the string must start with something that generates NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, including:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 ... (and others, some are terminals)\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, let me list all NT0 productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT1\nNT0 \u2192 NT4\nWait, no, looking again, the start is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the entire string must be generated by NT0 and NT1.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which is two components, but NT0 and NT1 can be single terminals or non-terminals. For example, NT0 can produce a terminal, and NT1 can produce another terminal.\n\nSo, for the string to start with `t80`, we can have S \u2192 NT1 t80? Wait, no, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so NT0 and NT1 must both be expanded into something that starts the string.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to try to parse the entire string step by step, considering each non-terminal and how it can be expanded.\n\nLet me create a stack for parsing. Since it's top-down, I'll use the leftmost derivation approach. Alternatively, maybe I can use a recursive descent approach, but that might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider the entire string as a sequence of terminals and try to match it by successively applying grammar rules.\n\nLet me list the string again:\n\nt80 t73 t46 t66 t66 t10 t54 t51 t5 t68 t12 t64 t58 t73 t71 t51 t51 t64 t63 t54 t71 t5 t43 t80 t67 t41 t40 t64 t5 t80 t42 t80 t69 t74 t78 t13 t5 t13 t46\n\nI think I need to find a way to map each part of the string to the grammar. Let me start by breaking the string into tokens and see what possible non-terminal expansions they could come from.\n\nFirst, t80: as I saw earlier, NT1 \u2192 t80, so the first token could come from NT1. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, perhaps NT1 becomes t80 and NT0 becomes the rest of the string. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so both NT0 and NT1 must expand into something that together forms the entire string. So, in the first step, the parser would start with S and try to match the leftmost symbol, which is t80. Since S's production starts with NT0 and NT1, perhaps NT1 is the terminal t80, and NT0 is the rest of the string.\n\nBut wait, S is NT0 followed by NT1. So S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so after S is expanded, the entire string is the concatenation of NT0's expansion and NT1's expansion. So the first step is to split the string into two parts: what NT0 generates and what NT1 generates.\n\nSo the first token is t80, so let's assume that NT1 generates t80. Then NT1 is T80, which is a terminal. So NT1 \u2192 t80. Then the rest of the string (after t80) would be what NT0 generates.\n\nThe rest of the string after t80 is: t73 t46 t66 t66 t10 t54 t51 t5 t68 t12 t64 t58 t73 t71 t51 t51 t64 t63 t54 t71 t5 t43 t80 t67 t41 t40 t64 t5 t80 t42 t80 t69 t74 t78 t13 t5 t13 t46\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to whether NT0 can generate this remaining string.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT1\nWait, the NT0 productions in the grammar are a bit messy. Let me list all NT0 productions correctly.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT1\nWait, that's not correct.

This structure suggests that each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. Because of that, the string should be a sequence that can be broken down into a binary tree structure, where each production (except the leaves) combines two symbols.\n\nLet me recall that in a CNF grammar, the leftmost derivation of a string will have a length of n-1 steps for a string of length n, starting from the start symbol. So, for a string of length m, the number of non-terminals in the leftmost derivation will decrease from 1 (start symbol) to m (leaves, all terminals). Since each production either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of non-terminals would increase by one each step until all are terminals.\n\nGiven that, I'll first check the length of the string. The string provided is a sequence of 40 't' tokens. So, the string length is 40. Since the grammar starts with S, which is a single symbol, the leftmost derivation would have 40 - 1 = 39 steps. Each step would add one non-terminal until all leaves are terminals.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet. Let's look at the start symbol: S -> NT0 NT1. So S is replaced by NT0 and NT1. Both NT0 and NT1 are non-terminals, so the next step would expand each of these into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nEach production for NT0, NT1, etc., either leads to two non-terminals or a terminal. So for example:\n\n- NT0 can produce NT3 NT5 or NT9 NT4, etc.\n- Terminal symbols are like t73, t84, etc.\n\nSince the leftmost derivation builds from the start symbol outward, the string must be generated by a chain of replacements starting from S and ending with all terminals.\n\nGiven the string length is 40, the leftmost derivation path would have 39 non-terminals, each step splitting a non-terminal into two. But tracking each step manually would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to see if the string can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't73'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't73'. Looking at the productions:\n\n- NT3 can produce 't73' (look at NT3 -> 't73'). \n- Is there any NT that when expanded leads to 't73' earlier? Let's check NT3's productions.\n\nNT3 has productions:\n- NT3 -> 't73'\n- NT3 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't4'\n\nSo, 't73' is a direct production from NT3. So the first symbol could be the result of expanding NT3.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the string starts with the production NT3 -> 't73', and then further expand NT3 and NT1.\n\nWait, the string after 't73' is 't84', 't54', etc. Let me see where those come. Let's look again.\n\nAfter t73 is t84. Let's see what 't84' is. Looking at NT4 and any other NT that produces 't84':\n\nNT4 has production 't84' (NT4 -> 't84'). So possible.\n\nBut how does that connect? Let's think about the structure.\n\nWe have S -> NT0 NT1. So the string is generated by NT0 followed by NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, it's the concatenation of NT0 derivation and NT1 derivation. Wait, no, it's the entire expansion. So the first symbol is from either NT0 or NT1. Wait, no, the whole string is the expansion of S into two parts, each being NT0 and NT1. So the string starts with NT0's expansion followed by NT1's expansion.\n\nWait no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. So S -> NT0 NT1, which means when S is expanded, it's first replaced by NT0 and NT1, which are both non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals can then be expanded further.\n\nSo the string will be a sequence where the first part is the expansion of NT0, followed by the expansion of NT1. Because when you expand NT0, it's the leftmost non-terminal first.\n\nWait, in leftmost derivation, you replace the leftmost non-terminal first. So after S, you replace S with NT0 NT1. Then, perhaps replace the leftmost NT0 with something, then NT1, but in some order.\n\nAlternatively, the entire string is the combination of the two strings generated by NT0 and NT1, but the order depends on which non-terminal is expanded first.\n\nBut given the string is 40 symbols, perhaps it's the combination of NT0's expansion (say, length x) and NT1's expansion (length y), where x + y = 40.\n\nBut that complicates things because without knowing x and y, it's hard. Instead, perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar by trying to find a sequence of productions that starts from S and results in the given string.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string from the bottom up, using the grammar's productions. Since CNF allows for easy parsing if we know the structure, but it might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each production in the grammar is in CNF, so the string must have a structure where every non-terminal symbol is replaced by two non-terminals, and so on, until the leaves are terminals. Each step adds a non-terminal, so the total number of non-terminals in the parse tree is equal to the number of symbols minus 1 (starting from S as one non-terminal, then every step adds one until all are terminals). For a string of length n, the parse tree has n-1 internal nodes. Since each internal node is a production that splits into two, the entire structure is a full binary tree with n leaves.\n\nSo for 40 symbols, the parse tree must be a full binary tree with 40 leaves, and 39 internal nodes, each corresponding to a production.\n\nBut without specifically constructing the parse tree, perhaps it's easier to find if the string can be generated by the grammar by trying to find which production rules could generate the string.\n\nBut manually doing that with 40 symbols is impractical. Instead, perhaps looking for the first few and last few symbols to see if they fit any production.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t73, t84, t54, t66, t41, t13, t40, t74, t84, t47, t8, t64, t55, t2, t42,...\n\nThe first symbol is t73, which is produced directly by NT3.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is 't73', which comes from NT3. Therefore, the leftmost derivation must have first expanded some NT to NT3.\n\nBut S is NT0 NT1. So the initial expansion is S -> NT0 NT1.\n\nThen, the leftmost symbol is NT0, which must be expanded into something. The expansion starts with NT0, so the string begins with the expansion of NT0 followed by the expansion of NT1.\n\nTherefore, 't73' must come from NT0's expansion. So NT0 must have a production that includes t73 as part of its derivation.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT47 NT4?\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, the given productions for NT0 are:\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT47 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT64 NT?\nWait, perhaps I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-439","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is a bit complex with a bunch of production rules, so I'm a bit nervous, but let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol is S, and I'll need to see if it can derive the given string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t68 t63 t67 t40 t10 t68 t67 t52 t67 t47 t76 t63 t4 t11 t74 t63 t5 t79 t40 t44 t55 t74 t69 t63 t71 t63 t44 t68 t84 t63 t0 t82 t63 t42 t10 t51 t76 t13 t46 t64`.\n\nThat's quite a long string. I'm going to need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree has a specific structure. Each production either splits into two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal.\n\nI think a good approach is to model this as a parsing problem. Starting from the start symbol S, I can try to break down the string into the rules. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces NT0 NT1. So the string should start with the concatenation of whatever NT0 and NT1 produce. Let's check the first part of the string: t68 t63... I need to see if t68 can come from NT0 or NT1.\n\nLooking at NT9, it can produce t68. So NT9 \u2192 t68. That must be part of the derivation. Let's see how NT9 can be derived.\n\nThe possible productions for NT9 are:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT9 -> 't68'\n\nSo for NT9 \u2192 t68, that's straightforward. So the first t68 in the string corresponds to NT9. Now, the NT9 also has another production: NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5. But in this case, it's directly producing t68, so that's the production we'll use.\n\nNow, the string after t68 is t63 t67 t40 t10... So next, we have t63, which should be part of NT0 since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and we've already used NT9 for the first t68, so NT1 is part of that.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. The string is generated by expanding S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the first part is NT0, followed by NT1. So the entire string is the concatenation of what NT0 produces and what NT1 produces.\n\nWait, no. In the Chomsky normal form, each step expands one non-terminal into two non-terminals. So when we derive from S, S becomes NT0 NT1. So the initial string starts with NT0 and then NT1. But each of these can be non-terminals that produce further expansions.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse the string using the grammar, treating it as a top-down derivation. So starting with S, which becomes NT0 NT1. So the first symbol of the string must be the expansion of NT0, followed by the expansion of NT1.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts: the part generated by NT0 and the part generated by NT1. So the string is:\n\nt68 t63 t67 t40 t10 t68 t67 t52 t67 t47 t76 t63 t4 t11 t74 t63 t5 t79 t40 t44 t55 t74 t69 t63 t71 t63 t44 t68 t84 t63 t0 t82 t63 t42 t10 t51 t76 t13 t46 t64\n\nThat's 40 symbols, so the first part could be any number of symbols up to 39, followed by NT1's production.\n\nBut wait, since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the entire string is what NT0 and NT1 derive to. So we need to find a way to split the string into two parts: one that is the expansion of NT0 and the other of NT1.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, I see that NT0 has several rules. One of them is NT0 \u2192 t73. So that could be the end if the string after a certain point is just t73. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, NT0 can be broken down into other non-terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT0's rules:\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> 't73'\n- NT0 -> 't79'\n- NT0 -> 't47'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- ... others\n\nSo for NT0, if it can produce a terminal, that's a leaf node. If it's split into other non-terminals, their expansions would have to form the string parts.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the first part of the string is generated by NT0 and the rest by NT1.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: t68. From earlier, we determined that NT9 \u2192 t68. So the first t68 must be produced by NT9, which is derived from NT0 in S \u2192 NT0 NT1, since S starts with NT0 being part of the initial expansion.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So NT0 can produce t68 if one of its rules is NT0 \u2192 t68, but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT0 \u2192 t68 as a production. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the non-terminals are S, NT0, NT1, NT9, etc., and their productions. So I don't see any production for NT0 that directly produces t68. The first t68 is part of NT9, which is a separate non-terminal.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the first symbol in the string must be the expansion of NT0, and the next symbol the expansion of NT1. So if the first symbol is t68, it must come from NT0. But looking at the grammar, NT0 doesn't have a production that directly produces t68. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see a production for NT0 \u2192 t68. The closest is NT9 \u2192 t68. So if the first symbol is t68, it must come from NT9, which is a different non-terminal. But in S \u2192 NT0 NT1, NT0 and NT1 are separate. So perhaps this is impossible. Therefore, the first symbol t68 can't be NT0's production, so it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let's re-express: in S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the initial expansion is that S becomes NT0 followed by NT1. Now, each of these can be further expanded. So the first part of the string could be NT0 expanded into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, and similarly for NT1.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t68, so if that's coming from NT0, and NT0 doesn't have a production that directly yields t68, that's a problem. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the NT0 rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't73'\n- NT0 \u2192 't79'\n- NT0 \u2192 't47'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- etc.\n\nSo, no, NT0 doesn't have a production for terminal symbols like t68. So t68 would have to come from NT9, but in the S \u2192 NT0 NT1 expansion, nt0 is one part and nt1 is the other. So for the first token to be t68, NT9 must be in NT0's expansion.\n\nWait, but how? Because NT0's expansion starts with NT0 itself. So if NT0 can expand into NT9 and then NT9 can expand into t68, then perhaps the string can be generated. For example, if NT0 \u2192 NT9, and then NT9 \u2192 t68.\n\nBut let me look at the grammar again. Does NT0 have a production involving NT9? Looking through the rules, I don't see that. So:\n\nLooking through the NT0 productions: I don't see any rule where NT0 produces NT9. Let's check:\n\nThe rules for NT0 are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Or was that a typo? Wait, in the original grammar above, yes, I see:\n\nLooking again at the grammar, for NT0, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> 't24'\n- etc.\n\nBut maybe I missed some. Let me recount NT0's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, the NT0 entries start after NT5:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> NT1 NT3\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't24'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT0 -> 't64'\nNT0 -> 't9'? Or not. Let me check: \n\nLooking at the original grammar:\n\nAfter NT5, it's:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\nNT9 -> 't68'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT3 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't64'\nNT1 -> 't51'\nNT9 -> 't64'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT9 -> 't69'\nNT0 -> 't73'\nNT0 -> 't24'\nNT3 -> 't43'\nNT1 -> 't67'\nNT5 -> 't74'\nNT9 -> 't52'\nNT5 -> 't71'\nNT5 -> 't8'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nNT3 -> 't4'\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT3 -> 't71'\nNT1 -> 't46'\nNT1 -> 't80'\nNT3 -> 't51'\nNT9 -> 't36'\nNT9 -> 't58'\nNT5 -> 't84'\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT9 -> 't66'\nNT4 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't42'\nNT0 -> 't79'\nNT9 -> 't78'\nNT0 -> 't36'\nNT0 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't17'\nNT4 -> 't55'\nNT9 -> 't63'\nNT4 -> 't13'\nNT5 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't76'\nNT9 -> 't44'\nNT4 -> 't58'\nNT9 -> 't41'\nNT3 -> 't50'\nNT1 -> 't73'\nNT3 -> 't40'\nNT5 -> 't80'\nNT0 -> 't5'\nNT1 -> 't42'\n\nWait, so looking at that, the NT0 productions are:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-444","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine if the given string is generated by the provided Context-Free Grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that CNF has some specific rules, like each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and either a terminal or non-terminal on the right. But wait, looking at the grammar, I see that some productions might have more than two non-terminals\u2014like S -> NT0 NT1 is okay since it's two non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, the left-hand side must be a single non-terminal, and each production can have two symbols on the right, which can be either non-terminals or terminals. So the grammar seems to comply with CNF.\n\nNow, the string I'm supposed to check is: `t13 t8 t76 t2 t52 t41 t64 t76 t71 t55 t84 t51 t71 t41 t66 t68 t51 t42 t17 t55 t82 t55 t66 t67 t46 t63 t47 t42 t68 t46 t54 t69 t4 t66 t12 t52 t82 t80 t78 t52 t69`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string is split into tokens, each starting with 't'. So each token is a terminal of the form 'tX', where X is a number. Therefore, each step in the parse must produce exactly one of these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. Each NT is a non-terminal that eventually produces these tX strings. So, the initial production is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which are two non-terminals. This suggests that the string should have an even number of tokens, because each production splits into two parts. Let me count the tokens in the string: 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 58 tokens. Wait, 58 is even, so that's good.\n\nNow, I can think of this as processing the string as a sequence of steps where each step combines two symbols. But since this is a tree structure, maybe using the leftmost derivation approach would help. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for CNF grammars. Let me try the CYK approach because it's systematic.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell (i,j) represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring starting at position i and ending at position j. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Initialize the table with each position containing the terminals that match the start symbols of the non-terminals. So, for each position i, find which NT can produce the ith token.\n\n2. For each length l from 2 to n (where n is the length of the string), and for each starting position i, find the possible non-terminals that can cover the substring from i to i+l-1.\n\n3. If the start symbol S can be derived from the entire string, then the string is accepted.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\nt13, t8, t76, t2, t52, t41, t64, t76, t71, t55, t84, t51, t71, t41, t66, t68, t51, t42, t17, t55, t82, t55, t66, t67, t46, t63, t47, t42, t68, t46, t54, t69, t4, t66, t12, t52, t82, t80, t78, t52, t69.\n\nThat's 58 tokens, so positions 0 to 57 (assuming 0-based indexing). Let me start by mapping each terminal to the non-terminals that can produce it. So, for each token 'tX', find NT such that NT -> 'tX'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT0 -> 't10' means that NT0 can derive 't10'. Similarly, NT1 -> 't12' and so on. Let's go through each token.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Let me create a list of all terminal symbols and what NTs can produce them.\n\nTerminals and their NT parents:\n't13' \u2192 NT0 (since NT0 can produce 't13')\n't8' \u2192 NT0 is not directly producing 't8'; let's check. Looking at the productions, NT0 can produce 't10' but what about 't8'? Or maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar. Wait, looking at the list, I see NT0 has some productions to terminals like 't2' (from NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5 where NT3 could be 't2'), but I need to see if any NT directly produces 't8'. Wait, the grammar has NT9 \u2192 't68', but that's 't68'. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for each NT and see what terminals they can produce.\n\nLet me go through the grammar and see the terminals for each NT:\n\n- NT0: NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't64', etc. Wait, looking at the productions: NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't64', etc. So NT0 can produce 't10', 't4', 't64', etc.\n- Similarly, NT1 can produce 't12', 't51', 't73', etc.\n- NT2 is only in the production NT3 \u2192 't2' or 't47'.\n- NT3 can produce 't2', 't47', 't9' (if any; need to check).\nLooking through all the productions, for example:\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' (multiple times)\n- NT3 \u2192 't43' etc.\nWait, let's make sure we list all NTs and their terminal outputs.\n\nLet's list each NT and the terminals they produce directly:\n\n- NT0:\n  NT0 -> NT3 NT5 \u2192 but directly, NT0 can derive the following:\n  From the productions of NT0:\n  NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't64', 't73', 't24', 't47', 't69', 't9', 't71', etc. Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nActually, looking through the list provided:\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't64'\n- NT0 \u2192 't47'\n- NT0 \u2192 't71'\n- NT0 \u2192 't24'\n- NT0 \u2192 't79'\n- Similarly, there's NT0 \u2192 't36' but that's from NT9.\nWait, the productions listed are:\n\nWait, the productions given are extensive, so perhaps I should process each one and see which NTs have direct productions to a terminal.\n\nHere's the list:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-455","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. First, I'll look at the grammar structure and the string to see how they might connect.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a terminal or two productions. Each non-terminal (NT) produces two other non-terminals or terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. \n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of terminals: t50 t52 t4 t0 t80 t5 t73 t84 t2 t80 t44 t10 t11 t5 t52 t47 t0 t42 t55 t36 t43 t55 t5 t8 t79 t68 t51 t24 t51 t79 t50 t5 t63 t58 t11 t69 t5 t76 t58 t79 t40 t43.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Parsing involves starting from the start symbol, applying productions, and building up the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the string must start with NT0 NT1. Let me look at the string: the first two tokens are t50 and t52. So, NT0 should produce t50 and NT1 should produce t52, or another combination where these are derived from.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT0 and NT1 might be more complex. Let me check the productions for NT0 and NT1.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT0 has multiple productions:\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 can also go to 't10', but the string starts with t50 and t52, so we don't need to consider that right now.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 has productions:\nNT1 \u2192 't12' and other combinations, but in our case, the first token after S is t50, which isn't t12. So we'll have to see how t50 is derived.\n\nWait, looking closer, the first production for S is NT0 and NT1. So the entire string must be the concatenation of NT0's derivation and NT1's derivation.\n\nLet me see the start. The string begins with t50 t52 t4 t0... So maybe NT0 is t50 and t52, but NT0 isn't 't52' unless there's a production for NT0 that's more complex.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT0 has a production NT0 \u2192 't10', but that's probably not relevant here since the string starts with t50.\n\nLooking for a production that can start with t50.\n\nIn the grammar, I see that NT3 \u2192 't43', and NT5 \u2192 't54', NT9 has several productions, including 't36', 't47', etc. So perhaps NT0 can derive t50 through one of its complex productions.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, do any of them can produce t50 at some point? Let's look for a path from NT0 to t50.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT0 can produce NT3 NT5 or NT9 NT4 or 't10'. So it can go through NT3 or NT9.\n\nLooking at NT3:\n\nNT3 has two productions: \u2192 't4' and \u2192 't2' or \u2192 't47' or \u2192 't43' or others. Wait, looking at the detailed rules:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list.

Wait, in the long list, I see:\n\nNT3 : 't2'\nNT3 : 't47'\nNT3 : 't43'\nNT3 : 't4'\n\nAdditionally, there's a line: NT3 -> 't71'\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nYes, lines like:\n\nNT3 -> 't43'\n\nand other productions.

Let's check:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't11'\nNT5 \u2192 't54'\nNT5 \u2192 't8'\nAnd others like NT5 \u2192 't74', etc. Wait, in the given grammar, I see lines:\n\n- NT5 -> 't8'\n- NT5 -> 't74'\n- NT5 -> 't55'\n- NT5 -> 't71'\n\nSo, NT5 can produce multiple terminals or can derive other NTs.\n\nLooking back at the problem, the string starts with t50, t52, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to see how NT0 can produce t50. Let's see if t50 is in the productions of NT0.\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT0, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (but not relevant)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- Also, a production: NT0 \u2192 't4' (so t4 is a terminal)\n- Another: NT0 \u2192 't5' (t5 is a terminal)\n- There's also NT0 \u2192 't63', 't43', etc.?\n\nWait, in the list of NT0 productions:\n\nLooking for t50. Hmm, looking through the NT0 productions:\n\nDo any of them include t50?

So that's a problem. So if the string starts with t50, how does NT0 produce it? Because in the grammar, NT0 doesn't have a production that directly gives t50.\n\nSo that suggests that the string may not be derivable, right?

{"custom_id":"request-457","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I\u2019m trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me go through this step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string to check is `t80 t79 t13 t44 t44 t2 t8 t54 t79 t78 t71 t55 t13 t4 t63 t24 t8 t58 t4 t84 t80 t42 t76 t69 t12 t42 t80 t0 t73 t43 t13 t46 t17 t42 t24 t66 t4 t66 t63 t69 t43 t82`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules step by step. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S directly produces NT0 NT1 based on the production S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the first step is to see how the string can be divided into two parts, one from NT0 and the other from NT1, since each is a non-terminal and needs to be expanded.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of tokens, so each token must correspond to a terminal in the productions. Let me count the tokens: there are 43 tokens. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, each of NT0 and NT1 can produce sequences of terms that together make up the 43-term string. \n\nI think I can approach this by checking if the string is a valid combination of NT0 and NT1 derivations. So, I'll split the string into two parts, trying different splits, and see if one part can be derived from NT0 and the other from NT1.\n\nBut wait, maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can model the derivation as a parse tree, ensuring that each step follows the production rules. Let me try to see if the string can be generated by starting from S.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT0 NT1. So, the first substitution is NT0 and NT1 each expanding to some strings. So the overall string should be the concatenation of what NT0 produces and what NT1 produces.\n\nSo, the first token must come from NT0, the second from NT0, etc., switching when NT1's expansion starts. Wait, no, because each non-terminal can produce a string, so the entire string is the concatenation of what NT0 produces and what NT1 produces.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When S \u2192 NT0 NT1, then the entire string generated by S is the concatenation of the string generated by NT0 and the string generated by NT1. So, the entire string is the result of NT0's expansion followed by NT1's expansion.\n\nTherefore, I can split the string into two parts: the first part from NT0 and the second from NT1. The key is that the concatenation of these two parts must equal the given string.\n\nBut how do I split the string into two parts? I need to find a split point such that the first part can be generated by NT0 and the second by NT1.\n\nLet me consider the grammar productions for NT0 and NT1:\n\nFor NT0:\n- It can produce strings involving various terminals and non-terminals. Let me see which terminals NT0 can produce. Looking at the productions for NT0, I see:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> 't2' (from NT3)\nNT0 -> 't47' (from NT3)\nNT0 -> 't4' (from NT4)\nNT0 -> 't64' (from NT5)\nAnd so on. So NT0 can produce sequences that include 't2', 't47', 't4', 't64', etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT1's productions include:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT1 -> 't51'\nNT1 -> 't13'\nNT1 -> 't46'\nNT1 -> 't42' (multiple times)\nSo NT1 can produce sequences with 't12', 't51', 't13', 't46', 't42'.\n\nThe given string is: t80 t79 t13 t44 t44 t2 t8 t54 t79 t78 t71 t55 t13 t4 t63 t24 t8 t58 t4 t84 t80 t42 t76 t69 t12 t42 t80 t0 t73 t43 t13 t46 t17 t42 t24 t66 t4 t66 t63 t69 t43 t82.\n\nHmm, the string starts with t80, then t79. Let me check if t80 can come from NT0 or NT1. Looking at NT0's productions, there are some terminals like 't54' (from NT9), 't58' (from NT5), etc., but I don't see 't80' directly in NT0 or NT1's productions. Wait, let's check again.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, I see:\n\n- NT0 can produce 't54' via NT9 \u2192 't54' (from NT9 -> 't54'?) Wait, checking the grammar, NT9's productions include 't68', 't54', 't44', but in the given grammar, I see NT9 -> 't54' perhaps?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, NT9 has several productions, including:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT9 -> 't68'\nNT9 -> 't54'? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, the NT9 productions are:\n\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT9 -> 't68'\n- NT9 -> 't54' (is that correct?)\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nAt one point, I see: NT9 -> 't68', NT0 -> 't4', etc. I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through the NT9 productions carefully:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- Also, I see NT9 \u2192 't54'?

So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string that I need to determine if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar is quite extensive with multiple non-terminals and production rules, so parsing it manually might be a bit tricky. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form (CNF), all production rules will be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol seems to be S, which produces NT0 NT1. That means the start string will be a combination of two non-terminals, but looking at the string provided, it's a sequence of t's like \"t36 t76...\", which I assume corresponds to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nNow, I need to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. One approach is to try to parse the string from the start symbol and break it down step by step using the production rules, ensuring that each split is consistent with the grammar.\n\nLet's list the production rules for NT0:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-463","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is \"t5 t84 t82 t84 t43 t67 t36 t40 t36 t43 t0 t24 t74 t67 t66 t63 t68 t2 t79 t79 t73 t4 t69 t36 t79 t0 t17 t8 t78 t67 t82 t36 t76 t47 t63 t36 t17 t73 t8 t64 t4 t11 t8\", and the grammar has a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that all the productions fit this form since each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. So the grammar structure is correct for CNF.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, and to determine if it's generated by the grammar, I need to construct a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are terminals, and the sequence of terminals in the order they are generated matches the given string.\n\nBut parsing such a long string manually would be extremely tedious. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if each terminal in the string appears in any of the production rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar's non-terminals, I see NT0, NT1, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT9. Each of these has productions (either non-terminals or terminals). Let me list out all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nNT0: t10, t3, t47, t4, t64, t4, t73, t24, t43, t67, t66, t68, t2, t79, t79, t73, t4, t69, t36, t79, t0, t17, t8, t78, t67, t82, t36, t76, t47, t63, t36, t17, t73, t8, t64, t4, t11, t8.\n\nSo all these terminals are covered in the string, at least some of them more than once. But that alone doesn't mean the string is valid.\n\nAnother approach: for the string to be generated, it must have a derivation that leads from the start symbol S to the entire string via the rules. The start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. So the string must be a concatenation of two parts: one generated from NT0 and the other from NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5, which is generated by NT1 (NT1 \u2192 t12), so the first part should be t12, but the string starts with t5. Wait, that's a mismatch. So maybe I made a mistake? Let me check NT1's productions.\n\nLooking back, NT1's productions are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t12\n- NT1 \u2192 t67\n- NT1 \u2192 t79\n- NT1 \u2192 t73\n- NT1 \u2192 t51\n- NT1 \u2192 t46\n- NT1 \u2192 t80\n- NT1 \u2192 t5\n- NT1 \u2192 t73\n- NT1 \u2192 t42\n\nOh, wait, one of the rules is NT1 \u2192 t5. So the first element of the string is t5, which can be generated directly by NT1. So the entire string must start with t5 followed by whatever NT0 generates.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5, which matches NT1. So the first part is good.\n\nNow, let's move on. The entire string is a sequence of terminals. Let's see the entire string broken into individual tokens:\n\n1. t5\n2. t84\n3. t82\n4. t84\n5. t43\n6. t67\n7. t36\n8. t40\n9. t36\n10. t43\n11. t0\n12. t24\n13. t74\n14. t67\n15. t66\n16. t63\n17. t68\n18. t2\n19. t79\n20. t79\n21. t73\n22. t4\n23. t69\n24. t36\n25. t79\n26. t0\n27. t17\n28. t8\n29. t78\n30. t67\n31. t82\n32. t36\n33. t76\n34. t47\n35. t63\n36. t36\n37. t17\n38. t73\n39. t8\n40. t64\n41. t4\n42. t11\n43. t8\n\nSo 43 tokens in total. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and NT0 generates the first part, NT1 the second. But wait, the string starts with t5, which is from NT1, but S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so NT0 should generate the prefix before NT1. So the string must be in the form generated by NT0 followed by NT1. But the string starts with t5 from NT1, implying that the initial part is from NT1, which contradicts S \u2192 NT0 NT1 unless NT0 can generate an empty string. But in CNF, the productions don't allow empty strings unless a non-terminal directly produces an empty string, which isn't the case here. So NT0 must generate some string, and then NT1 must generate the rest.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5, which is the start of NT1's production. So maybe the entire string is generated by NT1, but that can't be because S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so S produces two parts. So perhaps NT0 generates an empty string, but looking at the grammar, none of the NT0 productions are empty. NT0's productions are all rules that produce other non-terminals or specific terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If S \u2192 NT0 NT1, then the entire string must be NT0's output concatenated with NT1's output. So in the string, the part before the t5 would have to be generated by NT0, but t5 is the first symbol. So that would mean NT0 generates t5, but let's check if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (again)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't3' (but wait, 't3' isn't in the given string; wait, looking again, the grammar has NT0 \u2192 't36', but the string has 't36' as token 7 and 24, etc. So wait, no. In the grammar, NT0 can produce 't10', 't3' (wait no, looking back: in the grammar, it says NT0 -> 't10'; in the provided grammar, under NT0, the production is 't10'. So let's check if 't10' is in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, I don't see 't10'. The string starts with t5, t84, etc., so NT0 would be unable to generate 't10', which is in the grammar, but the string doesn't have it. So that's a problem because S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and if NT0 can produce 't10', but the string doesn't have that, and if NT0 can't produce anything else except combinations of other non-terminals or specific terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t5, which is generated by NT1, meaning that NT0 must be generating an empty string, which isn't possible because all NT0's productions produce other symbols. So perhaps the string starts with t5 being the beginning of NT1's production, and NT0 is producing an empty string, but that's not possible. Therefore, this would imply that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it starts with a terminal that comes from NT1, which is correct, but the rest of the string must come from NT1, but S must produce both NT0 and NT1.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the entire string is the concatenation of what NT0 generates and what NT1 generates. So the string must be structured as [NT0's string][NT1's string]. So the first part of the string is generated"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-478","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have production rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, and all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I'll note that each production indeed seems to fit CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT1 breaks down into two non-terminals, and other rules either produce two non-terminals or terminals like 't68'. So that's a good start.\n\nThe string to check is: `t76 t4 t13 t68 t13 t74 t2 t12 t42 t84 t44 t73 t2 t43 t40 t8 t68 t76 t79 t2 t17 t54 t66 t82 t73 t36 t50 t10 t4 t47 t52 t73 t82 t78 t11 t80 t4 t73 t55 t4 t78 t40 t69 t5`.\n\nSince the string is quite long, I think the best approach is to build the parse tree step by step or find a way to decompose the string into the grammar's productions. Alternatively, I could use the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming for such a long string.\n\nLet me list out the grammar rules to see which non-terminals can produce which terminals. I can create a dictionary or list mapping each non-terminal to its possible productions.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, 't68'\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, 't10', 't4', 't64', 't73', 't24', 't43', 't71', 't79', 't36', 't50', 't5'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12', 't67', 't51', 't46', 't80', 't36', 't73', 't43', 't54', 't78', 't42'\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT0 NT1, 't64', 't78', 't52', 't71', 't8', 't44', 't58', 't41', 't50', 't44' (Wait, some duplication might be there.)\n\nNT0 has several productions, including multiple terminals and combinations.\n\nI think a better approach is to work from the string and try to break it down into the possible rules. Let's start.\n\nThe string begins with 't76', which must come from a production of some non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't76'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't76' (from the given rules? Wait, let me check. Looking back, the user provided a list. Scanning through, I see NT0 has a rule 't76', yes, line: NT0 -> 't76'.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the user's grammar, I see:\n\nLine: NT0 -> 't76' \u2014 yes, that's one of the options. So 't76' can come from NT0.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't76', which must come from NT0. So the string starts with NT0 \u2192 t76. So the remaining string after 't76' would need to be derived from the other side of S's production. Wait, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the entire string must be NT0 followed by NT1.\n\nSo the entire string is S \u2192 NT0 NT1 \u2192 t76 ... rest of the string.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the string is the entire sequence of symbols, so NT0 must produce the first part, and NT1 must produce the second part. But actually, it's the entire string that must be generated by the grammar, starting from S.\n\nSo perhaps I can try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me note that the string is: ['t76', 't4', 't13', 't68', 't13', 't74', 't2', 't12', 't42', 't84', 't44', 't73', 't2', 't43', 't40', 't8', 't68', 't76', 't79', 't2', 't17', 't54', 't66', 't82', 't73', 't36', 't50', 't10', 't4', 't47', 't52', 't73', 't82', 't78', 't11', 't80', 't4', 't73', 't55', 't4', 't78', 't40', 't69', 't5'].\n\nThat's 47 symbols. I'll need to break this down.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the entire string should be NT0 followed by NT1.\n\nLet me see if I can decompose the string into two parts: the first part generated by NT0 and the second part by NT1.\n\nFirst part: starting with 't76'. NT0 can produce 't76' directly, as per the rule NT0 \u2192 't76'. So the first part is just 't76'.\n\nThen the remaining string is: ['t4', 't13', 't68', 't13', 't74', 't2', 't12', 't42', 't84', 't44', 't73', 't2', 't43', 't40', 't8', 't68', 't76', 't79', 't2', 't17', 't54', 't66', 't82', 't73', 't36', 't50', 't10', 't4', 't47', 't52', 't73', 't82', 't78', 't11', 't80', 't4', 't73', 't55', 't4', 't78', 't40', 't69', 't5'].\n\nWait, no. Actually, the entire string after NT0 must be generated by NT1. So the string after 't76' is the rest of the string. Let me confirm: S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the string is NT0 symbols followed by NT1 symbols.\n\nSo the first token is 't76', which is generated by NT0. The rest must be generated by NT1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 't4' comes next. Let me think. If NT0 can produce 't76' as a terminal, then the string after that must be generated by NT1. But the next token is 't4' \u2014 can NT1 produce 't4'?\n\nLooking back at NT1's productions, I see NT1 can go to several terminals. Looking at the list:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12', 't67', 't51', 't46', 't80', 't36', 't73', 't43', 't54', 't78', 't42'.\n\nSo 't4' is not directly produced by NT1. That suggests a problem because after 't76', the next symbol is 't4', which cannot be generated directly by NT1. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't76' is not the only production for NT0, but perhaps NT0 uses another production that starts with 't4'? Let me check NT0's rules again.\n\nNT0 has several rules, including 't10', 't4', 't64', 't73', 't24', 't43', 't71', 't79', 't36', 't50', 't5'.\n\nWait, 't4' is one of NT0's productions, so perhaps the string is split differently.\n\nSo maybe the first NT0 does not produce 't76' but instead another path, such as 't4', 't13', etc. Wait, but the start symbol is S, which is NT0 followed by NT1. So the entire string must be NT0 symbols followed by NT1 symbols.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't76', which is from NT0, but NT0 can also produce 't4' as another terminal. So perhaps the initial parse is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I think means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the terminals. The string provided is quite long, and it's made up of tokens like 't13', 't71', etc. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form looks like.

Let's see: NT0 and NT1 both have their own production rules. \n\nLooking at NT0, it has several options like NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT3, etc. NT1 produces t12 or more complex terms. Hmm, but in the string, the first token is 't13', which isn't a terminal in the grammar. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar's terminals are all the 't' tokens like t13, t71, etc. So perhaps each token must be derived from a terminal production.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky normal form, the productions can only have two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production in the grammar is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, in this case, each step in the derivation can only replace a non-terminal with two other symbols or a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So S is replacing into NT0 and NT1. Then each of those can be further decomposed.\n\nLet me see: the string starts with t13, which should come from some rule A \u2192 a. Let me check what NT1 can produce. From thegrammar, NT1 has:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t12, or other non-terminals. Wait, in the list, NT1 has a production to 't12' \u2014 but looking at the grammar rules, I see NT1 -> 't12' is one of the options. But in the provided string, the first token is 't13', not t12. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the grammar has multiple NT1 productions. Let me look again. The grammar includes:\n\nNT1 -> 't12', and also other non-terminals like NT3, etc. So the first 't13' in the string isn't directly a result of NT1 \u2192 't12'. Maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived by combining multiple paths in the grammar. Let me think of it as a binary tree; each non-terminal expands into two parts. So S produces NT0 and NT1, each of which must expand into their own sequences.\n\nLet me approach this step by step. The string has 40 tokens. Let me count: t13, t71, t17, t11, t58, t71, t10, t13, t47, t67, t8, t4, t55, t40, t79, t13, t74, t2, t43, t58, t44, t4, t42, t69, t40, t36, t0, t80, t79, t8, t69, t69, t36, t74, t68, t50, t68, t71, t41, t74, t13, t73, t68, t47.\n\nWait, but that's 40 tokens, which is an even number, but considering the initial production is two non-terminals, maybe each of those non-terminals contributes 20 tokens each. But I think the parse isn't that straightforward because some productions might lead to more tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the two parts generated by NT0 and NT1. So the first part is the first 20 tokens, and the second part is the next 20 tokens, but that might not necessarily be the case. I need to consider the structure more carefully.\n\nLet me start by seeing if the string can be divided into two segments: one generated by NT0 and the other by NT1. So the entire string is a sequence of symbols that starts with NT0 expansions, followed by NT1 expansions, or vice versa. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT1, perhaps the string is a concatenation of NT0's expansion and then NT1's expansion.\n\nSo the first step is to check if the string can be split into two parts where the first part is generated by NT0 and the second by NT1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT0 expansion produces some tokens, and then NT1 produces the rest. Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT3, etc. So each of these leads to other non-terminals, which can produce more tokens.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 has:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12', and also other rules like NT9, etc.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't13', which might be a problem because in NT1, the direct terminal is 't12'. Wait, but maybe the 't13' comes from another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar rules again. Hmm, I see in the NT1 rules, one of them is NT1 \u2192 t12, another is NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT5. But in the string, the first token is 't13', which isn't 't12'. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I misread the original grammar.\n\nLooking at the original grammar again:\n\nNT1 -> 't12' \u2014 that's correct. So the first token in the string is 't13', but NT1 can only produce 't12' or combinations. Wait, but perhaps it's a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a way to get 't13' through NT0 somehow.\n\nWait, looking at the NT0 rules, one of them is NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, but that would produce two 't's, right? Or if NT5 can produce a 't', but in the string, perhaps it's 't55' or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t13, which might be derived from NT9 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's take the string and walk through it step by step, trying to match it against the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with 't13 t71 t17 t11 t58 t71 t10 t13 t47 t67 t8 t4 t55 t40 t79 t13 t74 t2 t43 t58 t44 t4 t42 t69 t40 t36 t0 t80 t79 t8 t69 t69 t36 t74 t68 t50 t68 t71 t41 t74 t13 t73 t68 t47'\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in reverse. Start from the leaves. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the longest possible derivations starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the first few tokens can be derived from NT0 and NT1.\n\nSince the initial production is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, after that, each of NT0 and NT1 can expand further.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe some of these tokens are non-terminals, but from the grammar, I can see that the terminal symbols are all the tokens that appear in the right-hand side of the productions. So looking at the rules, NT0 can produce things like NT3 NT5, etc., so those are non-terminals, and some NT1 productions"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-482","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and either a single terminal or two non-terminals on the right. That should help because each step in the derivation would produce exactly two symbols, either both non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal, which might complicate things a bit.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string I need to evaluate. The string is `t41 t13 t54 t79 t17 t67 t52 t10 t40 t12 t46 t66 t58 t12 t79 t64 t69 t11 t5 t63 t54 t54 t0 t4 t80 t84 t17 t55 t41 t67 t69 t5 t5 t76 t58 t11 t36 t82 t55 t41 t12 t54 t52 t51 t69`. That's 41 tokens, all of which are terminals except for the NT's which are non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, the non-terminals are represented by NT followed by numbers, and terminals are just the 't' followed by numbers or strings like 't68' which could be terminals or non-terminals if they're on the left.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT9 is a non-terminal, and when it's on the right side of a production, it's being expanded into other symbols. The terminals are the strings that appear as leaves in the parse tree. So in the string, the tokens that are t followed by numbers are either terminals or non-terminals depending on whether they appear as right-hand sides in the productions. For example, 't68' appears as a right-hand side in the production NT9 -> 't68', so in the string, if a 't68' appears, it's a terminal because it can't be further expanded. Similarly, NT0 is a non-terminal because it's on the left of some productions.\n\nSo the first step is to note which combinations of terminals and non-terminals can appear in the string. For the string to be in the language, every non-terminal in the derivation must expand into the correct sequence of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands into NT0 NT1. So the first thing to note is that the string must start with NT0 and NT1 expanding into something that starts with the given string. So let me check if the first token in the string is compatible.\n\nThe string starts with t41. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t41?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT5 -> t84\nNT4 -> t82\nNT3 -> t46\nNT5 -> t58\nNT4 -> t55\nNT9 -> t58\nNT4 -> t41 (Wait, is there a rule for NT4 -> t41? Let me check: Looking through the productions, NT4 appears in several rules, for example, NT4 -> t54, NT4 -> t55, etc. Wait, I don't see NT4 -> t41. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some rules. Re-checking:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT4 -> t54, t55, t54 again, t55 again, t36, t47, t0. So no, NT4 doesn't directly produce t41. So none of the non-terminals directly produce t41. But maybe t41 can be part of a two-symbol production from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking for rules where the right-hand side includes t41.\n\nLooking at NT5: NT5 -> t58, t71, t8, t17, t73, t41. Oh, yes, NT5 -> t41.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT5->t71, NT5->t84, NT5->t74, NT5->t58, NT5->t8, NT5->t17, NT5->t73, NT5->t41. So yes, NT5 can directly produce t41.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 -> t58, t66, t84, etc.\n\nWait, in the initial production S -> NT0 NT1, the first symbol must be either NT0 or NT1 expanding into something that starts with t41. So, since the string starts with t41, we need to see if either NT0 or NT1 can produce t41 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: NT0 -> NT9 NT4, NT0 -> NT9 NT4 again? Wait, let me check the rules correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the rules for NT0 are:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4 (again)\nNT0 -> NT5 NT4?

{"custom_id":"request-493","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar looks a bit complex with a bunch of non-terminals and terminals. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So, every derivation starts with two non-terminals: NT0 and NT1. I need to see if the string provided can be generated by expanding S all the way down.\n\nLooking at the string: `t24 t80 t42 t80 t11 t5 t47 t67 t51 t36 t44 t8 t47 t50 t80 t68 t50 t66 t73 t68 t58 t73 t8 t0 t54 t78 t10 t67 t40 t11 t67 t24 t80 t46 t42 t24 t10 t0 t8 t5 t2`.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens, but I'll process them one by one. Maybe I can parse the string starting from the beginning, trying to find matches in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, 't24'. Let's see where 't24' appears in the grammar. Looking through the NT rules, I see NT0 -> 't24' and NT3 -> 't43'. Wait, no, let me list them:\n\nLooking through NT9, NT0:\n- NT0 has several options, including 't24' in multiple rules. For example, NT0 -> NT9 NT4 and NT0 -> 't24', among others.\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't24'. That could come from NT0. So, after the first token, we have the remaining string: `t80 t42 t80 t11 t5 t47 t67 t51 t36 t44 t8 t47 t50 t80 t68 t50 t66 t73 t68 t58 t73 t8 t0 t54 t78 t10 t67 t40 t11 t67 t24 t80 t46 t42 t24 t10 t0 t8 t5 t2`.\n\nNext, after 't24', the next token is 't80'. So, the first part was NT0 \u2192 't24' followed by 't80'.\n\nBut wait, the production is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so after expanding S, the first two symbols must come from NT0 and NT1 respectively.\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't24', which is part of NT0. The next symbol is 't80', so perhaps NT1 produces 't80'.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n- nt1 can be 't12', 't10', etc.\nWait, let me check NT1's rules:\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT1 -> 't10'\n... others like t80, t67, etc.\n\nYes, NT1 has 't80' as one of its options. So, the first two symbols can be covered by S \u2192 NT0 NT1 \u2192 't24' 't80'.\n\nNow, moving on to the third token, which is 't42'. So, after 't24 t80', the next is 't42'. Let's look at the production for NT0. Because after S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the first token is 't24', which is part of NT0. The next step is to see how the rest of NT0 can produce the remaining parts.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, one of them is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4. Another is NT0 \u2192 't24', but that's only the first token, which we've used. So, perhaps the third token 't42' comes from another production of NT0.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this as a parse tree. Starting from S, the first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so the first two symbols are 't24' (from NT0) and 't80' (from NT1). Now, the remaining string is: starting after 't24 t80', the next tokens are 't42 t80 t11 t5 ...'.\n\nSo, after 't24', we have NT0, which now has to produce the rest of the tokens until 't80'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the entire process step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with 't24 t80'. So, that's NT0 \u2192 't24' and NT1 \u2192 't80'.\n\n2. Now, the remaining string is: t42 t80 t11 t5 t47 t67 t51 t36 t44 t8 t47 t50 t80 t68 t50 t66 t73 t68 t58 t73 t8 t0 t54 t78 t10 t67 t40 t11 t67 t24 t80 t46 t42 t24 t10 t0 t8 t5 t2.\n\n3. The next symbol is 't42'. Looking at NT0's productions again, do any of them produce 't42'? Checking the rules:\n\nLooking through each NT0 production:\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4 \u2192 So, this would involve more symbols, but perhaps this is a path to 't42'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the context-free grammar rules more carefully. Each non-terminal can be replaced by a string of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1 \u2192 't24' from NT0 and 't80' from NT1.\n\nNow, the remaining string is 't42 t80 t11 t5 t47 t67 t51 t36 t44 t8 t47 t50 t80 t68 t50 t66 t73 t68 t58 t73 t8 t0 t54 t78 t10 t67 t40 t11 t67 t24 t80 t46 t42 t24 t10 t0 t8 t5 t2'.\n\nSo, next after 't24 t80', we have 't42'. How can NT0 produce 't42'?\n\nLooking again at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 can be replaced by 't24' (covered already), or other options:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 \u2192 So, this would be NT9 followed by NT4.\n\nWait, but that would mean that after 't24', the next symbols would be from NT9 and NT4. But the next symbol is 't42', so this might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps there's another path.\n\nLet me check NT0's other productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (already listed)\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for a way to derive 't42' from NT0.\n\nLooking through the NT0 productions, none of the replacements directly yield 't42', except possibly via chain rules. So, perhaps I need to consider how 't42' is produced through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the token 't42', let me see which non-terminals produce 't42'.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, some NTs can produce 't42':\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't54' (No)\n- NT3 \u2192 't43' (No)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5 (Yes, so 't43' and 't...' etc.)\n- Wait, perhaps I should trace through possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not in the language because 't42' doesn't appear as a terminal in any production chain.\n\nWait, looking through the NT rules, I don't see 't42' as a terminal in any of the productions. All the terminals are things like 't10', 't24', etc., but not 't42' directly.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals are:\n\n't24', 't80', 't42', 't80', 't11', 't5', 't47', 't67', 't51', 't36', 't44', 't8', 't47', 't50', 't80', 't68', 't50', 't66', 't73', 't68', 't58', 't73', 't8', 't0', 't54', 't78', 't10', 't67', 't40', 't11', 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-490","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has specific rules where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, and the start symbol doesn't produce the empty string. So I need to keep that in mind as I analyze the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So S is the start symbol, and it's generating two non-terminals: NT0 and NT1. Each of these must be expanded further.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t42 t54 t58 t11 t42 t55 t2 t76 t40 t47 t43 t67 t82 t84 t80 t8 t69 t8 t47 t44 t52 t0 t63 t47 t13 t43 t12 t78 t67 t10 t10 t82 t69 t73 t76 t0 t40 t50 t36 t47 t42 t47 t79 t13 t69 t80. \n\nFirst, I notice that this is a list of tokens separated by spaces, so it's a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try a top-down approach since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is suitable for that. Starting from S, which produce NT0 NT1. Let's see what NT0 and NT1 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT0: It has several productions. For example, NT0 can become NT3 NT5, or NT9 NT4, and others. Similarly, NT1 can produce several combinations as well.\n\nI think I'll try to look for any sequence of terminals that must come from specific productions. Let's see if any of the tokens at the beginning of the string can only come from certain NTs.\n\nThe first token is t42. Looking at the grammar, where do t42 appear? Checking each NT:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that t42 is on the right-hand side of a few productions. Let's list them:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t42\n- NT0 \u2192 t42 (in the production NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4, where NT5 could be t54, but wait, let me check. Looking at NT5 \u2192 t54? No, NT5 has productions like \u2192 t11, t74, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each NT for t42.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT0:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5 (so t42 could be in NT3 or NT5)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the NTs and their productions:\n\nNT9 productions: always something with 't' strings, but none contain 't42' as a terminal?\n\nWait, the NTs are:\n\nNT0: several options, including NT5 NT4\nNT1: NT11, t12, etc., but looking for t42\nWait, t42 appears in NT5? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, t42 is a terminal only on NT3 \u2192 t42. So if NT3 can produce t42, that's one way. Also, on NT0's side, in some cases, like NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT4, but in that case, maybe NT5 or NT4 can produce t42? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking for t42 in any of the NT productions:\n\nLooking at each NT:\n\n- NT9 only produces terms like 't68', 't64', etc., but not t42 as a terminal.\n- NT0's productions always have non-terminals except when NT9 is involved, but in those cases, it's something like NT9 \u2192 t68, etc., so nt9 can't produce t42 directly.\nWait, let's go back. The string starts with t42, t54, etc.\n\nSo, t42 can be obtained from NT3 \u2192 t42. So if NT0 somehow has a production that includes NT3, then that could produce t42. Let me see.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1. So S must be followed by two non-terminals. So the first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which then need to be expanded.\n\nAssuming S is the start, the first step produces two non-terminals, say A and B. Then A and B must expand into the string.\n\nLooking at the first token t42. Suppose one of the non-terminals (A or B) must produce t42. So, for example, A could be NT3, which can produce t42, or B could be another NT that can produce t42, but that's only NT3.\n\nSo let me see if I can build the string step by step.\n\nLet's write down the string again: t42 t54 t58 t11 t42 t55 t2 t76 t40 t47 t43 t67 t82 t84 t80 t8 t69 t8 t47 t44 t52 t0 t63 t47 t13 t43 t12 t78 t67 t10 t10 t82 t69 t73 t76 t0 t40 t50 t36 t47 t42 t47 t79 t13 t69 t80.\n\nLooking at this, the first token is t42. So let's see what can lead to t42.\n\nFrom NT3 \u2192 t42, so that's one possibility. So if one of the NTs is NT3, it can produce t42.\n\nNow, looking at the second token t54. Hmm, looking into the grammar, t54 appears in NT5 \u2192 t54. So perhaps NT3 can produce t42, and another NT leads to t54.\n\nWait, but NT3's production is only to t42. So wait, perhaps that's a dead end. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding NT3's production. Wait, no, the production is NT3 \u2192 t42. So NT3 can only produce t42, right? Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nWait no, no\u2014each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so NT3 can be expanded into t42, or potentially, is NT3 ever on the left side again? Let me check. For example, looking through all the productions, I don't see any production where NT3 is on the left side except where it's on the right side.\n\nWait, let me look again. From all the productions, I don't see any rules where NT3 is the left-hand side except for the production NT3 \u2192 t42. So once NT3 is expanded, it can't expand further. Because there is no rule in the grammar where NT3 produces something else, besides the terminal t42.\n\nSo that complicates things. Because t42 is the first token, and if the derivation goes through NT3, then the next token after t42 must be something that comes from another NT. So the next token is t54, which must come from somewhere.\n\nLooking back, the next token is t54. Looking at the grammar, where does t54 appear?\n\nLooking through the NTs: NT5 has a production \u2192 t54. So perhaps the next NT after t42 comes from NT5 producing t54.\n\nBut wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to visualize.\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nSo S must produce two NTs. Let's denote them as A and B. The first token in the string is t42, which is from A or B.\n\nAssuming that A expands into t42, so A must be NT3, because that's the only NT that can produce t42 directly.\n\nSo now, S \u2192 NT3 NT1. So the first non-terminal is NT3, which produces t42, and then NT1 must produce the rest of the string.\n\nThe rest of the string after t42 is: t54 t58 t11 t42 t55 t2 t76 t40 t47 t43 t67 t82 t84 t80 t8 t69 t8 t47 t44 t52 t0 t63 t47 t13 t43 t12 t78 t67 t10 t10 t82 t69 t73 t76 t0 t40 t50 t36 t47 t42 t47 t79 t13 t69 t80.\n\nSo the next token is t54.

{"custom_id":"request-503","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether this given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and the grammar structure.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- The start symbol is S.\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so S produces two non-terminals.\n- NT9 produces two non-terminals or sometimes a terminal.\n- NT0 has several productions, some to terminals and others to combinations of non-terminals.\n- I notice that NT1 seems to often produce 't12' (like NT1 \u2192 't12'), but also sometimes produce other non-terminals like NT5, NT9, etc.\n- NT3 has a mix of terminals and non-terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't43' or NT3 \u2192 NT4.\n- Other non-terminals like NT4, NT5, etc., have productions leading to various terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t66 t55 t11 t44 t52 t8 t52 t46 t43 t64 t50 t17 t36 t55 t55 t47 t40 t40 t64 t80 t4 t17 t54 t66 t41 t13 t50 t46 t67 t58 t68 t84 t66 t13 t8 t69 t8 t58 t12 t54 t84 t82 t79 t44 t5`.\n\nThe first step is to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. In CNF, each production either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals. So the parse tree will have a binary structure where each internal node is a non-terminal, and leaves are terminals.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into its components: each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. The string is quite long, so I need a systematic way to approach this.\n\nLet me try to see if I can build up the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't54'. So I need to find a production for the first non-terminal that produces 't54'. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't54' (NT5 \u2192 't54'), so if the first symbol comes from NT5 \u2192 't54', then the first part is done.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the first step is that S produces two non-terminals, NT0 and NT1. So the parse tree starts with S, which splits into NT0 and NT1. The entire string must be generated from these two.\n\nSo the first terminal in the string must come from NT0 or NT1. Let me list the possible terminals each of these non-terminals can produce:\n\n- NT0 has productions like NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, NT0 \u2192 't10', etc. So from NT0, we can generate certain terminals or non-terminals.\n- NT1 has productions like NT1 \u2192 't67', NT1 \u2192 't46', NT1 \u2192 't54', etc.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is 't54'. Let's see what NT1 can produce. Looking at the rules for NT1:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't67' (not matching), NT1 \u2192 't54'? Wait, no, looking back: Checking the NT1 productions:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\n\nNT9 -> 't68'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT3 -> 't43'\n\nAnd so on. Wait, perhaps I need to redo the grammar in a clearer way, as the user's format seems a bit jumbled. Let me list all the production rules for clarity:\n\nThe grammar rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n\nNT9 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't43'\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT4\n\nNT9 \u2192 't54'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't64'\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some, let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT3 \u2192 't43'\n- NT0 \u2192 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't4' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all production rules as per the user's message.\n\nLet me list each production without the variable names:\n\n1.

The grammar is a bit complex with multiple non-terminals, and the string is quite long. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the grammar has several NT rules leading to terminals (like t-something) or other NT rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t40 t11 t36 t40 t46 t64 t17 t80 t5 t5 t55 t63 t58 t69 t58 t80 t84 t64 t74 t0 t17 t4 t44 t80 t69 t67 t11 t8 t79 t42 t43 t8 t24 t43 t52 t42 t36 t43 t51 t63 t84 t36 t13 t66 t84 t63 t68.\n\nI'm going to start by identifying which NT rules can produce these terminals. Let's list out the NT rules and their productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 't68'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT3 \u2192 't47'\n- NT4 \u2192 't47'\n- NT5 \u2192 't51'\n- NT9 \u2192 't52'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4' (Wait, that's new, I didn't notice this before. It's under the S definition perhaps?)\nWait, no. Let me recheck the grammar. Looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that NT0 has several options:\n- NT0 \u2192 't4' (Yes, this is an addition I didn't consider earlier)\n- So now, NT0 can produce t4, which is a new terminal I didn't have before.\n\nWait, but in the original grammar, were there any other t4? Let me see. The string has t4 towards the end, so perhaps that's generated by this new NT0 \u2192 't4'.\n\nThis is important because I missed it earlier.\n\nSo the string ends with t4, which would have to come from NT0 \u2192 't4'. So that's my first point.\n\nMoving on, the string starts with t40, t11, t36, etc. I need to see if these can be produced by some combination of NT rules.\n\nLet me see the NT rules that produce these:\n\n- t40: Looking through the NT productions, I don't see any NT rule directly producing 't40'. So maybe 't40' comes from a longer production, perhaps via multiple NT steps.\n\nWait, no. Chomsky normal form doesn't allow for terminals on the left side, only non-terminals. So each rule must break down into non-terminals that eventually produce terminals.\n\nSo perhaps 't40' must come directly from an NT rule, but in the original grammar, the only terminals are under the NT rules, and I don't see any NT rule producing 't40' initially. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I need to trace back the NT rules that produce the string's components.\n\nStarting from the entire string, I'll need to see if each part can be derived from some start symbol.\n\nBut given the length of the string (45 tokens), this might be tedious. Maybe I can look for patterns or possible chains.\n\nFirst, the string: t40 t11 t36 t40 t46 t64 t17 t80 t5 t5 t55 t63 t58 t69 t58 t80 t84 t64 t74 t0 t17 t4 t44 t80 t69 t67 t11 t8 t79 t42 t43 t8 t24 t43 t52 t42 t36 t43 t51 t63 t84 t36 t13 t66 t84 t63 t68.\n\nLet me check each terminal:\n\nFirst token: t40.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t40. So I need to check if t40 is part of a longer production. Wait, but in Chomsky normal form, the only way t40 could appear is if it's part of an NT rule that eventually expands into t40 via other rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, none of the NT rules produce t40 directly. So that's a problem because the string starts with t40, which isn't directly produced by any NT rule. Therefore, I might suspect that the string is invalid, but I need to check further.\n\nWait, perhaps t40 comes from a longer NT production, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLooking again at the ND rules, perhaps t40 is part of a sequence generated by multiple NTs. Alternatively, perhaps t40 is generated via a combination of rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a possible chain that could produce t40. Let me see:\n\nLooking for NT rules that produce higher-level NTs which could generate t40. For example, maybe an NT rule produces two parts, each leading to terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which NT rules produce sequences that can eventually lead to t40 as the first symbol.\n\nBut in the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly leads to t40. Therefore, the first step is that the string starts with t40, which can't be produced directly by any NT rule, so the string might already be invalid, hence the answer is No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing some rules. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back, the grammar is as provided, and from the rules listed, the NT9 can produce t68, t52, etc., and NT0 can produce t10, t4, etc. But I don't see any rule that produces t40. Therefore, t40 cannot be generated by any rule in the grammar, making the string invalid.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. The first symbol in the string is 't40'.\n2. Checking the provided grammar, none of the NT production rules directly produce 't40'.\n3. Since Chomsky normal form requires all symbols in the expansion to be non-terminals or starting with a non-terminal, and there's no production rule that starts with 't40', the string cannot be generated.\n4.

{"custom_id":"request-511","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: \n\n`t74 t12 t84 t73 t80 t50 t73 t73 t50 t63 t84 t46 t63 t68 t55 t76 t13 t78 t73 t76 t24 t55 t66 t73 t13 t76 t63 t24 t12 t51 t8 t2 t54 t47 t17 t47 t68 t64 t41 t73 t76 t58 t76 t69 t13 t71 t78 t82`\n\nFirst, I should note that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) consists of production rules where each non-terminal is rewritten as exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all production rules seem to fit that structure, so that's good.\n\nThe approach to this problem is to use a method similar to the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars. The CYK algorithm parses strings by testing whether the string can be generated by the grammar using a dynamic programming approach. However, since I'm not implementing the algorithm, I'll break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understand the Grammar**: Let's list all the production rules to see how symbols can be rewritten.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. Each NTx is a non-terminal that can be rewritten into a combination of NTs or terminals.\n\n2. **Break Down the String**: The string has 46 tokens (words separated by spaces). Each token is a terminal symbol. I need to check if these tokens can be generated by the grammar.\n\n3. **Identify Non-Terminals and Terminals**: In the grammar, non-terminals are all the parts that can be replaced by rules. Terminals are the symbols that are leaves in the parse tree (e.g., 't74', 't12', etc.). So, any symbol that's on the left side of a production or appears in a production as a terminal is a non-terminal; others are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals are NT0, NT1, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT9. Terminals are all the other tokens.\n\n4. **Check for String Structure**: The start symbol S must produce the entire string. So the string should be derived starting from S, which is NT0 NT1. This means the string must start with symbols derived from NT0 and NT1.\n\n5. **Analyze the String Tokens**:\nLet's list the tokens:\n\n1. t74\n2. t12\n3. t84\n4. t73\n5. t80\n6. t50\n7. t73\n8. t73\n9. t50\n10. t63\n11. t84\n12. t46\n13. t63\n14. t68\n15. t55\n16. t76\n17. t13\n18. t78\n19. t73\n20. t76\n21. t24\n22. t55\n23. t66\n24. t73\n25. t13\n26. t76\n27. t63\n28. t24\n29. t12\n30. t51\n31. t8\n32. t2\n33. t54\n34. t47\n35. t17\n36. t47\n37. t68\n38. t64\n39. t41\n40. t73\n41. t76\n42. t58\n43. t76\n44. t69\n45. t13\n46. t71\n47. t78\n48. t82\n\nWait, wait, the string has 48 tokens? Let me recount:\n\nWait the user provided the string as:\n\n`t74 t12 t84 t73 t80 t50 t73 t73 t50 t63 t84 t46 t63 t68 t55 t76 t13 t78 t73 t76 t24 t55 t66 t73 t13 t76 t63 t24 t12 t51 t8 t2 t54 t47 t17 t47 t68 t64 t41 t73 t76 t58 t76 t69 t13 t71 t78 t82`\n\nThat's 48 tokens. Hmm, I might have miscounted earlier.\n\nSo, 48 tokens.\n\n6. **Identify Length Constraints**: Each production in CNF has a binary length reduction. So the number of symbols in a sentential form reduces each time until we reach the terminals. The initial string from S would have exactly two symbols:NT0 and NT1, so the number of symbols starts at 2.\n\nEach production rule in CNF can expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal and something else. Wait, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1 (two non-terminals)\nNT9 -> NT68 (terminal)\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5 (two non-terminals)\nSo, every production either introduces two non-terminals or terminates with a terminal.\n\nTherefore, starting from S with two non-terminals (S is the start symbol), each step can increase the number of non-terminals by 0 (if a non-terminal is replaced by two others) or decrease by one (if a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal and a non-terminal, but actually, no, wait: in CNF, each production is only two symbols: either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production can only produce either two non-terminals (reducing the count by one if already within a parse tree) or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in this case, since the rule is A -> a, where a is a terminal, meaning the count would change differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the parse tree. The string is the sequence of terminals, so each terminal must correspond to a path from the root to the leaves in the parse tree where non-terminals are expanded.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps a better approach is to simulate the possible parse steps.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, let me consider the structure.\n\nThe string starts with 't74', which must come from a production of some non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't74'?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLooking through NT9, NT0, etc., any rules where the non-terminal can rewrite to 't74'?\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't54'\n- NT0 -> 't74' only appears in rules where NT0 is followed by something else, right?\n\nWait, let's see the grammar rules:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nLooking for any production that outputs 't74':\n\nChecking all the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT5 -> 't17' (no)\nNT4 -> 't54' (no)\nLooking for 't74':\n- It's listed as NT5 -> 't54' and NT4 -> 't54'?

So the string must begin and end with NT0 and NT1, respectively, but the given string starts with t41, which I think corresponds to some NT production.\n\nWait, hold on. The string is a sequence of t symbols, each probably corresponding to the NT productions. I need to map each 't' symbol in the string to the NTs that can produce them. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT9 can produce several 't's:\n- NT9 -> t68\n- NT9 -> t66\n- NT9 -> t64\nWait, looking closer, I see NT9 can go to t68 directly? No, wait. Let me list all the NT9 productions:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5 (which would combine NT1 and NT5's t's)\nNT9 -> 't68'\nNT9 -> 't64'\nNT9 -> 't52'\nNT9 -> 't36' (twice)\nNT9 -> 't47' (twice)\n\nSimilarly, let me look at other NTs:\n\nFor example, NT0 can produce a lot of different things, including 't10', 't4', 't64', 't9' ( Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT0 has several options, including NT1 NT5, which would concatenate their t's, or other terminal t's.\n\nHmm, maybe I should construct the parse tree step by step. The string is:\n\nt41 t66 t36 t84 t46 t2 t46 t5 t76 t79 t82 t58 t73 t42 t63 t13 t50 t82 t46 t69 t5 t54 t47 t8 t52 t73 t69 t43 t13 t10 t73 t74 t51 t55 t2 t78 t40 t82 t68 t2 t0 t84 t42 t36 t55 t24 t46 t5 t0.\n\nThat's quite long. Let me count the tokens. There are 52 tokens, so the parse tree would have a depth matching that.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this by looking for possible derivations. Let me see if I can break the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe start is S -> NT0 NT1, so the string must start with NT0 and end with NT1. Looking at the string, the first token is t41, which likely comes from NT0 or NT9. Wait, let me see which NT can produce t41.\n\nLooking at the grammar, none of the immediate productions for NTs have t41. So perhaps t41 is part of a larger NT production. For example, NT9 can expand to NT1 NT5, which could then expand to t41 via NT1's production or something else.\n\nWait, looking at the NT1 productions:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT1 -> 't10'\nNT1 -> 't73'\nNT1 -> 't74'\nNT1 -> 't51'\nNT1 -> 't42'\n\nHmm, none of these are t41. So maybe t41 is part of NT5's production. Let me check NT5:\n\nNT5 can expand to NT1 NT1, which would produce two t's, or to 't17', 't71', 't8', 't54', 't47', 't58', 't84'.\n\nSimilarly, t41 isn't directly produced by any NT, so it must be part of a chain of productions where NTs expand into other NTs until a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step, seeing if it can be split into parts that fit the grammar structure.\n\nAnother approach is to represent each token and see if it can be matched by the NTs.\n\nLet me consider the start:\n\nThe first symbol is t41. Since NT1 doesn't have t41, perhaps it's part of a longer NT.\n\nLooking at NT0 productions, it can produce several combinations. For example, NT0 can go to NT3 NT5. If NT3 can produce t41, but looking at NT3's production:\n\nNT3 has several options, including:\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT3 -> 't47'\nNT3 -> 't43'\nNT3 -> 't50'\nNT3 -> 't78'\nWait, none of these are t41. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for t41 in the grammar. Actually, the grammar might have t41 as an output of some combination, but looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t41.\n\nWait, perhaps t41 is a result of combining NT5s, but looking at NT5's productions: NT5 can produce 't58' which is a terminal, or other NT combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The first token is t41, which is probably generated by NT9 or another NT that can eventually produce t41 through a chain.\n\nWait, looking back to NT9, the productions are:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT9 -> 't68'\nNT9 -> 't64'\nNT9 -> 't52'\nNT9 -> 't36' (twice)\nNT9 -> 't47' (twice)\n\nHmm, so if NT9 can expand to other NTs, perhaps t41 is part of a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps t41 is part of NT73, but looking at NT73, I don't see any production. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT73 is part of other NTs:\n\nLooking at NT73 in the grammar, I don't see a direct production. So maybe t41 isn't directly covered. Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path.\n\nPerhaps I should approach this by looking for the last token, which is 't0'. Let's see where 't0' comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, 't0' is a terminal symbol in NT9's production:\n\nNT9 -> 't0'\n\nSo that's one way to get t0. So in the parse tree, the last symbol must be t0 produced by NT9.\n\nThus, the last part of the string must be part of an NT9 that expands to 't0'.\n\nLooking back at the string, the last token is t0, preceded by several other t's. So let's start from the end and work backwards.\n\nThe last few tokens before t0 are: t84, t42, t36, t55, t24, t46, t5, t0.\n\nWait, but let me list the token sequence from the end:\n\nt0\n\nLooking backwards, before t0, the previous token is 't84' (the second to last token). Wait, no: looking at the string:\n\nThe last token is t0 (position 52). Before that is t84 (position 51). But in the grammar, NT9 can produce 't84'.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, yes, NT9 can expand directly to 't84'.\n\nSo perhaps the last part is NT9 -> 't84' followed by t0. But wait, the grammar doesn't have a production where NT9 produces 't0' and 't84' directly. So perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t0 is the result of a longer chain. For example, NT9 could expand to NT1 and NT5, which then expand to t's.\n\nWait, perhaps that would be: NT9 -> NT1 NT5. Then NT1 could produce t0, and NT5 could produce 't' something?\n\nWait, looking at NT5's productions: it can produce 't58', 't84', etc., but not directly t0. So that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t0 is part of a combination that leads back to the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, I might be approaching this wrong. Let me try to look for possible segments in the string that can be matched by a production rule.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t41, t66, t36, etc. I wonder if these can be the result of an NT9 production.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, if it's expanding to NT1 and NT5, then the two symbols from NT1 and NT5 could combine.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nSuppose NT9 -> NT1 NT5.\n\nNT1 could produce t66 (from NT1's 't66'? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT1 doesn't directly produce t66. Hmm.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-525","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that each production rule is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. That should make parsing the string a bit easier because there's a standard way to parse such grammars, like the CYK algorithm. Wait, but the string given is quite long, so doing it manually might not be feasible. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and S directly produces NT0 NT1. So the entire string must be generated by expanding these non-terminals until we get a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, each non-terminal seems to produce one or more terminals or combinations of non-terminals. For example, NT0 can produce NT3 NT5, which can further expand into terminal strings. My goal is to see if the given string can be broken down into these production steps.\n\nThe string provided is: `t68 t74 t74 t67 t43 t74 t69 t84 t8 t5 t12 t46 t5 t68 t0 t43 t68 t40 t17 t4 t40 t78 t8 t73 t58 t80 t10 t12 t71 t51 t69 t17 t82 t69 t80 t52 t78 t2 t43 t76 t50 t79 t47 t76 t43 t55 t67 t73 t44`.\n\nThat's 46 tokens. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string starts with t68. Looking at the grammar, t68 can be generated by either NT9 -> 't68' or NT0 -> 't68' (from the production rules listed). So S starts with NT0 and NT1. The string starts with t68, which is in NT0's production, so that's okay.\n\nBut wait, after S -> NT0 NT1, the first symbol is t68, which is in NT0's production. So let's follow the expansion of NT0.\n\nLooking at NT0, it can produce several things: NT3 NT5, NT9 NT4, or directly some terminals like t2, t47, t9, etc. Given that the first token is 't68', which is directly produced by NT0 (from the production NT0 -> 't68'), that would mean NT0 stops here. But then, after that, we have to consider the rest of the string, which is 't74 t74 t67 t43 t74 t69 t84 t8 t5 t12 t46 t5 t68 t0 t43 t68 t40 t17 t4 t40 t78 t8 t73 t58 t80 t10 t12 t71 t51 t69 t17 t82 t69 t80 t52 t78 t2 t43 t76 t50 t79 t47 t76 t43 t55 t67 t73 t44'.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is 't68', so that would be the expansion of NT0, and then NT1 would produce the rest. So NT1 would have to generate the remaining string: 't74 t74 t67 t43 t74 t69 t84 t8 t5 t12 t46 t5 t68 t0 t43 t68 t40 t17 t4 t40 t78 t8 t73 t58 t80 t10 t12 t71 t51 t69 t17 t82 t69 t80 t52 t78 t2 t43 t76 t50 t79 t47 t76 t43 t55 t67 t73 t44'.\n\nBut looking at NT1's productions: NT1 -> 't12' or NT1 -> 't46'. The next token is 't74', which doesn't match either. So that approach seems stuck.\n\nMaybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the CYK algorithm steps. The string length is 46, so k will range from 1 to 46. But since we can't do this manually, I need to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the entire string, I can check for possible starting points. S -> NT0 NT1, so the first two symbols should come from NT0 and NT1. Let's see the first two terms: 't68' and 't74'. So NT0 must produce 't68' and NT1 must produce 't74'.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, it can produce 't68' directly. So NT0 -> 't68' is acceptable. Then NT1 needs to produce the remaining string after 't74', which starts with 't74', but NT1's productions are 't12' or 't46'. Neither produce 't74', so this path doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expansion isn't S -> NT0 NT1, but I don't think so because that's how the grammar is structured.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with 't68' which is from NT0, and then follows with 't74', which is from NT1, but since NT1 can only produce 't12' or 't46', not 't74', that's invalid.\n\nSo maybe 't74' is obtained by expanding NT1. Let me check NT1's productions: NT1 can produce 't12' or 't46' directly. So the second symbol being 't74' suggests that NT1's production includes 't74' somewhere in its expansion, but looking at the grammar, none of NT1's productions directly or indirectly produce 't74'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT1. Wait, NT1 can produce 't12' or 't46' directly, but also, perhaps through other non-terminals.\n\nLooking back, NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT1 -> NT3 NT5\n\nOr wait, looking at the original grammar, that's not the case. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the original grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nAre there other productions for NT1? Let me check again. Wait, the grammar as given is:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\n\nOther rules include NT1 -> 't12' and NT1 -> 't46' (looking at the last entries). Wait, actually in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT1 -> 't46'\n\nAdditionally, perhaps more? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT1 -> 't46'\n\nAre there any other NT1 productions? Let me scan through:\n\nNo, under NT1, I see only those two.\n\nSo NT1 can produce either 't12' or 't46' directly. Therefore, the second symbol being 't74' after 't68' would require that NT0 produces 't68' (which is possible) and NT1 must produce 't74', but that's not possible because NT1's are limited to 't12' or 't46'. Therefore, the second symbol being 't74' is a problem.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with 't68 t74', but NT1 can't produce 't74'. So this suggests that the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in checking the NT1 productions. Let me list all NT1 productions again to ensure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking again at the grammar:\n\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n\n- NT1 -> 't46'\n\nNo others. So NT1 can only produce 't12' or 't46'. Therefore, 't74' can't come from NT1.\n\nSo the initial steps fail right away.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given, and I need to parse the string `t12 t47 t40 t80 t66 t10 t73 t73 t8 t55 t42 t84 t51 t54 t68 t67 t42 t42 t0 t41 t58 t47 t4 t5 t51 t47 t80 t47 t42 t0 t64 t78 t41 t51 t84 t17 t5 t67 t67 t0 t10 t66 t40 t64 t43 t13 t73 t52 t4 t17` using the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and each production starts with S.\n\nI know that one method to check if a string is generated by a grammar is to perform a reduction, where I start from the start symbol and apply the productions to try to derive the string step by step.\n\nAnother tool is the CYK algorithm, but that might be too time-consuming if the string is long, given that it's a context-free grammar. However, I'll try to tackle it step by step manually.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. Each terminal must match a production's right-hand side (RHS). Let's try to see how the string can be broken down into non-terminals and terminals.\n\nStarting from S, the first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So S is two non-terminals, NT0 and NT1. This means the string must start with the concatenation of NT0 and NT1.\n\nLooking at the string: The first token is t12. Checking the grammar, t12 is a terminal. Let's see which production for NT1 can produce t12. Looking at NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12' (directly).\n\nSo NT1 can be replaced by t12. Therefore, the first part of the string is t12, which matches NT1. That leaves NT0 to be matched by the rest of the string after t12.\n\nSo the rest of the string is: t47 t40 t80 t66 t10 t73 t73 t8 t55 t42 t84 t51 t54 t68 t67 t42 t42 t0 t41 t58 t47 t4 t5 t51 t47 t80 t47 t42 t0 t64 t78 t41 t51 t84 t17 t5 t67 t67 t0 t10 t66 t40 t64 t43 t13 t73 t52 t4 t17\n\nWait, maybe I should break down the string into parts corresponding to NT0 and NT1. Since the string is the concatenation of the first NT0 production and NT1 production, the string must start with the sequence from NT0 and end with the sequence from NT1, or vice versa depending on the order.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the string must start with NT0 and then NT1. But NT1 ends directly with t12. So let me see:\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the string is separated into parts: NT0 and NT1. So the string is split into two parts: the first part must be generated by NT0, and the second part by NT1.\n\nBut wait, NT1 can produce a terminal t12 directly. So the second token must be t12. Looking at the string, the first token is t12, which aligns with NT1. Then the rest of the string beyond t12 must come from NT0.\n\nWait, no. NT0 is the first part, and NT1 is the second. So the string starts with NT0, then NT1. So the first part corresponds to NT0, and the second part to NT1.\n\nBut looking at the string: the first token is t12, which is NT1, so that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in splitting. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So when expanded, the string is [NT0] [NT1]. The entire string must be the concatenation of what NT0 generates and what NT1 generates. So if the string starts with t12, which is terminal, that would have to come from NT1, but S's expansion requires that both NT0 and NT1 are part of the string. So if the string starts with a terminal, that must be part of NT1's expansion.\n\nBut wait, the string is as follows: t12 t47 t40 t80 ... etc. So the first token is t12, which is NT1. So that would leave NT0 to generate the remaining tokens starting from the second one.\n\nLet me check that. The first token is t12, so that's NT1, so the first part is S \u2192 NT0 NT1 \u2192 nt0 t12. Thus, the entire string must start with nt0, followed by t12. So the first token is t12, which is the end of NT1. But S requires both nt0 and nt1. Therefore, the production would be nt0 generating the rest of the string except for t12.\n\nWait, no. Because S \u2192 NT0 NT1, which would translate to a string that is the concatenation of NT0's derivation and NT1's derivation. So if NT1 can produce t12 directly, then the string must start with the NT0 derived part, followed by t12. But the first token is t12, which is terminal, so that would mean that NT1 is generating t12 as the first token. But how can that be, because S \u2192 NT0 NT1 requires that the entire string starts with NT0, then NT1. But if the first token is t12, which is NT1, that can't be. Unless NT1 is part of the first token? No, because NT1 would need to expand to a sequence that starts with a terminal, but S's production requires NT0 followed by NT1. Therefore, the entire string should have nt0 followed by nt1. So the first part of the string (before the nt1 part) must come from nt0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think recursively. Let's consider NT0 and NT1 as terminals?

So, if NT1 can produce t12 directly, then NT1's expansion is t12, and the rest of the string (from position 2 onwards) must be generated by NT0.\n\nBut wait, the first token is t12, so according to S, the entire string is NT0 followed by NT1. Therefore, the first token must be part of NT0's expansion, but t12 is a terminal, which cannot be a part of NT0's expansion if NT0 is a non-terminal that can only expand into other non-terminals or terminals through its productions.\n\nWait, that's confusing.

So any symbol that starts with 't' is a terminal, others are non-terminals.\n\nSo, NT0, NT1, etc., are non-terminals, except for the 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals.\n\nThus, NT0 must expand into a sequence of non-terminals and\/or terminals. Similarly for NT1.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me outline the approach.\n\nStep 1: Parse the string according to the grammar, starting from S.\n\nWe'll need to check if the entire string can be derived starting from S by applying the productions.\n\nPerhaps, to do this, I can perform a top-down parsing, expanding NT0 and NT1 step by step.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT0 NT1.

{"custom_id":"request-535","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has certain rules: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow CNF since all production rules are either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t63 t10 t10 t69 t52 t10 t17 t17 t68 t36 t51 t84 t44 t2 t17 t67 t58 t43 t13 t42 t74 t42 t67 t55 t24 t12 t46 t0 t43 t46 t36 t64 t82 t0 t73 t52 t78 t24 t79 t12 t11 t13 t4 t74 t52 t64 t50 t51 t55 t69`. That's a long string, so I need a systematic way to check it.\n\nI think the best approach is to perform a parsing using the given grammar. Since it's in CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or simulate the parsing step by step. Since writing a full parser here might be time-consuming, perhaps I can look for the structure of the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the first step should be that the string starts with the concatenation of two non-terminals, NT0 and NT1. So the entire string must be generated by this initial rule.\n\nLooking at NT0 and NT1, I should find their productions. Let's list them:\n\nNT0 can produce:\n- NT3 NT5\n- NT9 NT4\n- ... many others, but importantly, let's look for the sequences that lead to terminals.\n\nSince the string starts with 't63', let's see what produces 't63'. Looking through the NT0 productions, I find NT0 \u2192 't64' under production 'NT0 -> t64'. But wait, NT0 is a non-terminal, so it needs to produce a sequence of terminals. So for NT0 to produce 't64', I suppose there's a rule NT0 \u2192 't64', which would generate the terminal directly.\n\nWait, let me check the NT0 productions. Yes, there is NT0 -> 't64'. So the first part could be 't64', but the actual string starts with 't63'. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Let me check the first part again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again: the first symbol is 't63', so I need to find a production for NT0 that starts with 't63'. Looking through the NT0 productions, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't63'? No, I don't see that. Let me check all the productions for NT0:\n\nLooking through the list:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (same as above)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 \u2192 't10' (No)\nWait, I might have misread.

No. Wait, perhaps I got it wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading the NT0 productions. Let me list all:\n\nNT0:\n- => NT3 NT5\n- => NT9 NT4\n- => NT0 -> 't10' (No, looking at the list, there's NT0 -> NT1 etc., but for NT0 producing directly, I see:\n\nLooking through the entire list of rules, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT0 -> 't10' \u2192 Wait, no, I think I misread.

Each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-18","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string \"t64 t67\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has each production rule either starting with a non-terminal symbol and producing two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. The grammar's production rules are all in CNF, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing and helps in analyzing the structure of the generated strings.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t64 t67\". Since this is a sequence of two tokens, I'm guessing each corresponds to a terminal symbol derived from the grammar. So, the string consists of 't64' followed by 't67'. My goal is to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S -> NT0 NT1. So, for the string to be derived, NT0 and NT1 must produce 't64' and 't67' respectively, or through other non-terminals that eventually resolve to these strings.\n\nLet me check the production rules for NT0 and NT1. \n\nStarting with NT1:\nNT1 -> t12, but our string has 't67', so NT1 isn't that. Checking other NT1 rules:\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT1 -> 't46'\n- NT1 -> 't51'\n- NT1 -> 't80'\n- NT1 -> 't80' again\n- NT1 -> 't73'so none of these directly produce 't67'. Wait, hold on, looking again, I see that NT1 has a production 't67'? Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking through the NT1 rules:\n\nYes, I see NT1 -> 't67' is present. There's a specific production NT1 -> t67. That's in the list for NT1. So NT1 can directly produce 't67'.\n\nNow for NT0: it needs to produce 't64'. Let me look at the rules for NT0:\n\nNT0 has several productions. Let me list them all to see which could lead to 't64':\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4 (duplicate)\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT4\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT0 -> 't24'\n- NT0 -> 't2'\n- NT0 -> 't47'\n- NT0 -> 't64'\n\nAh, so NT0 has a direct production to 't64' as NT0 -> t64. That's straightforward. So, NT0 can directly produce 't64' and NT1 can directly produce 't67'.\n\nPutting it all together, S -> NT0 NT1 can directly produce 't64 t67' if both NT0 and NT1 have productions for these terminals. \n\nWait, but I should verify if the grammar can indeed derive this. Let me double-check the rules for NT0 and NT1.\n\nFor NT0: Yes, there's a production NT0 -> t64, which means NT0 can directly generate 't64'. Similarly, for NT1: There's a production NT1 -> t67. So when you apply S -> NT0 NT1, you get 't64 t67'.\n\nAlternatively, the parsing process would be:\n\n1. Apply S -> NT0 NT1.\n2. NT0 is replaced by t64 (direct production).\n3. NT1 is replaced by t67 (direct production).\n4.

{"custom_id":"request-37","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that CNF has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. This grammar follows that structure.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t66 t0 t67`. Let's break it down into parts: it's three tokens, which probably each correspond to a single production step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step should produce exactly two symbols, but here the string has three, which makes me think it's a combination of two productions, meaning the total string is a concatenation of two steps. Wait, no, actually, each production in a derivation can produce any number of symbols, but in CNF, each rule is only two symbols. So to form a string of three symbols, we probably have two productions where one of them is a terminal and the other is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, wait. Let's think again. Each production in CNF can only expand into two symbols. So a string of length 3 would require two steps, where the first step produces two symbols, and the second step expands one of those non-terminals into two more. So combining two productions would give three symbols. Alternatively, if the first step results in three symbols, but in CNF, each production is only two symbols, so that's not possible. So it's more likely that the derivation starts with one symbol (like S) and two expansions, each contributing two symbols, but wait, perhaps the starting symbol S expands into two non-terminals, each of which then expands into one or two symbols.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT0 NT1. So S can only produce two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals can then expand further. So to get a string with three symbols, each of those NT0 and NT1 must expand into two symbols each. So the first expansion would give four symbols, but that's more than three. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a three-symbol string, which would require each symbol to be generated by a production. But in two steps: S -> NT0 NT1. Then NT0 and NT1 each expand into two symbols. So the first expansion: NT0 and NT1 each are non-terminals. Let's see, NT0 has multiple productions, for example, NT0 -> NT9 NT4 or NT0 -> 't64' etc. Wait, 't64' is a terminal, so NT0 can expand into a terminal, which would contribute one symbol, or into two non-terminals, contributing two more symbols.\n\nSo if NT0 -> 't64', that's one symbol, and NT1 -> 't0', which is another symbol. Then where's the third symbol, 't67'? That seems off because NT0 and NT1 each only contribute one symbol. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me approach it step by step.\n\nThe string is `t66 t0 t67`. So three tokens: t66, t0, t67.\n\nWe need to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, the grammar's start symbol is S. The first expansion is S -> NT0 NT1, which gives two tokens. Then each of NT0 and NT1 can expand into either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, the first expansion would give NT0 and NT1, which would each be processed into their respective symbols.\n\nSo for S, after the first step, we have NT0 and NT1. Each of those could be expanded further.\n\nLet's consider how each non-terminal can produce the respective token.\n\nLooking for 't66' in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, where does 't66' appear? Checking all the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> 't12'? No, that's 't12'. Hmm, wait, let's go through all NT rules:\n\n- NT9 -> 't68'\n- NT0 -> 't10', 't24', 't4', 't36', etc.\nWait, looking at the NT rules for 't66':\n\nLooking at the list of NT rules, I don't see 't66' as a terminal. So maybe t66 is produced by a non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I need to look through all the right-hand sides to see if 't66' is a terminal. Let's check the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT5 -> NT1 NT1\n- NT9 -> 't68'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT3 -> 't47'\n- NT4 -> 't47'\n- NT5 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't64'\n- NT1 -> 't51'\n- NT9 -> 't64'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT9 -> 't69'\n- NT0 -> 't73'\n- NT0 -> 't24'\n- NT3 -> 't43'\n- NT1 -> 't67'\n- NT5 -> 't74'\n- NT9 -> 't52'\n- NT5 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't8'\n- NT0 -> 't71'\n- NT3 -> 't4'\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT3 -> 't71'\n- NT1 -> 't46'\n- NT1 -> 't80'\n- NT3 -> 't51'\n- NT9 -> 't36'\n- NT9 -> 't58'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT9 -> 't66'\nAh, here we go. So NT9 has a production to 't66'. Similarly, I should check if 't0' and 't67' are produced by some non-terminals.\n\nt0: Looking through the NT rules, I don't see 't0' directly.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a grammar in Chomsky normal form has each production rule either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. From the given grammar, I can see that it's indeed in CNF because all productions are either splitting non-terminals into two non-terminals or terminal symbols. So that's good, no issues there.\n\nThe string I'm checking is `t42 t84 t73`. Since it's a sequence of terminals, each token represents a terminal symbol.

So I need to see if S can derive this string step by step.\n\nLooking at the first production of S: S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the string needs to result from NT0 expanding and NT1 expanding, connected together. Let me see if each of the tokens can come from NT0 and NT1 somehow.\n\nLet's start with NT0. From the productions, NT0 can derive various combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to find a way to reach the string `t42 t84 t73` by seeing how each token can be produced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to see for each token where it can come from. Let's consider each token in the string: t42, t84, t73.\n\nFirst, t42 is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t42? Let me go through the NT productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5: I don't think that's relevant here.\n- NT3: NT3 \u2192 't2', but that's t2, not t42. But wait, let me check all NTs that might produce t42.\nLooking through the given NT entries:\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t74 (no, that's not t42)\nNT1 \u2192 t12, t67, etc.\nWait, I might have to look for NTs that directly produce t42. Looking through the list:\n\nI see NT0 has a production to 't5', but that's not t42.\n\nWait, in the grammar, among the NTs, perhaps there's an NT that produces t42. Let me check each NT:\n\n- NT9 has several productions, like 't68', 't64', 't9', etc. No t42 there.\n- NT0 -> 't5' ... no.\n- NT1 has production NT1 \u2192 't12', 't67', 't51', etc. Not t42.\n- NT3 has productions for 't2', 't43', etc. No t42.\n- NT4 has 't47', 't54', etc.\n- NT5 produces 't51', 't17', 't74', etc. No t42.\n- Let's check others: NT9 has 't66', 't44' etc.\nWait, I don't see any NT that directly produces t42. So maybe t42 is a derived string through non-terminals.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. Because if none of the non-terminals directly produce t42, then it must be formed through a combination of non-terminals in some way. Let's think about this: in the grammar, the only way a terminal can appear is through a production where a non-terminal directly produces it or via a series of productions leading to a terminal.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar. Maybe I missed an NT that produces t42.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe NTs are:\n\nNT0: various productions, some NT0 produce other NTs. From the list:\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\n- NT0 has several productions, like \u2192 NT3 NT5, \u2192 NT9 NT4, \u2192 NT4 \u2192 't47', etc.\n- NT1 has \u2192 't12', \u2192 't67', etc.\n- NT3 has \u2192 't43', etc.\n- NT4 has \u2192 't54', \u2192 't71', etc.\n- NT5 has many \u2192, including 't17', 't51', 't74', 't58', etc.\nWait, I don't see 't42' in any of these. So t42 must be a result of a chain of productions.\n\nThis means that to get t42, there must be a way for a non-terminal to produce another non-terminal which then produces t42. But I'm not seeing any NT that directly produces t42, so that path must be impossible.\n\nWait, that's a problem because if t42 is a terminal and none of the NTs directly produce it, then it's impossible for the grammar to produce it. But this can't be, because the grammar generates a language consisting of sequences like 't10 t5', 't42 t84 t73', etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, let me check the productions in the grammar carefully to see if I missed any NT that can produce t42.\n\nLooking back through the list:\n\nLooking again, NT9 has \u2192 't68', 't64', 't36', 't66', etc., but no t42.\n\nNT0: \u2192 't5', which is t5. Then where does t5 come from? Wait, NT0 can produce t5, but t5 isn't a terminal either. Looking at the NT0 productions again, none of them directly produce t5.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Wait, t5 is 't5', so it's a terminal? No, because terminals are symbols, and if the grammar has a production like NT0 \u2192 't5', then t5 is a terminal, right?\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky normal form, all production rules have exactly two non-terminals, except if they're terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, the grammar is represented with rules A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, so if a non-terminal can derive a single terminal, that's allowed.\n\nSo looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't5' is a production. So t5 is a terminal symbol. That makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 't4' directly, so t4 is a terminal. So t5 and t4 are terminals.\n\nBut then, where does t42 come from? Because looking through all the grammar rules, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't42' or a symbol that can derive 't42' in one step.\n\nWait, perhaps t42 is a result of a chain. But without a production that leads directly to t42, it's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps t42 is the result of combining other non-terminals that eventually produce it. For example, NT3 might produce another non-terminal which then produces t42.\n\nLooking through the NT3 productions: NT3 \u2192 't43'. So 't43' is a terminal. How about NT4? NT4 can produce 't47', but then 't47' is a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a production.

{"custom_id":"request-58","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t43 t73 t73 t67`, and the grammar is quite extensive with many non-terminals and productions. Let me break this down step by step to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific structures for its productions. Each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to be in CNF because every production on the left side (like S, NT9, etc.) has either one terminal or two non-terminals on the right. So, the grammar's structure is correct for CNF.\n\nNext, the string we need to check is `t43 t73 t73 t67`. It looks like this is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, a useful approach to parse the string might be the CYK algorithm. The CYK algorithm is designed to determine if a string is in the language generated by a grammar in CNF. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps, so I need to remember how it works.\n\nThe CYK algorithm constructs a table where each cell (i, j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j. The algorithm starts by initializing the table based on the productions and the terminals. Then, it fills the table in a diagonal manner, expanding the substring lengths from 1 to n.\n\nLet me outline the steps I should follow:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Terminals and Terminals:**\n   - Terminal symbols in the string are `t43`, `t73`, `t73`, `t67`.\n   - The non-terminals in the grammar are various NT with numbers: NT0, NT1, NT9, NT3, etc.\n\n2. **Construct the Parsing Table:**\n   - Let's note that the string has four terminals, so the length n=4. Therefore, the CYK table will be a 4x4 grid.\n\n3. **Initialize the Table on Diagonal (Length 1):**\n   - For each position i, check if there's a production that directly derives the terminal at that position.\n   - For each i, j=i, if there's a production NT \u2192 a where a is the terminal at position i, then add NT to table[i][i].\n\n4. **Fill the Table Diagonally for Increasing Lengths:**\n   - For lengths l from 2 to n:\n     - For each starting index i:\n       - Compute j = i + l - 1.\n       - For each non-terminal NT:\n         - Check if NT \u2192 X Y, where X can derive the substring i to k, and Y can derive the substring k+1 to j. For some k in i to j-1.\n       - If such NT exists for any partitioning, add NT to table[i][j].\n\n5. **Check the Top-Right Corner:**\n   - After filling the table, if the start symbol S is present in table[1][4], then the string is in the language.\n\nNow, let's try to apply this step by step to the given string.\n\n**Step 1: Identifying Terminals and Non-Terminals**\n\nThe string is:\n1: t43\n2: t73\n3: t73\n4: t67\n\nTerminals: t43, t73, t73, t67.\n\nNon-terminals: Need to check each production for a single terminal. For example, NT9 \u2192 't68' implies NT9 is non-terminal that directly produces 't68'. Similarly, we have other non-terminals that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several productions where non-terminals produce a single terminal. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't54'\n- NT5 \u2192 't55'\n- NT5 \u2192 't58'\n- NT5 \u2192 't74'\n- NT5 \u2192 't80'\n- NT5 \u2192 't82'\n- NT5 \u2192 't67' (Wait, in production NT5 \u2192 't8'? Hmm, that's t8, but our string has t73. Not relevant here.\n\nWait, in the string, we have t43, t73, etc. So, let's look for non-terminals that produce these.\n\nBut perhaps first, let's list all non-terminals and their direct productions (terminals) from the grammar.\n\nLet me go through each production:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT9 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\nNT0 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't12'\nNT1 \u2192 't51'\nNT1 \u2192 't67' (NT1 \u2192 't67') \u2192 so NT1 produces t67.\n\nWait, in our string, the last terminal is t67. So if a production for NT1 is t67, and the fourth terminal is t67, maybe that could be a starting point.\n\nLooking further:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2', 't47', 't43'\n\nSo NT3 can produce t43.\n\nSimilarly, in the string, the second and third terminals are t73.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT9 \u2192 't68' and other productions, none directly produce t73. Wait, perhaps NT73? No, the non-terminals are named NT0, NT1, etc., starting with NT.\n\nWait, but looking through the productions, none of the NTs directly produce t73. Hmm. That might be a problem because the string has t73, but none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce it.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some productions. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't47'\n- NT0 \u2192 't43' (Wait, does it?

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the production rules for clarity. The starting symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT1. So S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nNext, NT0 has several production options:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT1\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (Wait, I think that's a duplicate)\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 can also produce other things, but I see 't24', 't47', etc.\n\nNT1 produces:\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT1 \u2192 't47'\n- NT1 \u2192 't66'\n- NT1 \u2192 't80...'\nWait, looking back, I think I have some mistakes. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I think I see that NT1 has several rules, including producing 't67', 't80', 't46', 't51', 't73', 't51' again, 't42', 't80', 't67', etc. So I should note all of them.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is \"t50 t46 t67 t80\". So it's a sequence of four tokens, each starting with t.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So the start is NT0 followed by NT1. Each NT is a non-terminal, and each needs to be expanded into terminal tokens.\n\nLooking at the string, it's four tokens, so each NT must expand into one or two tokens. Since the string has four tokens, let's see how that could happen.\n\nWait, each NT production can either produce a single terminal or a combination of two NTs, each of which then produce terminals. So let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT0 and NT1 must derive into exactly two terminals each, leading to a four-token string.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's say NT0 \u2192 ... So, NT0 and NT1 each must produce two tokens, because the string is four tokens in total. So that makes sense: NT0 \u2192 something that produces two tokens, NT1 \u2192 something that produces two tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which NT0 productions produce two terminals. For example, NT0 \u2192 t10 (a single token), so that's unlikely. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 t4, t5, etc. So NT0 can produce a single terminal, but the string is four tokens, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is such that the start symbol S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and each NT0 and NT1 must produce two tokens. So that way, the entire string is four tokens.\n\nSo let's assume that each NT0 and NT1 must each produce two tokens. So each must expand into two non-terminals, each of which then expand into a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one NT produces one terminal and the other produces three, but that's less likely since the string is four tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that S \u2192 NT0 NT1, and each of those NTs expands into a pair of tokens. So, for example, NT0 could expand into two tokens, and NT1 into two, making four in total.\n\nLet me check the possible paths.\n\nLooking at the string: t50 t46 t67 t80.\n\nLet me split this into pairs: (t50, t46) and (t67, t80). Alternatively, another way to split, but let's see if these pairs can be derived from NT0 and NT1 respectively.\n\nFirst, looking at the first two tokens: t50 and t46.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: NT0 can produce 't5' (but 't5' isn't in our string). Wait, looking back, I see that in the grammar, NT9 and NT0 can produce some terminals. Let me list all the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals (i.e., non-NT rules) are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't24', 't47', 't5' is from NT9 \u2192 't52' (no, that's not a terminal). Wait, no, let me check each production for NT0:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't36', 't47', 't4', 't5', 't71', 't73', 't78', 't79', 't80'.\n\nWait, let me list the terminals in the grammar:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (from NT9 \u2192 't68', but wait, no, NT0 is a non-terminal. Wait, look again: for example, NT0 \u2192 't36' (from NT9 \u2192 't36'), 't47' (from NT0 \u2192 't47'), 't4', 't5' isn't a terminal here. Wait, no:\n\nLooking at the production rules, whenever I see a production like NTx \u2192 't...', that's a terminal. So:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't10' (from NT0 rule)\nNT0 \u2192 't4' (another rule)\nNT0 \u2192 't24' (another rule)\nNT0 \u2192 't47' (another rule)\nNT0 \u2192 't71' (another rule, from NT0 \u2192 't71', but wait no: looking back, I see NT0 \u2192 't71' is under NT5 \u2192 't71', so that's a production for NT5, which is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all the terminals from the grammar:\n\n- From NT0:\n  - 't10'\n  - 't4'\n  - 't24'\n  - 't47'\n  - 't71' (from NT5 \u2192 't71', but wait: NT5 is a non-terminal, it derives from other NTs, so 't71' is produced by NT5, which is itself a non-terminal. So no, that's not terminal in the overall string.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) and terminals (the 't...' strings). A production for a non-terminal either goes into another non-terminal (left-hand side) or into a terminal symbol (right-hand side).\n\nSo in the grammar, the right-hand sides that are letters beginning with 't' are terminals, except when they are produced by non-terminals like NT0, NT1, etc. So, for example, NT9 \u2192 't68' is a production of a non-terminal (NT9) into a terminal ('t68'), so 't68' is a terminal. Similarly, S \u2192 NT0 NT1 means S (a non-terminal) produces two non-terminals, NT0 and NT1.\n\nSo in the given grammar, looking for all the terminals, which are the strings that appear as right-hand sides of non-terminals and are not further defined by other non-terminals.\n\nSo let's list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through each production rule, wherever a right-hand side is a string starting with 't', and not in the non-terminals, that's a terminal.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT1 (both NTs)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5 (both NTs)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (both NTs)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT1 (both NTs)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (both NTs)\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (terminal)\n- NT0 \u2192 't4' (terminal)\n- NT0 \u2192 't24' (terminal)\n- NT0 \u2192 't47' (terminal)\n- NT0 \u2192 't71' (terminal? Wait, but NT5 \u2192 't71' is a production, so 't71' is a terminal. Or is it?\n\nWait, actually, wait: NT5 \u2192 't71' is a production, meaning that NT5 can produce 't71', but 't71' is a string of terminals, not non-terminals. So NT5 is non-terminal, and its production can lead to 't71', so in the overall string, 't71' is considered a terminal. But wait, no: in context-free grammars, a terminal is just a single symbol, so 't71' is a single terminal token. So in the string, each token is like 't50', 't46', etc.\n\nSo, the terminals in this grammar are all the 'txxx' where 'txxx' is not part of any non-terminal rule.

Let me list them out:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\nNT9 -> 't68'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT3 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't64'\n NT1 -> 't51'\n NT9 -> 't64'\n NT0 -> 't4'\n NT9 -> 't69'\n NT0 -> 't73'\n NT0 -> 't24'\n NT3 -> 't43'\n NT1 -> 't67'\n NT5 -> 't74'\n NT9 -> 't52'\n NT5 -> 't71'\n NT5 -> 't8'\n NT0 -> 't71'\n NT3 -> 't4'\n NT4 -> 't54'\n NT3 -> 't71'\n NT1 -> 't46'\n NT1 -> 't80'\n NT3 -> 't51'\n NT9 -> 't36'\n NT9 -> 't58'\n NT5 -> 't84'\n NT4 -> 't0'\n NT9 -> 't66'\n NT4 -> 't82'\n NT3 -> 't42'\n NT0 -> 't79'\n NT9 -> 't78'\n NT0 -> 't36'\n NT0 -> 't47'\n NT5 -> 't17'\n NT4 -> 't55'\n NT9 -> 't63'\n NT4 -> 't13'\n NT5 -> 't50'\n NT5 -> 't76'\n NT9 -> 't44'\n NT4 -> 't58'\n NT9 -> 't41'\n NT3 -> 't50'\n NT1 -> 't73'\n NT3 -> 't40'\n NT5 -> 't80'\n NT0 -> 't5'\n NT1 -> 't42'\n\nWait, some of these look a bit repetitive, but maybe that's not relevant right now. I need to focus on the string: `t42 t42 t80 t54 t80`.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to trace back through the grammar starting from S, expanding each non-terminal step by step until I reach the terminals. Since S is the start symbol, the first step is S -> NT0 NT1.\n\nSo the string starts with `t42`, which has to come from NT0 or NT1. Looking at the productions for NT0 and NT1, we can see that NT0 can produce `t42` if there's a production for NT0 -> 't42', but quickly scanning, I don't see that. Wait, wait, looking back, I see NT0 -> 't42'? Yes, under NT0: NT0 -> 't71', but hold on, no, wait.\n\nWait, I need to re-examine the grammar to see which NT0 productions result in 't42'.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has NT0 with several productions:\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT0 -> 't64'\nNT0 -> 't9' (Wait, no, I think there's a typo there because under NT0, I see 't71' but I'm looking again. Let me check all the NT0 productions:\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\nNT0 -> 't10': So 't10'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT0 -> 't64'\nNT0 -> 't69'\nNT0 -> 't73'\nNT0 -> 't24'\nNT0 -> 't71' (from NT0 -> 't71')\nNT0 -> 't4' (again, seems duplicated)\nNT0 -> 't64' (duplicated again)\nNT0 -> 't47'\nNT0 -> 't43' (Wait, no, looking back, no, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nWait, under NT0: There are several:\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT0 -> 't64'\nNT0 -> 't69'\nNT0 -> 't73'\nNT0 -> 't24'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nOther NT0s perhaps, but I might have miscounted. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused with NT3 and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all NT0 productions clearly:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nNT0 -> NT5 NT1 (Wait, is that correct? Let me check the original grammar.\n\nThe original grammar is:\n\nS -> NT0 NT1\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nNT5 -> NT1 NT1\n\nNT9 -> 't68'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\n\nNT3 -> 't47'\n\nNT4 -> 't47'\n\nNT5 -> 't11'\n\nNT0 -> 't64'\n\nNT1 -> 't51'\n\nNT9 -> 't64'\n\nNT0 -> 't4'\n\nNT9 -> 't69'\n\nNT0 -> 't73'\n\nNT0 -> 't24'\n\nNT3 -> 't43'\n\nNT1 -> 't67'\n\nNT5 -> 't74'\n\nNT9 -> 't52'\n\nNT5 -> 't71'\n\nNT5 -> 't8'\n\nNT0 -> 't71'\n\nSo, for NT0, the productions are:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n\nAnd the other productions are:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\n\n'nt0' \u2192 't4'\n\n'nt0' \u2192 't64'\n\n'nt0' \u2192 't69'\n\n'nt0' \u2192 't73'\n\n'nt0' \u2192 't24'\n\n'nt0' \u2192 't71' (from NT0 -> NT0? Or is that another production?)\n\nWait, let me parse all NT0 productions correctly.\n\nWait, let me list all possible NT0 productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I think I see:\n\n1. NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n\n2. NT0 -> NT9 NT4\n\nAnd then the others are terminals:\n\n3. NT0 -> 't10'\n\n4. NT0 -> 't4'\n\n5. NT0 -> 't64'\n\n6. NT0 -> 't69'\n\n7. NT0 -> 't73'\n\n8. NT0 -> 't24'\n\n9. NT0 -> 't71'\n\nWait, that's 9 productions for NT0. So the terminals from NT0 are 't10', 't4', 't64', 't69', 't73', 't24', 't71'. So, 't42' is not among these. So, how can the string start with 't42'?\n\nAh! Because another way: 't42' can come from NT3 or NT5, right? Because looking at the grammar, some non-terminals have a terminal 't42'. For example:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT3 has a production 't42'? Yes: NT3 -> 't42'.\n\n- Also, NT1 has a production NT1 -> 't42' as well.\n\nWait, under NT1, I see: NT1->'t42' is present?\n\nWait, let me check. The grammar includes NT1 with several productions, including:\n\nNT1 -> 't42'\n\nYes, under NT1: 't42' is one of the productions.\n\nWait, under NT1:\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, there's:\n\nNT1 -> 't42', yes.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't42', that could come from either NT3 or NT1.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, the first expansion is S \u2192 NT0 NT1. So NT0 and NT1 will have to somehow lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nSo, the string starts with t42, t42, t80, t54, t80.\n\nSo, let's plan the tracing:\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT0 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-71","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t73 t80 t42 t54 t73`, and the grammar is a bunch of productions for non-terminals NT with some terminals.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That seems to be the case here, so I'm good on that front.\n\nThe task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol, which is S in this case. The given string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces, so the string to derive is `t73 t80 t42 t54 t73`. Let's ignore the spaces since the grammar rules don't include any, so I'll focus on the sequence t73, t80, t42, t54, t73.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT1, so any string generated by the grammar must start with NT0 NT1. Since the input is a sequence of five terminals, it's a single production because the number of symbols can't increase beyond that. Wait, actually, since S goes to NT0 NT1, each NT0 and NT1 can produce a single terminal each. Wait, no\u2014each NT's productions are more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is derived in multiple steps. The string has five terminals, but the initial production of S gives two terminals. So, I might need to see how the non-terminals NT0 and NT1 can generate more symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the five terminals are the results of applying the productions. Let me try to see the possible derivation steps.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT0 NT1. Then NT0 and NT1 each need to produce something.\n\nLet's look at NT0. NT0 has several productions. For example:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't64'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't73'\n... and others.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 has:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT1 \u2192 't51'\n- NT1 \u2192 't80'\n- NT1 \u2192 't46'\n- NT1 \u2192 't80'\n- ... etc.\n\nSo, let's break down the string: t73 [1], t80 [2], t42 [3], t54 [4], t73 [5].\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT0 NT1, the first symbol must come from NT0, the second from NT0 again, but wait\u2014in the grammar, each production is a transformation from a single non-terminal to other symbols. So, each NT0 and NT1 can expand into multiple symbols, and when combined, the sequence is formed.\n\nWait, but how do we parse the string? Perhaps using a top-down approach or the CYK algorithm, but I think I can try to see if each terminal in the string can be produced by the respective NT0 and NT1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the possible derivations step by step.\n\nThe string is t73 t80 t42 t54 t73.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, to get five terminals, we must have expansions that produce more than two symbols.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either one terminal or two non-terminals. So, the derivation would involve expanding nt0 and nt1 into more symbols until we get terminals.\n\nLet me attempt to find a possible derivation.\n\nFirst step: S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nNow, each of NT0 and NT1 can be expanded into more non-terminals or terminals. Let's see what can produce t73.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, one of them is NT0 \u2192 't73'. So NT0 can produce t73 directly.\n\nSimilarly, look for t80: Looking at NT1, one of the productions is NT1 \u2192 't80'.\n\nBut then the string is built as t73 (from NT0) followed by t80 (from NT1), but that's only two terminals. The given string is five, so we need more steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT0 and NT1 can each expand into sequences that produce multiple terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps we can consider more than one step. Let's think step by step.\n\nLet me consider that each of NT0 and NT1 can produce a sequence of non-terminals which eventually become terminals.\n\nFor example, let's see how NT0 can produce t73. Since NT0 \u2192 't73' is a production, we can do that directly. So, in the first step, NT0 becomes 't73'.\n\nThen, NT1 needs to generate the remaining t80, t42, t54, t73. Wait, that can't be because NT1 \u2192 't80' is a production, but that's only one terminal. So the string would be t73 t80, but the given string is longer.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to have each NT0 and NT1 expand into multiple symbols. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe NT0 can expand into more non-terminals, which in turn expand further.\n\nLet's take NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5. Then NT3 might expand into something.\n\nLooking at NT3, one of its productions is NT3 \u2192 't43', another is NT3 \u2192 't4', another is NT3 \u2192 't51', another is NT3 \u2192 't2', and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see if there's a way to reach t73, t80, t42, t54, t73.\n\nWait, maybe looking at each symbol step by step.\n\nLet me try to break the string into individual symbols and see if each could be produced by the correct NT0 or NT1.\n\nThe string is:\n1. t73\n2. t80\n3. t42\n4. t54\n5. t73\n\nBut since S produces NT0 NT1, the string must be built as the concatenation of the expansions of NT0 followed by NT1.\n\nSo, the first set of symbols comes from NT0, the second from NT1.\n\nBut the string is five symbols, so perhaps each NT0 and NT1 produce multiple symbols.\n\nLet me try to see how each symbol in the string could be produced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT0, and the second part is the expansion of NT1.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case because NT0 and NT1 could each produce multiple symbols. For example, if NT0 expands into three symbols and NT1 into two, the total would be five.\n\nWait, so let's think: NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5, and then NT3 and NT5 can each expand into more symbols. Similarly for NT1.\n\nLet's try building the first part, which is the expansion of NT0, that generates, say, the first, third, fifth symbols, and NT1 generates the second, fourth. Hmm, but that's perhaps too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of each step of the derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nThen, consider each non-terminal expanding step by step.\n\nFirst, let's expand NT0 as much as possible.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\n1. NT0 \u2192 't10' \u2192 t10\n2. NT0 \u2192 't64' \u2192 t64\n3. NT0 \u2192 't4' \u2192 t4\n4. NT0 \u2192 't73' \u2192 t73 (terminates)\n5. And so on with other NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5 etc.\n\nSimilarly, look at NT1's productions:\n\n1. NT1 \u2192 't12'\n2. NT1 \u2192 't51'\n3. NT1 \u2192 't80' (terminates)\n4. NT1 \u2192 't46'\n5. And so on.\n\nBut to get five symbols, both NT0 and NT1 must produce multiple symbols each.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a way for NT0 to produce, say, three symbols and NT1 to produce two, or something like that.\n\nWait, another approach is to try to match the given string from left to right by trying to find possible expansions.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nSuppose NT0 expands into the first, third, fifth symbols, and NT1 into the second and fourth.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT0 first expands into NT3 NT5, and then each of those can further expand.\n\nBut let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, take S \u2192 NT0 NT1.\n\nLet me try to see if NT0 can produce 't73' and NT1 can produce 't80 t42 t54 t73'.
