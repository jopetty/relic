The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals directly produce terminals, like S \u2192 NT3 NT9, etc. So each of those right-hand sides could potentially produce the string when combined.\n\nThe string we're checking is \"t91\". Now, I should see if \"t91\" can be produced by the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the production rules for S: S can produce NT3 NT9. So if I can show that NT3 \u2192 t91 and NT9 \u2192 t91, but wait, that's not possible because NT3 and NT9 are both non-terminals, and each can only produce certain terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each production is a left-hand side producing a sequence of symbols on the right. So S \u2192 NT3 NT9 means S can be replaced by NT3 followed by NT9. But each NT... could be non-terminals that further produce strings until they become terminal strings.\n\nLooking at the rules, some non-terminals like NT9 directly produce a terminal symbol, for example, NT9 \u2192 t91 and NT9 \u2192 't91' in another rule. Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 can go to 't75', 't60', 't90', 't22', 't14', 't99', 't8', 't41', 't90', etc. Oh, wait, one of them is exactly 't91'? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the NT9 productions: I see NT9 \u2192 't75', 't60', 't90', 't22', 't14', 't99', 't8', 't41', 't90', 't23', and so on. Wait, actually, I don't see 't91' directly in NT9's productions. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any non-terminal that directly produces 't91'. I check the rules again and see that there's a NT0 \u2192 't13'; but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me look through all the rules where a non-terminal is replaced by a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT9: I see NT9 \u2192 't75', 't60', 't90', 't22', 't14', 't99', 't8', 't41', 't90', 't23', 't22', 't19', etc. Wait, I think I might have misread, did any rule produce 't91'? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking again: No, wait, I don't think any non-terminals directly produce 't91' because all 't...' are single terminals, like 't37', 't52', etc., but I don't see 't91' listed as a direct production from any non-terminal.\n\nHmm, that's an issue because if none of the non-terminals directly produce 't91', then how can we get 't91' in the string?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the structure again. The string is \"t91\", which is a single character. So, the entire string must be produced by a single production step where a single non-terminal produces that terminal. But since none of the non-terminals directly produce 't91', that would mean the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me look again. Here are the rules for NT9: It goes to several 't's, but none say 't91'. Similarly, checking other non-terminals: NT8 goes to 't52', NT3 to 't30', and so on. No, I don't see 't91' anywhere as a terminal output from a non-terminal.\n\nSo, since the grammar doesn't have a production that directly outputs 't91', the string \"t91\" can't be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-1","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t90\" is generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on CFGs, but let me try to think through this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. It's a set of rules where each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right side.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of non-terminals (S, NT0, NT1, ..., NT9, etc.) and a lot of production rules. The string to evaluate is \"t90\". So, essentially, I'm being asked if \"t90\" is a valid string in the language defined by this grammar.\n\nLet me look at the grammar. The initial non-terminal is S, and the production rules from S are S -> NT3 NT9 and S -> NT2 NT9. Wait, so any string derived from S will end with two NT9. That would mean any string in the language starts with NT3 or NT2 followed by other non-terminals and ends with NT9. But wait, looking at the rules, NT9 is a terminal and specifically \"t90\" according to the grammar. So, the base case is when NT9 \u2192 \"t90\".\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for example, NT9 \u2192 \"t90\" is present. But then, what about other NT9 rules? Let me check: There are a few more NT9 productions. In the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9 and NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1. Also, NT0, NT1, etc., have various terminals.\n\nBut since the string we're considering is \"t90\", which directly corresponds to NT9 \u2192 \"t90\", I need to see if there's a way to derive \"t90\" starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string \"t90\" is a single terminal. So, if one of the productions directly leads NT9 to \"t90\", and S can derive to NT9 via some path, then yes.\n\nLet me check the steps. S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT2 NT9. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT2 NT9.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then to get \"t90\", I need both NT3 and NT9 to produce \"t30\" and \"t90\", respectively. Because looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 and NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2, for example.\n\nWait, but let's try to build \"t90\". Is there a way for a production to directly result in \"t90\"?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT9 \u2192 \"t90\" is a direct production. So, if a non-terminal can derive to NT9 and then to \"t90\", then yes, \"t90\" can be produced.\n\nSo, let's see if there's a way for S to derive to NT9. For example, S \u2192 NT2 NT9. Then, if NT2 can derive to a string that, when combined with \"t90\", can form a valid string.\n\nWait, but actually, since S's initial productions produce two non-terminals followed by another non-terminal? Or does S produce two non-terminals in one step? No, S \u2192 NT3 NT9 is a single production for S, meaning in one step, S becomes NT3 NT9, each of which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, to get \"t90\", perhaps one of the non-terminals in the production chain must be NT9, which can directly produce \"t90\". So, for example, if S \u2192 NT2 NT9, and then NT2 can produce something that results in a string when combined with \"t90\".\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Since NT9 \u2192 \"t90\", then the string \"t90\" is directly derivable if a non-terminal that can derive to it is present in the string.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT9 appears in multiple productions. For example, S can produce NT3 NT9, and if NT3 can derive a string that, when concatenated with \"t90\", forms the string we have. But the string given is just \"t90\", which is a single character. So, for that, the derivation path must result in a string that's exactly \"t90\".\n\nSo, perhaps S must derive to a string that is \"t90\". Looking back, the initial productions from S are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT2 NT9. Now, if both NT3 and NT2 can derive to something that, when concatenated with \"t90\", forms \"t90\". That seems impossible unless one of the non-terminals derive to an empty string, which they don't.\n\nWait, no. Because in Chomsky normal form, all productions are two non-terminals or a terminal. So, it's impossible to have an empty string unless a non-terminal can derive to the empty string, which I don't think any of these do.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the string \"t90\" is only directly produced by NT9, which is directly a terminal. So, if S can produce NT9 somehow, and then NT9 can produce \"t90\", that would be the case. But looking at S's initial productions, S can't directly produce NT9 by itself; S must produce two non-terminals first.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So S starts as S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT2 NT9. So both options result in two non-terminals. Then each of those can produce other things. To get \"t90\", that would mean that one of those non-terminals must produce \"t90\". So perhaps one of NT3 or NT9 can produce \"t90\".\n\nBut wait, NT3 can produce more non-terminals, unless one of them has a direct production to \"t90\". Wait, looking at the rules: NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2, and NT9 \u2192 \"t90\". So if NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2, then NT9 would be \"t90\" and NT2 would produce something else. Wait, but the string is just \"t90\", so I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way for S to produce NT9 directly through some path. But I don't see any rule that directly allows S to produce NT9; S can only produce NT3 or NT2 followed by NT9. So S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT2 NT9. Therefore, the entire string derived from S would be a concatenation of the strings derived from NT3 and NT9, or from NT2 and NT9.\n\nWait, but if S produces NT3 NT9, and if NT3 can produce the empty string, then NT9 would produce \"t90\". But NT3 doesn't produce the empty string; instead, it produces at least one non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \"t90\" is a terminal symbol in NT9's production, any string that can be derived from S must pass through NT9 as part of the derivation. But S directly produces two non-terminals, so the resulting string would be a combination of the two.\n\nBut wait, the string given is just a single \"t90\". To get that, the derivation must somehow result in just \"t90\". But considering that S's productions involve two non-terminals, perhaps one of them is a path that leads to \"t90\" and the other leads to nothing? But I don't see any rules that allow a non-terminal to produce nothing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two non-terminals can produce such that their concatenation results in \"t90\". But let's see: For example, if NT3 can produce \"t90\" and NT9 somehow produces the empty string, but no rule does that. Alternatively, if NT3 produces \"t30\" and NT9 produces \"t90\", but then the string would be \"t30t90\". Which isn't the string we're given.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way for S to produce a string that ends up being \"t90\" via a much longer derivation. Let me think: For instance, starting from S \u2192 NT2 NT9. If NT9 can produce \"t90\", then the other non-terminal, NT2, must derive to something that when combined with \"t90\", but then if NT2 somehow derivate to an empty string, but again, that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe NT2 can derive to the empty string. Checking the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly or indirectly produces the empty string. All productions seem to produce at least one symbol, either terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nSo unless there's a way for both NT2 and NT9 to produce terms that, when concatenated, form \"t90\". For example, if NT2 \u2192 \"t9\" and NT9 \u2192 \"0\" (but that doesn't seem to be in the rules).

Hmmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should remember what Chomsky normal form (CNF) looks like. CNF is a set of production rules where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. So, all productions are binary or terminals. That might help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the rules are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which fits the CNF. Some have terminals like 't41', 't19', etc. So, this should be manageable.\n\nThe string to check is \"t41 t19\". That's two terminals, which would mean a derivation that starts with the start symbol S and ends up producing exactly two terminals in sequence. Since the start symbol S can decompose into two NT symbols, it could split into more non-terminals, but ultimately have to produce the two terminals without any remaining non-terminals.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. From the grammar, S can produce two NT3 NT9. So, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then, we need to see if NT3 and NT9 can produce t41 and t19 respectively.\n\nLooking at NT3:\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nEach of these, NT6 and NT2, can further split. Let's see what they produce.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5 (from the given rules)\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0\nNT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4\nNT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3\nThis seems like it forms a loop because NT7 depends on NT5 and NT4, which themselves have dependencies. Alternatively, looking up NT6 rules, there are more options like NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2. Oh, wait, looking back at the grammar, I see that NT6 has production NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2. That might be a better path because NT9 might produce 't91' directly, but wait, no, looking at the rules, actually NT9 can go to NT3 NT7 or NT6 NT1 or NT3 NT8 or NT6 NT9. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the production for NT3. NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Then, let's follow NT3 and NT2.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2 or NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5 or others. The most promising might be NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2. Because NT9 from the given rules can produce 't91' (NT9 \u2192 't91').\n\nSo, if NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2, then:\nNT9 would eventually produce 't91'. But wait, NT9 might have to keep producing more non-terminals. Let me see: NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7 or NT6 NT1 or NT3 NT8 or NT6 NT9. Each of these requires further decomposition.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack. The string is \"t41 t19\", which suggests that S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then NT3 produces 't41', and NT9 produces 't19', or vice versa.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nThen, NT6 can produce 't91'? Or let's see: NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4. Let me check the NT6 rules.\n\nIn the given grammar, I see:\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nAlso, there's NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4.\n\nWait, but the given string has 't41', which is a terminal. Looking for where 't41' comes from. Scanning the terminal productions, I see:\n\nLooking for 't41' in the terminals attached to any non-terminal. Scanning the productions, I see NT8 can produce 't8', NT9 can produce 't91', and others like NT4 \u2192 't88'. Wait, in the end of the grammar, I see lines like:\nNT6 \u2192 't8', NT0 \u2192 't13', etc.\n\nWait, let me look for which non-terminals directly produce 't41'. Looking through the given rules:\n\nI don't see any NT directly producing 't41'. All the terminals are things like 't40', 't52', 't13', 't30', etc. Wait, looking carefully, in the provided grammar, at the end, there are multiple rules that go NTx \u2192 a, like NT8 \u2192 't52', NT2 \u2192 't33', NT0 \u2192 't13', etc. So, I don't see 't41' as a terminal in any of the productions. Hmm. That's a problem because the string has 't41' which would have to be produced by some NT rule.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake? Let me check again. The string is \"t41 t19\". So, in the string, each token is a terminal. So, 't41' must be directly produced by a production rule of the form A \u2192 t41, but looking through all the NT rules, I don't see any NT \u2192 't41'.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan all the terminal rules. Scanning through the provided grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't52'\nNT2 \u2192 't33'\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\nNT9 \u2192 't75'\nNT2 \u2192 't37'\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\nNT9 \u2192 't60'\nNT7 \u2192 't70'\nNT2 \u2192 't30' (again)\nWait, no 't41' anywhere. Hmm. That would mean that 't41' is not present in the grammar, so the string cannot be generated because 't41' can't be produced.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem says the string is \"t41 t19\", but in the grammar, there's no NT rule that produces 't41'. So, the string contains a terminal that the grammar doesn't know how to produce, which would mean it can't generate that string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I mislooked. Let me check again for any NT rules that produce 't41':\n\nLooking through the list of rules provided:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT9 \u2192 't91'\n- NT9 can go to NT3 't30' and NT7 \u2192 't70'\n- NT0 \u2192 't13' etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps 't41' is produced via a longer path, but I don't see any NT rules that produce 't41'. Therefore, without any rule generating 't41', the string can't be produced.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Did I miss any rule?\n\nLet me make sure I didn't skip any NT production that ends in 't41'. Looking through the rules again:\n\nLooking at all the lines:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't75'\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\nNT1 \u2192 't25'\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\nNT5 \u2192 't91'\nNT6 \u2192 't65'\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\nNT8 \u2192 't37'\nNT9 \u2192 't60'\nNT2 \u2192 't33'\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\nNT1 \u2192 't40'\nNT7 \u2192 't10'\nNT1 \u2192 't19'\nNT1 \u2192 't12'\nNT4 \u2192 't88'\nNT2 \u2192 't37'\nNT3 \u2192 't90'\nNT9 \u2192 't60'\nNT7 \u2192 't70'\nNT8 \u2192 't41'\nWait! Wait a minute, I think I skipped this one: NT8 \u2192 't41'. Let me check again.\n\nLooking:\n\n- There's a line \"NT8 \u2192 't41'\". Yes, definitely. So, NT8 can produce 't41'. So, okay, the 't41' in the string is produced by NT8.\n\nNow, the other part is 't19'. The string is \"t41 t19\", so the first terminal is 't41' from NT8 and the second is 't19' from somewhere else.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nWe need to derive 't41' from NT3 and 't19' from NT9, in some order.\n\nWait, but S splits into NT3 and NT9, so the string would have two parts: NT3 derived into the first part and NT9 into the second.

{"custom_id":"request-28","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the string \"t22 t12\" is generated by the given context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, or a terminal. So, the entire process involves starting from the start symbol and applying these productions until we derive the string, replacing non-terminals with terminals or other non-terminals until we get the desired string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S is the start symbol. From S, it goes to NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Since our string starts with \"t22\", which is a terminal, I need to see if any production leads to \"t22\".\n\nLooking at the last parts of the productions, some non-terminals expand to 't12' or 't22'. For instance, NT9 -> 't75' isn't helpful here, but I notice that some non-terminals like NT8 and NT9 directly lead to terminal strings. For example, NT8 -> 't8' and NT9 -> 't75', but those aren't \"t12\" or \"t22\".\n\nWait, let me look more carefully. Oh, I see NT6 -> 't8', NT5 -> 't37', NT2 -> 't33', and so on. But none of these immediately produce \"t22\" or \"t12\" except the ones that are terminals. So, maybe those are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe string we have is \"t22 t12\". So each 't' must come from a terminal production. Let's see if NT2 or any non-terminal can produce \"t22\" or \"t12\".\n\nLooking deeper, in the productions, I see NT2 has several options, including NT9->NT8 NT9 and NT9->NT6 NT1, etc. But no production of NT2 directly results in \"t22\". Wait, perhaps it's through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, let's think about how the string is built. The string starts with \"t22\", so maybe the leftmost symbol in the string is the result of a production that leads to \"t22\". Looking through the productions, I notice that some non-terminals expand to a single terminal, like NT2-> 't33', which is a different 't', not 't22'. But maybe through further expansion.\n\nWait, looking again, I see that NT2 has a production NT2 -> 't33', but I don't see \"t22\". Hmm. Let me check if any non-terminals directly produce \"t22\". Scanning through the productions, I see NT9 -> 't75', NT8 -> 't8', etc. But none of the non-terminals directly produce \"t22\" or \"t12\". Does that mean that \"t22\" and \"t12\" cannot be derived from any non-terminal in this grammar?\n\nWait no, that's not right. Maybe \"t22\" is a terminal symbol, so it's directly from a production. Looking back, I can see that some non-terminals expand to a single terminal, but are there any that produce exactly \"t22\" or \"t12\"?\n\nLet me check the end of the productions. Looking for 't22' in the terminals, I see that NT9 has a production NT9 -> 't75' and another, but I don't see 't22' directly. Similarly, 't12' is produced by some NT? Let me search through all the productions where the right-hand side is a single terminal.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT6 -> 't8' (t8)\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT5 -> 't37'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT8 -> 't52' (t52)\n- NT9 -> 't75' (t75)\n- NT5 -> 't91' (t91)\n- NT2 -> 't22'? Not as per above. Wait, no, no production directly gives 't22'. Wait, let me check again in the detailed production list.\n\nLooking at all the productions, I don't see any of them resulting in exactly 't22' or 't12'. Maybe I missed it. Let me go through the list more carefully.\n\nLooking through each production, starting from NT:\n\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT8 -> 't8'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT6 -> 't65' (but as a result from a production)\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT5 -> 't91' (but via NT5->NT0 NT1, etc.)\n- NT2 -> 't33' directly\n- NT4 -> 't88' directly\n- NT0 -> 't13' directly\n- NT6 -> 't8' (via production)\n- NT1 -> 't40' directly\n- NT7 -> 't40' directly\n- NT2 -> 't37' directly? No, NT2 -> 't33', wait, let's confirm earlier data.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all the terminal-only productions:\n\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT5 -> 't37'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT5 -> 't91' (as per the end)\n- NT2 -> 't22'? No, looking again, in one of the productions earlier I think I might have misformatted. Let me check the initial grammar provided.\n\nAh, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Wait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nI see line: NT2 -> 't33'\n\nAnother line: NT2 -> 't37'\n\nWait, no, in the initial grammar block, I think I'm missing some lines. Wait, to clarify, looking at the grammar provided in the initial message, I can see:\n\nFor example, here are a few relevant lines:\n\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT5 -> 't37'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT5 -> 't91'\n- NT2 -> 't22'? Let me check again.\n\nWait, near the end, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n- NT6 -> 't84'\n- NT0 -> 't04' (not terminal)\n- NT5 -> 't65' (no)\n- NT2 -> 't8'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because some of these are two-terminals, so that's not relevant. Let me recap: the string we need is \"t22 t12\", each as single terminals.\n\nSo, for \"t22 t12\", both would need to be produced by non-terminals that expand into these terminals directly. But if no such non-terminals exist in the grammar, then the string cannot be derived.\n\nLooking again, the only terminal productions from non-terminals are for 't13', 't30', 't37', 't40', 't52', 't65', 't75', 't70', 't75', etc., but no 't22' or 't12'. Therefore, the string \"t22 t12\" cannot be generated because there's no production that creates 't22' or 't12' as terminal symbols.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-46","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string \"t34 t22 t37\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because that means all the productions are either two non-terminals on the left and a single non-terminal on the right, or a single terminal on the left and two terminals or a terminal on the right. But wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. The production rules are all of the form S \u2192 AB, where A and B are non-terminals, and each non-terminal produces other non-terminals or terminals. The start symbol is S, and each production eventually leads down to terminals, which are the actual string components.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal has several productions. Some of them produce terminals, like S \u2192 NT3 NT9, where NT9 is mapped to 't22'. Hmm, wait, but in the initial user message, the user listed many rules, each ending with a string, e.g., NT9 -> NT3 NT7, and some with just 't52' or similar. I think that each of these rules where the right-hand side is a terminal is actually a terminal symbol. So, for example, when NT9 -> 't34' is listed, that means that NT9 can directly produce 't34'.\n\nWait no, looking back at the grammar provided, the grammar has multiple productions ending with, for example, 't34', 't22', etc. So it seems like some of these are productions that expand to just a terminal symbol. So, the grammar includes terminals as well as non-terminals.\n\nSo the string we're testing is \"t34 t22 t37\". Let's break this down. Each t followed by a number seems to be a terminal symbol. So, each of these terminals must be the result of some production.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S, the first step is to see what S can produce. Looking at the given rules, S has two options: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nSo, the string \"t34 t22 t37\" must derive from one of these paths. Let's take the first option: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So, the string would be T3 T9, but in our case, the string is three terminals, so probably another step is needed. Wait, but S produces two non-terminals, each of which can produce two more, so perhaps the string is three terminals, implying that in the derivation, the two initial non-terminals expand to three terminals.\n\nWait, no. Each non-terminal production is a binary expansion. For example, if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then each of these non-terminals would need to generate a terminal or another non-terminal. So, the initial expansion will produce two non-terminals, and each of those can either expand further or terminate.\n\nWait, but the given string has three terminals, which suggests that perhaps the derivation goes through multiple steps. Let's think: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then NT3 must expand to something, say, NT3 \u2192 t34. Wait, but let me check the production rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals can directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT9 -> 't34'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT6 -> 't34' (Is that correct? Wait, wait. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT0 -> 't13', NT6 -> 't34', NT9 -> 't75', etc. So, each non-terminal can sometimes directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo, to get the string \"t34 t22 t37\", I need to have three terminals. That implies that the derivation path must produce three terminals. Since each production step in the grammar can only generate two non-terminals, I think it's possible if the non-terminals expand into two parts, but I need to make sure that all three are covered.\n\nWait, but each production step is binary. So, starting from S, which is two non-terminals, each of those could be either a terminal or a non-terminal. So, for example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. If NT3 can produce one terminal and NT9 can produce two terminals, but no, because each non-terminal production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each non-terminal can only directly produce a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this step by step. Let's see what terminals each non-terminal can produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT9 can produce 't34' (among others, but let's focus on 't34' for now). Similarly, NT8 can produce 't52', NT2 can produce 't33', etc.\n\nBut wait, looking deeper, for example, NT3 has the rule NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, among others, but also NT3 \u2192 't30'. Similarly, NT2 has rules like \u2192 NT7 NT7, \u2192 NT3 NT1, etc., and also NT2 \u2192 't33', 't37', etc.\n\nWait, no, in the rules, each entry is a non-recursive list. For example, NT9 has multiple rules, some of which produce terminals. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT9 has:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT9 -> NT6 NT1\n\nNT9 -> NT3 NT7\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT2\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT8\n\nNT9 -> NT7 NT9\n\nNT9 -> NT6 NT8\n\nNT9 -> NT3 NT8\n\nNT9 -> NT7 NT5\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nWait, but no, the grammar may have some non-recursive terminal productions. For example, some rules have only terminal symbols, like 't30', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of this as a set of production rules where each rule can be applied as needed. So, for example, if a non-terminal has a production leading to a terminal, then it can directly produce that terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar can be represented as a set of production rules where each non-terminal can be expanded until all symbols are terminals.\n\nSo, to parse the string \"t34 t22 t37\", we can consider that the start symbol S must expand into two non-terminals, which then produce a total of three terminals. So, each of these non-terminals must produce at least one terminal each, but wait, how?\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So, that's two non-terminals. Each could potentially produce two more non-terminals, but that would result in four terminals. Hmm, but the string is three. So maybe one of the non-terminals produces two terminals, and the other produces one? But in the grammar, non-terminals only directly produce terminals or other non-terminals, not combined terminals. Each production step reduces either to a terminal or another pair of non-terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the production isn't S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Let me check other options. The second option is S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So, if S \u2192 NT3 NT2, then NT3 and NT2 each must produce a terminal or non-terminals.\n\nSo, if NT3 can produce 't34' and NT2 can produce 't22' and NT9 can produce 't37', that would give three terminals. Wait, but then the initial expansion would be S \u2192 NT3 (producing 't34') and NT2 (producing 't22'), but then where does 't37' come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT2 can produce 't37' or 't22' or 't33' etc. Let's look at NT2's production rules. Here are some of NT2's rules:\n\nNT2 -> NT7 NT7\n\nNT2 -> NT3 NT1\n\nNT2 -> NT5 NT6\n\nNT2 -> NT2 NT2\n\nOthers include:\n\nNT2 -> 't33', NT2 -> 't37', etc. So, NT2 can directly produce 't33', 't37', etc.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT3 NT2, and NT3 produces 't34', NT2 produces 't22' and 't37' perhaps. Wait, but how would the string have 't34', 't22', and 't37' together?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then NT3 \u2192 't34', NT9 \u2192 't75', but that would give two terminals. Hmm, not enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion goes deeper. For example, NT3 could expand to more non-terminals that then produce more terminals. Let's see NT3's production:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\n\nSo, for example, if NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal on the right. \n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of \"t14\", \"t70\", and \"t37\". I notice that each of these tokens starts with \"t\" followed by numbers, which suggests that these might be terminals in the grammar. So, the string is composed of terminal symbols. \n\nIn CNF, the start symbol is S, which can produce other symbols, and the process continues until terminals are reached. Since the string is just three terminal symbols, I need to see if there's a way for S to directly produce them in sequence.\n\nBut looking through the production rules, the start symbol S is only in the first two rules:\n- S -> NT3 NT9\n- S -> NT8 NT9\n\nSo from S, we get two non-terminals: either NT3 and NT9 or NT8 and NT9. Now, looking at the string, the end is \"t37\", which matches the production for NT8 (since NT8 -> \"t37\" according to the grammar).

Let's check the productions for NT9 and NT3.\n\nLooking at NT9:\n- NT9 can produce \"t37\", \"t75\", \"t22\", \"t14\", etc. So yes, \"t14\" is a direct production of NT9.\n\nLooking at NT3:\n- NT3 can produce \"t30\" and \"t30\" again, or perhaps other non-terminals.

So NT3 isn't directly producing \"t14\", but \"t70\" is an option.\n\nWait, in the first option, after S -> NT3 NT9, we have to see if NT3 can produce \"t14\". So NT3 can only generate NT6 NT2. Then, I need to see if NT6 can produce \"t14\".\n\nLooking at NT6's rules: NT6 -> NT3 NT6, NT4 NT5, NT8 NT4, etc. To get \"t14\", perhaps NT6 can go to NT8 NT4? Because looking at NT8, \"t37\" is one of its production. Wait, no, NT8 is a terminal here, so perhaps NT8 can't go further. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, actually, NT3 can only generate NT6 NT2. So, to get \"t14\", we need to see if either NT6 or NT2 can produce \"t14\". Looking at NT6's rules, I don't see \"t14\" as a terminal, except in other NT6 productions. Similarly, NT2's rules include producing NT8, which is a terminal for \"t37\", but I'm not sure if NT2 can produce \"t14\".\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe NT3 does not directly produce \"t14\", so in the first option (S -> NT3 NT9), NT3 would have to produce \"t14\", which it can't, because NT3's only production is to non-terminals. So this path might not work.\n\nLet's try the second option from S: S -> NT8 NT9. So the first part would be NT8, then NT9. Now, the string is \"t14 t70 t37\". So the first element is \"t14\", second is \"t70\", third is \"t37\". So NT8 needs to produce \"t14\", then NT9 produces \"t70\", but wait, this isn't directly possible because NT8 only produces \"t37\" as a terminal. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. S -> NT8 NT9 would produce NT8 and NT9 as strings, so the string would be something like \"t37\" (from NT8) followed by \"t14\" (from NT9). But our string is \"t14 t70 t37\", so that's three tokens, which would require that from NT8 and NT9, we have three terminal steps. Hmm, perhaps I need a more detailed analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S directly produces three non-terminals, but in our grammar, S seems to only produce two at a time. So to get three terminal symbols, we might need a combination of multiple productions.\n\nLet me try another approach: working backwards from the string. Each token in the string must be a terminal, so we need to see if each can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t14, t70, t37.\n\n- t37 is a terminal, so it must be produced from NT8: S -> NT8 NT9, where NT8 produces t37, and NT9 produces t14.\n\nThen t70 is the middle token. So the middle token would come from the second part of the initial production. If S -> NT8 NT9, then the NT9 needs to produce something that leads to t70.\n\nWait, but NT9 can produce t70? Let me check the NT9 productions: yes, NT9 can produce \"t60\", \"t70\", etc. So if NT9 produces \"t70\", then that would make the second token t70, matching the string. Then NT8 produces \"t37\", and NT9 produces \"t70\" and \"t14\". So the initial production S->NT8 NT9 would generate \"t37\" followed by \"t70\" and \"t14\", which is exactly the string given. But wait, the string is \"t14 t70 t37\". That's different. So the order would be \"t37\" from NT8 and \"t70\" and \"t14\" from NT9, resulting in \"t37 t70 t14\", which is the reverse of the given string.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Maybe I got the order wrong.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each rule has two non-terminals, so S -> NT8 NT9 would produce NT8 NT9. Each of these can themselves be split into two non-terminals, but eventually, the entire string of terminals must follow that structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is generated as follows:\n\nLet me consider the possibility of S -> NT8 NT9.\n\n- NT8 -> \"t37\"\n- NT9 -> \"t70\" followed by \"t14\"? No, that's not possible because each production is a non-terminal to a terminal, so NT9 can only produce one terminal directly, but the string has three terminals, so maybe there's an intermediate step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the string is derived. Let me think step by step.\n\n1. Start with S: S -> NT8 NT9\n2. Then NT8 is replaced by \"t37\"\n3. NT9 can be replaced by \"NT1 NT5\"\n   - Then NT1 can be replaced by \"t40\"\n   - NT5 can be replaced by \"t91\"\n   - But this would give \"t40 t91\", which is not matching our string.\n\nAlternatively, NT9 can be replaced by other non-terminals. Let me see all possible expansions.\n\nLooking at NT9's rules:\n- NT9 can produce \"t75\", \"t60\", \"t37\", \"t91\", etc. But wait, none of these directly produce \"t14\" or \"t70\".\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all the terminal symbols in the grammar:\n\nThe terminals are:\nt14, t70, t37, t12, t19, t40, t22, t23, t30, t37, t40, t42, t50, t52, t60, t65, t70, t75, t8, t90, t13, t14, t19, t22, t23, t30, t37, t41, t42, t50, t52, t60, t65, t70, t75, t8, t90, t13.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the grammar as a tree where each non-terminal expands into other symbols.\n\nGiven that the string is \"t14 t70"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-61","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I need to determine if the string \"t14 t99 t37\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a CFG in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal (A) expands into two other non-terminals (BC). Terminal symbols don't appear on the left side, only on the right. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most production rules for non-terminals involve two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT3, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and so on. However, some rules directly produce terminal symbols, like NT9 \u2192 't75' or NT8 \u2192 't52'. These terminals are atomic and can't be broken down further.\n\nThe string given is \"t14 t99 t37\". It's a sequence of four terminals. The goal is to see if this sequence can be derived by the grammar.\n\nI think the approach here is to break down the string into components and check if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's split the string into its components: ['t14', 't99', 't37'].\n\nSince the string has three terminals, the derivation starts with the start symbol S, which expands into two non-terminals, as per the production S \u2192 NT3 NT3 or S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Wait, looking back, the first two productions are S \u2192 NT3 NT3 and S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Let me check: The initial rules are S->NT3 NT3 and S->NT3 NT9. So S splits into two NT3s or NT3 and NT9.\n\nNow, the first symbol in the string is 't14', which is a terminal. So whatever is at the start must be a terminal or non-terminal that can directly produce it. But the start symbol S is a non-terminal, so it must expand into two non-terminals.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT3 or NT3 NT9. Let's examine the possible branches.\n\nLooking at the production for NT3: From the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and further, NT6 and NT2 each can split further.\n\nWait, let me list all the possible rules for NT3. Wait, in the given grammar, looking for NT3, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nAh, so NT3 can produce either NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT3 NT3, or S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't14'. So let's assume the first NT3 in S's production must derive something that can end in 't14'. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built by multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see each production path recursively.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to match the string \"t14 t99 t37\" from the start symbol.\n\nSince S must generate two non-terminals, let's consider each possibility:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT3\n2. S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nNow, the string is three symbols long, so let's see how these can be produced.\n\nFirst, if S \u2192 NT3 NT3, then each NT3 can generate a terminal or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the first NT3, which may generate a terminal or non-terminals, and similarly for the second NT3.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that one of the NT3s produces a terminal, and the other produces more non-terminals that eventually produce the other terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived by some path.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that NT0, NT3, NT5, etc., can produce 't' terminals like 't13', 't25', 't37', etc. Let's see which NTs produce 't14', 't99', and 't37'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n- NT6 \u2192 't65', 't34', 't8' etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't30', 't37'\n- NT7 \u2192 't70', 't10', 't40', 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't75', 't60', etc.\n\nSo 't14' is produced by which NT? Let's go through the production rules.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't14':\n\nIn the production rules, I don't immediately see any NT that directly goes to 't14'. So perhaps we need to see if any NT can derive to 't14' via their production rules.\n\nWait, let's see the rules for each NT.\n\nLooking for NT X \u2192 't14', but I don't see that in the given rules.\n\nWait, let's recheck the production rules to see if any NT directly or indirectly can produce 't14'.\n\nIn the given rules for NTs, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't40', 't25', 't40', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't30', 't37'\n- NT5 \u2192 't91', 't65', 't37'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8', 't34', 't65', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't70', 't10', 't40', 't7'\n- NT8 \u2192 't52', 't37', 't23', 't8', etc.\n- NT0 \u2192 't13', 't22', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't75', 't60', 't37', 't22', etc.\n\nWait, does any NT produce 't14'? Hmm.\n\nLooking through all, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't14'. Is it possible that 't14' is not reachable in this grammar? Or perhaps I missed it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible to construct 't14' through some rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each NT and see if any production could end up with 't14'.\n\nLooking at NT7: productions include 't7', 't10', 't40', 't70'. So it's possible to have 't7' via NT7.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe one of the NTs can derive into 't14' via their production chains.\n\nBut perhaps 't14' is not present in any of the terminals defined by the grammar. If that's the case, then the given string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking back at the given string: 't14', 't99', 't37'. 't37' is present in NT3, NT6, NT8, etc. For example, NT3 \u2192 't37' directly. So that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, 't75' is directly produced by NT9, and 't60' is directly produced by NT9 as well. So 't60' is possible.\n\nBut 't14' is tricky. Maybe some NTs can derive into 't14' via their rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't14' is a terminal that isn't present in any production. Let me cross-verify.\n\nLooking through each NT's production rules, I don't see any NT that produces 't14' directly. So, perhaps the grammar can't derive 't14' as a terminal. Therefore, the string with 't14' can't be generated.\n\nWait, but the production rules may allow some NT to produce 't14' through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can explore if 't14' can be produced by any NT.\n\nWait, looking at NT6: its rules include NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, and then perhaps NT8 and NT4 can produce certain terminals.\n\nFor example, looking at NT6's rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT4 has rules like \u2192 NT2 NT8, \u2192 NT7 NT0, etc.\n\nBut none of these seem to directly produce 't14'.\n\nAlternatively, let's take NT9, which produces 't60' (directly). But how does that relate to 't14'?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should focus on each element of the string and see if they can be matched.\n\nFirst element: 't14'\u2014let's see if any NT can produce it.\n\nLooking at NT7: it produces 't7', 't10', etc., but not 't14'.\n\nLooking at NT8: produces 't52', 't37', 't23', 't8', etc. But no.\n\nWait, perhaps NT0: NT0 \u2192 't13', in some rules.

{"custom_id":"request-62","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string `t40 t12 t23 t70` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, but it's still quite complex with a lot of production rules.\n\nFirst, I should remind myself what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. It requires that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and the start symbol can be a non-terminal that can produce terminals. Also, the productions can't have empty strings on the right-hand side, except when the start symbol is the only symbol in the production. So, the given grammar seems to fit this, as all the rules are two non-terminals.\n\nNext, since the grammar is in CNF, I know that each production rule introduces exactly one terminal symbol in the string. Wait, no, not exactly, because CNF only ensures that each production splits into two non-terminals, but the terminals can only appear in the base case (start symbol may produce a terminal, but usually, the start symbol doesn't). So actually, the production rules can have terminals when the non-terminals are at the same level as the start symbol. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nAlternatively, since the productions are all in CNF, the string generated must have a length that is a power of two multiplied by the number of symbols in the start expression. Hmm, the string is `t40 t12 t23 t70`, which is four symbols long. The grammar's start symbol is S, which starts as S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So, each production from S adds two symbols, and the total length would be 2^n where n is the number of productions applied. Since four symbols, that's 2^2, so n=2. So that\u2019s possible. So the string length is appropriate.\n\nNow, each symbol in the string must come from a production chain starting from S. Let me try to map each terminal to a production.\n\nLooking at the string: t40, t12, t23, t70.\n\nI need to see if each of these terminals can be produced by the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's check each terminal:\n\n1. t40: Looking through the NT rules, I see that NT0 can produce 't13' and 't40'. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't40', and NT5 \u2192 't91' which isn't relevant. So t40 can be produced by NT0, NT7.\n\n2. t12: Let's see if any non-terminal can produce 't12'. Looking through the rules, do any right-hand sides have 't12'? It's not obvious. Let me scan:\n\nNT9 -> NT7 NT9: Not helpful. NT8 -> NT6 NT8: Also not. Let me check each NT's productions to see if any produce t12.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any production rule that has t12 on the right-hand side as a terminal. So it seems that 't12' is not a terminal in the grammar because none of the non-terminals have a rule where 't12' appears on the RHS as a terminal. Wait, no, all non-terminals are split into two non-terminals, except the ones in the right-hand side producing terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, the only way a terminal appears is when the start symbol is the only symbol in the root production. Wait, no, that's when the grammar isn't using CNF correctly. Wait, in CNF, the start symbol can directly produce a terminal only if it's the left-hand side of a production rule. For example, if S \u2192 a B, where a is a terminal, then 'a' is in the language.\n\nLooking at the given rules, do any non-terminals have a terminal as their RHS? Let me scan through the productions:\n\nYes, several rules have terminal 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nNT1 -> 't25'\n\nNT3 -> 't30'\n\nNT6 -> 't8' (Wait, NT6 \u2192 't8'? No, wait, looking back:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the provided grammar, I think some of these might be direct terminals.\n\nWait, checking the given productions:\n\nLooking for any NT -> 't...'\n\nYes:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, but Wait, I'm looking at the provided productions again, yes, for example, NT0 \u2192 't13', and NT6 \u2192 't8', etc. So those non-terminals can directly produce terminal symbols.\n\nWait, but the string is t40 t12 t23 t70. So each t is a terminal, and I need to find a production chain where each terminal is produced by a non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, do any non-terminals produce t12?\n\nLooking at all the RHS productions for non-terminals, do any of them have 't12'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any production that produces 't12'. The only terminals are those with t followed by numbers, but t12 isn't present.\n\nWait, that means that 't12' is not a terminal in the grammar\u2014it's not a terminal, so how can it appear in the generated string?\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because in CNF, every production must have non-terminals except for the case where a start symbol produces a terminal directly. So, if there's no rule that produces t12, then t12 is not in the grammar's terminals; thus, the string t40 t12 t23 t70 can't be generated because 't12' is not a terminal symbol.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar rules provided:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any production where the RHS includes 't12'. Therefore, 't12' is not a terminal, which would mean the string contains a terminal that's not part of the grammar, which is impossible.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So, if 't12' isn't a terminal in the grammar's production rules, it can't appear in the language generated by the grammar. So the string provided can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is composed of variables like S, NT0, NT1, and so on, each with production rules that combine other variables. Some of these production rules are terminals, denoted by 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are actual symbols. The string I'm given is a sequence of these terminals: t34, t13, etc.\n\nThe grammar has S -> NT3 NT9 and S -> NT3 NT2 as its starting points. But the string starts with t34, which is a terminal, not a variable. So I need to trace back from the string to see if it can be derived from S through the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list the variables and terminals involved:\n\nVariables:\nS, NT0, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT8, NT9\n\nTerminals:\nt34, t13, t41, t60, t12\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that t9 appears twice as terminal, but in the given string, it's t12, t34, etc., so I think each t may be unique. Now, let me see which variables produce t34, t13, etc., in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT6 -> 't34' (rule #17)\n- NT0 -> 't13' (rule #23)\n- NT8 -> 't41' (rule #16)\n- NT9 -> 't60' (rule #34)\n- I don't see t12 directly, so maybe NT12 isn't present. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, looking through the rules, I see:\n- NT3 -> 't30' (rule #29)\n- NT8 -> 't37' (rule #31)\n- NT9 -> 't75' (rule #62)\n- NT2 -> 't33' (rule #61)\n- NT6 -> 't8' (rule #66)\n- NT1 -> 't40' (rule #69)\n- NT7 -> 't70' (rule #73)\n- NT5 -> 't37' (rule #91)\n- Others like NT2, NT3, etc., go into other variables.\n\nWait, but the string has t12. None of the variables seem to directly produce t12. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking at all the rules, I don't see any terminal with t12. So that might be an issue. But perhaps t12 is part of a longer production that's been reduced to a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me look again. Variables like NT12 aren't defined, so maybe t12 must come from a variable that's been expanded. But I don't see any rule for a variable that produces t12. Let's check all the rules:\n\nGoing through each production, for example:\n- S produces NT3 and NT9, which in turn produce more variables or t symbols.\n- NT9 -> 't75', not t12.\n- NT6 -> 't34' and also NT6 -> NT3 NT6. Wait, no, that's rule NT6 -> NT8 NT4, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, the terminals are quite specific. I don't see any rule that ends in t12. So perhaps if t12 is part of the string, it's generated by some variable, but I can't find such a variable. So this might mean that the string can't be generated because t12 isn't produced by any rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in not seeing it. Let me go through all the productions systematically:\n\nLooking at the list, the terminals are t13, t34, t41, t60, t12.\n\nCheck each production for these terminals:\n\n- t13 is produced by NT0 (rule 23).\n- t34 by NT6 (rule 17).\n- t41 by NT8 (rule 16).\n- t60 by NT9 (rule 34).\n- t12: I don't see any variable whose production ends with t12. Let's check all other productions. For example, is there a variable that directly goes to t12?\n\nLooking through the production rules, under NT2 -> 't33' (rule 61), NT6 -> 't8' (rule 66). No, nothing else. So since t12 is not a terminal in the grammar, the string contains a symbol that's not part of the grammar, meaning it can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't12' is part of another variable's production. But I can't see which variable would produce that. The only potential is if a variable has a production that includes t12, but none are listed.\n\nSo the string includes t12, which isn't produced by any rule.

{"custom_id":"request-83","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t23 t52 t14 t25 t22`. Alright, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires each production rule to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit that structure. Every production either has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. Okay, that's good because CNF is structured that way, so it's compatible.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals: `t23`, `t52`, `t14`, `t25`, `t22`. Since the grammar is in CNF, each terminal in the string must be directly derived from a production with a single terminal, like A \u2192 a. \n\nI'll start by trying to reconstruct the parse tree from the bottom up, seeing if I can reach the start symbol S. The string ends with `t22`, so I'll look at the production rules that have `t22` as an output. Scanning through, I see that rule is `NT9 \u2192 't22'`. So the last symbol `t22` comes from NT9.\n\nWorking my way back, since NT9 is part of a chain, I need to see how NT9 is connected. Looking at the grammar, NT9 can also go to NT3, NT7, or NT6. But in the string, we only have `t22`, so NT9 must directly produce `t22`. But that might mean that after NT9, there are no more symbols, which could be a problem because the string has five symbols, so the tree might have branches.\n\nWait, let me think again. The string is five symbols long, so the parse tree should generate five terminals in sequence. Starting from S, which is the top, and then branching out.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the string: `t23 t52 t14 t25 t22`. Since all these are terminals, each must be produced by a production that directly emits a terminal.\n\nFirst, `t22` is from NT9. So the last symbol is produced by NT9.\n\nLooking at `t25`, which is the fourth symbol. Looking for productions that produce `t25`. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT2 \u2192 't25' is a production. So `t25` comes from NT2.\n\nNext is `t23` as the third symbol. Looking for `t23`, I see `t23` is from NT9 via `NT9 \u2192 't23'`. So `t23` comes from another NT9.\n\nBut wait, NT9 also has other productions. The sequence is NT9 \u2192 `t23`, then presumably another node produces `t52`, then `t14`, then NT2 produces `t25`, then NT9 produces `t22`. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAnother approach is to try to find the leftmost derivation, expanding from the start symbol S, and see if it can yield the string. If at any step the expansion doesn't match, then it's not possible.\n\nStarting with S, it can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So the string must start with whatever NT3 or NT2 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t23`, which comes from NT9, not NT3, because NT3 produces 't30' via `NT3 \u2192 't30'`, but `t23` is not 't30'. Wait, so if S starts with NT3, how does it produce `t23`? Hmm, maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, if S starts with NT3 NT9, then NT3 would produce `t23`, and NT9 produces `t52`. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions, I see `NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2` or `NT3 \u2192 't30'`. Since the first symbol is `t23`, it's not `t30`, so perhaps NT3 can be expanded further. Let's see: if NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, then we can proceed.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT2 NT9.\n\nNow, the first symbol is derived from NT6. Looking at NT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, etc. I need to find a symbolic string that starts with `t23`. Wait, `t23` is produced by NT9, but in the expansion so far, we've moved beyond NT9. Maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by NT9 producing `t23`, which would require NT9 to produce `t23` via a production. Looking back, I see NT9 can produce `t23` via `NT9 \u2192 't23'`. But the problem is that NT9's children in a parse would be something else as well, but in a leftmost derivation, we expand the leftmost non-terminal first.\n\nWait, maybe it's getting too complicated. Let me try to think about the overall structure.\n\nThe string has `t23` as the first token, so perhaps it comes from NT9. So the last production rule in the sequence would be NT9 \u2192 `t23`. Then before that, the previous symbol is `t52`, which would have to come from NT9's other production. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT9 also has `NT9 \u2192 NT3`. So perhaps the parse tree has NT9 at the top, which splits into NT3 and NT7 or something else. Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated by S \u2192 NT3 NT9 \u2192 NT3 produces `t23` and NT9 produces `t52`, but I don't see NT9 \u2192 `t52` in the grammar. Let me check: in the given rules, there's `NT8 \u2192 't52'` but not NT9. So `t52` must come from NT8, not NT9. So maybe S \u2192 NT3 NT9 won't produce `t52` as the second symbol because NT9 can't produce `t52`. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled up.\n\nWait, maybe I should backtrack. The last symbol is `t22`, which is produced by NT9. So somewhere in the parse tree, there's an NT9 that directly leads to `t22`. The second last symbol is `t25`, which is produced by NT2. So maybe before NT9, there's a NT9 that produced `t22`, and the previous NT9 had another NT9 as a child? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the overall structure is that S produces NT3 NT9, and NT3 produces `t23`, while NT9 produces `t52`, then some branching continues. But this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try to write down the string and see what possible productions can fit:\n\nLooking at NT9 \u2192 `t23` and `t22`. Wait, `t23` comes from NT9 via `NT9 \u2192 't23'`, and `t22` from `NT9 \u2192 't22'`. So perhaps in the parse tree, there's a NT9 that has two children: `t23` and then another NT9 that leads to `t52`, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should map the entire parse tree. Let's try.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNT3 can be 't23' or expanded. Since the first symbol is `t23`, NT3 must directly produce 't23', i.e., NT3 \u2192 't23'.\n\nThen, we have S \u2192 't23' NT9.\n\nNext, we process NT9. The second symbol is `t52`, which is produced by NT8, as `NT8 \u2192 't52'`. So NT9 must be expanding to produce NT8 first. Let's see. If NT9 produces NT8, then NT8 must produce 't52'. But looking back, NT8 has several productions, including one that leads to 't52', which is `NT8 \u2192 't52'`. So yes, NT8 can produce 't52'.\n\nSo, S \u2192 't23' NT9 \u2192 't23' NT8 \u2192 't23' 't52'.\n\nWait, that would give the first two symbols as `t23 t52`, which matches the start of the string. Good.\n\nNow, after `t52`, the next symbol is `t14`, which must come from another NT node. Looking at the grammar, `t14` is from NT1, as `NT1 \u2192 't14'`.\n\nSo, moving to the next symbol, we have `t14` from NT1.\n\nNow"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-106","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to check is `t34 t13 t13 t22 t13 t23`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form is. It's a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. All the terminals are single symbols, and there's no useless symbols or epsilon productions except for the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the production rules are all of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ or NTX \u2192 'tN', where 'tN' represents a terminal symbol like t34, t13, etc. So this seems to comply with Chomsky normal form because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string to check is a sequence of terminals: t34, t13, t13, t22, t13, t23. Each of these corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. So the first step is to parse this string using the given grammar rules to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, parsers like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent can be used. But since I might not remember all the production rules off the top of my head, I can try a step-by-step approach.\n\nLet me first list out the production rules again to identify all possible ways the terminals can be formed. Each rule that ends with a terminal (like NT9 \u2192 't75') gives a possible terminal in the language. \n\nThe string is of length 6, so when considering how it's derived, I need to see if each terminal can be part of a leftmost (or rightmost) derivation and if the non-terminals can expand appropriately.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t34. Scanning through the production rules, I see NT6 \u2192 't34', so it's possible for NT6 to produce t34.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t34, which comes from NT6. So perhaps we have a production that starts with NT6. Looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT9. But S is the start symbol, so the derivation would begin with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the initial derivation would produce something like NT3 NT9, which then needs to expand into the string. But the first terminal is t34, which is from NT6, but how would NT3 and NT9 lead to that?\n\nWait, maybe this is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which production rules directly produce each terminal in the string.\n\nLooking at each terminal in the string:\n\n- t34 comes from NT6 \u2192 't34'\n- t13 comes from NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- t22, I don't immediately see a production rule that ends with 't22'. Looking back, I see NT9 \u2192 't75', but no 't22'. Maybe I missed one. Wait, let me scan through the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at NT5, I see NT5 \u2192 't91', which is different. Hmm, perhaps t22 is not directly a terminal in the grammar. Wait, let me check the production rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the rules, each production ends with either a non-terminal or a terminal. Let me check for any NT that produces 't22'. Hmmm, in the list of rules, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- NT6 \u2192 't34'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT1 \u2192 't40'\n- NT4 \u2192 't88'\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n\nOh, I don't see any NT that produces 't22' directly. So that means 't22' isn't a terminal symbol in this grammar, right? But the string contains 't22', so unless it's a non-terminal that can derive into it through multiple steps, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky normal form, all terminals are single symbols, so if the grammar doesn't have a rule for 't22', then the string can't be generated because 't22' is not part of the grammar's language.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Looking through all the production rules, every rule that ends with a terminal is listed, and I don't see any rule that ends with 't22'. So it's safe to assume that 't22' isn't a terminal in this grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because it contains a terminal that doesn't exist in the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I overlooked a production rule. Let me go back through the list:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't75'\nNT8 \u2192 't52'\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\nNT6 \u2192 't34'\nNT1 \u2192 't40'\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\nNT2 \u2192 't33'\nNT4 \u2192 't88'\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\nNT5 \u2192 't91'\nNT7 \u2192 't65' \u2192 No, wait, earlier line: Wait, looking again, perhaps I misread.

{"custom_id":"request-108","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break down what I know and how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall Chomsky Normal Form. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production is either a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. The given grammar fits this structure because all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t22 t8 t41 t91 t40 t34`. Since this is a string of terminals, I need to check if the grammar can derive this string step by step.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top-level production in the grammar. The start symbol is S, and looking at the rules for S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo S can produce either NT3 followed by NT9 or NT3 followed by NT2. My string starts with t22, which I need to map to a terminal. Let me see where t22 comes from.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT9 \u2192 't91', and NT0 \u2192 't13', etc. Wait, the string has t22, which I need to find if any non-terminal ends with 't22'. Looking through the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 t75, NT7 \u2192 t40, NT8 \u2192 t52, NT0 \u2192 t13, etc. Hmm. Wait, none of the non-terminals directly produce t22. Maybe I need to see which production rule leads to 't22'. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 't75', NT2 \u2192 't33', NT6 \u2192 't8', etc. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, actually, in the given rules, I see that NT9 \u2192 't91' and other rules, but nothing for t22. Wait, did I miss a production?\n\nWait, looking back, the string is `t22 t8 t41 t91 t40 t34`. Let me see if any of the non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check each rule carefully. Is there a rule that produces 't22'? Going through the production rules...\n\nWait, I don't see any direct rule that produces 't22'. Hmm, that's a problem because if a production rule requires a symbol that's not present, then the string can't be derived. But maybe I made a mistake in looking. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the rules are long, so perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each rule:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t75\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n- NT5 \u2192 t91\n- NT6 \u2192 t8\n- NT1 \u2192 t40\n- NT7 \u2192 t10\n- NT1 \u2192 t19\n- NT1 \u2192 t12\n- NT2 \u2192 t37\n- NT2 \u2192 t8\n- Wait, some of these produce terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 t75, which is in the string.\n\nWait, but the string is t22, which isn't appearing anywhere. Maybe I was wrong, perhaps I miscounted. Let me look again:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any rule that has a terminal 't22'. So that would mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because there's no production that leads to 't22'. That would be a problem.\n\nWait, but maybe 't22' comes from a non-terminal that does produce it indirectly. Wait, no, because if the only production rules are in CNF, then any symbol in the string must be either a direct production of a non-terminal or an atomic terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the rules. Let me look carefully again.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see NT9 \u2192 't91', NT0 \u2192 't13', etc. But nothing that produces 't22'. So that suggests that the string includes a symbol that the grammar can't generate. Therefore, the string can't be produced by this grammar.\n\nWait, but the string is given, so maybe I made a mistake in parsing the rules. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps 't22' is a result of a production from one of the non-terminals, but I didn't notice. Let me see each rule again:\n\nWait, no, the rules don't include 't22' as a terminal in any production. So for example, looking at NT9, one rule is NT9 \u2192 't75', which is present in the string. Similarly, other rules produce other terminals.\n\nSo if 't22' isn't in any of the production rules, then the string can't be generated because it contains a terminal that isn't allowed by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The given string is: t22 t8 t41 t91 t40 t34.\n\nLooking at each t:\n\n- t22: Do any rules produce this? Looking through the rules, I don't see any. For example, NT2 \u2192 t33, which is close but not t22. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 t13, etc. So t22 isn't present.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string can't be generated because it includes a symbol that's not allowed by the grammar's production rules.\n\nBut wait, maybe the NT for 't22' is a non-terminal that eventually can derive t22, but I don't see that happening.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT non-terminals can eventually derive t22 through a series of steps, but looking at the production rules, none of the NTs directly derive t22. For instance, is there any NT that can lead to t22 through two steps? But since all productions are in CNF, we can only have two symbols at each step.\n\nWait, maybe it's part of a longer chain, but since all are in CNF, the only way is through direct productions. So any string with t22 would be impossible because there's no rule that gives 't22' directly.\n\nThus, the answer should be 'No' because the string includes a terminal that is not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-129","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t65 t10 t41 t13 t22 t52 t14`. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. However, I notice that some of the productions have terminal symbols, which might help in breaking down the string.\n\nFirst, I should look at the string and see if it can be matched by the rules. The string starts with `t65`, and looking at the grammar, I see that `NT6` can produce `t65`. So, `t65` matches `NT6` right away. That leaves me with `t10 t41 t13 t22 t52 t14`.\n\nNext is `t10`. I check the rules for non-terminals that can produce `t10`. Looking through, I find that `NT11` (which is represented as `NT1` due to the notation confusion here) can produce `t10`. So, I match `t10` with `NT1`, and now the remaining string is `t41 t13 t22 t52 t14`.\n\nMoving on to `t41`, I search for a production that gives `t41`. I see that `NT18` (which is `NT2`, considering the notation used here) can produce `t41`. So, I match `t41` with `NT2`. Now, the remaining string is `t13 t22 t52 t14`.\n\nNext is `t13`. Checking the non-terminals, I find that `NT1` (originally `NT0`) can produce `t13`. So, I match `t13` with `NT0`, leaving `t22 t52 t14`.\n\nThen, `t22` is matched by `NT22`, which I think is `NT9`. Wait, let me check. Since `NT9` can produce `t22`, that's correct. So, `t22` is matched by `NT9`, and now the string is `t52 t14` remaining.\n\nNext is `t52`. Looking at `NT3` (originally `NT8`), `NT8` can produce `t52`. So, I match `t52` with `NT8`, leaving `t14`.\n\nFinally, `t14` is produced by which non-terminal? Checking the rules, I see that `NT1` (which is `NT0`) can produce `t14`. So, I match `t14` with `NT0`. Now, putting it all together, I have matched each token with corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLet me check if the non-terminals can derive each other in order. Starting from the start symbol `S`, which produces `NT3 NT9`. `NT3` can produce `t65`, and `NT9` can produce `t22`. But wait, in our breakdown, after `t65` comes `t10`, which requires a different path. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, no. Because if `S` is `NT3 NT9`, then the string generated would be sequences from NT3 and NT9. So, in our breakdown, I had `t65 t10...`, but if `S` starts with NT3, which can produce `t65`, that's fine. But then, after `t65`, I have `t10`, which is in the string. But earlier, I thought NT3 only produces `t65`. Wait, looking back, in the grammar, `NT3 -> NT6 NT2` and then `NT6` and `NT2` have their own expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recheck the steps. Let's recount:\n\n1. `t65` is from `NT6`.\n2. `t65` is followed by `t10`, which is from `NT1` or `NT0`? Actually, looking at the rules, `NT1` can produce `t10`. So maybe NT1 is `NT1`, which is a different non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol is S, which is NT3 NT9. So, NT3 and NT9 must derive the first and the second parts of the string respectively. Alternatively, maybe S can derive other combinations, but in the string, the first token is `t65`, which is from NT6. But according to S, it's NT3 and NT9. So, how can the first token be `t65` if NT3 can't produce `t65` unless it goes through some steps.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. In the grammar, `NT6 -> 't34'`, but wait no, no\u2014looking at the rules, some produce terminals. Let's see: NT6 can produce 't8' directly, but perhaps NT6 can also produce other combinations. Wait, the rules for NT6 are: `NT6 -> NT3 NT6`, `NT6 -> NT4 NT5`, `NT6 -> NT9 NT2`, etc. So, NT6 can go all the way to terminals, including 't34', but in our string, `t65` is first.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the string, the first token is `t65`, which comes from NT6. But looking at the grammar, I see that NT6 can produce 't8', 't37', 't65', etc. Wait, I need to check which NT6 productions produce 't65'. Looking through:\n\n- NT6 -> NT3 NT6 (non-terminal)\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT5\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT2\n- ... And other non-terminals\n- Oh, looking further, NT6 -> 't65' is a direct production. So yes, NT6 can produce 't65'.\n\nSo the initial match is NT6 -> 't65', leaving the next part as \"t10 t41 t13 t22 t52 t14\".\n\nNow, for the remaining part: `t10 t41 t13 t22 t52 t14`. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nAfter `t65` (NT6), the next token is `t10`, which is from NT1 (as per rules, NT1 -> 't10'). So, NT1 -> 't10' produces `t10`. Now, the remaining string is `t41 t13 t22 t52 t14`.\n\nNext is `t41`. Looking for a production that gives `t41`. Checking NT2: NT2 can produce `t41` (NT2 -> 't41'). So, NT2 -> 't41' gives `t41`. Remaining string: `t13 t22 t52 t14`.\n\nNext is `t13`. Looking for a terminal production. Hmm, let's check NT0: NT0 -> 't13'. Yes, so NT0 -> 't13' produces `t13`. Remaining string: `t22 t52 t14`.\n\nNext is `t22`. Looking at NT9 (originally `NT1`?), wait, checking the production NT9 -> 't22'. Yes, so NT9 -> 't22' produces `t22`. Remaining string: `t52 t14`.\n\nNext is `t52`. NT8 can produce `t52` (NT8 -> 't52'). So, NT8 -> 't52' gives `t52`. Remaining string: `t14`.\n\nFinally, `t14` comes from NT0 (NT0 -> 't14'). So, `t14` is produced by NT0. \n\nPutting it all together, the breakdown is:\n\n- S -> NT3 NT9\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT9 -> NT1 ... but wait, looking back, `t10` is the next token, which is from NT1. Wait, no. Because S is NT3 NT9, which must expand to the entire string. So, the issue is that after `t65`, the next part is `t10`, but in the grammar, is there a way that NT3 could expand to some non-terminals that produce `t10`? \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Because S is NT3 NT9. So, the derivation must first expand NT3 and NT9. So, for the string `t65 t10 ...`, that would require that NT3 somehow produces `t65` and then the rest is derived from NT9.\n\nWait, but NT3 initially is a non-terminal. Let me look at NT3's productions: NT3 -> NT6 NT2. Then, how can NT3 -> 't65 t...'?\n\nWait, no. Because NT3's initial production is NT6 NT2, which are non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-122","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t23 t52 t12 t14 t30 t88 t91\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm not very familiar with all the details here, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a string is generated by a grammar if we can derive it from the start symbol S using the production rules. The grammar provided has a bunch of S and NT productions, ultimately leading to terminals like 't23', 't52', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t23, t52, t12, t14, t30, t88, t91. I think each of these terminals must be generated by some non-terminal in the grammar. Let me see if each is in the grammar or can be derived.\n\nI notice that some of these are directly present in the grammar. For example, NT9 -> t75 and NT8 -> t52. Wait, in the string, t52 is there, so maybe it comes from NT8. Similarly, t23 is present in NT8 -> t23. So maybe t23 is derived directly from NT8.\n\nBut wait, t23 is a terminal, right? So its production must be one of the rules that ends with t23. Let me check the grammar rules. Yes, there's NT8 -> t23. So that must be where t23 comes from.\n\nNext, let's look at t52. The rule NT8 -> t52 is also present. So that's straightforward; t52 comes from NT8.\n\nThen, t12. Hmm, is there a non-terminal that directly produces t12? I'm trying to scan through the rules. Oh, I see NT9 -> t12 in some rule. Wait, no, actually, looking at the list, I don't see a direct rule for NT9 -> t12. But maybe it's through another production.\n\nWait, maybe t12 comes from a different non-terminal. Let me check. Is there any NT that produces t12? Let me look for 't12' in the right-hand side of any production. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT8 has multiple rules, but 't12' isn't directly there. Instead, NT2 has some rules. Let me check the NT2 production.\n\nLooking at NT2's production: Oh, wait, there's NT2 -> NT3 NT1. That's not t12. Then NT2 has another rule: NT2 -> NT5 NT6. No. Another rule: NT2 -> NT7 NT8. Hmm, that's t75 and t89? No, wait, NT7 might produce t70 and t91. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me list all the t's and see where they come from.\n\nt23: From NT8 -> t23.\nt52: From NT8 -> t52.\nt12: Hmm, maybe it's from NT0? Let me check. NT0 has several rules, but I don't see any that produce t12 directly. Wait, maybe it's produced by a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t12 comes from a non-terminal that eventually leads to it. Let me think. Wait, looking back, I see that NT9 has a rule: NT9 -> t75, but that doesn't help. Let me check NT1's rules. Wait, NT1 has several: NT1 -> NT4 NT8, which can produce t88. Wait, no, t88 is directly from NT4.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to build a parse tree from the string and see if the grammar can generate it.\n\nStarting from the left, the first symbol is t23. As we saw, it must come from NT8. So S starts with NT8. The string would be NT8 t23 t52 t12 t14 t30 t88 t91.\n\nBut wait, the entire string is t23 t52 t12 t14 t30 t88 t91, so S must expand into something that leads to this. Let me see the initial rule for S. The grammar has two rules for S: S -> NT3 NT9 and S -> NT3 NT2. Both start with NT3. Wait, wait a minute, in the initial lines, the user wrote:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nWait, so S can produce NT3 followed by NT9 or NT2. So the initial expansion is either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nNow, let's consider the string. The first symbol is t23, which is produced by NT8. How do we get NT8 from the S rules? S can produce NT3, but how does NT3 produce NT8? Let me check the NT3 rules.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules: NT3 -> NT6 NT2, and also NT3 -> NT0 NT7. So to get NT8, which is in the string, I need to see if any of these can lead to NT8 through their productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, t23 must come from NT8. So the first part is NT8 leading to t23. But S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So how does NT3 and NT2 lead to NT8? I'm getting lost.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is such that each symbol must come from specific non-terminals. Let me list all the t's and see which NTs produce them:\n\n- t23: NT8 -> t23\n- t52: NT8 -> t52\n- t12: Looking through the rules, I don't see an NT directly producing t12. So maybe it's produced by a chain. For example, NT2 might produce t12 through some intermediate steps, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the possible derivations. Let me start from the start symbol S and see if I can generate the string.\n\nS can be NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let's pick one, say NT3 NT2.\n\nNT3 has two options: NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7.\n\nIf I take NT6 NT2, then NT6 might produce something. Let's see. NT6's rules include NT4 NT5, NT3 NT6, NT8 NT4, etc. Hmm, this is getting too deep.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not possible because certain rules don't align. For example, the string includes t14, t30, etc., which may come from NT0 or NT7.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. Let me list all the t's and see if each can be mapped to a non-terminal, then see if those non-terminals can be generated by the start symbol S.\n\nBut considering each t is a single terminal, the only way is to see if their production rules are present.\n\nSo:\n\nt23: NT8 -> t23\nt52: NT8 -> t52\nt12: Not directly present, but maybe derived from another NT.\nt14: NT0 -> t14? Wait, looking for nt's that can produce t14. I don't see a direct production of t14 in the rules. Hmmm.\n\nWait, no, the direct rules are for NT3, NT4, etc., but t14 isn't listed as a terminal in any rule. So maybe t14 isn't in the grammar. But wait, looking back, t14 isn't listed. Did I miss it?\n\nWait, the string is t23 t52 t12 t14 t30 t88 t91. So t14 is in the string. Did any of the NT rules produce t14? Looking back at the grammar, I don't see any NT's that produce t14 as a terminal. So that could be a problem because if t14 isn't in any NT's terminal productions, then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, no, the NTs might have rules that end with those t's. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any that end with t14. So that's a problem. Because if t14 isn't directly produced by any NT, then the string can't be generated. Unless it's generated through some intermediate steps.\n\nWait, but that would require that a production chain leads to t14, but in a CFG in Chomsky normal form, each production is a single non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal. So if I have an NT that can produce t14, it would have to be in the list.\n\nSince t14 isn't in any of the rules as a terminal, the string can't contain it, right? So that means the entire string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure because maybe t14 is derived from some other rule that I missed.

{"custom_id":"request-143","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's break this down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these grammars.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF means. CNF is a form where each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit that structure because each rule has two parts on the right side, and some are terminals like 't14', 't10', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t14 t10 t33 t37 t99 t23 t40 t41`. I notice that these are all terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S. \n\nStarting with the start symbol S, from the grammar I see that S has two productions: S -> NT3 NT9 and S -> NT3 NT2. Wait, actually, looking back, the first production is S -> NT3 NT9 and the second is S -> NT3 NT2. Oh, right, NT3 and NT9 are non-terminals, as is NT2.\n\nThe string starts with 't14' which is a terminal. I need to see which non-terminal can produce 't14'. Looking through the grammar, I find NT9 -> 't14' (from the list, line 145: NT9 -> 't14').\n\nSo, in the string, the first 't14' comes from NT9. Let's follow the derivation. The first part of the string is NT9, so that's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's consider NT9. The production for NT9 is: NT9 -> NT7 NT9 (line 112). Hmm, wait, actually, I think I mixed that up. Let me cross-check. Line 145 says NT9 -> 't14', but looking through the other rules, line 115 says NT9 has a production NT9 -> NT7 NT9 and some others. So I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, looking again, line 145 is indeed NT9 -> 't14'. But line 112 is NT9 -> NT3 NT7, while line 115 is NT9 -> NT7 NT9. So, that makes sense. So NT9 can produce t14 directly, or it can produce NT7 NT9.\n\nIn the string, the first 't14' is produced by NT9 -> 't14', so that's one way. But perhaps the string could also be derived via the other path. Let me see.\n\nWait, the string is `t14 t10 t33 t37 t99 t23 t40 t41`, so after 't14', it goes to 't10'. So after NT9 produces 't14', the next symbol must come from another production involving NT9 or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the next terminal is 't10', which is a terminal. Let's check which non-terminals produce 't10'. Looking through the grammar, line 92: NT7 -> 't10' (NT7 -> NT9 NT8 which can produce 't10'). Hmm, but NT7 is a non-terminal. So after 't14', we have 't10' which is NT7's production.\n\nWait, but in the first position, we have 't14' from NT9, then the next part is 't10', which must come from NT7 producing 't10'. But how does that fit with the structure of the grammar? Let me see how NT7 can be derived.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions: NT7 -> NT5 NT7 (line 77) or NT7 -> NT4 NT0 (line 75). Also, NT7 -> 't70' (looking at line 91, NT7 -> 't70'). Hmm, I might be getting confused.\n\nWait, line 91 says NT7 -> 't70', but in the string, we have 't10', which isn't 't70'. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me check the lines again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, line 77: NT7 -> NT6 NT5.\n\nLine 91: NT7 -> 't70'.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't14', the next is 't10', which matches NT7 -> 't10' (line 92 says NT7 -> NT9 NT8, but I don't see 't10' directly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the production rules.\n\nWait, let me check again. The NT7 -> 't10' is not directly listed, unless I'm missing it. Alternatively, looking through the rules, I see that NT11: NT7 -> NT6 NT5. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, line 72: NT8 -> NT4 NT2 and others, but that's probably not relevant here.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error earlier. Let me re-express this carefully.\n\nThe string is `t14 t10 t33 t37 t99 t23 t40 t41`. So, after 't14' (from NT9 -> 't14'), the next symbol is 't10'. So, 't10' is a terminal. So, in the grammar, which non-terminal can produce 't10'?\n\nLooking at all production rules, I see NT10 (if it exists) but perhaps it's elsewhere. Wait, in the list, I see NT5's rules, NT8's, etc., but let's check.\n\nWait, looking through lines, I notice NT7 has a production to NT5 NT4, but also, NT9 has multiple productions. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try mapping each terminal in the string step by step.\n\nStarting from S, which has two options: S->NT3 NT9 or S->NT3 NT2. Let me see both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's try S->NT3 NT9.\n\n- NT3: Looking at the rules, NT3 can produce NT6 NT2 (line 30: NT3 -> NT6 NT2) or maybe others? Wait, line 30 shows NT3 -> NT6 NT2.\n\nWait, no, looking through the list, I see NT3's productions:\n\nLine 30: NT3 -> NT6 NT2.\n\nLine 33: NT6 -> NT3 NT10 (not sure, maybe). Line 80: NT3 -> NT0 NT7.\n\nLine 90: NT3 -> NT90 NT...\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all the rules for NT3.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2 (line 30)\n\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7 (line 80)\n\n- NT3 -> NT90 NT... Hmm, perhaps I need a better approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should create a list of all non-terminals and their productions. But that might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree for the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm might help, but since it's a bit time-consuming, maybe I can do it step by step.\n\nWait, the string length is 8 symbols, so each symbol is a terminal. Now, in the grammar, each production produces two non-terminals or a terminal, so each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols or replaces one with two.\n\nWait, no, the CYK approach builds a table where each cell represents the possible non-terminals that can derive a substring.\n\nBut perhaps instead, let me try to find a path through the grammar that can produce this string.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in CNF produces two symbols, the number of symbols in the string must be equal to the number of production steps taken, but the string length can vary.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Each production replaces one symbol with two, so starting from one symbol (S), each step increases the count by one. So, to reach a string of 8 terminals, you need 7 steps. That's manageable.\n\nBut given the time, maybe a better strategy is to follow the possible derivations.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't14'. From the grammar, 't14' is produced by NT9 -> 't14' (line 145).\n\nSo, S can produce NT9 NTsomething. Wait, but S->NT3 NT9. So, in this case, the string starts with NT3 and NT9.\n\nWait, but in the first step, S is a single non-terminal, but in the first production S->NT3 NT9, it's replaced by NT3 NT9, so the string is two symbols: the first is NT3, the second is NT9. But in our case, the string is 8 terminals, so"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, the string is \"t19 t60 t88 t91 t60 t42 t8 t60\". \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule produces two non-terminals. But looking at some of the rules here, some are actually terminals. For example, NT9 -> 't19' is a terminal production. That's good because the string consists of these terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using a top-down approach like the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent parser. Since the grammar is somewhat complex with many non-terminals, maybe a recursive descent approach would be manageable if I break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which is defined as two NT3 and NT9, so S -> NT3 NT9. That would produce something like (NT3)(NT9). Each of those can be further expanded.\n\nI should start by seeing if I can match the entire string by expanding S and then looking through the productions.\n\nLet me list all the terminal productions to see what other terminals are possible. Each rule that ends with -> 'tX' gives possible X values. From the given grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt13, t25, t30, t33, t34, t37, t40, t42, t52, t60, t65, t70, t75, t8, t90, t88, t91, t99, t22, t14.\n\nWait, the string has t19, which isn't in my initial list. That's a problem. Let me check the rules again. Hmm, I didn't see an NT production that ends with 't19'. Maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking again at the rules:\n\nI see NT1 -> 't40', NT7 -> 't40', NT9 -> 't60', NT4 -> 't88', NT2 -> 't37', etc. But where is 't19'? Oh, wait, I see some longer productions, but each ends with a specific terminal. I don't see 't19' as a terminal in any rule. So that's a red flag. If the string contains 't19', but there's no production that directly generates 't19', then it's impossible for the grammar to generate this string. Because in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals except for the terminals, which are single terminals.\n\nSo, if 't19' isn't a terminal, then the grammar can't produce it. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each rule again to be thorough. Scanning through all the NT productions:\n\n- NT9 -> 't19' (there is one)\n- looking at other NT9 rules: NT9 -> 't75', etc., but not 't19'.\n\nSo, the only production that produces 't19' is NT9 -> 't19'. Therefore, 't19' must be a terminal generated by NT9.\n\nIn the string, the second token is 't60', which needs to come from NT6 or NT9 since NT6 -> 't34' or 't8' and NT9 has 't60' as a terminal. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the string is 't19 t60 t88 t91 t60 t42 t8 t60'. So, each token is a separate terminal, so the string is eight terminals long.\n\nSo the first token is 't19', which must come from NT9 -> 't19'. Then, the next is 't60', which must come from either NT9 or NT3. Looking at NT3's productions, does any rule produce 't60'? NT3 has a production NT3 -> NT6 NT2, which is two non-terminals. Then NT2 might expand into something else.\n\nAlternatively, NT3 -> 't30' is a terminal. So, 't30' comes from NT3, but 't60' is not directly from NT3. So how does 't60' come into play?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the NT9 and the non-terminal. So, the first step is to check if each token in the string is produced by any NT rule.\n\n- 't19' is directly produced by NT9 -> 't19', so that's fine.\n- Next is 't60', which must come from NT9 because NT3's only terminal is 't30' (NT3 -> 't30'). Looking at NT9 productions, I see NT9 -> 't60', so that's a valid production. So 't60' comes from NT9.\n- Next is 't88', which is directly produced by NT4 -> 't88', so that's good.\n- Next is 't91', which comes from NT7 -> 't91'.\n- Then 't60' again from NT9.\n- Then 't42', which comes from NT8 -> 't42'.\n- Then 't8', which comes from NT0 -> 't8' or NT7 -> 't8'.\n- Finally, 't60' again from NT9.\n\nWait, but this approach doesn't take into account the structure of the grammar in terms of the productions. Because when S produces NT3 NT9, it's a combination that needs to expand into the string step by step.\n\nPerhaps the right way to approach this is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Let me try to do that.\n\nThe string to parse is: t19, t60, t88, t91, t60, t42, t8, t60.\n\nStarting with S -> NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, the first part is NT3 and the second is NT9.\n\nNow, let's see what each of these can generate.\n\nFor NT3:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT3 can expand into NT6 NT2 or 't30'.\n\nBut the first token is 't19', which comes from NT9, not NT3. So, perhaps after expanding S, the first rule is NT3 producing 't30', but that's not our case. Since the string starts with 't19', which is a production from NT9, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, no. The S rule is S -> NT3 NT9. So when expanding S, the first non-terminal is NT3, and the second is NT9.\n\nSo, the entire string must be derived from (NT3 (\u2192 ...)) followed by (NT9 (\u2192 ...)).\n\nTherefore, the string must be split into two parts: the first part derived from NT3 and the second from NT9.\n\nBut wait, that's not the case. Each of the two symbols NT3 and NT9 can produce sequences. So the entire string is a combination of what NT3 produces and what NT9 produces.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of two parts: the first part from NT3 and the second from NT9.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Each of the two symbols in S is a non-terminal, which can expand into sequences. So the entire string is a concatenation of the two sequences generated by NT3 and NT9.\n\nSo to parse the entire string, we need to split it into two parts: the first part from NT3 and the second from NT9.\n\nBut the given string is eight tokens long, so the first part could vary in length. For example, if NT3 generates a shorter part, then NT9 needs to generate the remaining part.\n\nBut maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to build the parse tree starting from S, and see if we can match the string.\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. S -> NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, the string must be a concatenation of NT3 derivation and NT9 derivation.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two parts: Part1 (from NT3) and Part2 (from NT9).\n\nWhat's the minimal split.\n\nFor example, let's say Part1 is the first k tokens, and Part2 is the remaining 8 -k tokens.\n\nBut to try all possible splits might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps we can see if there's a way that the entire string can be generated by this structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to see if each individual token in the string can be mapped to the NT productions and see if the structure fits.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to write down the entire string as tokens: t19, t60, t88, t91, t60, t42, t8, t60.\n\nLet me see each token:\n\n- t19: must come from NT9 -> 't19'\n\n- t60: must come from NT9 -> 't60'\n\n- t88: must come from NT4 -> 't88'\n\n- t91: must come from NT7 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar seems extensive, with many non-terminals (S, S, NT0, NT1, NT2, etc.), each producing a combination of other non-terminals or terminals. Some of the non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols, like NT9 \u2192 't75' or NT8 \u2192 't37'. \n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t34, t60, t70, t30, t14, t88, t22, t42, t10. I need to see if this string can be derived by the grammar step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string should match the structure of the derivation. The start symbol is S, which in CNF can only produce two non-terminals. So, the first step would be S \u2192 NT3 NT9, producing a string of two non-terminals. But since the given string has nine tokens, I need to see how many expansions are happening.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT3 NT9. So the initial expansion would produce two non-terminals. Each of these can further expand into other non-terminals until we get to terminals. So the number of tokens should correspond to a certain depth of expansion. For nine tokens, the derivation depth would need to be such that each step adds tokens accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production of S adds two symbols, so starting from S, we have two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can further expand. It's a bit complicated, maybe I should map the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t34. Looking at the grammar, t34 is a terminal. So let's trace which non-terminals produce t34.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT6 \u2192 't8' and NT0 \u2192 't13', etc. But wait, in the grammar, each non-terminal either splits into two non-terminals or a single terminal. So to get a terminal like t34, I need to find a non-terminal that directly produces t34.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce t34. Wait, looking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 't8' and other options. Not t34. Let me check all productions:\n\nWait, let me go through the productions to see which non-terminals produce t34.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT1 \u2192 't25', 't40', 't75', 't70', 't10', 't19', 't12'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', 't37', 't8' (twice), 't60', etc. Yes, looking at the productions for NT2, I see NT2 \u2192 't33', 't60', 't70', 't88', 't37', 't65', 't8', etc. So NT2 can produce 't60'. But I'm looking for t34.\n\nLet me check all NT entries for a rule that produces t34.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t34. All the terminals listed are things like t30, t34, t37, etc. Wait, let me look again.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't52', NT0 \u2192 't13', NT6 \u2192 't34'? Wait, no, looking at NT6: I see NT6 \u2192 't90', NT3 \u2192 't30', NT8 \u2192 't23', etc. Wait, no, actually, wait, the production for NT6 includes:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't90', 't8', 't34', etc? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided productions, I see:\n\nWait, specifically, I see NT6 \u2192 't34' once in the list. Let me see: the line says NT6 \u2192 't34':\n\nWait, no, looking through the user's grammar, it's listed as:\n\nLooking at the grammar, one of the NT6 productions is NT6 \u2192 't34'. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, under NT6, the productions are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't8', 't65', 't92', 't0'... Wait, no, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT6 -> NT3 NT6\nNT6 -> NT4 NT5\nNT6 -> 't34'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT6 -> 't65'\nNT6 -> 't92'\nNT6 -> 't0'\"\n\nWait, no, I think I may have misread. Let me look again.\n\nThe user provided a long list of productions. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT3 NT6\nNT6 -> NT4 NT5\nNT6 -> 't34'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT6 -> 't65'\nNT6 -> 't92'\nNT6 -> 't0'\n\nYes, so NT6 directly produces t34. So t34 must come from NT6, specifically the rule NT6 \u2192 't34'.\n\nSimilarly, the next token in the string is t60. Let's see what NT produces t60. Looking through the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that produces t60. Let's check NT2: Looking at the productions for NT2:\n\nNT2 -> 't33', 't60', 't70', 't88', 't37', 't65', 't8', 't99', etc. So NT2 can produce t60 via NT2 \u2192 't60'.\n\nThe third token is t70, which can be produced by NT2 as well, via NT2 \u2192 't70'.\n\nFourth token is t30. Looking for a non-terminal that produces t30. Checking, for example, NT3: NT3 \u2192 't30' is a production, so NT3 can produce t30.\n\nFifth is t14. Let's see. Looking for a non-terminal that can directly produce t14. Scanning the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT with t14 as a terminal. Wait, no, checking through the list: For example, NT9 \u2192 't75', etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, under NT9, there are several rules. Let me check if NT9 can produce t14. Looking through, I don't see t14 as a terminal in the grammar. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all terminals in the grammar first. The grammar produces various terminals, such as:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, the terminals are:\n\nt34, t60, t70, t30, t14, t88, t22, t42, t10.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nFor example, NT9 has:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't75', 't91', etc.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't52', 't37', etc.\n\nNT2 \u2192 't60', etc.\n\nNT6 \u2192 't34', 't8', etc.\n\nWait, does any NT produce 't14'?

Let me go through all production rules again more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT9 has several rules, but none directly produce t14.\n\nNT1 has NT1 \u2192 t40, t75, t70, t12, t10.\n\nWait, t10 is one of the options, but we have t14 as a terminal. Hmm.\n\nThen, perhaps there is a non-terminal that produces t14 indirectly. For example, maybe a deeper expansion. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier, and t14 is somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking again at the token sequence: t34 t60 t70 t30 t14 t88 t22 t42 t10.\n\nSo at position 5, we have t14, which is the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-167","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a specific form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe given string to evaluate is `t25 t70 t65 t30 t88 t40 t75 t33 t34`. I know that in CNF, each production has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So, the grammar allows for two-step predictions as we parse the string.\n\nFirst, I should perhaps look at the start symbol, which seems to be S. The grammar has two initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\nS \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nWait, actually, the first rule is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then there are others, but the initial ones have S producing combinations of NT3 and other N terminals. Wait, no, looking again, the first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then it proceeds. Wait no, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then S also goes to several other combinations like NT3 NT2, but in the grammar as presented, it's possible that S can produce other combinations, so the string might get generated via multiple paths.\n\nBut let me check: the string provided is a series of terminals. The first symbol is 't25', which I see in the grammar. Looking back, 't25' is a terminal produced by NT1, as per one of the rules:\n\nNT1 -> 't25'\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 -> 't25'\n\nSimilarly, another NT is NT7, which produces 't40', NT0 -> 't13', and so on.\n\nSo the string is t25 t70 t65 t30 t88 t40 t75 t33 t34.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. Starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string has 9 symbols. So the derivation should result in a sequence of 9 terminals. Since each production can only generate one symbol or two non-terminals, but in this case, the productions are all right- and left-heavy, I think we need to see if the number of steps matches.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the number of symbols is 9. The start symbol S could generate two non-terminals, which would then each generate more symbols. Each application reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So for a string of n terminals, the depth of the parse tree would be n-1.\n\nBut since this is a grammar, we can model the string as being generated through a series of productions. So starting with S, which produces two non-terminals, and each of those non-terminals needs to be expanded, and so on, until we reach the terminal string.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe it's better to see if the string can be derived by starting from S and expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the string length is m, so the number of productions needed would be m-1. So in this case, 9 terminals would require 8 productions. But considering that each production can only expand one non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as a top-down parsing using the grammar. But since I'm not very familiar with parsing algorithms for CNF grammars, maybe I can try to find a possible derivation.\n\nLooking for a path starting with S.\n\nLooking at S's initial productions:\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nWait, actually, from the initial grammar provided, the first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, followed by another S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So the possible first steps are to generate either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nLet me see the components of the string. The string starts with 't25', which is derived from NT1. But looking at the NT1 productions, it's only 't25'. So 't25' is a single terminal symbol, meaning that the initial production path must reach NT1 and produce 't25'.\n\nWait, but S can't directly produce NT1. Looking back, in the grammar, the NT rules include NT1, which produces 't25'.\n\nSo perhaps in the derivation, one of the branches would have to go through NT1. Let me see:\n\nOption 1: Let's say the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nThen, NT3 and NT9 would need to be expanded. Let me see what NT3 can produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3 has several productions, such as:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n... and others, including eventually NT3 \u2192 't30'\n\nWait, so in the string, the first symbol is 't25'. So that would have to come from NT1. So perhaps the path would have to go through NT1, which is 't25'.\n\nSo looking at the first step S \u2192 NT3 NT9: Let's suppose that in the first expansion, one of NT3 or NT9 leads to NT1.\n\nLooking at the NT9 rules, I see NT9 can produce 't75' directly, among other options, but also has a rule: NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9, which seems recursive. Similarly, NT7 can produce 't40' among others.\n\nBut the string starts with 't25', which is NT1, so perhaps one of the NT3 or NT9 must be NT1, but in the grammar, NT1 is only defined as producing 't25'. So NT1 has no other productions. Therefore, the only way to get 't25' is from NT1 \u2192 't25'.\n\nSo for 't25' to be the first symbol, the first step must reach NT1, which only produces 't25'. So how can that happen?\n\nLooking at S's initial production: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So that would expand S into NT3 and NT9. So to get 't25' from NT1, perhaps one path is to have NT3 eventually derive 't25' and the other path derive the rest.\n\nBut let's see. Let's suppose that in the first step, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then, in the next step, one of these non-terminals (NT3 or NT9) must be expanded into 't25'.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem possible because without any NT3 \u2192 NT1 rule. Unless somewhere down the line, NT3 or NT9 can derive NT1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Let me check:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT3 NT2, then NT3 can, in future steps, generate 't25' if it can reach NT1. So maybe:\n\nFirst step: S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSecond step: NT3 \u2192 't25' and NT2 remains to be processed.\n\nWait, but NT3 can only produce 't25' via NT1, if it can reach NT1. But in the grammar, NT3 doesn't directly produce NT1; perhaps through some other path.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions, I see NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Then NT6 can produce NT3 NT6, which seems recursive. Hmm, that might be a loop.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have 't30' as the third symbol. Let me look at how to get 't30'. Looking at the grammar, NT3 can produce 't30' directly via NT3 \u2192 't30'. So if in some path, NT3 can directly reach 't30'.\n\nWait, so let's suppose:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n2. NT3 \u2192 't30' (so the first symbol is 't30')\n3. NT2 \u2192 't70'\n\nBut wait, the first symbol in the string is 't25', not 't30'. So that's a problem. So maybe the initial expansion has to be the other way around.\n\nWait, maybe S \u2192 NT3 NT9 is the first step. Then, let's see how NT3 and NT9 can be expanded.\n\nNT3 can produce 't30', 't65', 't33', etc. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n... and then 't30'.\n\nSo perhaps, NT3 could expand to 't30'. Then, the second part would be NT9, which could expand to 't70' via NT9 \u2192 't70'?\n\nWait, yes, in the grammar, NT9 has a production NT9 \u2192 't70'. So that would give 't30' followed by 't70', which is the first two symbols: 't25' is the first, so that doesn't fit.

{"custom_id":"request-186","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t42 t42 t60 t19 t41 t90 t75 t75 t22 t8`. \n\nFirst, let's recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and the start symbol never appears on the right-hand side. Additionally, the start symbol can generate strings of terminals only when necessary. The advantage of CNF is that it simplifies the structure of the grammar, making it easier to analyze and often used in parsers.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that all the non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) eventually resolve into terminal symbols (like 't42', 't40', etc.). This suggests that each non-terminal can produce a single terminal or a pair of terminals. The start symbol S has two productions: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So, to generate the string, we'll probably need to use the S rule at the top level.\n\nNow, looking at the string: it's a sequence of t's followed by numbers, all separated by spaces. Let's count them: there are 10 tokens. That means the string has 10 segments. In the grammar, each rule might produce two non-terminals, so we'd need to see if this string can be broken down into a sequence of 5 rules (since each rule adds two non-terminals, starting from S which is two, so 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 8 \u2192 16, but that might not be directly applicable here).\n\nBut more importantly, let's look at the productions for each non-terminal that result in 't' terms.\n\nLooking through the grammar, many non-terminals like NT2, NT3, NT4, etc., have productions that include 't' as their terminal symbols. For example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t33\n- NT3 \u2192 t30\n- NT4 \u2192 t88, t8\n- NT5 \u2192 t37\n- NT6 \u2192 t34, t8\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t52, t23, etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 t75, t60, etc.\n\nOur string includes t42, t60, t19, etc. I need to check if these 't' symbols are produced by any of the non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string and see where they might come from:\n\n- t42: Check which NT produces t42. Looking through the grammar, I spot:\n  - NT2 \u2192 t33\n  - NT4 \u2192 t88 (which doesn't help), t8 (not our case)\n  - NT5 \u2192 t37\n  - NT7 \u2192 t40\n  - NT9 \u2192 t75, t60 (so t60 is possible)\n  - NT8 \u2192 t52, t23, etc.\n  Hmm, t42 doesn't appear directly. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each non-terminal again.\n\nWait, another look: There's NT8 \u2192 t37, but that doesn't help. Wait, no, perhaps I overlooked NT2's production for t42. Wait, looking back: the grammar rules for non-terminals that produce 't42' aren't directly given. That's a problem. Let me list all non-terminals and their terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, the terminals are only single characters like t42, t40, t25, etc. So, each production is either to terminals or other non-terminals. \n\nSo, for example, NT2 has a rule NT2 \u2192 t33. So t33 is directly produced by NT2. Similarly, NT4 has NT4 \u2192 t88, t8. NT9 has NT9 \u2192 t75, t60, etc.\n\nWait, so does any non-terminal produce t42, t60, t19, etc.? Let's check.\n\nLooking at NT7: NT7 \u2192 t40 (from an earlier rule, but no t42). NT2's rules: NT2 \u2192 t33, and then some rules with other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each rule with a terminal:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t30, so t30 is produced by NT3.\n\nNT4 \u2192 t88, t8.\n\nNT5 \u2192 t37.\n\nNT6 \u2192 t34, t8.\n\nNT0 \u2192 t13.\n\nNT1 \u2192 t25.\n\nNT7 \u2192 t40.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t52, t23, t65, t37, t41, t90, t75, t70, t22, t68, t10, t84, t89, t38, t79, t67.\n\nWait, looking at NT8's rules, does it produce t42? I don't see any rule for NT8 that directly includes t42. Same with NT6: NT6 \u2192 t34, t8, etc.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I've missed something. Let me go through each non-terminal rule:\n\n- NT0: t13, so t13 is possible.\n- NT1: t25.\n- NT2: t33, and other rules with non-terminals.\n- NT3: t30.\n- NT4: t88, t8.\n- NT5: t37.\n- NT6: t34, t8.\n- NT7: t40.\n- NT8: t52, t23, t65, t37, t41, t90, t75, t70, t22, t68, t10, t84, t89, t38, t79, t67.\nWait, I don't see t42 anywhere.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake? The string has t42 twice. So, maybe I'm supposed to see if t42 can be produced by some non-terminal. Looking at NT2's rules: NT2 \u2192 t33. Other NT2 rules are with non-terminals, so unless another NT2's rules can produce t42, which they don't, then perhaps t42 is produced by a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing NT8's rules. Let me check again. Under NT8, I see NT8 \u2192 t37 but not t42. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the initial rules provided, I might have missed somewhere. Let me recheck the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT8: There's a rule NT8 \u2192 t37. But I'm looking at the string, which has t42. So, unless one of the non-terminals for NT2's rules can produce t42, which they don't directly seem to.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list of production rules. Let me look for any non-terminals that might produce 't42'. \n\nWait, looking through the non-terminals, I don't see any that produce t42. The only 't's produced are specific numbers like t40, t52, t23, etc. So, if the string includes t42 twice, but no production for t42 exists, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar because t42 isn't produced at all.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I overlooked a rule in the grammar. Let me go through each rule again to make sure.\n\nThe non-terminals:\n\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\nLooking at the productions for NT3 and NT2.\n\nNT3's rules are:\n- NT3 \u2192 t30\n- NT3 \u2192 t62 (Wait, no: looking at NT3's rules, I don't see t30 and t62. Wait, in the grammar:\n\nNT3 has:\nNT3 \u2192 t62, but wait, no, let's check.\n\nWait, looking again, for NT3:\n- NT3 \u2192 t62. No, it's actually under the initial part, perhaps I misread. Let me check. From the initial part:\n\n\"NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n\nNT3 -> NT9 NT5\"\n\nWait no, that's not right. Looking back, the main block lists the rules, so I'll go through each line.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT3 rules to check:\n\nLooking through the original grammar rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT9 NT5\nDoes that include t30? No, t30 is from another NT3.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial rules provided by the user, the lines under NT3 are:\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\n\nNT3 -> NT9 NT5\n\nWait, so no production for t3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-188","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the string \"t12 t23 t60 t65 t23 t65 t13 t34 t75 t90\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This means the grammar doesn't have rules like longer left-hand sides or any special cases.\n\nThe provided grammar looks like it's in CNF, mostly having two productions on the left except for some that lead to terminals. Each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right. So, I can proceed under this assumption.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t12 t23 t60 t65 t23 t65 t13 t34 t75 t90. Each of these looks like separate tokens, probably separated by spaces, so the string has 10 tokens.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree for any string will be a binary tree where each node has exactly two children, corresponding to the two non-terminals in each CNF production. This suggests that the length of the string must match the way the grammar builds it up, especially considering start symbol S which likely leads to the entire string after several expansions.\n\nWait, let me think: The start symbol is S, and initially, S is split into two non-terminals since S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Then each of those non-terminals will expand based on their own productions. So each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by one, starting from S.\n\nBut for a string of length n, the number of steps needed to derive it would be n-1. Hmm, for n=1, it would be trivial, but here we have 10 tokens, so the derivation would have 9 steps. But let me make sure that the grammar can indeed produce strings of length 10.\n\nEach production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting from S, each expansion doubles the number of symbols or adds one (if a terminal is added). But considering all possible productions, the number of symbols can grow exponentially, but for a specific string, I need to see if there's a way to break it down recursively.\n\nBut maybe instead of building the entire derivation tree, I can use a parsing approach or look for possible left or rightmost derivations that could produce the string. Alternatively, I can check if each token in the string is accounted for by the productions.\n\nLet's list the tokens: t12, t23, t60, t65, t23, t65, t13, t34, t75, t90.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each terminal is defined on the right side of some production rule. So I can map each token to its possible non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t12: Looking at the productions, I see NT9 \u2192 t75, and other rules, but no NT producing t12 directly. Wait, let me check all productions for terminals.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions, with several rules leading to terminals like 't12', 't23', etc. So each 't' like t12 is a terminal directly produced by a non-terminal NT...\n\nSo, for t12, I need to see if there's a rule where NT... \u2192 t12. Looking through the list, I see NT1 \u2192 t40, NT2 \u2192 t33, NT7 \u2192 t40, NT5 \u2192 t37, NT9 \u2192 t75, NT3 \u2192 t30, NT8 \u2192 t37, etc. Wait, I don't see any rule that produces t12 directly. Hmm, that's a problem. So if t12 is a terminal, then it's only directly produced by a non-terminal NT12, but in the grammar, such NT12 doesn't exist. All non-terminals are defined as NT followed by two digits, like NT0, NT1, etc.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9, etc., and the NTs are listed as NT0, NT1, NT2, up to NT99? Wait, wait no, the provided grammar doesn't show numbers beyond three digits, but it's written in a long list.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, all non-terminals are of the form NT followed by some digits, but when they produce terminals, the tokens like t12, t23 are the terminals. So for each terminal token, it must be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking back, for example, NT9 \u2192 t75 is present, but t12 is missing. If t12 isn't produced by any NT, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Because in CNF, all terminals must be directly produced by non-terminals.\n\nWait, that's a point. If the string contains a terminal 't12', but there's no production rule that directly produces 't12' (i.e., NTx \u2192 t12 for some x), then the string can't be generated by the grammar. So let me check if any of the NTs produce t12.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, the NTs and their productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t30\n- NT8 \u2192 t37\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n- NT9 \u2192 t75, t65\n- NT2 \u2192 t33, etc.\n\nNo, I don't see any NT that produces 't12'. So the token 't12' isn't present as a terminal in any production rule of the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, in the provided grammar, there are several NTs that end up producing terminal symbols. For example, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t75, t65 etc.\n\nBut I don't see any rule where NT... \u2192 t12. So 't12' isn't a terminal in the grammar, hence the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me look through the productions again to see if any NT produces 't12':\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3 ... etc.\n- NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8, etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7, etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0, etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6, etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2, etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4, etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8, etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, etc.\n\nWait, actually, the right-hand sides are combinations of NTs. The only single-terminal productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9, etc. No terminals there except when NTs produce terminals.\n\nWait, the actual productions that produce terminals are:\n\nLooking for 'a' in 'NTx \u2192 a', etc.:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t75\n- NT8 \u2192 t52\n- NT0 \u2192 t13\n- NT6 \u2192 t8\n- NT1 \u2192 t40\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n- etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, are there any rules like NTx \u2192 t12? I don't see any. So 't12' is not a terminal generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string contains 't12', which is not a terminal that appears in any production rule. Hence, it's impossible for the grammar to generate this string.\n\nAlternatively, if 't12' is a non-terminal, but 't12' is written in the string, that's a problem because in the grammar, all terminals are specific, and 't12' is not a terminal here.\n\nWait, but is 't12' a terminal or a non-terminal? Because in the grammar, it's written as 't12' being a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-208","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t8 t25 t13 t91 t90 t13 t99 t41 t60 t34 t12`. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF means. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The language generated by such grammars can be parsed by a pushdown automaton. Now, the given grammar has rules that all fit this pattern, so that's good.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: `t8, t25, t13, t91, t90, t13, t99, t41, t60, t34, t12`. The task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by examining the start symbol S. From the grammar, the first rule is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So S must produce a string starting with NT3 and NT9. Let me check the string. The first two tokens are t8 and t25. I need to see if NT3 can produce t8 and NT9 can produce t25.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3: \n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- And so on, with some of these terminals mapping to specific t's like t30, t65, etc.\n\nWait, so NT3 is an intermediate that can be broken down further. Let me try to trace how NT3 could produce t8.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3: There's NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and NT6 can produce NT4 NT5. NT4 can be NT7 NT0, and NT7 can be NT5 NT4, and NT5 can be NT3 NT6. This seems like it might go into a loop. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT3's productions more carefully: Oh, I see that NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, with NT8 \u2192 t37 and NT4 \u2192 t88. Wait, no, in the terminal substitutions, some have t's. For example, NT8 is sometimes t37, NT4 is t88, but I need to reconstruct how NT3 can eventually lead to t8.\n\nWait, no. Hold on, in the given string, the first token is t8. So the first part of S is NT3, which should produce t8. Let me check the productions for NT3 that result in terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, none of the immediate productions for NT3 directly produce a terminal. Instead, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, then NT6 can go to NT4 NT5, etc. But in the given string, the first two tokens are t8 and t25. So perhaps S \u2192 NT3 NT9 leads to NT3 producing t8 and NT9 producing t25? But wait, do any of NT3's productions directly produce t8?\n\nLooking at the list of NT3 productions, none of them directly have t8 except perhaps through the terminal expansions, but in the grammar provided, many of the higher NTs are further expanded with other NTs until they hit terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, NT6\u2192 NT8 NT4, NT8\u2192 can go to a terminal like t37 or t41, etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t8. So maybe NT3 \u2192 some path that results in t8. Let me see.\n\nLooking deeper into the productions for NT3:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, etc.\n\nHmm, let's try to see how NT3 can produce t8. Maybe through NT8? Wait, NT3 can't directly produce a terminal, but through NT6. Let me think step by step.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Let's see what NT3 can do.\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\nThen, NT6 can be NT4 NT5. NT4 can be NT7 NT0. NT7 can be NT5 NT4. NT5 can be NT3 NT6. This seems like a loop. Alternatively, maybe a different path.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to build the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t8 t25 t13 t91 t90 t13 t99 t41 t60 t34 t12.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nFrom the string, T1 is t8, so perhaps NT3 produces t8, and NT9 produces t25.\n\nBut looking at NT9's productions: The direct productions for NT9 are, for example, `NT9 -> NT7 NT9`, `NT9 -> NT6 NT1`, etc., and also directly `NT9 -> t75`, `NT9 -> t60`, `NT9 -> t22`, etc. So one of the direct terminals for NT9 is t25. So yes, NT9 can produce t25. So that part is fine.\n\nNow, does NT9 have other rules that lead to multiple steps? But in the string, after t8 comes t25, so we can directly assign NT9 to t25 after NT3. But wait, NT9 can produce t25 if there's a rule that leads directly to t25. Looking at the given grammar, I don't see a direct rule where NT9 \u2192 t25, but it has direct rules to t75, t60, etc. So, unless one of those terminals is t25, which it's not. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back: The string starts with t8 t25. So NT3 must produce t8, and NT9 must produce t25. But in the grammar, does NT9 have a rule that results in t25? Or does it produce another non-terminal that can result in t25?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9's productions include NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1, which could then lead to more NTs. So perhaps NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1 \u2192 [terminals]. Let me see if any of those paths lead to t25.\n\nBut before that, let's make sure NT3 can produce t8. Let's see: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Now, NT6 can be NT8 NT4, and NT8 can be t37 or t41 or other terminals, but t8 is one of the terminals.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT8 has a production NT8 \u2192 t8. Looking at the provided rules, yes, there's a line: `NT8 -> 't8'`. So if NT8 can directly produce t8, then NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT4, and maybe NT4 can be t88, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, I think I need to look more carefully. Each production in the grammar either produces another non-terminal or a terminal. So for NT3, it's N terminals \u2192 N or T.\n\nLet me try to model the derivation.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nWe need to start with NT3 and NT9. The first part, NT3, should derive t8, and then NT9 should derive t25.\n\nNow, looking at NT3's production:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nThen, we need to see how NT6 and NT2 can be used.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4.\n\nIf NT8 can produce t8, which it can (NT8 \u2192 't8'), then NT6 \u2192 t8 NT4. Then NT4 can be, for example, NT7 NT0. Let's see if that can produce something.\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4.\n\nHmm, that's a loop. Wait, but maybe NT0 can produce something that eventually leads to t25.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on NT9. NT9 needs to produce t25. Does NT9 have a production that can reach t25? Looking at the provided rules, NT9's productions go to other NTs, but none of those directly lead to t25. Only terminals for NT9 are t60, t75, t59, etc. So unless there's a path from one of these NTs that leads to t25.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, perhaps NT5 can produce t25. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT5's productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6\n- NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5\n\nNone of these are terminals, but looking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-201","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t52 t75 t99 t12 t60 t88 t52 t91 t12 t23 t75`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) implies. CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. This structure simplifies parsing because each production rule doesn't have more than two symbols on the right side, and any symbol can be either a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that most productions are of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ or NTX -> a terminal. So, it seems to adhere to CNF.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: `t52 t75 t99 t12 t60 t88 t52 t91 t12 t23 t75`. My task is to check if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which in the given grammar can produce either NT3 NT9 or NT2 NT3 (wait, no, looking again, the productions from S are S -> NT3 NT9 and S -> NT3 NT2. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the first two lines:\n\n1. S -> NT3 NT9\n2. S -> NT3 NT2\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, actually, those are two separate production rules. So S can go to NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because both start with NT3.\n\nWait, but looking again, the grammar as presented has multiple lines for S, so perhaps I made a misread. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, the first two lines are:\nS -> NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nSo, S has two production rules, both starting with NT3. The first one leads to NT3 and NT9, while the second leads to NT3 and NT2. So, S can go to either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, that seems redundant because both start with NT3. Maybe I need to consider whether they are alternatives.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's correct. So, in the initial step, S can produce either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2, which would give two different paths. So, the first step would produce a pair of non-terminals, then each of those would be further expanded.\n\nBut wait, looking at the production rules, most non-terminals are further expanded into other non-terminals or terminals. So, each of these NTx productions leads to other NTy NTz, except where a terminal is used, which would end the chain for that path.\n\nBut in the given string, the endpoints are all terminals like t52, t75, etc. So the string is a sequence of terminals, which must be generated by applying the productions step by step, replacing non-terminals with terminals or other non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nSo, the strategy would be to see if we can find a derivation path from S down to the given string by expanding non-terminals into their RHS, eventually matching the string.\n\nBut since the string is given, a better approach might be to see if we can break it down into smaller parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\nt52 t75 t99 t12 t60 t88 t52 t91 t12 t23 t75\n\nSince this is a flat list of terminals, we can split them into a sequence. Let's write them as tokens: [t52, t75, t99, t12, t60, t88, t52, t91, t12, t23, t75]\n\nNow, with the grammar being in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). Since the end string is just terminals, each production must eventually expand into a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the structure of the string may correspond to a binary tree of productions.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let's see which part of the string matches which.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if it can be split into two parts, considering that S produces NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So maybe the first part is NT3 and the second part is NT9 or NT2.\n\nWait, but NT3 and NT9 are two non-terminals, each of which can produce a sequence of terminals. Alternatively, NT9 is a terminal string? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, some of the productions are NT9 -> 't75' and NT9 -> 't60', etc. So NT9 can produce terminals like t75, t60, t22, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 -> 't30' etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with NT3 and continues with NT9, or NT2.\n\nLet's explore both options.\n\nFirst possibility: S produces NT3 NT9. Then we'd have NT3 T1 NT9, where T1 is the production of NT3 as a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the first step, S would expand to NT3 NT9, so that gives us tokens starting with NT3 and ending with NT9.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t52, which is a terminal, so it's produced by some NTx production.\n\nWait, but S can't produce terminal directly; it produces NT3 and NT9 or NT2. So the first step would produce NT3 and NT9 (or NT2), each of which can then produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to split the string into a binary tree, considering each step as a production.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to see which non-terminals can produce the first token, t52.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NT productions produce t52? I'll go through the list:\n\n- NT8 -> 't52' [Found at the end of the grammar]\n- NT6 -> 't8' etc., but that's for another non-terminal.\n\nSo, NT8 can produce 't52'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t75 in the grammar: NT9 -> 't75' and NT5 -> 't91', etc., but t75 is produced by NT9.\n\nSo, in the string, t52 is first, which could be produced by NT8, as NT8 -> 't52'.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part is NT8 producing 't52'.\n\nNow, the first step could be S -> NT3 NT9, then NT9 might produce 't75', but let's see.\n\nWait, no, if S is S->NT3 NT9, then NT3 would produce something, and NT9 would produce something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S->NT3 NT2, and then NT3 produces something, NT2 produces something.\n\nBut let's try to think recursively. Let me attempt a possible tree.\n\nLet's start with the entire string as the root.\n\nt52 t75 t99 t12 t60 t88 t52 t91 t12 t23 t75\n\nWe can think of this as a sequence of products. Let's see if it can be split into two parts, each corresponding to a production from S's first rule (S->NT3 NT9) or the second (S-> NT3 NT2).\n\nBut first, let's consider the overall length of the string. The string has 11 tokens. That's an odd number, so each step would split into two, resulting in a binary tree. But 11 tokens could result from, say, 4 steps:\n\n- Step 1: 1 non-terminal (S) splits into 2 non-terminals.\n- Step 2: Each of those 2 could split into 2, making 4.\n- Step 3: 8.\n- Step 4: 16, but the string is 11, which is less.\nAlternatively, perhaps not every split produces two deeper splits.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see if the string can be tokenized into a series of productions.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.\n\nFirst token: t52, which is produced by NT8 -> 't52'. So, perhaps the first production is NT8.\n\nSo, let's say the first NT8 produces t52.\n\nThen, looking back, NT8 can only be produced by NT8's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT8 appears in several places. Let's see:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT1 (multiple times)\nNT8 -> NT6 NT8\nNT8 can also produce 't52' as a terminal.\n\nSo, maybe the tree is: NT8 (t52) and another NT8 or NT6 NT8.\n\nWait, but the next token after t52 is t75,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So the process starts with S and expands two non-terminals: NT3 and NT9, or NT3 and NT2.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't91' 't42' etc. I'll need to trace back the derivation to see if these tokens can be part of the generated string.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly map to terminals, like NT9 -> 't91', NT8 -> 't8', etc. So, for the string, I should look for nodes that can produce these terminals.\n\nStarting from the end of the string, maybe it can help. Or perhaps a top-down approach using the leftmost derivation might be better, but given the length, it might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string top-down. Let's see the first two symbols after the start. Wait, the string is `t91 t42 t8...` Wait, the structure is a bit unclear. Actually, the string is `t91 t42 t8 t99 t41 t10 t90 t88 t65 t91 t70 t41`, which is a long sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, let me write all terms: t91, t42, t8, t99, t41, t10, t90, t88, t65, t91, t70, t41. Let me check if these correspond to any non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions: each non-terminal maps to a specific terminal.\n\nNT9 -> t91  \nNT8 -> t8  \nNT6 -> t65  \nNT4 -> t42  \nWait, let me list all terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nt91: NT9  \nt42: NT4  \nt8: NT8  \nt99: NT99? Wait, but looking at the rules, NT9 never appears as a non-terminal except in the last few rules: Wait, I don't see NT99 in the productions. Wait, checking the rules, some look like:\n\nWait, checking the grammar rules again, I see:\n\nNT9 -> t91  \nNT8 -> t8  \nWait, but what about other terms? Let's see. For example:\n\nLooking for t99. Hmmm, I see NT8 -> 't52', but I don't see t99 being a terminal here. Wait, perhaps it's written as 't99'? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar rules, the last part has:\n\nNT7 -> t70  \nNT9 -> t60  \nNT8 -> t41  \nNT4 -> t42  \nWait, but is there a rule for NT9 -> t99? Looking through the rules, I don't see that. The last rule for NT9 is `NT9 -> 't75'`. So t99 is not in the list. That suggests that t99 isn't a terminal generated, but perhaps a typo or misrecognition.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's 't99'. Is this a terminal? Looking at the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that leads to 't99'. Unless it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the rule was intended to be something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each line.\n\nLooking further down, I see:\n\nNT9 -> t75  \nNT2 -> t33  \nNT6 -> t8  \nNT1 -> t40  \nNT7 -> t40  \nNT5 -> t37  \nNT9 -> t60  \nWait, perhaps I misread and there's no 't99' in the terminals. So if the string has 't99', which isn't defined in the grammar, then the string can't be generated because it's invalid.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me double-check. Oh! I just realized that in the rules, there's NT9 -> 't91', NT8 -> 't88'? Wait, let me check the lines.\n\nHere's a line: `NT4 -> 't88'` and `NT2 -> 't33'`. Wait, I'm looking for 't99' but I can't find it in the rules. So perhaps 't99' is an invalid token, making the string impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is correct, and I'm misinterpreting the rules. Let me go through each production rule step by step.\n\nLooking at NT9: the rules are:\n\nNT9 -> t91  \nNT9 -> t60  \n\nSo if the string has t91 and t60, but nowhere t99. So t99 isn't produced by any rule. Therefore, the string `t91...t99...` has t99, which is invalid because it's not a terminal in any rule.\n\nHence, the given string cannot be generated as it contains a terminal that isn't defined in the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed a line or misread. Let me scan through all the NT9 productions:\n\nNT9: \nNT9 -> t91  \nNT9 -> t60  \n\nYes, no 't99'. So t99 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the string has t99 which is not part of the grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a terminal `t99`, which is not present in any production rule. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-221","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t13 t70 t90 t65 t10 t19 t23 t34 t60 t12 t30 t88`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of multiple non-terminal symbols (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) and a few terminals (like 't13', 't70', etc.). My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions provided.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This is important because it allows for simple parsing using algorithms like CYK, but given the size of the problem, I'll try to manually check.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of terminals: t13, t70, t90, t65, t10, t19, t23, t34, t60, t12, t30, t88. Each of these is a terminal from the grammar. \n\nI start by noting that the start symbol S has two productions: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Each of these is a pair of non-terminals. So, the string must start with a sequence that can derive from one of these.\n\nLet me check the first production S \u2192 NT3 NT9. The string starts with 't13', which matches NT9. So, NT9 must be the first non-terminal. What's the production for NT9? Looking back, NT9 has two productions: NT9 \u2192 t60 or t75 or t37, according to the list. Wait, no, I think I need to check the productions for NT9. \n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions for NT9 are: \n- NT9 \u2192 t75\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT9 \u2192 t14\n- NT9 \u2192 t22\n- NT9 \u2192 t12\n- NT9 \u2192 t30\n- NT9 \u2192 t60 (again)\n- NT9 \u2192 t70\n- NT9 \u2192 t37\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me look again:\n\nLooking through the production list, I see:\n- NT9 \u2192 t75\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT9 \u2192 t14\n- NT9 \u2192 t22\n- NT9 \u2192 t12\n- NT9 \u2192 t30\n- NT9 \u2192 t88\n- NT9 \u2192 t23\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, I think each line corresponds to a production. Let me list the productions for NT9:\n\n- NT9 -> t60\n- NT9 -> t75\n- NT9 -> t14\n- NT9 -> t22\n- NT9 -> t12\n- NT9 -> t30\n- NT9 -> t23\n- NT9 -> t10\nWait, am I sure?

The lines for NT9 are:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n- NT0 -> NT1 NT3\n- NT5 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT2\n- NT1 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT6\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT8\n- NT5 -> NT7 NT5\n- NT2 -> NT3 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT8 -> NT2 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT0 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT8\n- NT5 -> NT0 NT1\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT5 -> NT2 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT7 -> NT6 NT5\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT0 NT1\n- NT6 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT2 -> NT1 NT2\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT0\n- NT9 -> 't40' \u2192 Wait, no: looking back, maybe some lines have 't' as terminals. Let me parse this correctly.\n\nWait, earlier in the grammar list, I see lines ending with terminals. For example:\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\nNT6 -> 't34'\nNT1 -> 't25'\nNT7 -> 't40'\nNT5 -> 't91'\nNT6 -> 't65'\nNT3 -> 't30'\nNT8 -> 't37'\nNT9 -> 't75'\nNT2 -> 't33'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT1 -> 't40' ? Wait, no, in the grammar, each line is either a production or a terminal. So lines like:\n\nNT9 -> t75; NT9 -> t60; etc. Wait, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me re-express the grammar.\n\nLooking again, the productions are followed by either more non-terminals or terminals. For example:\n\nNT0 -> NT1 NT3\n...\nNT0 -> 't13' \u2192 So that's a production from NT0 to t13.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 -> 't34' is a production that directly gives 't34' as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, other lines like:\n\nNT1 -> 't25' \u2192 terminal.\n\nNT2 -> 't33' \u2192 terminal.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm seeing that some lines have production rules (e.g., NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3) and others are where the non-terminals are mapped to terminals. So, for example, in the grammar, the line 'NT0 -> 't13'' means that NT0 can produce the string 't13' directly. Similarly, NT6 can produce 't34'.\n\nSo, all the lines that end with a string (like 't13') are terminal symbols, and the rest are production rules.\n\nSo, the NT9 productions: looking for lines where NT9 is the left-hand side.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT9 -> t75\n- NT9 -> t60\n- NT9 -> t14\n- NT9 -> t22\n- NT9 -> t12\n- NT9 -> t30\n- NT9 -> t23\n- NT9 -> t10\n- And another NT9 production: NT9 -> t90?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. I need to separate the production rules (which consist of non-terminals) from the terminals. The right-hand sides that are just strings (like 't13') are terminals, whereas others are production rules.\n\nSo let's restate the NT9 productions from the grammar:\n\nNT9 -> t75 \u2192 terminal\nNT9 -> t60 \u2192 terminal\nNT9 -> t14 \u2192 terminal\nNT9 -> t22 \u2192 terminal\nNT9 -> t12 \u2192 terminal\nNT9 -> t30 \u2192 terminal\nNT9 -> t23 \u2192 terminal\nNT9 -> t10 \u2192 terminal\nWait, is there another production? Looking for left-hand side as NT9:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT9 \u2192 production\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT1 \u2192 production\nWait, no, looking for \"NT9 \u2192 ...\".\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe full list of lines after the initial grammar line is provided. So, for the NT9 productions, I see:\n\nThe lines that have NT9 as the left side are more towards the end.\n\nSpecifically, looking for 'NT9 -> ...':\n\nYes, here are the NT9 lines:\n\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the full list:\n\nNo, looking carefully, the NT9 productions are as follows:\n\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string we're testing.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the productions, S starts with NT3 NT9. Then, each of those NT symbols can expand into a combination of other NT symbols and possibly terminals. Some of the productions ending in terminals like 't52', 't34', etc., seem to represent the terminal symbols in the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t52 t34 t65 t40 t65 t41 t75 t40 t41 t52 t33 t60 t8.\n\nFirst, let's break down the string into its parts: t52, t34, t65, t40, t65, t41, t75, t40, t41, t52, t33, t60, t8.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, I see that NT0, NT2, etc., can produce various other NTs or t's. Some NTs directly produce t's. For example, NT8 can produce 't52' and 't37', and NT0 can produce 't13'.\n\nThe string starts with t52 and ends with t8, so let's see if we can derive that.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT3 NT9. Let's see what NT3 and NT9 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3:\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\nSo, S -> NT3 NT9 becomes S -> NT6 NT2 NT9.\n\nNow, let's break down NT6 and NT9.\n\nNT6 can produce:\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT2\n  Then NT9 can produce 't52' or others.\nWait, let's see NT9 productions:\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT9 -> NT8 NT9\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT8\nWait, but the first NT9 can produce 't75' when NT9 -> 't75'. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another path.\n\nAlternatively, let's see NT3 and NT9.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string from the start.\n\nThe string starts with t52. Let's see where t52 can come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t52 can be produced by NT8 -> 't52' and also NT2 -> 't33', which isn't t52. Also, NT9 can produce 't75', and others.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again:\n\nNT8: \n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT8 -> 't37'\n\nSo, t52 comes from NT8. So the first symbol t52 comes from NT8.\n\nSo in S -> NT3 NT9, which becomes NT6 NT2 NT9.\n\nNow, let's see if NT6 can produce 't34' or something else. Wait, NT6's productions:\n\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT5\n- Other productions involving NT6.\n\nIf NT6 is to produce t34, looking at NT6 -> 't34' is a production as per the grammar. Yes, NT6 produces 't34'.\n\nSo NT6 -> 't34'. That would use one of the symbols. Similarly, NT2 can produce 't33' or 't37', etc.\n\nWait, let me structure this. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nString: t52 t34 t65 t40 t65 t41 t75 t40 t41 t52 t33 t60 t8\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which is NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the first two symbols should come from NT3 and NT9.\n\nBut wait, NT3 and NT9 each produce two symbols, so the string starts with the symbols from NT3 and NT9. Let's see.\n\nWait, S -> NT3 NT9. So NT3's expansion will produce some symbols, and NT9's expansion will produce others. The string is a concatenation of all those symbols.\n\nSo let's parse the string into possible derivations.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t52, which we've determined comes from NT8.\n\nSo in S, which is NT3 NT9, let's see if NT3 -> NT6 NT2 and NT9 -> NT8 NT9. Wait, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to perform a leftmost or rightmost derivation. Let's try leftmost.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo NT3 can expand as follows:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nNT6 can expand:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't34' directly, since NT6 -> 't34' is a production.\n\nSo NT6 \u2192 't34'.\n\nThen NT2 can expand. Let's see the options for NT2:\n\nNT2 has several productions, like NT2 -> NT6 NT8, among others. Let's see if NT2 can produce 't33'. Looking at the productions:\n\n- NT2 -> 't33' is not a production. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, NT2 has a production NT2 -> 't33' \u2014 yes, there's an entry: NT2 -> 't33', so that's a terminal.\n\nSo NT2 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSo now the first two symbols from NT3 and NT2 are 't34' and 't33', which are not the first two symbols of the string. The string starts with 't52 t34...'.\n\nHmm. That's a problem. Maybe another path.\n\nWait, perhaps NT3 doesn't go directly to NT6 NT2. Let me check the production options for NT3 again:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- Others for higher symbols.\n\nSo NT3 can go to NT6 NT2, but also possibly to NT0 NT7. Let's see which path could lead us to the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t52. Let's see, t52 is produced by NT8. So perhaps NT9 needs to produce NT8.\n\nLooking at NT9, possible productions:\n\n- NT9 -> 't75' (a terminal), or others.\n\nWait, but let's try this approach:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nIf NT3 \u2192 't30' (is that a terminal?), wait, checking the grammar: NT3 expands to NT6 NT2. So no, NT3 produces non-terminals, not terminals. So first, NT3 will produce non-terminals, and their expansions will produce the string.\n\nWait, so the first symbol t52 must come from NT8, which means that somewhere in the expansion, NT8 is generated. So perhaps in the expansion of NT3 or NT9.\n\nWait, but S starts with NT3 NT9, so each must produce some symbols.\n\nLet me consider the first two symbols t52 t34.\n\nSuppose the first symbol comes from NT9 and the second from NT3.

{"custom_id":"request-242","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG. Alright, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier, but I'm not actually parsing; I just need to check if the string is in the language.\n\nThe string given is: `t23 t42 t12 t60 t22 t23 t41 t90 t14 t37 t65 t14 t30`.\n\nI notice that each of these t's are terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if there's a way to derive this string using the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet me look through the grammar to see which productions correspond to these terminals. Let's make a list:\n\nLooking at the RHS of each production, whenever the RHS includes a terminal, that might be part of the string.\n\nFor example, `NT8 -> 't40'` means that NT8 can be replaced by 't40'.\n\nSimilarly, `NT3 -> 't30'`, `NT9 -> 't75'`, etc.\n\nSo the strategy is to see if the string can be broken down into a series of productions, each deriving each terminal in order.\n\nI think the best way is to start from the start symbol S and try to split the string into the required non-terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has productions:\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo the string must start with either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with 't23 t42 t12 ...' which is a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, the first two symbols are t23 and t42. So I need to see if 't23' can be derived from NT3 or NT4 (since NT3 can produce other non-terminals which then derive to t23).\n\nLooking at the productions:\nNT3 has:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nSo NT3 can produce other non-terminals, which might lead to t23 or another t.\n\nLooking at the possible chains for t23. Let's find which non-terminals can produce 't23'.\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't40', but that's not t23.\n- NT9 \u2192 't75', nope.\n- NT6 \u2192 't34' and 't8', but 't23' isn't in there.\n- NT0 \u2192 't13', but that's not matching.\n- NT2 has 't33' and 't22'? Wait, looking at NT2 productions:\nNT2 \u2192 't33', 't22', etc. Wait, 't22' is an option, but we have 't23' in the string.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe it's better to try to find if each terminal in the string can be derived from a specific non-terminal, starting from the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using CYK parsing or looking for possible substructures.\n\nBut considering the time, maybe I can simulate the parsing steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps focusing on the start symbol and see if the first few symbols can be derived.\n\nGiven that S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nSuppose we take S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nThen, the first symbol in the string is t23. Does NT3 produce t23? Let's check NT3's productions.\n\nLooking back, NT3 has:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nNo 't23' directly in NT3's productions. So perhaps NT3 must generate a sequence that includes t23.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let's check where t23 can be derived from.\n\nLooking at all NT productions, is there any production that can result in t23? Let me scan the productions.\n\nLooking through each non-terminal's productions:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't40'\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- NT6 \u2192 't34', 't8'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', 't22', etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 't88', 't2', etc.\nWait, perhaps NT2 can produce 't2'? Let me see: NT2's productions include NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7, NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8, NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6, etc. Then, when do NT2 derive t22 or t23?\n\nWait, in NT2's productions, I see NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 't22' and another \u2192 't33', etc. So 't22' can come from NT2. Similarly, 't23' is in the string after 't42'.\n\nWait, let's check: The string is t23 t42 t12 t60 t22 t23 t41 t90 t14 t37 t65 t14 t30.\n\nSo the first part is t23, then t42.\n\nLooking at t42. Does any non-terminal produce t42?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT9: No, 't22', 't14', etc.\n- NT0: 't13', 't40' maybe elsewhere.\n- NT7: 't70', 't70' perhaps.\n- Wait, in NT3: No production produces t42.\n- NT2: Has production NT2 \u2192 't33' and 't22', but no t42.\nWait, maybe looking for t42 elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing one. Let me check all productions again:\n\nLooking at NT9 productions:\n- NT9 \u2192 't75', 't60', 't22', etc.\n\nWait, in NT9, 't60' is an option. But in the string, after t23 comes t42. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at NT9 \u2192 't60', which doesn't help here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to see if there's any way to derive the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parsing the string from right to left using the grammar.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be represented as a series of productions.\n\nWait, the string is: t23, t42, t12, t60, t22, t23, t41, t90, t14, t37, t65, t14, t30.\n\nLet me try to group these into possible non-terminals.\n\nThe first two symbols are t23 and t42. So perhaps NT3 produces t23 and another non-terminal that produces t42.\n\nLooking back, since S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nSuppose we choose S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then the string starts with NT3 \u2192 ... and NT9 \u2192 ... \n\nLooking at t23: Is there a production for NT3 that could produce t23 in a chain? Let's see:\n\nNT3 has production NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Then, what can come from NT6 and NT2.\n\nNT6: has 't34', 't8', etc. Looking further, NT6 can produce 't90' as per productions? Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT6 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nAnd NT0 has 't13', 't40', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, then NT6 can produce 't34' or other nt's. Alternatively, let's see:\n\nt23 comes from NT3, which could be derived from NT6 and NT2.\n\nIf NT6 can produce 't34' or another nt that could eventually produce t23. Wait, perhaps I'm stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let's try a different approach. Instead of starting with S, perhaps see if the string can be built by combining the productions appropriately.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that each t is a terminal, so each must correspond to exactly one production. So let's check which non-terminals can produce each t in the string.\n\nWait, that works. So for each t in the string, we need to ensure there's at least one rule that produces it.\n\nLooking at each t:\n\nt23: Check if any NT has a production NT \u2192 't23'. Looking through, I don't see any NT's that produce 't23' directly. So this would be a problem.\n\nWait, because if none of the NTs directly produce 't23', then the string can't be derived, right?\n\nWait, no, because perhaps it's produced"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t22 t23 t23 t99 t25 t34 t52 t25 t42 t14 t12 t19 t25 t60`. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, making each production a single non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) and terminals (like t22, t23, etc.), with the string to evaluate comprising a sequence of terminals. To determine if the string is in the language, I need to see if it can be derived from the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is defined as NT3 NT9. So the first two symbols should be either NT3 or something that can lead to NT3, followed by NT9 or the corresponding NT9. Let me check the start symbol: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. That means the first part of the string after expansion must start with NT3, NT3\u2192something..., and then NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t22. I need to see if t22 can be derived from NT3 or NT9. Wait, actually, the grammar uses non-terminals on the left, and terminals are only on the right in certain cases. So I need to see how t22 can be a result of some derivation. Looking at the productions, I don't see t22 directly as a terminal in the right-hand side of any production for NT3 or NT9. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, in Chomsky normal form, the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 B, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking back, yes, some of the productions are terminals. For example, some rules end with a terminal, like NT6 \u2192 t34, or S \u2192 NT3 NT9, but NT3 and NT9 expand further.\n\nWait, but wait, the string starts with t22, which is a terminal.

Let me check each line starting with NT0 to NT9.\n\nFor example, looking for NT3 \u2192 t30: Yes, the line is `NT3 -> NT0 NT7`, but that's a non-terminal. Wait, no, t30 is a terminal, so I need to see if any production for NT3 ends in t30. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking for NT3 productions:\n\nThe user provides lines like `NT3 -> t30`? No, let me see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't immediately see NT3 \u2192 t30. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking for NT3 in the productions:\n\n- `NT3 -> NT6 NT2` (line starting with NT3:)\nWait, no, the productions list starts with S, then NT8, NT0, etc. So for NT3, looking through the list:\n\nI see a line `NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2`, another line `NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7`, and another line `NT3 \u2192 't30'`. Wait, 't30' is written after the arrow, so yes, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 t30, which would directly produce the terminal t30. Similarly, looking for t22, t23, etc.\n\nWait, let me see all NT productions with terminals:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t8 (line: NT6 -> 't8')\n- NT5 -> t37, t37 again? Wait, no, looking at the NT5 productions: `NT5 -> t37` and `NT5 -> t75`, perhaps? Wait, more accurately:\n\nWait, the user's productions are as follows (only showing NT lines):\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I can see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t52\n- NT0 \u2192 t13\n- NT6 \u2192 t34\n- NT1 \u2192 t25\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n- NT5 \u2192 t91\n- NT6 \u2192 t65\n- NT3 \u2192 t30\n- NT8 \u2192 t37\n- NT9 \u2192 t75\n- NT7 \u2192 t70\n- NT1 \u2192 t40\n- NT7 \u2192 t10\n- NT1 \u2192 t19\n- NT4 \u2192 t88\n- NT2 \u2192 t33\n- NT3 \u2192 t90\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT7 \u2192 t70\n- NT8 \u2192 t41\n- NT4 \u2192 t42\n- NT9 \u2192 t22\n- NT9 \u2192 t14\n- NT4 \u2192 t99\n- NT8 \u2192 t23\n- NT5 \u2192 t37\n\nSo yes, each of these NT's directly produce some terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT9 produces t60 directly, t75, t22, t14, etc.\n\nLooking back at the string, the first token is t22, which must come from an NT9, because in the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So to get the first token t22, it must come from NT9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 t22 is a production.\n\nSo the first part of the string corresponds to NT9 \u2192 t22.\n\nThen, the second token is t23. Looking at NT9's productions, I don't recall seeing t23 directly, but perhaps via another NT. Or maybe it's an expansion through another path.\n\nWait, after generating t22 (from NT9), the next part would involve NT9. Wait, but in S \u2192 NT3 NT9, both NT3 and NT9 must be expanded, and both contribute to the string. So the entire string is a concatenation of the expansions from NT3 and NT9.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the string is the concatenation of the expansion of NT3 and the expansion of NT9. So the string is formed by first expanding NT3 into some sequence, then expanding NT9 into another sequence, and concatenating both, resulting in the entire string.\n\nSo, the first part, starting with t22, must be the expansion of NT9, and the part after t22 must be the expansion of NT3, starting with t23. Wait, but that might not necessarily be the case. Let me clarify: the entire string is the combination of the two non-terminals, so maybe both NT3 and NT9 can contribute to the same part of the string, but that's unlikely because they're separate in the production S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT3 NT9 means the string is first the expansion of NT3, then the expansion of NT9, in that order. So the entire string is the concatenation of NT3's expansion and NT9's expansion.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t22, which must come from NT9's expansion. Let's examine NT9 productions:\n\nLooking at the NT9 productions, the user provided a list where NT9 produces multiple terminals, including 't22', 't14', 't75', etc. So the first token t22 must be from NT9's production that includes t22. Let's check if there's such a production.\n\nWait, looking through the NT9 lines provided, the productions are:\n\nNT9 -> t75, t60, t22, t14, t99, and other possibilities? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided NT9 productions, yes, NT9 has the following terminals:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't22' (assuming that's correct, as the user's grammar includes `NT9 -> t22` once, and `NT9 -> t14` another time, etc.)\n\nSo t22 is directly produced by NT9.\n\nThen, after t22, the next token is t23. But according to the grammar, NT9 only directly produces t22, t14, t19, t25, t22, t75, and others. Wait, checking the NT9 productions:\n\nWait, let me re-examine.

The string is `t8 t8 t91 t42 t90 t65 t14 t25 t13 t12 t52 t19 t25 t23`. \n\nFirst, I remember that the Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires each production rule to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except possibly the start symbol, which can produce terminals. But in this case, the given grammar seems to have some rules where the right-hand sides are strings of terminals. For example, I see rules like NT9 -> 't75' or NT2 -> 't8'. That might indicate that the grammar is not in CNF, which is a bit confusing because the initial problem stated it was in CNF. Maybe the user made a typo, or perhaps the arrows are overloaded. \n\nWait, no, looking closer, perhaps the grammar includes both CNF rules and some direct terminal productions, which is acceptable in CNF if we allow the start symbol to produce terminals. Or maybe the grammar is in a modified form where some rules produce terminals. That would mean that the grammar might accept strings composed of terminals based on the allowed productions.\n\nMy task is to check if the given string can be generated step by step starting from the start symbol S and applying productions until I derive the entire string, breaking it down into non-terminals and terminals. The string has 16 tokens: t8, t8, t91, t42, t90, t65, t14, t25, t13, t12, t52, t19, t25, t23. \n\nI need to see if each token can be matched by a production in the grammar. Since the start symbol S has two productions: NT3 NT9 and NT3 NT2. So first, S -> NT3 NT9.\n\nLet me consider how the string begins with t8 t8... So the first two tokens are t8s. Looking at the grammar's non-terminals, I can check which non-terminals produce t8.\n\nLooking at the given rules, NT6 -> 't8' is one production. But wait, I need to check all rules for each non-terminal. So for NT6, yes, it can produce t8. Similarly, NT0 -> 't13' and others produce t's like t8, t13, t12, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their terminal productions. Let me go through each production rule and note which ones produce terminals:\n\n- S -> NT3 NT9, S -> NT3 NT2 (both S's productions are non-terminals)\n- NT8 -> NT0 NT2, NT8 -> NT4 NT2, NT8 -> NT6 NT1, NT8 -> NT6 NT8, NT8 -> NT7 NT9, NT8 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT1 NT3, NT0 -> NT2 NT2, NT0 -> NT5 NT7, NT0 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5, NT9 -> NT7 NT9, NT9 -> NT3 NT7, NT9 -> NT6 NT1, NT9 -> NT3 NT8, NT9 -> NT7 NT6\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT7, NT2 -> NT6 NT8, NT2 -> NT5 NT6, NT2 -> NT3 NT1, NT2 -> NT4 NT8, NT2 -> NT5 NT0, NT2 -> NT7 NT8, ... etc.\n- There are many NT3, NT4, NT5, etc., with various rules, some producing terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar as written, there are some direct terminal productions. For example, NT6 -> 't8', which immediately produces a terminal. Similarly, NT9 -> 't75'; I think this is a typo, but looking back, the user wrote it as NT9 -> 't75'. Similarly, NT0 -> 't13', etc.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the grammar is in CNF, all production rules should have two non-terminals on the right, except for the start symbol, which can produce terminals. So maybe the direct terminals are in the last level, but some rules can produce multiple terminals in one step, but in CNF, each step replaces one non-terminal with two others, until eventually terminals are produced.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some rules are, for example, NT8 -> 't52', which produces a single terminal. Similarly, NT0 -> 't13', etc. That might not conform to CNF because in Chomsky normal form, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS. Therefore, perhaps this grammar is not in CNF because it has production rules producing a single terminal. \n\nBut the user was told it's in CNF. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the grammar, and 't8' etc., are just two-character sequences. But in the problem, the string given is `t8 t8 ...`, so each token is a single 't' followed by a number. So each token is a single character. Hmm, but in the grammar, some rules produce multi-character terminals. Wait, no, looking closer, for example, NT9 -> 't75'\u2014that's a three-character terminal. Similarly, NT8 -> 't52', which is three characters. But in the string, each token is a single 't' followed by a number, like 't8', which is two characters. So perhaps the grammar's terminals are sequences of 't' followed by a digit, but in the given grammar, some production rules produce multiple 't's with digits, making them longer than single 't's.\n\nWait, but the problem's string is a sequence of two-character tokens, each starting with 't' followed by a single digit. But in the grammar, some rules produce like 't88' (three characters) or 't13' (two characters). So perhaps the confusion is that 't88' would be a longer string. \n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT9 -> 't75' would produce the string 't75', right? So each time a rule is used, it can produce a terminal string, which could be longer than one token. But in the given string, each step seems to be adding one token.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently.\n\nFirst, the given string is a sequence of 14 tokens (since counting each 't' and number as a token: t8, t8, t91, t42, t90, t65, t14, t25, t13, t12, t52, t19, t25, t23). So each is two tokens. Wait, no\u2014wait, the string is written as t8 t8 t91 t42 t90 t65 t14 t25 t13 t12 t52 t19 t25 t23. That's 14 tokens, each two characters, making the entire string 28 characters. But in the grammar's rules, some rules produce one or two 't' characters with numbers. For example, NT9 -> 't75' would produce three characters, which would be two tokens: 't7' and '5'. But in our case, the string is t8 t8 t91 t42 etc., each token is two characters, so perhaps each rule in the grammar should be checked for producing a single 't' followed by a digit. But looking at the grammar, that's not the case. For example, NT8 -> 't52' produces 't52', which would be three characters, implying two tokens: 't5' and '2'? Or perhaps the tokens are each a single 't', but the numbers can be multiple digits. Wait, the string has 't8', which is two tokens: 't' and '8'\u2014no, each token is separated by space, so each token is a single entity. So perhaps, in the grammar, each rule is intended to produce a single token (e.g., a single 't' followed by a single digit). However, in the grammar, some rules produce longer terminals, which suggests that the grammar may not be in CNF, but the user claims it is.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the notation here. In the grammar, each production like NT9 -> 't75' is a terminal string of three characters: 't', '7', '5'. So each such production would derive a string of three characters. But in the given problem, each token is two characters. So that would complicate things, unless each rule in the grammar is intended to produce two-character tokens. But then, for example, NT0 -> 't13' would produce a two-character token 't1', '3', but as a single token. Hmm, perhaps the initial statement was wrong, or perhaps I need to interpret the grammar's production rules differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, where each production is either two non-term"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t34 t42 t14 t41 t70 t34 t22 t60 t23 t91 t91 t75 t33 t70 t60`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar here is in CNF because all the productions are right-hand sides with two non-terminals or single terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can model the parsing process using a method similar to the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars. But I'm not familiar with implementing CYK, so maybe I can approach it by looking for possible derivations step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is composed of terminals, I can try breaking it down into steps where each production rule is applied to generate the string. Let's look at the string and see if it can be built from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to find a way to decompose it into non-terminals using the grammar rules. Each production in the grammar either introduces a non-terminal or terminates with a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for terminals.\n\nI should note that for a string to be generated by a CNF grammar, the length of the string must be a power of 2. Let's check the length: \n\nThe string has 15 tokens. 15 is not a power of 2 (since 2^4=16). Wait, 15 is 2^4 -1, which is not equal to a power of 2. Hmm, but sometimes the number of terminals can vary, but generally, in CNF, the number of steps is a power of 2. Wait, no, that's for the derivation tree height. The number of tokens can be any size, but the structure of the tree must have a certain form. Wait, I might be confusing the levels of the tree with the string length.\n\nWait, each production in CNF can only expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals until the leaves are terminals. So, the number of terminals in the derived string must be 2^n where n is the number of non-terminals in the derivation. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, which eventually become terminals. So, the number of terminals in the string is equal to the number of terminal leaves in the parse tree. Each production step doubles the number of symbols. So, starting from 1 symbol (S), the number of symbols increases as 1, 2, 3, etc., but each production step can only replace a non-terminal with two, so the count would be 1, 2, 3,... but for terminal counts, it's at the leaves.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the depth of the parse tree that determines the maximum number of terminals. For a string length of L, the parse tree would have a certain structure. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me check the string length again. The given string has 15 tokens. Let's list them:\n\n1. t34\n2. t42\n3. t14\n4. t41\n5. t70\n6. t34\n7. t22\n8. t60\n9. t23\n10. t91\n11. t91\n12. t75\n13. t33\n14. t70\n15. t60\n\nSo 15 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols in the derivation tree must be 2^n -1 for some n, because each level of the tree doubles the number of nodes. Wait, no, that's how the parse tree for a leftmost derivation would look in Chomsky's grammar. Alternatively, the number of symbols in the string after n steps would be up to 2^n, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the string can be broken down into the possible substrings generated by the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are t12, t13, t14, t22, t23, t33, t34, t41, t42, t52, t60, t65, t70, t75, t88, t90, t91, t75, t70. Wait, some of these might repeat, but I need to see if the string can be constructed from these.\n\nLet me see if each terminal in the string is present in the grammar. From the grammar, I see that many terminals are listed, like t34, t42, t14, etc., which are all present in the string. So no missing terminals there.\n\nNext, I need to see if the string can be broken down using the productions. Let's start from the beginning. The first symbol is t34. Looking at the grammar, I see that S can produce NT3 NT9. But the first symbol is t34, which is not a non-terminal. Wait, I'm getting confused. No, wait, in the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it doesn't produce a terminal directly. So S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which are non-terminals. Then, each of those non-terminals must be expanded into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, that's not how it works. The grammar has S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which are two non-terminals. Each NT (non-terminal) can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to derive a terminal string, we start with S and perform a series of productions, expanding non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, the derivation must proceed by expanding non-terminals into other non-terminals, which eventually produce the required terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the first part. The first token is t34. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT6 \u2192 t34. So perhaps one of the non-terminals in the derivation chain must produce t34.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t34 is produced directly by a non-terminal that eventually leads to it through productions. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> t34: So if a NT6 appears in the derivation, it can produce t34.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t34, which is a terminal. So in the derivation, there must be a NT6 somewhere that is the first non-terminal to produce t34.\n\nSo, perhaps the start S must expand into NT3 and NT9.\n\nThen, in the first step: S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nEach of these non-terminals (NT3 and NT9) will be expanded. Let's look at possible productions.\n\nFrom NT3: Looking at the rules, I find NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So NT3 would become two non-terminals, NT6 and NT2. Then, NT6 \u2192 t34, which matches the first token.\n\nSo, to get t34, perhaps the path is:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT6 \u2192 t34\n\nSo the first part of the string is t34, which corresponds to the NT6 expansion. But wait, the first token is t34, so that would require the NT6 to be the first symbol in the derived string. Let me confirm: the initial expansion of S would lead to two non-terminals, so the derived string would need to have both expanded into symbols such that the entire string is built correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the T34 is the result of a leftmost derivation, so the string starts with NT6 being expanded first, leading to t34.\n\nBut since S is the starting symbol, it can't directly produce a terminal, only non-terminals. So the first symbol must be either NT3 or NT9.\n\nWait, maybe the first symbol can be either NT3 or NT9, but in the string it's t34. So t34 must be the first symbol, which is t34. Looking at the NTs, which NTs directly produce t34? Only NT6 does, as per the grammar.\n\nSo, to get t34 as the first symbol, we must have a path starting with NT6. But S can't produce NT6 directly. Wait, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and to get NT6, perhaps NT3 can produce NT6 via some chain.\n\nWait, looking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nSo, NT3 can become NT6 and NT2, which could then be expanded.\n\nIf the first part of the string is t34, which is produced by NT6, then perhaps the expansion is:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT6 \u2192 t34\n\nBut how does this fit into the overall string?

Alternatively, some NTs produce terminal symbols.\n\nLet me list out the production rules where a terminal appears on the RHS:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT2 -> 't33' (but 't33' isn't in the string)\n- NT3 -> 't30' (also not in the string)\n- NT5 -> 't91' (in the string, 't70' is also present)\n- NT6 -> 't8' (so 't8' comes from NT6)\n- NT8 -> 't52' (not in string)\n- NT9 -> 't75' (nope)\n- NT0 -> 't13' (yes, 't13' is in the string)\n- NT1 -> 't40' (nope)\n- NT7 -> 't40' (also nope)\n- NT4 -> 't88' (yes, 't88' is in the string)\n- NT0 can produce 't13', and it's involved in other productions like NT0 -> NT2 NT2, which could lead to 't13's.\n\nLooking at the string: `t8 t70 t91 t34 t60 t88 t60 t90 t34 t13 t13 t14 t65 t70 t70`.\n\nI need to see if each of these can be generated via the grammar. Maybe I can work backwards or try to find a path starting from S.\n\nStarting from S, S -> NT3 NT9. So, the string would start with the productions of NT3 and NT9.\n\nNT3 has a production to NT6 NT2. So NT3 could become NT6 NT2. Let's check if the string starts with 't8', which is 't8' from NT6.\n\nSo, NT3 produces 't8' as part of NT6. Then what's NT2? NT2 can produce 't33', which isn't in the string, or other non-terminals. Looking at the string, after 't8' comes 't70', so perhaps NT2 can produce something that leads to 't70'. Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions:\n\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT2 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT5\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT8\n- NT9 -> 't75'\nWait, maybe let's see:\n\nAfter 't8', if NT2 produces NT7 NT7, then each NT7 can produce things. Let me check NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT9 and NT7 -> something else. So NT7 can produce 't40' if it goes to NT5 NT4. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting at the beginning: S -> NT3 NT9. Let's see what NT3 can produce. NT3-> NT6 NT2. NT6 can produce NT4 NT5. Then NT5 can produce NT7 NT5 or other stuff.\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe I should consider the entire string and see if it's a series of productions that can be reduced.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if it's derived from S by replacing each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the string as a tree structure, starting from S and expanding until we get the terminals. But this is time-consuming manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for any terminal that can't be produced from any rule. For example, 't70' is in the string. Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't70'?\n\nLooking through the rules, NT7 can produce NT5 NT4. NT5 can produce 't91' but that's not 't70'. Wait, let me check NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 -> NT5 NT4 or NT7 -> NT0 NT8.\n\nSo, in the string, after 't8' comes 't70'. Wait, 't70' could come from NT7 as 't70' if NT7 can produce that, but checking the rules, I don't see any rule for NT7 that ends in 't70'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe 't70' comes from NT2, because NT2 can produce NT7 NT7. Let me think: Maybe the NT2 production NT2-> NT7 NT7, and each NT7 can produce 't37' or 't40', but that's not 't70'.\n\nAlternatively, NT2 could produce NT6 NT8. Then NT6-> NT4 NT5, and NT5-> 't91' or other rules. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't70' comes from NT5's production to 't91', but that's 't91', which is in the string but probably comes later.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt8 t70 t91 t34 t60 t88 t60 t90 t34 t13 t13 t14 t65 t70 t70\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. t8: This must come from a non-terminal that produces t8. Looking at the rules, NT6 -> 't8'. So perhaps S->NT3 NT9, and the first part is NT3 producing NT6 NT2, so the first 't8' comes from NT6.\n\n2. Next is t70: So after t8, the next symbol is t70. Let's see what happens after NT6 and NT2. NT6 is 't8', so the next part is t70, which should come from NT2. So NT2 produces t70.\n\nBut looking at NT2's productions, the only way to get t70 is if NT2 can produce something that includes t70. Looking at NT2's rules: NT2-> NT7 NT7, NT6 NT8, etc. So to get t70, it would have to come via NT7.\n\nWait, does NT7 produce t70? Looking at the rules for NT7: NT7-> NT5 NT4 or NT0 NT8. So unless NT5 or NT4 can produce t70, which I don't think they do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't70' comes from NT5 or NT0. Let's look at NT0's productions. NT0-> NT1 NT3, and sometimes NT0-> NT2 NT1 or other things. And NT1 can produce 't40'.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet's reconstruct the derivation:\n\nStart with S: S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 (since it can go to NT6 NT2, which can produce t8)\n\nSo starting with t8, next is t70. So after NT6 is t8, then the next symbol is t70, which must come from NT2. So NT2 must produce t70.\n\nSo looking at NT2's productions: NT2 -> NT7 NT7, which could produce t70 if each NT7 can produce t35 each? No, I don't think so. Alternatively, NT2-> NT6 NT8.

{"custom_id":"request-300","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or S \u2192 \u03b5 (where A and B are non-terminals, a is a terminal, and \u03b5 is the empty string). \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are a lot of NT rules and then a bunch of terminal rules. The terminal rules map certain NTs to specific strings starting with 't'. My string to test is: `t33 t99 t25 t42 t75 t10 t65 t30 t52 t75 t30 t91 t60 t90 t52 t22`.\n\nFirst, I notice that in Chomsky normal form, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. The string provided is a series of terminals, so each element of the string corresponds to a production rule that ends with a terminal. \n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual tokens: t33, t99, t25, t42, t75, t10, t65, t30, t52, t75, t30, t91, t60, t90, t52, t22.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a non-terminal that has a production rule directly to that terminal. So, for example, NT9 \u2192 t75, NT5 \u2192 t91, and so on. \n\nI need to build the parse tree starting from S and see if I can derive the given string. Let me see what S can produce. Looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the derivation starts with NT3 and NT9.\n\nNow, I need to check if each of these, NT3 and NT9, can be expanded to the corresponding non-terminals in the string. \n\nStarting with NT3: Looking at the rules, NT3 can go to NT0 NT7 or NT6 NT2. Each of these would need further expansion. The string after t33 is t99, so maybe NT3 expands to something that starts with t33.\n\nLooking at the terminal rules, NT3 \u2192 't30', so if NT3 is a leaf, it would produce 't30'. However, in our string, the first token is 't33'. So unless NT3 can somehow expand into a combination that starts with t33, it might not fit. But wait, NT3 could be part of a chain of rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about each non-terminal and see what tokens they produce. For example, NT3 could expand into NT0 NT7, which could further expand. But without knowing the entire expansion, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is structured in a way that each production leads to the next token. Let me try to map the tokens to the production rules.\n\nStarting with S = NT3 NT9. So the first part is NT3, which should derive to the first token 't33'. \n\nLooking at the rules for NT3: \n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n\nSo if NT3 is 't30', the first token would be 't30', but we have 't33' as the first token. So that's a mismatch unless NT3 can somehow produce t33 through a chain. Alternatively, maybe NT3 is part of a longer chain leading to t33. \n\nIf NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, then NT0 and NT7 need to expand. So let's see what NT0 and NT7 produce.\n\nLooking at NT0:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n \nSimilarly, NT7:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT6 NT5\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT8\n- NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT7 \u2192 't70'\n- NT7 \u2192 't10' ?\n\nWait, no, looking back: the terminal rules. For example, NT7 \u2192 't70' and NT7 \u2192 't10'. So NT7 can be 't70' or 't10'.\n\nSo if in the string the first token is 't33', and the rule for NT3 leads to a subtree that starts with 't33', that would be needed.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe I should build the parse tree bottom-up, starting from the string and checking if the grammar can derive it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into a sequence of terminals, and each can be checked against the grammar's terminal productions. But each non-terminal must derive a string of terminals that match the required order.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent each terminal as a node. The string is t33 t99 t25 t42 t75 t10 t65 t30 t52 t75 t30 t91 t60 t90 t52 t22. Let's list their positions and see which non-terminals could produce them.\n\nLooking at the first terminal, t33. Which NTs lead to t33?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't65', NT8 \u2192 't37', etc. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal rules:\n\nLet me list all NTs that have terminal productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t30\n- NT5 \u2192 t91\n- NT6 \u2192 t65, t34, t8, t37, t90, t90, t8, t6, etc.\nWait, this is too many.

{"custom_id":"request-301","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is \"t91 t23 t34 t22 t14 t40 t25 t65 t60 t22 t19 t42 t70 t40 t19 t75\". Hmm, that's a lot of tokens separated by spaces. I need to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and the start symbol cannot be on the right-hand side. Additionally, all terminal symbols must be directly derived without any variables in their rule. So in this grammar, each production is either a non-terminal producing two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and the initial rule is S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Each of these NT (Non-Terminal) symbols has their own production rules. At the bottom of the grammar, there are several rules where NT symbols are converted into terminal tokens like t91, t23, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal tokens. So each token in the string corresponds to a specific production rule. I need to see if the overall sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of steps.\n\nLet me break down the string token by token:\n\n1. t91\n2. t23\n3. t34\n4. t22\n5. t14\n6. t40\n7. t25\n8. t65\n9. t60\n10. t22\n11. t19\n12. t42\n13. t70\n14. t40\n15. t19\n16. t75\n\nI think the approach here is to see if each token is correctly derived from the grammar's non-terminals in the correct order. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step of derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others, eventually leading to terminal symbols.\n\nLet me start by examining the first token, t91. Looking into the grammar, I see that NT9 has a production rule that can lead to t91: NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9 and NT7 \u2192 t60, but wait, there's also NT9 \u2192 t91. So t91 is directly reachable from NT9. That means the first token t91 must have come from NT9.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, how is NT9 defined? There's a rule NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5 and another NT9 \u2192 t91. Wait, no, in the given grammar, it's written as NT9 \u2192 t75, NT9 \u2192 t60, and also NT9 \u2192 t91. So the rule is actually NT9 \u2192 t75, but that's not one of the first few. Wait, no, looking more carefully, I see multiple entries:\n\nNo, in the provided grammar, the lines with NT9 as the left-hand side are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\nNT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\nWait, no. Actually, the user provided a list of productions, and under NT9, there are rules like NT9 \u2192 t75, NT9 \u2192 t60, etc. So I think I need to parse each production correctly.\n\nWait, the user input includes lines like:\n\nNT9 -> t75\nNT9 -> t60\nAnd so on. So looking at the grammar, the first thing I notice is that NT9 has production rules that lead to terminals like t91, t23, etc. So for the first token t91, it's produced by NT9.\n\nNow, to derive t91, that must be the result of applying one of NT9's production rules that leads directly to a terminal. Looking at the grammar, under NT9, do we have a rule that produces t91? Let me scan:\n\nYes, I see \"NT9 -> t75\" and \"NT9 -> t60\", but also \"NT7 -> NT6 NT5\", etc., which may produce t91? Wait no, t91 is directly a terminal from NT9 in the production:\n\nWait, the user wrote lines like:\nNT9 -> 't40' etc.\nWait, in the grammar provided, the lines are like:\n\nNT9 -> NT7 NT9\nNT9 -> NT6 NT1\nNT9 -> NT3 NT7\nAnd also:\nNT9 -> t75\nNT9 -> 't60' and others like that. Wait, is there a direct production for NT9 to t91?\n\nLooking back, the exact grammar provided includes:\n\nNT9 -> t75\nNT9 -> t60\nNT9 -> t91\nYes, so NT9 can directly produce t91, t60, t75, etc.\n\nSo the first token t91 comes from NT9 \u2192 t91. Now, in the derivation, the start symbol S must ultimately derive this string. Let's think about how S connects to NT9.\n\nLooking at S's initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\nS \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo S starts by producing NT3 and NT9, or NT3 and NT2. Since our string starts with t91, which comes from NT9, let's see which initial production includes NT9. The first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So perhaps S \u2192 NT3 \u2192 ... eventually leading to t91, which is the first token.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t91, which is from NT9. So in the initial step, S would have to produce NT3 and NT9. So in the derivation, the first symbol would be NT3 or NT9. Since the first token is NT9 (t91), that suggests that the first step must be S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nWait, but S can also produce NT3 NT2, so the first symbol would be NT3 or NT2. But since the first token is t91 from NT9, that suggests that the first symbol in the string is NT9, which would have to come from the second production S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Because if it were S \u2192 NT3 NT2, the first token would be either NT3 or NT2, not NT9.\n\nWait, that might not be right. Because the string starts with t91, which comes from NT9, so in the expansion of S, the first non-terminal would have to be NT9. But looking at S's rules, the first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which would make the string start with whatever NT3 expands to or NT9. But in the string, the first token is t91, which is NT9 producing directly. So that would require that in the first step, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then NT3 is expanded to something, but that expansion might contribute to tokens after.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the correct approach is to represent the entire string as a sequence of terminals that must be derived from the start symbol following the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to see if each token in the given string can be generated by some path in the grammar.\n\nGiven that, let's list all the terminals and see where they come from. Each token is derived from a non-terminal. Let's map each token to their respective rules:\n\n1. t91: comes from NT9 \u2192 t91\n2. t23: probably from NT2 \u2192 t23? Checking grammar, under NT2, I see production NT2 \u2192 t23.\n3. t34: from NT3 \u2192 t34? Checking NT3 productions, yes, there's NT3 \u2192 t30, but also other rules, but maybe NT6 \u2192 t34?\nWait, looking back, in the grammar:\n\nLooking for each terminal, perhaps a better approach would be to create a reverse mapping from terminals to their possible non-terminal parents.\n\nLet me check the grammar:\n\nLooking for each terminal, their production sources:\n\n- t91: NT9 \u2192 t91\n- t23: NT2 \u2192 t23\n- t34: Probably NT6 \u2192 t34, but let me check. Under NT6: NT6 -> 't34' appears, yes.\n- t22: Check where t22 comes from. Looking through the grammar, I see NT2 \u2192 t22? No, wait, perhaps another NT symbol.\n\nWait, checking NT3: NT3 \u2192 t30. So that doesn't match t22. What about NT6? Under NT6, I see NT6 -> t34. So probably not NT6. Maybe NT2? Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each NT's production rules and see if any of them produce the needed terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backwards, building the entire string from the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t14 t42 t52 t88 t42 t42 t40 t88 t42 t60 t40 t23 t90 t75 t33 t65 t65 t8`. \n\nFirst, I recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure usually makes parsing easier, though I'm not going to use a parser algorithm here, just logical deduction.\n\nSince the string is fully tokenized with terminals, I don't have to worry about anything else. Each terminal in the string must be derived by the grammar, and each non-terminal must expand appropriately to match the sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that several symbols like NT8, NT0, NT2, etc., are defined with multiple productions. However, the string contains a lot of specific terminals like 't14', 't42', 't52', etc., which are actually the leaves in the derivation trees.\n\nI should check if each of these terminals appears in the grammar. Let me scan the right-hand sides of the grammar rules to see if any non-terminals expand directly to these terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't52' (found)\n- NT2 \u2192 't37' (found)\n- NT9 \u2192 't75' (found)\n- NT0 \u2192 't13' (found)\n- NT1 \u2192 't40' (found)\n- NT7 \u2192 't10' (found)\n- NT9 \u2192 't60' (found)\n- NT8 \u2192 't41' (found)\n- NT5 \u2192 't37' (found)\n- NT9 \u2192 't22' (found)\n- NT9 \u2192 't14' (found)\n- NT4 \u2192 't88' (found)\n- NT4 \u2192 't99' (found)\n- NT8 \u2192 't23' (found)\n\nWait, but the string contains 't14', which is covered by NT9 \u2192 't14'. Similarly, 't42' is covered by NT9, as there's NT9 \u2192 't42'.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that in the grammar, these terminals (like 't14') are correctly assigned to the non-terminals they can produce. Each occurrence of 't14' in the string must come from a production where the non-terminal is NT9, because that's the only production that directly maps to 't14' and 't14' isn't a non-terminal in any other rule.\n\nBut I should also check that the grammar allows the sequence of these terminals to be derived. Since the string is linear, each term must be generated in the correct order, with non-terminals expanding to other non-terminals that eventually produce the correct terminal in the right order.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual parts:\n\n1. t14\n   This must come from NT9 \u2192 t14.\n\n2. t42\n   This comes from NT9 \u2192 t42.\n\n3. t52\n   From NT8 \u2192 t52.\n\n4. t88\n   From NT9 \u2192 t88.\n\n5. t42\n   Again from NT9 \u2192 t42.\n\n6. t42\n   Another t42 from NT9.\n\n7. t40\n   From NT1 \u2192 t40.\n\n8. t88\n   Another t88 from NT9.\n\n9. t42\n   t42 from NT9.\n\n10. t60\n    From NT0 \u2192 t60.\n\n11. t40\n    From NT1 \u2192 t40.\n\n12. t23\n    From NT8 \u2192 t23.\n\n13. t90\n    From NT0 \u2192 t90? Wait, no\u2014looking at the rules, NT0 \u2192 t13, so how is t90 derived? Let me check: NT9 \u2192 t90. Yes, there's a rule NT9 \u2192 't90'.\n\n14. t75\n    From NT9 \u2192 t75.\n\n15. t33\n    From NT2 \u2192 t33.\n\n16. t65\n    From NT3 \u2192 t65.\n\n17. t65\n    Again from NT3 \u2192 t65.\n\n18. t8\n    From NT6 \u2192 t8.\n\nWait, but NT6 \u2192 t8.

Let me check the grammar again, it's possible I made a mistake.\n\nLooking back, the user provided a lot of rules. Let me see:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT3 NT6\nNT6 -> NT4 NT5\nNT6 -> NT8 NT4\nNT6 -> NT9 NT2\nNT6 -> NT6 NT8 \u2192 This is the same as NT6 \u2192 NT6 AND NT8? Or is this a duplicate? Probably a typo in my reading. Let's check again.\n\nNo, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nNT6 -> NT3 NT6\nNT6 -> NT4 NT5\nNT6 -> NT8 NT4\nNT6 -> NT9 NT2\nNT6 -> NT6 NT8 \u2192 That's redundant since it's the same as the first rule but without the restriction. So, perhaps in the original, it's just different steps.\n\nBut I don't see NT6 \u2192 't8' in the right-hand sides. Instead, the right-hand side of NT6 can be NT3 NT6, which would imply that to get t8, there must be a path where NT6 expands to a terminal. Looking through other rules, I don't see NT6 producing t8 directly. Instead, NT8 \u2192 t8 might be involved because NT6 can derive NT8...\n\nWait, let's check NT8:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT2 \u2192 t37, but also NT8 \u2192 t52, among others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me retrace:\n\nEach terminal in the string must be generated by a rule that directly maps a non-terminal to that terminal.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that every 't' in the string is covered by some production rule that directly expands a non-terminal to that 't'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each of the terminals in the string has a production rule:\n\n- t14 from NT9 \u2192 t14\n\n- t42 from NT9 \u2192 t42\n\n- t52 from NT8 \u2192 t52\n\n- t88 from NT9 \u2192 t88\n\n- t60 from NT0 \u2192 t60\n\n- t40 from NT1 \u2192 t40\n\n- t23 from NT8 \u2192 t23\n\n- t90 from NT9 \u2192 t90\n\n- t75 from NT9 \u2192 t75\n\n- t33 from NT2 \u2192 t33\n\n- t65 from NT3 \u2192 t65\n\n- t8 from NT6 \u2192 t8\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t75, which is from NT9 \u2192 t75, yes.\n\nSo, wait, for t8, the only production is NT6 \u2192 't8', yes, in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nYes, in the right-hand sides, there's NT6 -> t8.\n\nWait, looking through the initial grammar input:\n\nYes, towards the end, after all the symbols with arrows, the last few rules include NT6 -> t8.\n\nWait, but in the initial user input, under the grammar section, in the terminal productions, for NT6 -> t8 appears.\n\nYes, here:\n\n\"NT6 -> NT8 NT4\"\n\nWait, no, wait: Wait, no.

The string is `t91 t41 t10 t70 t40 t99 t10 t10 t19 t91 t8 t12 t33 t23 t19 t88 t90`. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make things a bit easier because each step of derivation will involve expanding a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are both non-terminals (like S, NT3, NT9, etc.) and terminals (t-something). Wait, no\u2014it might be that the terminals are actually the 't'-prefixed items, but I have to be careful. Wait, no, the grammar is in CNF, so all productions either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So in this case, some of the productions expand into a terminal, like NT9 -> 't91', or NT0 -> 't13', etc. So each production either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the string consists entirely of terminals, which are combinations like t91, t40, etc. So each of these must correspond to terminals in the grammar. \n\nNow, looking at the string, it's `t91 t41 t10 t70 t40 t99 t10 t10 t19 t91 t8 t12 t33 t23 t19 t88 t90`.\n\nI think the approach should be to start from the start symbol S and try to derive the string step by step, but that might take a really long time. Alternatively, perhaps we can parse the string top-down or bottom-up.\n\nBut considering the time, maybe a better approach is to check if each token in the string can be generated by the grammar, or if there's a way to break down the string into the productions.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so each element is a terminal. So we can look at each part and see if the grammar can generate each token.\n\nAnother idea is to check the structure using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So the string, being a sequence of terminals, will be a series of nodes that must have been expanded from a starting non-terminal.\n\nLet me first try to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string:\n\nt91 t41 t10 t70 t40 t99 t10 t10 t19 t91 t8 t12 t33 t23 t19 t88 t90.\n\nI notice that t91 is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT9 -> 't91', and that's a production. So t91 is directly generated by NT9. So the first token is okay.\n\nSimilarly, t41: looking through the productions, NT4 -> 't88' and NT0 -> 't40' are direct terminals. Hmm, but where is t41? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production that directly gives t41. Wait, did I miss that? Let me scan the list again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT9 -> 't91', NT8 -> 't52', NT0 -> 't13', NT6 -> 't34', NT1 -> 't25', NT7 -> 't40', NT5 -> 't91', NT6 -> 't65', NT3 -> 't30', NT8 -> 't37', NT9 -> 't75', NT2 -> 't33', NT6 -> 't8', NT1 -> 't40', NT7 -> 't10', NT1 -> 't19', NT1 -> 't12', NT4 -> 't88', NT2 -> 't37', NT3 -> 't90', NT9 -> 't60', NT7 -> 't70', NT8 -> 't41', etc.\n\nWait, there's a production NT8 -> 't41', which means t41 is generated directly by NT8. So the second token is t41, which is NT8, which is directly a terminal. So that's okay.\n\nThird token is t10, which is produced by NT7, since NT7 -> 't10'. So that's okay.\n\nFourth token is t70, which is NT7 producing t70. So that's okay.\n\nFifth token is t40, which is produced by NT0, as NT0 -> 't40'. So that's okay.\n\nSixth token is t99: looking at the productions, is there a production for t99? Looking through, I don't see any production that has t99 as a terminal. The maximum I see is NT9 -> 't75', NT9 -> 't60', etc. So unless t99 is produced by some NT, it's not directly a terminal. Therefore, the sixth token is t99, but I don't see any production that directly gives t99. So that might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe it's a result of a non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, maybe t99 is produced by a non-terminal that can eventually derive into t99. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce t99 through a chain.\n\nLooking at the first few productions, I don't see any production to t99 except perhaps through other steps. Let me check if any non-terminal leads to t99 via other terminals.\n\nFor example, is there a non-terminal that produces something leading to t99?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT9 -> 't91' and other productions like NT8 -> 't41'. Let me see if any sequence can lead to t99.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if the grammar includes a production that can reach t99. But looking through the given productions, none of the terminals are t99 except if it's produced by a non-terminal. So perhaps the string has a token that is not present in the grammar, making it impossible.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking through again:\n\nThe productions include:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nNT9 -> 't60'\n\nNT7 -> 't40'\n\nNT5 -> 't91'\n\nNT6 -> 't34'\n\nAnd others, but where is t99?\n\nI don't see any production that directly produces t99, so unless t99 is produced by some NT that is itself a child of another NT which gives t99, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any such path. The only way is if some production of NT2, NT3, etc., can lead to t99.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I can look for the context-free grammar to see if all the given terminals can be derived.\n\nSo perhaps the sixth token t99 is not present, so the string can't be generated. But I need to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t99 is produced by a non-terminal.

So unless there is a way that some non-terminal, when expanded, can lead to t99, which I don't think is the case.\n\nLooking through all the productions, except for the terminals, they seem to break down into other non-terminals or a mix of non-terminals and terminals. So for example, NT9 can produce 't75' or 't60', but nothing else.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because it structures the derivations in a binary tree fashion, making it easier to track the steps.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t23 t23 t75 t30 t99 t91 t42 t90 t13 t90 t25 t91 t10 t12 t34 t60 t41 t30`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a sequence of terminal symbols. My job is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two main productions: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT2 NT9. Let me note that down because any valid string must start with either NT3 NT9 or NT2 NT9.\n\nLet me check the possible starting points in the string. The string starts with t23, which is a terminal symbol. I need to find which non-terminals can produce t23.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces t23. So, this makes me think that either the string doesn't start with a production that can derive t23, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for rules that eventually derive a t23 through a chain of productions. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nI see NT8 \u2192 't52' and NT6 \u2192 't34'. Hmm, no t23 directly there. Let me check NT2: there are multiple rules for NT2, for example, NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8. If I follow that, I need to see if NT6 and NT8 can produce t23.\n\nBut NT6's production is NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, and so on. I don't see t23 appearing anywhere in the rules for NT2 or NT6 or NT8. Maybe I'm going the wrong way. Perhaps t23 comes from NT6?\n\nWait, I think I see something. The rule NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and in the string, I have t23 appearing after some other ts. Hmm, perhaps I should consider all possible paths that could produce t23.\n\nWait, but the non-terminals don't produce t23 directly. So unless t23 is derived from a combination of other non-terminals, it might not be possible.\n\nLooking again, the S production has either NT3 NT9 or NT2 NT9. Let me check if either NT3 or NT2 can produce t23.\n\nLooking at NT3: it has a production NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and further down NT2 productions. For example, NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT1 or NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT8, etc. It seems NT3 and NT2 can derive into different combinations but not t23.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm stuck because I can't directly get t23. Perhaps I should check if t23 is part of the string and see if it can be derived at all.\n\nWait, the string has t23 t23. That's two t23 in a row. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step adds two symbols. Unless a rule produces t23 directly, which it doesn't, it's impossible to have t23 in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again to see if any NT can produce t23. Looking through all the rules, no NT appears directly on the right-hand side to produce t23.\n\nSo, unless t23 is a derived symbol through some combination, but the rules don't provide that. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because t23 can't be produced from any non-terminal.\n\nI think the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given grammar.

The string is `t13 t37 t13 t41 t75 t34 t37 t99 t34 t19 t42 t40 t25 t75 t37 t14 t88 t8`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This makes the derivation trees straightforward because each step involves splitting a symbol into two parts.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the productions, I notice that most rules are of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, where X, Y, Z are digits. Some terminals are present, like `t13`, `t37`, etc. The goal is to see if the string can be generated by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which in the first part of the grammar has two rules:\n- S -> NT3 NT9\n- S -> NT3 NT2\n\nBut in the given string, the very first token is `t13`, which suggests that maybe the start rule used is S -> NT3 NT9 because NT9 translates to `t13` as per the terminal rules.\n\nWait, let me check the terminal rules:\n- NT9 -> 't75' when I look at the rules, but wait, in the provided grammar, for example, NT9 -> NT3 NT7 and NT7 -> 't40', but in the terminals, I see NT0 -> 't13', NT9 -> 't75', etc. So perhaps the mapping is different.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions:\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT8 -> 't37'\n- NT9 -> 't75' (from NT9 -> 't75')\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT5 -> 't91'\n- NT9 (other rule) -> 't75'\nWait, actually, looking through, it's clear that some NTX produce terminals, and others produce non-terminals. For example, NT9 can produce NT3 NT7 (which would then produce 't30' and 't10') or 't75'. Similarly, NT3 can produce 't30' directly, but also through other rules.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals starting with `t13`, which suggests that the first part of the derivation starts with S -> NT3 NT9. So S becomes NT3 and NT9. Then, we need to see if NT3 and NT9 can derive the rest of the string.\n\nStarting with NT3: From the grammar, NT3 can produce NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7, or directly 't30'. So, looking at the string, after the first `t13`, the next token is `t37`, which is 't37' from NT8. Hmm, but how does that connect to NT3 and NT9?\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by reconstructing possible parse trees or seeing if the string can be split into parts that match the production rules.\n\nAnother approach is to break the string into tokens and see if each can be generated by the grammar, building a derivation from S to this string.\n\nLet me list the tokens in the string:\n\nt13, t37, t13, t41, t75, t34, t37, t99, t34, t19, t42, t40, t25, t75, t37, t14, t88, t8.\n\nWait, but I'm looking at the string, it's separated by spaces, so each word is a single token. So 18 tokens in total.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production splits a symbol into two, and the entire string will be derived by a series of such splits.\n\nBut tracking all 18 tokens manually is complex. Maybe I can check the first few tokens and see if they can come from the start symbol.\n\nThe first token is `t13`. This must come from a NTX that produces `t13` or a chain of non-terminals that end in `t13`. Looking at the terminal rules, NT0 -> 't13', and NT9 -> 't75', but wait, does any NTX directly produce `t13`? Yes, NT0 -> 't13'. But in the productions, NT0 has multiple rules, including NT2 NT2 and NT5 NT7, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with `t13`, which means it's either from NT0 -> 't13' or from a non-terminal that eventually produces `t13`. But according to the terminal rules, NT0 is one of the non-terminals that produce 't13' directly. So how did S produce `t13`?\n\nIf S is S -> NT3 NT9, then NT3 and NT9 must derive strings whose product is the given string. But if the string starts with `t13`, which is 't13', that would require that the first step in NT3 or NT9 produces 't13'.\n\nLooking at NT3: NT3-> NT6 NT2, or NT3-> NT0 NT7, or NT3-> 't30'. None of these directly produce 't13'. Similarly, NT9 can produce NT3 NT7, which would then derive 't30' and 't10', but not 't13' directly. Wait, but in the terminal rules, NT9-> 't75' and NT3-> 't30', so none of them produce 't13'. So how does S start with `t13`?\n\nWait, looking at the terminal rules again, perhaps I miscounted. Let me re-examine the terminal productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar, the terminal rules are:\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\nNT9 -> 't75'\nNT3 -> 't30'\nNT8 -> 't37'\nNT9 (another rule) -> 't75'\nNT2 -> 't33'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT1 -> 't40'\nNT7 -> 't10'\nNT4 -> 't88'\nNT5 -> 't91'\nNT9 (another rule) -> 't99' [Wait, no, let's check: Are there two NT9 rules? Looking back, I see:\n\nYes, the terminal rules have:\nNT9 -> 't75'\nand\nNT9 -> 't99'?\n\nWait, let me look:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- The terminal rules are mixed with non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT2 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT7 -> NT6 NT5\n- NT5 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT1 NT3\n- NT6 -> NT8 NT4\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. The terminal rules are where a non-terminal directly maps to a single terminal. So, let's find all NTX -> t, where t is a terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT8 -> 't37'\n- NT9 (another rule) -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT5 -> 't91'\n- NT9 (another rule) -> 't99'?\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nLooking carefully, I can compile all the terminal productions:\n\nNT0 -> 't13' (appears twice, but the same)\nNT3 -> 't30'\nNT8 -> 't37' (appears multiple times)\nNT9 (from NT9 -> 't75' and another where?)

First, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) is a set of production rules that generate strings through rewriting of symbols.

Scanning, NT3 \u2192 't30' and other productions of NT3 don't seem to produce 't34'. Alternatively, looking at NT4: maybe NT4 can produce 't88' or other tokens. Maybe elsewhere. Wait, wait, another way: Do any non-terminals produce 't34'? Checking the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't34' is one production. So 't34' can come from NT6.\n\nSo, after 't34', we have 't13'.

So NT2 again.\n\nNext 't12' again: same as before, NT9 \u2192 't12'.\n\nThen 't23' again: same, NT2 \u2192 't23'.\n\nThen 't10': Looking for 't10', which comes from NT7 \u2192 't10'.\n\nThen 't37' again: From NT2, as before.\n\nThen 't34' again: From NT6.\n\nThen 't99' comes from NT9 \u2192 't99'.\n\nThen 't8' from NT6 \u2192 't8'.\n\nNext 't22': Let's see, checking productions, does any NT produce 't22'? Looking, I see NT9 \u2192 't22' is a production, so NT9.\n\nThen 't70' comes from NT7 \u2192 't70'.\n\nThen 't8' again: from NT6.\n\nThen 't99' again: NT9.\n\nFinally, 't8' again: NT6.\n\nWait, this seems very detailed, but did I miss anything? Or did I make a mistake in the mapping? Let me double-check each token.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps it's better to try to parse the string using the grammar, step by step, starting from S and see if it can derive the string.\n\nBut that might take a lot of time. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of a Derivator.\n\nBut maybe a more efficient way is to realize that the string starts with t33 and t37, which suggests that the initial part is derived from NT2 (since t33 is from NT2 \u2192 t37, and then another part). Wait, but NT2 can produce 't37' directly after 't33'.\n\nWait, but after 't37', the next token is 't34', which is 't34', not 't33' again. So perhaps the structure is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the start symbol S. S can be rewritten in two ways: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t33, which is from NT2. So perhaps the first production S \u2192 NT3 NT2 might not be relevant because it starts with NT3. Wait, or maybe the string starts with a production that produces 't33', which is NT2, and then perhaps NT2 can derive more tokens.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to map each token step by step, ensuring that each comes from a production.\n\nLet me try to map each token:\n\n1. t33: from NT2 \u2192 t33. So S \u2192 NT3 NT2? Wait, no, S directly can't be followed by NT2. Hmm, S produces either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT2, which would be two consecutive non-terminals. Then, each of these can be rewritten into sequences of terminals.\n\nWait, so let's see: the string starts with t33, which is from NT2. So the first non-terminal must be NT2. But S can start with NT3 NT9, not NT2. So how can we get NT2 from S?\n\nAh, wait, perhaps S produces NT3 followed by NT2? So, S can be rewritten as NT3 NT2. So first, NT3 is rewritten, then NT2.\n\nWait, NT3 is followed by 't33', but looking at the productions, NT3 can produce 't30' directly, but our string starts with 't33', which is from NT2. So perhaps this approach is not working. Maybe I should consider that the string doesn't start with S, which can't directly produce t33 because S's productions start with NT3 or NT2 as the second part.\n\nWait, S can be rewritten as NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Now, each of these non-terminals (NT3 and NT2) can be further rewritten into sequences.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't33' which is from NT2, so perhaps the first symbol in the string is derived from NT2 \u2192 t33. So the first part is NT2 \u2192 t33. But then the second part comes from NT3. Wait, but in S's production, the first part is NT3 and the second is NT2, so after S \u2192 NT3 NT2, the first non-terminal is NT3, and the second is NT2. So, to produce 't33', perhaps we have to have NT2 produce 't33' in the second position, which could come from a production.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be parsed back into the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. 't33' comes from NT2 \u2192 t33.\n2. Next is 't37'. So after NT2, we have to get a 't37'. Since NT2 \u2192 t37 is also an option, maybe the next symbol comes from another NT2 production, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe after nt2 \u2192 t33, the next symbol comes from NT3.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to think about this as a sequence of symbols generated by the grammar's productions. Maybe I should approach it by building a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the entire string step by step, making sure each token comes from a production.\n\nBut maybe another approach: checking if the string starts with any of the possible first symbols of the grammar. The start symbol S can produce sequences that start with NT3 or NT2. Now, look at the first token in the string, 't33', which is from NT2. So the first production should be S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Because if it's S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the first symbol would be from NT3.\n\nSo, from S \u2192 NT3 NT2, the first symbol is NT3, and the second is NT2. But the first token in the string is 't33' (from NT2). That suggests that perhaps the NT2 comes first,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-368","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is \"t42 t52 t34 t99 t34 t22 t37 t8 t14 t23 t34 t90 t10 t25 t14 t37 t33 t8 t60\", and the grammar has a lot of production rules. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the grammar consists of. It looks like non-terminals are represented by sequences like NT3, NT8, etc., which eventually map to terminals (the 't' followed by numbers). Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nMy task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules. \n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into tokens: \n\nt42, t52, t34, t99, t34, t22, t37, t8, t14, t23, t34, t90, t10, t25, t14, t37, t33, t8, t60.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminals. I'll need to see if this sequence can be generated by expanding the non-terminals step by step until all are replaced by terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal should expand into two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and also S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Wait, in the first rule, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then looking at NT3 and NT9, each might have their own expansions.\n\nLet me try to find possible expansions. Starting from S, the first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the string starts with t... which could be from NT3 or NT9. Looking at the string, it starts with t42, so let's see where that could come from.\n\nLooking up NT3 in the grammar rules:\n\nNT3 can produce NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. So the first token after NT3's expansion would be a non-terminal. Similarly for NT9, let's check its productions.\n\nNT9 can produce 't75', 't60', etc. Wait, in the grammar, NT9 has several productions ending with t strings, like 't37', 't60', etc. For instance, NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7, NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1, NT9 \u2192 NT2 NT9. So NT9 can expand into various terminal sequences.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t42. So for t42 to come from NT3, we need to see if NT3 can directly produce t42. Checking NT3's productions, I don't see NT3 \u2192 t42. NT3 can only produce non-terminals. Similarly, looking up NT9, none of its immediate productions produce t42 as a terminal. So perhaps t42 comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me check all non-terminals. Hmm, looking at NT2, one of its productions is NT2 \u2192 't33'... or check other rules.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for example, NT2 has NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and so on. But 't33' is part of the string. Wait, looking back, one of NT6's productions is NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps t42 is part of a non-terminal expansion. Let me look through each non-terminal to see if they can produce t42.\n\nLooking at the rules for each non-terminal, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13' etc., but no 't42' for NT0.\n- NT1 \u2192 't25', 't40', etc.\n- NT2 has rules like NT2 \u2192 't33', so t33 could be from NT2. Also, NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8, etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, or NT0 NT7. Doesn't produce t42.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0, etc., but not t42.\n- NT5, NT6, NT7, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps t42 is part of NT6. Let me check the rules for NT6:\n\nNT6 can expand into NT8 NT4, or NT9 NT2, or others. Let's see if any of these could produce 't42' as a terminal. For example, in NT6's rules, one is NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT9. \n\nWait, but none of the immediate productions of any non-terminal end with t42 except perhaps NT2. Let me see if any of the rules for NT2 include t42. Looking for NT2 rules: Does NT2 have a production ending with 't42'? Looking through all NT2 rules, I see NT2 \u2192 't33', which is a terminal. Also, another rule says NT2 \u2192 't56'? Or was that something else.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, under NT2, there's a production NT2 \u2192 't33'. So the token t33 would come from NT2. Similarly, there's NT2 \u2192 't56', perhaps. Wait, in the initial list, under NT2, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't33'\n\nAlso, under NT2, there's \"NT2-> 't56'? Let me recount. Wait, looking at the list: \n\nAfter the initial list, I see several lines like:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't60'\n\nAnd so on. So, for example, NT2 has several rules, one of which is NT2 \u2192 't33'. So t33 would come from NT2. Similarly, other rules might produce t56 or other strings, but perhaps none produce t42 as a terminal. So perhaps t42 comes from a non-terminal that eventually expands into t42.\n\nLooking at the rules, is there any non-terminal that can directly produce 't42'? Let's go through each non-terminal:\n\n- NT0: does any rule for NT0 end with 't42'? Looking: NT0 \u2192 't13', 't22', 't25', 't14', 't40', etc. Not t42.\n- NT1: rules end with 't25', 't40', etc. No t42.\n- NT2: does any rule directly produce 't42'? Let me check all NT2 rules:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8 (again)\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nWait, is there any NT2 rule that directly results in t42? Or perhaps, does any rule for NT2 have a terminal that is t42? No, only NT2 \u2192 't33' and others. So 't33' comes from NT2.\n\nThen t42 must come from a non-terminal that expands into NT2, and in turn, t33 comes from NT2. Or perhaps, it's another route.\n\nWait, perhaps 't42' is part of a longer production. For instance, if a non-terminal A can produce B C, where B is something else and C is a terminal that results in t42.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 't42' comes from NT3, which in turn is produced by NT6 and NT2. If NT6 can produce t42, or if NT2 can, but we saw that NT2 doesn't directly produce t42. So perhaps it's not possible.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this methodically.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, we can think of the parse tree starting from S and expanding until all leaves are terminals.\n\nThe string is: t42, t52, t34, t99, t34, t22, t37, t8, t14, t23, t34, t90, t10, t25, t14, t37, t33, t8, t60\n\nI can count the number of tokens: 18.\n\nStarting with S, which can expand into NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nLet's try the first option: S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the first part is NT3, which expands into NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7.\n\nLooking at the next token: t42. If the first part is NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, then the first output is NT6 and then NT2.\n\nBut NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, NT9, etc. So maybe the first token t42 comes from NT6.\n\nWait, no.

Let me consider that each token is a terminal, and I need to derive the string by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is a binary split, so the derivation will split the string into a tree.\n\nThe string is: t60 t19 t25 t10 t90 t10 t90 t19 t70 t14 t42 t33 t23 t91 t90 t30 t34 t60 t34 t19.\n\nWait, this is 20 tokens. Since each step in the derivation splits into two, the number of steps should match. But this might not be necessary right now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for a possible derivation path.\n\nLooking at the first token, t60, which is generated by NT9. So the first non-terminal is NT9.\n\nThen, the rest of the string must be derived from NT9 after the initial split.\n\nBut wait, S initially splits into NT3 and NT9. So T1 is t60, which comes from NT9, so that part is NT9 \u2192 t60. Then, the other part is NT3, which needs to generate the rest of the string.\n\nSo after the initial split, we have NT3 and NT9. But NT9 is now processed to t60, and the next part is NT3, which now must be processed.\n\nWait, but we have the entire string to match. So let's think in reverse. The entire string is a sequence of terminals, which must be produced by some sequence of non-terminals expanding into them.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string using the grammar's productions, starting from S and expanding.\n\nLet me start:\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNow, T1 is t60, so NT9 \u2192 t60.\n\nSo, T1 is matched by NT9, leaving NT3 to generate T2-T20.\n\nNow, after NT9 is handled, we need to expand NT3.\n\nLooking into NT3's productions:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT3 \u2192 NT1 NT2 (looking, but I might have missed some; need to check.)\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar provided, which is extensive.

{"custom_id":"request-384","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm. The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. I've just started learning about this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar. It looks like it's a series of productions where each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals. Some of those non-terminals are actually terminals with specific string representations. For example, look at the productions for 't88', 't99', etc. Each of these must correspond to specific tokens in the input string.\n\nWait, the input string is `t88 t99 t40 t10 t91 t10 t37 t19 t42 t34 t34 t99 t25 t13 t90 t52 t8 t8 t90 t40`. So each token is separated by a space, and each is a string. My job is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, I think the process involves trying to split the string into the non-terminal symbols as per the grammar. Since it's Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two non-terminals. So the string should be broken down into pairs that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start by seeing how many tokens there are. The string has 20 tokens. Since each production generates two tokens, I expect that the number of tokens should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions steps. But 20 isn't a power of two. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, no, the initial string is the input, and the grammar is being applied recursively from S. Each production replaces a non-terminal with two, so the total number of tokens created would double each time. But since here, we're starting from S, and the string is a flattened version, the total number of tokens should be a power of two. However, 20 isn't. So that might indicate that the string isn't generated by this grammar, but I can't be sure yet because the grammar could have multiple paths that combine in different ways.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial string is the result of applying the grammar's rules, but I need to reconstruct a parse tree. It might help to look for the root symbol S and see if I can split the string into two parts that can be generated from S's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So the entire string must be split into two parts that each can be generated by either NT3 or NT2 as their root.\n\nFirst, let's look for where NT3 and NT2 would expand to in the string. Each of these is a non-terminal that expands into other non-terminals, which might eventually lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT3 and NT2 to see how they can expand.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3 has productions like:\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT3 -> NT9 NT9\nWait, wait, actually, looking again, the grammar starts as:\nS -> NT3 NT3 or S -> NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the first line under S is \"S -> NT3 NT3\" and \"S -> NT3 NT2\". Then under NT8, NT0, etc., there are many productions.\n\nBut when looking for NT3's productions, I see lines like \"NT3 -> NT6 NT2\" and \"NT3 -> NT0 NT7\", but also \"NT9 -> 't75'\". Wait, no, I'm looking for NT3's productions. Let me list all NT3 productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3 has these productions:\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT3 -> NT9 NT9\n- Wait, no, actually, in the given grammar, I see \"NT9 -> 't75'\", but that's a terminal, not an NT3. So in the grammar, let me find all NT3 productions.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT3 -> NT9 NT9 (Wait, no, line says \"NT9 -> 't75'\", so no, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, only NT3's productions are as follows:\n\n1. NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n2. NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n3. NT3 -> NT9 NT9\n4. NT3 -> ... (Wait, let me check carefully.)\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\nAfter \"NT3 -> NT6 NT2\" comes \"NT3 -> NT8 NT4\", but wait, that's not correct\u2014I must have made a mistake earlier. Wait no, the grammar entries after NT9's are all individual productions, each line being a production for a specific non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, each line starts with a non-terminal, followed by ->, then two non-terminals.\n\nSo, to find NT3's productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2 (line starting with NT6)\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7 (line starting with NT0)\n- NT3 -> NT8 NT4?

The string consists of a series of terminals: t19, t60, etc. My task is to see if this string can be derived from S by applying the productions in the grammar.\n\nThe approach is to simulate the derivation process, starting with S and checking if all the terminals in the string can be generated step by step according to the productions.\n\nS starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9 (another option is S \u2192 NT3 NT2). Let's choose the first option because it's the one that may lead to the string. So, S becomes NT3 NT9.\n\nNow, we need to expand NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT9 \u2192 several options, including NT3 NT7, NT6 NT1, etc. From the string, the first token is t19, so let's see which production of NT9 can produce t19. Looking at NT9's productions: NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7, NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1, NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT8, etc. We need to find a sequence of NT9 productions that can produce t19. \n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT9's productions are:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT8\n\nLooking at the string's first token, t19. So maybe NT9 can expand to something that produces t19. Let's check NT9's productions. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, and if NT1 \u2192 t19, that would give t19. Let me check the productions for NT1:\n\nNT1 has a production NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8. Looking at NT4's options, NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8 or NT7 NT0. Hmm, and NT8 can produce t42, etc. Wait, perhaps NT4 can produce t25 because NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8, and NT2 might produce t25 via NT2 \u2192 't25'. Let me check NT2's productions: NT2 \u2192 't33' or other non-terminals. But in the string, t25 is there, so perhaps NT2 is producing 't25'. \n\nWait, let's back up. The first token is t19, which could come from NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5. If NT1 \u2192 t19, but looking at NT1's productions: NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8. For NT1 to produce a terminal, it must expand to a production where both sides are terminals. But NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8, and NT8 \u2192 't40' or other productions. Hmm, wait, maybe NT5 can produce t19? Let's check NT5's productions. NT5 \u2192 NT0 NT1, which are both non-terminals, so that can't produce t19 directly.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other NT9 productions: NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1. If NT6 can produce a terminal, and NT1 can produce t19. Let's check NT6: NT6 has productions like NT6 \u2192 't34', 't8', etc. So if NT6 \u2192 't34' and NT1 \u2192 't19', then NT9 \u2192 t34 t19, which would give us t34 t19 as part of the string. But the string starts with t19, so that's not matching. Alternatively, if NT6 \u2192 t19? But looking at NT6's productions, I don't see any directly terminal production except 't34', 't8', etc. So that might not be the case.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's look for t19 in the grammar. Is there any production that includes t19 as a terminal? Checking, NT7 \u2192 't10', NT1 \u2192 possibly? Looking at NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8, which can be expanded further. If NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT1, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps T19 comes from NT1 directly? But I don't see a production for NT1 \u2192 t19, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the productions from NT9 to see if any can produce a terminal that is t19.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions again:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5. If both NT1 and NT5 can produce terminals, but I don't see any direct terminal productions for them yet. So maybe this path isn't leading to t19.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT9 \u2192 NT9 NT9 could produce more tokens, but that's unlikely since it's recursive.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's instead look at the entire string and see if each terminal can be produced by the grammar. The string is a series of terminals, all connected by spaces. So the entire string is a concatenation of these terminals.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT3 NT9. From S, we produce NT3 NT9.\n\nFirst, expand NT3 and NT9.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nSo S becomes NT6 NT2 NT9.\n\nNow, NT6 can produce various things, like NT6 \u2192 't34', 't8', 't9', etc. Let's choose a production for NT6 that can produce a terminal early on. Looking at the string, the second terminal after t19 is t60. So maybe nt6 should produce t60. Is that possible?\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5 or NT9 NT2 or NT5 NT7. Wait, none of these directly produce terminals because NT4, NT5, NT2, NT7, NT9 are non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps NT6 can expand to another NT6, which could eventually produce a 't60'.\n\nWait, but that might take a long time. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me check if any non-terminal can produce t60.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT8 \u2192 't52', 't60', etc. So maybe NT8 can produce t60. Is there a way for NT6 to produce NT8? Let's check NT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, which is an option. So NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4. If NT8 can produce t60, then that could create 't60' in the string.\n\nSo let's proceed: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4.\n\nThen the string becomes NT8 NT4 NT2 NT9.\n\nNow, expand NT8: NT8 has options like 't52', 't60', 't41', etc. We need t60, so let's choose NT8 \u2192 't60'.\n\nNow the string is t60 NT4 NT2 NT9.\n\nWait, but NT4 is a non-terminal, so we need to expand NT4.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8 or NT7 NT0.\n\nIf we choose NT4 \u2192 't25' directly? No, because NT4's productions are all involving other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps NT4 can produce a terminal. Let me check NT4's productions again.\n\nWait, the production NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0 OR NT2 NT8 OR NT9 NT1. None of these directly produce terminals. So perhaps NT4 needs to be expanded multiple times until it reaches a terminal.\n\nLooking further down the grammar, I see that some non-terminals can produce terminals:\n\nNT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 't33' or others. Wait, yes, NT2 \u2192 't33' is one of the productions, so that's a terminal. So if NT2 produces 't33', then in the string, the fifth token is 't14', which might not be 't33'. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's step through again.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nS becomes NT6 NT2 NT9.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 (since that's an option).\n\nNow, NT8 has options. We need 't60', so let's pick NT8 \u2192 't60'.\n\nNow we have t60, then NT4, then NT2, then NT9.\n\nSo the expansion is t60 NT4 NT2 NT9.\n\nNow expand NT4.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I observe that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This type of grammar is useful for certain parsing algorithms, but here, I need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: each 't' followed by a number. My goal is to see if these terminals can be produced by the grammar. To do this, I should map the terminals to their corresponding non-terminals based on the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list out the right-hand sides of the rules to see how terminals map to non-terminals:\n\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n- NT3 -> 't90'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT7 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't42'\n- NT9 -> 't22'\n- etc.\n\nI can create a mapping where each terminal is a value, and the non-terminals correspond to their production rules. For example, 't14' must be produced by a specific non-terminal. From the rules, I don't see a direct production for 't14', but wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, each production rule's right-hand side produces certain terminals. For example, in the grammar, there's a rule like NT1 -> 't40'. Similarly, NT2 can produce 't33'. So, each terminal corresponds to a specific production rule.\n\nSo, for each 't' in the string, I need to find which production rule in the grammar generates it. Let's list out each term and their corresponding non-terminal:\n\n- `t14` \u2192 Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a rule where the RHS is 't14'. Wait, in the rules provided, the NT1 has multiple productions that include 't40' but not 't14'. So maybe 't14' is produced by a specific NT. Let me check through the rules to see if any NT has a production leading to 't14'.\n\nWait, the grammar includes rules like:\n- NT2 \u2192 't37'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n- NT1 \u2192 't40', 't19', 't12', etc.\n- Looking further: yes, in the grammar rules, I see that NT7 has a production NT7 -> 't70', and NT9 produces 't75', etc. Hmm, wait, perhaps 't14' is not directly produced by any single rule. But that can't be, since the string must be in the language if generated by the grammar. So, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe each terminal is generated by a specific non-terminal. For instance, 't14' could be produced by NT6, but looking at the rules, NT6 -> 't34' (among others), but wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT6:\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT6 -> 't37'\n- NT6 -> 't90'\n- NT6 -> 't34' \u2192 That's 't34', not 't14'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't14' is generated via another path. Let me check if any NT rule produces 't14'. Scanning through the rules, I don't immediately see an NT that produces 't14' as a terminal. So perhaps 't14' is part of a non-terminal's production path that eventually generates other non-terminals, leading to the terminals.\n\nWait, but each terminal in the string must be generated by some NT. Since the grammar doesn't explicitly show a rule that produces 't14', maybe 't14' is part of a larger production. For example, if an NT can produce a sequence that includes 't14' as one of the terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, 't14' appears twice. So it must be generated by two different non-terminals or the same one through different productions. Alternatively, perhaps 't14' is generated indirectly through a series of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built by breaking down each 't' into a sequence of non-terminals until all are resolved into terminals. Let's try that.\n\nThe string is: t14 t33 t23 t40 t42 t40 t90 t33 t99 t40 t13 t52 t41 t33 t99 t22 t70 t14 t70 t30 t42.\n\nI can write this as a sequence of terminals: [t14, t33, t23, t40, t42, t40, t90, t33, t99, t40, t13, t52, t41, t33, t99, t22, t70, t14, t70, t30, t42].\n\nEach of these must be produced by some rule. Starting with t14: looking through the rules, I don't see a direct NT rule that produces 't14'. Hmm. That's a problem because if 't14' isn't a terminal in any production, then it can't be derived. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps 't14' is a placeholder, but looking through the rules, let's see:\n\nNT6 -> 't8' \u2192 doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a production that produces 't14'. Let me check all the production rules again. Hmm, I see that NT2 has 't33' and 't37', but no 't14'. NT1 has 't40', 't19', 't12'. NT7 has 't70' and 't10' (from earlier rules like NT7 -> 't60', etc.), but I don't see a rule for 't14'. So perhaps this string cannot be generated by the grammar, which would mean the answer is No.\n\nWait, but the user provided 20 't' terms, each representing a terminal. So each must be produced by some NT production. Since 't14' is not present as a terminal in any production rule, it's impossible to generate a 't14' term. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nHowever, perhaps I missed something in the rules. Let me re-examine the grammar to see if any NT's production results in 't14'. Scanning:\n\nLooking for any 't14' in the productions:\n\n- I don't see any production where the RHS is 't14'. The closest I see is 't75' for NT9, 't33' for NT2, etc.\n\nSo since 't14' is not directly produced by any production rule, the grammar cannot generate a string containing 't14'. Therefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, S \u2192 NT3 NT2 or S \u2192 NT3 NT9.

Hmm, I need to find a production of NT3 that can start with t14.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals that can produce t14: Looking through non-terminals, it seems NT1 can produce t14 because at the end, NT1 \u2192 't40', but looking again, maybe I missed it.

So, maybe I should track the parsing steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production NT0 \u2192 't12' and NT2 has t52, so maybe the first NT2 is t52, and the NT3 needs to produce t14.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Since I'm more familiar with writing out the steps, let me try to parse the string manually, though this might take some time.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: t19, t23, t14, t14, t88, t52, t91, t65, t10, t37, t30, t41, t23, t42, t19, t14, t14, t22, t75, t23, t10, t52.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has the following productions:\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo, the first step is to expand S into either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let's choose the first option: NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nSo, NT3 can expand into NT6 and NT2.\n\nNow, NT6's productions:\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6 | NT4 NT5\n\nLet's pick NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5.\n\nNow, NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0 or NT2 NT1. Let's choose NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0.\n\nNT7's productions: NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4 or NT6 NT5. Let's pick NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this systematically. Let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t19, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t19? Let's check the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n- NT9 \u2192 t75\n- NT8 \u2192 t37, t41, t52, t65, t88, t91, t60, t70, etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n- NT5 \u2192 t91, t37\n- NT2 \u2192 various t's like t33, t37, t23, t42, t52\n- NT4 \u2192 t88, t22, t99, etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 t30, t90, t37\n- NT6 \u2192 t34, t8, t65, etc.\n- NT0 \u2192 t13, t22, t14, etc.\n- Others like t19 is not directly a terminal; wait, looking back, I think I missed some. Let me scan the entire list again for 't19'. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8, but that's non-terminal. It doesn't directly produce t19. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake. Let me scan all the productions for any NT rule that ends with t19. I don't see any in the given grammar. The provided grammar doesn't have any rules where a non-terminal directly produces t19. So, t19 can only be produced by a non-terminal that eventually expands into a terminal string that includes t19. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t19. Let me check again carefully.\n\nLooking through every line, after NT9 comes NT8 and a few more:\n\nWait, looking for where a non-terminal ends with \u2192 t19. Scanning through the list, I don't see any such production. For example, NT1 has rules like NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8 and other non-terminals, but none that end with t19. So, the non-terminals that can produce t19 don't exist in this grammar.\n\nWait, but in the string given, we have t19 twice: at positions 3 and 15. So, if our grammar can't produce t19, the string is definitely not in the language.\n\nSo, does this mean that the string cannot be generated because t19 isn't present in the grammar? That would make the answer 'No'.\n\nBut I might have missed something. Let me double-check the grammar for any non-terminals that produce t19.\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar list, the last few rules are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t75\nNT8 \u2192 t37, t41, t52, t65, t88, t91, etc., but not t19\nNT7 \u2192 t40, no t19\nNT5 \u2192 t91, t37\nNT6 \u2192 t34, t8, etc.\nNT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8, etc.\nSo, no non-terminal seems to directly produce t19.\n\nTherefore, any occurrence of t19 in the string means the string can't be generated by this grammar. Since the string contains t19 twice, the answer is definitely 'No'.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if perhaps there's a roundabout way to get t19. But looking again, none of the productions for non-terminals produce t19, either directly or indirectly because all t tokens are leaves. So the string is invalid.\n\nThus, the conclusion is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-441","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the string is a sequence of tokens, right? So, each token is part of the grammar's terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar structure. It starts with S -> NT3 NT9, which means the string must start with NT3 followed by NT9. But wait, looking at the string, the first token is 't91'. Does the grammar have an NT3 that produces 't91'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar production rules, I see NT9 -> 't91'. So, if NT9 is present, it can produce 't91'. But wait, how does that fit into the production of S? S starts with NT3 NT9, so the first two symbols should be NT3 and NT9 in that order. But in the string, the first token is 't91', which is NT9. So, that would mean the first part should be NT9, not NT3. But S starts with NT3 NT9, so the first two symbols must be NT3 followed by NT9. So that would require the first two tokens to be 'tXXX' from NT3 and 'tYYY' from NT9. However, the string starts with 't91', not 'tXXX tYYY'. So, maybe the string can't be generated because S starts with NT3 NT9, which would mean the first two tokens should be 'something' that derive from NT3 and NT9. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the grammar works. Let me think: The string is a sequence of tokens, each of which must be matched by the productions. So, the parser would try to parse the string from left to right, choosing productions that match the next tokens.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step. The string is: t91 t22 t25 t41 t33 t70 t99 t42 t23 t10 t40 t40 t25 t41 t23 t52 t60 t34 t14 t75 t65 t14 t22.\n\nFirst, the parser looks at the first token 't91' and checks which NT can produce it. Looking at the grammar, NT9 can produce 't91' because NT9 -> 't91'. So, the parser would use NT9 as a production. But wait, the start symbol is S, which is NT3 NT9. So, S must be NT3 NT9, not NT9 NT3. So, the first two tokens must start with NT3 and NT9, but the string starts with NT9 alone. Therefore, can the parser start with NT9? Or does the start symbol require NT3 NT9?\n\nThis is a crucial point. The start symbol S is S -> NT3 NT9, meaning the first two symbols must be NT3 followed by NT9. So, the parser would look for NT3, and then NT9 as the next step. Let me check what NT3 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT3 has two productions: one produces 't30' and another produces NT0 NT7. \n\nIf the parser uses NT3 -> 't30', then the first token should be t30, but our string starts with t91. So that production doesn't match. Therefore, the parser must use NT3 -> NT0 NT7. So, after NT3, the next symbol is NT7, which would come after. \n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't91', which is generated by NT9, not NT3. So, maybe the parser can start with NT9? But S starts with NT3 NT9, so the first two tokens should be from NT3 and NT9. Therefore, the string can't be generated because it doesn't start with NT3 followed by NT9. \n\nWait, maybe the string starts with NT9, but the parser can choose a different production for S. But no, S's first production is only NT3 NT9. So, the parser can't start with NT9. It must start with NT3 and then NT9. Therefore, the string starts with 't91', which can't be part of NT3's production.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's another way. Could the parser use some kind of left recursion or something else? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a mix of multiple NT productions, but how does the S production factor in? The S production is S -> NT3 NT9, so the entire string must start with NT3 and NT9. So, the first two tokens must be NT3 and NT9 in that order. But in the string, the first token is NT9, which can't be the first NT3. \n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar because it doesn't start with NT3 followed by NT9. \n\nWait, but maybe the parser can re-arrange the NTs somehow? Like, could it have NT3 produce multiple symbols, and then NT9, but I don't think so. NT3's only production is either 't30' or NT0 NT7, both of which are further into the string. Similarly, NT9 produces 't91' directly. So, the first token being 't91' would have to be from NT9, but that would mean the first part of S is NT9, which is wrong because it's supposed to be NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, to sum up, the string starts with 't91', which is from NT9, but the start symbol S requires NT3 first. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the grammar:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\nOther productions for NT3: -> 't30', or NT0 NT7\nOther NTs have various productions, including NT9 -> 't91'\n\nSo, S's first production is NT3 followed by NT9. To produce the string, it must start with NT3 NT9. Since the string starts with NT9, that production can't be used. Therefore, the answer is No, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-442","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and the string I need to check.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows me to apply algorithms like the CYK algorithm if needed.\n\nThe grammar has several non-terminal symbols, such as S, NT3, NT9, NT8, NT6, NT4, NT2, NT7, NT1, NT0, NT5, NT9, etc. Wait, looking closely, some non-terminals repeat, like NT9. There might be a typo or misalignment in the rules, but I'll proceed assuming each rule is correctly written.\n\nThe final production rules seem to map specific non-terminals to terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 't75', NT1 \u2192 't40', etc. Each rule ends with a terminal symbol, so the process of generating the string will involve replacing non-terminals step by step until all symbols are terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t10 t40 t41 t42 t14 t25 t30 t8 t10 t42 t42 t75 t65 t75 t42 t65 t22 t14 t42 t23 t75 t91 t65`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of 23 tokens (assuming each 't' followed by a number is a single terminal). My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from S using the grammar.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, I can attempt to parse it from left to right, perhaps using the CYK algorithm. Alternatively, I can try to build the derivation tree step by step, ensuring that each production is valid.\n\nLet's start by identifying possible starting points. The start symbol is S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So the string should start with 't...t...' where the first t is from NT3 and the second from NT9 or NT2.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't10'. Let's see if NT3 can produce 't10'. Looking through the rules, NT3 has several productions ending with different terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, etc. It also directly produces terms like 't30', 't37', etc. So, no direct 't10' from NT3. Therefore, 't10' must be derived from a non-terminal that eventually produces 't10'.\n\nWait, but in the rules, NT7 \u2192 't10'. So if a non-terminal A can derive NT7, then A can produce 't10'. Similarly, NT1 \u2192 't40', and some non-terminals derive to NT1, which in turn produces 't40'.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t10 t40. Let's say the first t10 comes from NT7. So, perhaps the first part starts with NT7 \u2192 t10, and then followed by something that produces t40. Let's check the next term, which is t40.\n\nt40 can be produced directly by NT1. So maybe after NT7 comes NT1, giving t10 t40. Let's see if this is possible in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT1 has the production NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8. So to get NT1 to produce t40, NT4 must produce something that can lead to t40, and NT8 must produce something that leads to t40 as well.\n\nWait, NT4 has several productions. For example, NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT8, which when expanded, could eventually lead to t40. Similarly, NT8 can produce 't41' among others. Alternatively, NT9 \u2192 t75, but that's not relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0, but that may lead to different terminals. Let me try to see if there's a path from NT7 to t10, and from NT1 to t40.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Perhaps I should look for a way to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list out the string again for clarity:\n\nt10 t40 t41 t42 t14 t25 t30 t8 t10 t42 t42 t75 t65 t75 t42 t65 t22 t14 t42 t23 t75 t91 t65.\n\nLet me try to break it down. The first two tokens are t10 and t40. Let's see how to get these.\n\nAssuming that S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the first symbol is t from NT3, and the second from NT9. Or S \u2192 NT3 NT2, so first t from NT3, second from NT2.\n\nLet's check NT3's productions. NT3 can produce direct terminals, such as 't30', 't37', etc., but no 't10' directly. So the first symbol t10 must come from a non-terminal derived from NT3, but that non-terminal must produce t10 via some chain.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT3 \u2192 NT9 could happen if NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, and NT0 \u2192 't10'. Wait, no, looking back, NT0's rules include NT0 \u2192 't13', so that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe NT3 is part of a larger derivation that produces t10.\n\nWait, perhaps NT3 can derive into NT9, which can then derive into t10. Let me check: NT9 has a production NT9 \u2192 t75, or NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9. Wait, if NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9, that would allow for multiple t75s? Or maybe NT9 can derive into t75 via NT9 \u2192 't75'. So if NT9 directly produces t75, but that might not help here.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should list the possibilities for each part.\n\nLet me think about the first part: t10. Where can t10 come from? Looking through the rules, the only non-terminals that directly produce t10 are those that derive from NT7. Because NT7 \u2192 t10. So t10 must come from NT7.\n\nSimilarly, t40 can come from NT1, as NT1 \u2192 t40.\n\nSo perhaps the first two symbols are NT7 and NT1, producing t10 t40.\n\nNow, looking at the first part: t10 t40, which would correspond to NT7 \u2192 t10 and NT1 \u2192 t40.\n\nSo, the start symbol S must have a production that allows the first part to derive to NT7 and NT1. Looking at the S productions: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, if the first part is NT7 and NT1, then perhaps S must be able to derive a structure that allows this. Let me see if S can split into NT3 NT9 and NT3 NT2, and then the NT3 part can produce t10, and NT9 or NT2 can produce t40.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part is generated by a different production of S.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to try to parse the string step by step using the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be more systematic. I'll try that approach.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the tokens in the string: t10, t40, t41, t42, t14, t25, t30, t8, t10, t42, t42, t75, t65, t75, t42, t65, t22, t14, t42, t23, t75, t91, t65.\n\nNow, I'll note the positions:\n\n1: t10\n2: t40\n3: t41\n4: t42\n5: t14\n6: t25\n7: t30\n8: t8\n9: t10\n10: t42\n11: t42\n12: t75\n13: t65\n14: t75\n15: t42\n16: t65\n17: t22\n18: t14\n19: t42\n20: t23\n21: t75\n22: t91\n23: t65\n\nUsing the CYK algorithm, I'll create a table where each cell (i,j) represents the range of tokens from position i to j.

They wrote:\n\n\"S -> NT3 NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2 \nNT8 -> NT0 NT2\nNT8 -> NT4 NT2\nNT6 -> NT3 NT6\nNT4 -> NT7 NT0\n... \" and so on, up to \"NT9 -> 't75' NT2 -> 't33' NT6 -> 't8' ...\".\n\nWait, actually, S has two productions: S can be NT3 NT3 NT9 or S can be NT3 NT2. Wait, no, the initial line shows S as producing NT3 twice and then NT9. Or was it S \u2192 NT3 NT3 NT9? That would be a production with three non-terminals. But Chomsky normal form allows only productions with two non-terminals or terminals. So I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the initial part says:\n\n\"S -> NT3 NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2\"\n\nThat's incorrect because Chomsky normal form only allows A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, which means two non-terminals or a terminal in a single production. Having a production with three non-terminals (like NT3 NT3 NT9) would not fit CNF. Therefore, perhaps I've misread. Let me check again: perhaps it's S \u2192 NT3 NT3 NT9, which would be a production of three non-terminals, but that's not allowed in CNF.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, or perhaps it's S \u2192 NT3 NT3 NT9 as a single production. That would be wrong for CNF. Alternatively, maybe the user wrote S \u2192 NT3 NT2 and S \u2192 NT3 NT3 NT9 is not a production at all. Hmm, maybe the user intended something else.

But that seems unlikely because the user is asking to parse the given grammar, so perhaps the user intended to write it correctly.

{"custom_id":"request-464","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t88 t30 t90 t19 t34 t22 t70 t12 t10 t41 t22 t65 t88 t25 t25 t91 t34 t30 t25 t99 t88 t41 t99 t19`. Hmm, that's quite a long string with a lot of symbols. \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals (except for a, which is a terminal). The start symbol isn't a non-terminal, right? So, in this grammar, S is the start symbol, and all the other rules are in CNF. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S can produce NT3 NT9, so S is a non-terminal. The string starts with t88 and ends with t19. I should probably trace back from the end to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol. \n\nWait, actually, in CFGs, we can derive the string by breaking it down step by step. Since it's in CNF, each production only produces two symbols at a time, either a terminal and a non-terminal or two non-terminals. But in this case, the terminal symbols are t13, t25, t30, etc. So, I think each rule that ends with a terminal is the actual terminal in the string.\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly map to terminals. For example, NT9 -> t75, NT8 -> t52, etc. So each rule like NT9 -> t75 is a terminal, meaning the string can be built from these rules. But to build the entire string, it must be a series of rules that, when combined, form the entire string.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string backward. Starting with the last symbol, which is t19. Let's see what rules produce t19. Looking through the rules, I see NT1 -> t25 and others. Wait, no, looking at the given rules, I see:\n\nWait, in the given rules, some have 't' followed by numbers, like t88, t30, etc. So those are terminals. Let me try to find which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nFor example, looking for NT9 -> t19, but I don't see that in the given rules. Hmm, maybe the rules are numerous, so I need to search systematically.

The grammar seems to consist of a bunch of these productions connecting non-terminals until they reach terminals (strings of letters like 't88', 't34', etc.) or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t88 t34 t99 t22 t99 t19 t70 t70 t8 t70 t33 t30 t33 t30 t70 t70 t40 t70 t52 t42 t75 t30 t65 t75 t40`. It's a sequence of 25 tokens, each starting with 't' followed by two digits. I need to determine if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll note that each production in the grammar can only produce exactly two non-terminals or terminals. Since this string is a sequence of terminals, the productions that produce terminals are the ones that 'term' the derivation. To build the string, each step must concatenate two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). So the entire string must have an odd number of symbols, but here it's 25, which is odd, so that's good because a derivation in CNF has a tree with n-1 edges, leading to a string length of n if starting from S. But I'll confirm later.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the grammar by looking at each production and seeing which ones produce 't' followed by two digits. For instance, looking at the productions where a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT6 \u2192 't34'\n- NT1 \u2192 't25'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n- NT6 (multiple times, including some with 't8')\nWait, I notice that some non-terminals have 't' productions. So any time I see a terminal, it must come directly from a production that ends with a terminal.\n\nBut to get the given string, I need to see a way to start from S and expand it into the string. Let's look at the start symbol S. The grammar has S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Since S is followed by two non-terminals, each expansion starts with two NTs.\n\nSo the first step would be S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNT3 has a production: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 or NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. So NT3 can expand into two non-terminals. Similarly, NT9 has several productions, some producing terminals like t75, t60, etc. Looking at NT9: it can produce 't75' directly, among others.\n\nSo let's see: If NT9 produces 't75', that would give us the last symbol of the string. But in the given string, the last token is 't40', which would need to come from NT7 or another NT that produces 't40'. Let's check NT7: one of its productions is NT7 \u2192 't40'.\n\nBut wait, let's look back. The string ends with ... t75 t30 t65 t75 t40. Wait, the last token is t40, which comes from NT7. So maybe the end part involves NT7 \u2192 't40'.\n\nNow, let's try to track back. Let me think about how to produce a long string, but with that given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think about building the string backward to see if we can find a sequence of productions that generate it.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 25 tokens, which suggests that the derivation would have 25 leaves, so the parse tree would have 24 internal nodes. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two symbols, so the derivation would indeed produce a string of length 25.\n\nNow, I can try to split the string into parts corresponding to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list out the string again:\n1. t88\n2. t34\n3. t99\n4. t22\n5. t99\n6. t19\n7. t70\n8. t70\n9. t8\n10. t70\n11. t33\n12. t30\n13. t33\n14. t30\n15. t70\n16. t70\n17. t40\n18. t70\n19. t52\n20. t42\n21. t75\n22. t30\n23. t65\n24. t75\n25. t40\n\nI notice that 't52' and 't75' are at positions 19 and 21. Let me check if 't52' comes from NT8. Yes, NT8 \u2192 't52' (look at the grammar: NT8 \u2192 't52'). Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't40'. So those are direct terminals.\n\nLet me start building from the beginning. S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Let's see how NT3 and NT9 can produce the string.\n\nNT3 can go to NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. Let's consider NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 first.\n\nNow, look at NT6 and NT2:\n\nNT6 can go to NT8 NT4, NT5 NT7, or 't8'. But in the string, the first token is t88, which suggests that NT3 might expand into something that starts with t88. Wait, let me check NT3's productions. NT3 can expand to NT6 NT2, and looking at NT6's productions, one of them is NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 or NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, etc. But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, wait, NT3 can also be 't30' directly? Let me check: looking back, the grammar for NT3 includes NT3 \u2192 't30'. Oh, yes, under NT3: NT3 \u2192 't30'. Similarly, NT9 can produce 't75', etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production S \u2192 NT3 NT9 would first produce NT3 generating t88, but let me check the grammar for NT3: does NT3 have a production that directly produces t88? Let's look: the grammar for NT3 includes NT3 \u2192 't30'. There's also NT0 \u2192 't30' and others. But t88 is not directly a production of NT3. The productions for NT8 include NT8 \u2192 't88'. So maybe NT3 doesn't produce t88; instead, perhaps another part.\n\nThis makes me think that maybe I should approach this backward. Let's look for the last few tokens and see which productions could generate them.\n\nThe last token is t40, which is produced by NT7 or NT1 (since both have 't40' in their productions). Wait, looking at the grammar, NT1 can produce 't40' as well.\n\nWait, in our string, the last token is t40, which is the 25th token. If we consider the last two symbols being 't40', but wait, each production is two symbols, so the last symbol must come from a production that ends directly in a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last part of the string is generated by a chain of expansions ending in t40.\n\nLet me try to think of the end of the string: t30, t65, t75, t40. Let's look where these can come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't30' is produced by several NTs, such as NT0 and NT3. 't65' is produced by NT6 and other non-terminals. 't75' is produced by NT9.\n\nWait, let me go back. The last three tokens in the string are t75, t40. So perhaps we have a production like NT9 \u2192 't75' followed by something that produces 't40'. Looking at NT9's productions: one of them is NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5. Similarly, NT1 can produce 't40'. So maybe NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5 \u2192 't40' NT5, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, NT9 can directly produce 't75' if it has that production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see 't75' as a direct production from NT9. Let me check again. The grammar has:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens like t12, t34, etc. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: t12 t34 t88 t90 t30 t75 t34 t30 t52 t37 t91 t75 t65 t22 t14 t42 t23 t65 t65 t14 t22 t14 t99 t19 t30. \n\nI notice that each terminal is just a single letter followed by a number. The grammar has several productions that map non-terminals to terminals. For example, NT9 can produce 't12', 't34', etc. So I'll need to see if the string can be derived by the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S starts by producing NT3 NT9. So the first step is S -> NT3 NT9. Then, each NT symbol will further expand until they hit terminals.\n\nLet me break the string down into parts. The first token is t12. Looking at the grammar, NT9 can produce t12. So maybe NT9 is the source for t12. But wait, S starts with NT3 NT9, so perhaps NT3 is generating the first part and NT9 the second.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT9 can produce 't12' as per the production NT9 -> 't12'. But in the string, the first token is t12, so maybe NT9 is the one producing it.\n\nBut S is S -> NT3 NT9, then NT3 and NT9 expand into parts of the string. So perhaps NT3 is generating some part and NT9 the other.\n\nWait, in the string, the sequence starts with t12, which could be the result of NT9 -> t12. But then the rest is more tokens, so I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider how each part of the grammar leads to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each token in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar. Since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, the string should be divided into segments of either two terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, but that might not always be the case because non-terminals can produce sequences. So perhaps each 'element' in the string must come from a production that's a terminal or a combination of non-terminals that can expand to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each token in the string must be a terminal that can be directly derived from a non-terminal. So I can check the grammar to see which non-terminals can produce each token.\n\nLooking at the grammar's terminal productions:\n\nNT9 -> t12, t34, t90, t75, t65, t22, t14, t99, t19, t30\nNT8 -> t52, t37, t41, t88, t42, t23, t65, t68, t57, t33, t27, t5, t...\nWait, perhaps I should list all terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT9 can be t12, t34, t88, t90, t30, t75, t65, t22, t14, t42, t23, t99, t19, t60, t70, t41, t42 is listed twice, but wait, it's t42, t23, etc. Not sure all are listed, but for this problem, the string is t12 t34 t88 t90 t30 t75 t34 t30 t52 t37 t91 t75 t65 t22 t14 t42 t23 t65 t65 t14 t22 t14 t99 t19 t30.\n\nWait, perhaps each of these tokens is a production that a non-terminal can produce. So, for example, t12 is produced by NT9, t34 by NT9, t88 by NT9, etc.\n\nBut S starts with NT3 and NT9. So the first part of the string would be generated by NT3, and the second by NT9.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first four tokens are t12 t34 t88 t90. If S is NT3 NT9, then the first part is generated by NT3 and the second by NT9. So perhaps NT3 generates t12 t34 t88 t90, and NT9 generates the rest.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, NT3 has production NT3 -> NT6 NT2. Then NT6 can be broken down into more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me try expanding step by step.\n\nLooking at S -> NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the first part is NT3, the second is NT9.\n\nNow, what's NT3's expansion? From the grammar, NT3 -> NT6 NT2.\n\nSo NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nNow, expand NT6 and NT2.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 has several productions, including NT6 -> NT8 NT4, NT6 -> NT4 NT5, NT6 -> NT9 NT2, NT6 -> NT3 NT1, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 has productions like NT2 -> NT7 NT7, NT2 -> NT5 NT6, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to see if the given string can be generated by sequentially breaking down the non-terminals.\n\nBut this could take a while because the string is quite long, and the grammar is extensive. Maybe a better approach is to check if all the tokens in the string are present in the grammar's terminals, and then see if the structure can be built.\n\nFirst, let me see if each token in the string is present as a terminal in any non-terminal's expansion.\n\nLooking at the given string:\nt12, t34, t88, t90, t30, t75, t34, t30, t52, t37, t91, t75, t65, t22, t14, t42, t23, t65, t65, t14, t22, t14, t99, t19, t30.\n\nCheck each against the grammar's terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\n- NT9 can produce t12, t34, t88, t90, t30, t75, t91, t22, t14, t42, t23, t99, t19, t30.\n- NT8 can produce t52, t37, t65, t88, t42, t23, t91, t75, ... (I think t68 is in NT2, but maybe others).\n- NT5 can produce t91, t42, etc.\n- NT2 can produce t33, t27, etc.\n\nWait, but the string includes t12, which is in NT9, and t34 is in NT9, etc. So perhaps all these tokens are produced by NT9, which might not be the case because the string starts with multiple instances of t34 and t30.\n\nWait, but if all the tokens in the string are produced by NT9, then perhaps the entire string is generated by NT9. But S starts with NT3 NT9, which would split it into two parts: NT3 generates a part, and NT9 another.\n\nWait, no, because the entire string is a single sequence, so perhaps the entire string is produced by S.\n\nBut S is NT3 NT9, which would split it into two parts that don't necessarily align with the structure. Hmm, maybe the string is formed by a series of productions where each part is broken down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is a production starting from S, meaning that NT3 generates the first part, and NT9 the second. But perhaps each of these can be further broken down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be generated as a single NT9 production if the starting symbol can produce NT9, but S starts as NT3 NT9, so maybe NT3 is the root and NT9 the last part.\n\nWait, no, S is S -> NT3 NT9, so the entire string must be generated by expanding NT3 and NT9. So perhaps the string is a combination of NT3's expansion and NT9's expansion.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Maybe I can try to see how many tokens are in the string and if it's a possible derivation.\n\nLooking at the string length: 25 tokens.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string we need to check is: `t60 t41 t13 t25 t70 t19 t37 t23 t23 t8 t70 t33 t34 t90 t37 t42 t23 t65 t91 t99 t19 t30 t75 t91 t88 t42`.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the symbols in the string are terminals. Chomsky normal form consists of non-terminals on the left-hand side and terminals on the right. So, this grammar can only generate strings where the start symbol S is rewritten into terminals step by step.\n\nLet me look at the structure of the grammar. It's a set of production rules for non-terminals, each rewriting into other non-terminals or terminals. For instance, S -> NT3 NT9, which starts the process. Each production could have multiple non-terminals, which would require further expansion.\n\nSince the string is entirely terminals, each production used in the derivation must lead to terminals. That means for each non-terminal in the string, there should be a production rule that directly terminals, or a path of productions leading down to terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: I need to check if each token (like t60, t41, etc.) is either a terminal or can be derived from a non-terminal with a production that includes that terminal.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string and see if all the tokens are present in the grammar's terminals. Checking each token in the string:\n\nt60, t41, t13, t25, t70, t19, t37, t23, t8, t70, t33, t34, t90, t37, t42, t23, t65, t91, t99, t19, t30, t75, t91, t88, t42.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar's production rules, the last ones are non-terminals mapping to terminals:\n\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT6 -> 't34'\n- NT1 -> 't25'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT5 -> 't91'\n- NT6 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT8 -> 't37'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n- NT3 -> 't90'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT7 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't23'\n- NT5 -> 't37'\n\nWait, looking at these, for example, NT9 can produce 't75' and 't60'. NT8 can produce 't52' and 't37'. NT0 can produce 't13'. NT6 can produce 't34' and 't8'. NT1 produces 't25', NT7 produces 't40' and 't70', NT3 produces 't30' and 't90', etc.\n\nWait, some of these may not be directly present. But looking at the string, we have t60, which has a rule NT9 -> 't60', so that's fine. t37 appears multiple times, which is okay because NT8 can produce 't37', as well as NT2 and NT5.\n\nSo, for each token in the string, is there a corresponding production rule that can derive it from the initial symbol S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to see if the sequence is possible through the grammar. Since the string is a series of terminals, we need to see if the grammar can produce this sequence through a series of expansions.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\nThe starting symbol is S. From the rules, S can only go to NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, S -> NT3 NT9.\n\nThen, NT3 and NT9 would each need to expand. Let's look at the rules for NT3:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2.\n\nSo, NT3 expands into NT6 and NT2. Now, let's see what NT6 and NT2 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT6: production rules are NT6 -> NT4 NT5, and NT6 -> NT8 NT4.\n\nFrom the string, we already have t8, t37, etc. Let's see what NT4 can produce.\n\nNT4's rules are: NT4 -> NT7 NT0, NT4 -> NT2 NT1, and NT4 -> 't88'.\n\nSo, t88 is a direct terminal. If the string includes t88, that's possible.\n\nLooking at our string, I see 't88' in it, so that's okay.\n\nWait, let me check each token:\n\nt60: from NT9 -> 't60'.\n\nt41: from NT8 -> 't41'.\n\nt13: from NT0 -> 't13'.\n\nt25: from NT1 -> 't25'.\n\nt70: from NT7 -> 't70'.\n\nt19: Hmm, looking through the rules, do we have a rule that produces 't19'? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at all the production rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't19'.\n\nSame for 't19' in the string: there's no direct production for 't19'. So, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Looking at the rules, non-terminals like NT9 can produce 't75' or 't60', NT8 can produce 't52' and 't37', NT0 produces 't13', NT6 produces 't34' or 't8', NT1: 't25', NT7: 't40' or 't70', NT3: 't30' or 't90'.\n\nWait, but in the string, there's a 't19'. So, is there any non-terminal that can produce 't19'? Alternatively, perhaps 't19' is a typo, but assuming that it's correct, we need to see if there's a rule for a non-terminal that can expand to 't19'.\n\nLooking again at the rules, I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't19'.\n\nSimilarly, let me check other tokens. For example, t33: that's from NT2 -> 't33'.\n\nt34: from NT6 -> 't34'.\n\nt90: from NT3 -> 't90'.\n\nt37: appears multiple times, from NT2, NT5, NT8.\n\nt23: from NT8 -> 't23' or NT9 can't produce t23. Wait, looking at the rules, NT8 can produce 't37' or 't23'? Let me check.\n\nLooking again, I see NT8 -> 't52', NT8->'t37', NT8->'t23'? Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT8 -> 't37'\n- NT8 -> 't23' (from the end of the list)\n\nYes, NT8 can also produce t23.\n\nt42: from NT4 -> 't42' (from the rules, looking up), yes, NT4 has a production to 't42'.\n\nt23: as above.\n\nt65: from NT6 -> 't65'.\n\nt91: from NT5 -> 't91' or NT2 -> 't91'.\n\nt99: I don't see a rule that directly produces 't99'.\n\nt19: Again, no rule for 't19'.\n\nWait, in the string, we have 't19' appearing twice. I need to check if any non-terminal produces 't19'.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals:\n\n- NT0: t13, t8, t34, t90, t75.\n\nWait, NT9 can produce t75 and t60.\n\nHmm, no, none of the non-terminals seem to have 't19' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but let's look at all the rules:\n\nFor NT0:\n\n- NT0 -> NT1 NT3\n\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT2\n\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT7\n\n- NT0 -> NT4 NT0\n\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT1\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is: `t30 t70 t23 t75 t65 t12 t90 t10 t25 t34 t13 t37 t70 t91 t8 t42 t22 t91 t25 t60 t42 t12 t10 t91 t90 t37`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The grammar has two initial productions for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n2. S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT3 followed by NT9 or NT3 followed by NT2. Let me check the string: the first token is t30, so I need to see if NT3 can produce t30.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 can also produce other things, but let's see the first option. So NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nNow, I need to see how NT6 can produce t30. Looking at NT6's productions:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT8\n- Other productions lead to terminals in other parts.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I see that NT6 has several non-terminals. Maybe I can trace the path from NT3 to t30.\n\nSo, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Now, NT6 can produce NT8 NT4, etc. Let's say NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4. Then NT8 can produce terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nWait, NT8 has several productions, including NT8 \u2192 t75 (I think). Let me check: In the provided grammar, under NT8, I see NT8 \u2192 't75', yes. So if a path can reach a production that has a terminal, that's a terminal.\n\nBut I'm trying to reach t30. So let's check if any production from NT3 or downstream NTs can produce t30.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, NT3's productions:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- Also, other productions for NT3 lead to NT0 NT7 and NT1 NT5, but they might not be relevant here since we start with S.\n\nSo from S, the first step must be S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. The first option leads us to t30, so let's consider NT3 \u2192 t30 somehow.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So if NT3 can produce t30 via a terminal, but the productions are all to non-terminals except for t30, t70, etc.\n\nLooking at the list, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So when does NT6 produce t30? Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see a production where NT6 directly becomes t30. Instead, here's what I see:\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT8\n- Also, NT6 appears in other productions, but I don't see NT6 \u2192 t30. Instead, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nWait, under NT3, the productions are:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nSo for the string, the first token is t30. So I need a production that can produce t30. Looking through NT3's productions, none directly produce t30. Unless there's a path from NT3 or one of its downstream NTs that can produce t30.\n\nWait, but looking further down, in the part where I have NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, I see that NT6 can produce NT1 NT8, etc. Let me try to see if any of these can lead to t30.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the fact that t30 is produced by NT3. Wait, in the given grammar, is there any production where a non-terminal directly produces t30? Let me go through each production.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals:\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', 't25', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't30' (I think), because in the provided grammar, under 'NT3' is a production NT3 \u2192 't30'?\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I don't see a production where NT3 directly becomes t30. I see that NT6 is connected to t30? Let me check:\n\nLooking through:\n- NT1 \u2192 't25', 't40', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't40', 't70', etc.\nWait, but I think I might have missed something.

In the provided list, I see:\nNT3 \u2192 't30'.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar there are lines like:\nNT3 \u2192 't30', but let me check the actual grammar steps.\n\nLooking again, the grammar has this part:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nAnd further down:\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n...\nBut then, for the terminals:\nWell, looking for 't30' in the productions:\n\nSearching through all lines, the first terminal listed is under NT7: NT7 \u2192 't70'.\n\nWait, I might have misread it earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLine: NT6 \u2192 't8' is one of the productions for NT6. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't75', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recheck each production. Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking for 't30', I see it's under NT6:\nLooking through all the NT lines, the one before NT9 \u2192 't60' and others, I see:\n\nWait, actually, for NT3, do I have a way to reach 't30'? I might have been confusing the non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a line that says NT3 \u2192 't30'. Let me confirm.\n\nLooking through all the lines, I see that yes, there's a line: NT3 \u2192 't30'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 appears in several productions, but the specific terminals are:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see several lines where a non-terminal is followed by a terminal. For example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\nNT7 \u2192 't70'\nNT9 \u2192 't60'\nBut no line where NT3 \u2192 't30' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the lines, I see:\n\nNT3 productions:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nNo line where NT3 \u2192 't30' directly. So t30 must be produced through NT3's downstream productions.\n\nWait, but NT3 can't directly produce t30, unless it's through a chain.\n\nSo let me try to see if NT3 can eventually produce t30.\n\nStarting with NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nNow, NT6 can produce several things. Let's pick NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4.\n\nThen NT8 can produce several things, including 't75'.\n\nWait, but I need to reach t30.

{"custom_id":"request-525","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I\u2019ve got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means each production rule either has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. The string to evaluate is `t99 t75 t70 t34 t40 t19 t22 t37 t88 t52 t13 t13 t22 t88 t23 t99 t19 t10 t14 t22 t33 t52 t91 t60 t88 t37 t88`.\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze the grammar and see how each symbol in the string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since it's in CNF, each symbol is derived either directly from a terminal or through two steps involving non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. S directly produces NT3 NT9. So, the first step is to see if the string starts with symbols that can derive to NT3 and NT9.\n\nThe string starts with `t99 t75`. Let me check if these terminals appear on the right-hand side of any production. Looking through the rules, I see NT9 -> 't99', 't75', 't60', etc. Wait, no, actually let me scan:\n\nNT9 has rules like NT9 -> 't99', 't75', etc. So t99 is in NT9, and t75 is in NT9 as well. So the first two symbols `t99 t75` must come from NT9. So the first part is that S -> NT9 via S->NT3 NT9, but the string starts with NT9 producing t99, t75.\n\nWait, S can produce NT3 NT9. But the first part of the string is t99 t75. So S has to generate something that leads to t99 followed by t75. Let's check S's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two main productions: S-> NT3 NT9 and S-> NT3 NT2. Hmm, wait, no\u2014wait the initial part says S->NT3 NT9 and S->NT3 NT2? No, looking back, actually the initial lines of the grammar are:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nWait, but that can't be right because NT2 is another non-terminal. Let me confirm the first two productions of S:\n\nYes, the user provided the grammar as starting with S->NT3 NT9 and S->NT3 NT2. So that's the start. But in the current string, the first part is NT9 producing t99 and t75, but how does that connect back?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t99 t75 t70 t34 t40 t19 t22 t37 t88 t52 t13 t13 t22 t88 t23 t99 t19 t10 t14 t22 t33 t52 t91 t60 t88 t37 t88`.\n\nI think each symbol in the string must be either a terminal produced directly by a non-terminal or derived from the non-terminals in the CFG. Since all productions are in CNF, each step will have two non-terminals.\n\nLet's try to parse the string from the beginning. The string starts with `t99 t75`. Let's see where `t99` and `t75` come from.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT9 has rules NT9 -> 't99', 't75', etc. So `t99` and `t75` are both productions from NT9. But in the grammar, S can't produce NT9 directly because S's first production is NT3 NT9. So after S, the next symbols must come from NT3 and NT9.\n\nWait, let's see: S produces NT3 NT9. So the string must begin with the symbols produced by NT3 and NT9. But the string starts with `t99 t75`, which would mean that NT9 produces `t99` and `t75`. But wait, NT9 is a single non-terminal, so when the grammar is in CNF, a non-terminal can only produce one thing. So if the string is `t99 t75`, that would imply that NT9 is producing two symbols in one step, which isn't possible unless NT9 can produce all those symbols, but in CNF, each production rule must have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string is a sequence of all the terminal productions from the non-terminals. So each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal in the derivation. So each step, non-terminals are replaced by their right-hand sides, which are either terminals or another pair of non-terminals.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's see which non-terminals can produce the initial symbols.\n\nThe string starts with `t99 t75`. Looking at the productions, NT9 has rules that produce t99, t75, etc. So the first two symbols `t99 t75` must come from NT9. Since NT9 directly produces t99 and t75 as separate productions, but in the grammar, a non-terminal can only generate one terminal per production. Wait, no\u2014that would be for a different form. Wait, in a CFG with terminals, a non-terminal in CNF can produce a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So for example, NT9 can produce 't99' and also 't75' in separate rules. So if the string starts with two symbols, both from NT9, then NT9 must be splitting into those two terminals.\n\nWait, but in CNF, a non-terminal can only expand to one symbol each production. So if NT9 produces both t99 and t75, it can't produce both in the same step. Alternatively, the string may require that NT9 first produces t99 and then t75, but in that case, NT9 would have to split into t99 and t75, which isn't possible because in a single production, it's only one symbol or two non-terminals. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string is the result of S deriving through several steps, and each symbol in the string is a terminal that must be generated by some non-terminal. Since S starts by producing NT3 NT9, let's see if NT3 can produce the first symbol t99.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions: NT3-> 't30', 't90', 't69' (Wait, actually let me look up the productions for NT3.\n\nIn the grammar, I see lines:\n\nNT3-> NT6 NT2\nNT3-> NT90 NT8\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT3, I see:\n\nNT3-> NT6 NT2\nNT3-> NT4 NT8\nNT3-> NT2 NT7\nWait, perhaps I'm not matching correctly. Let me search the grammar for NT3.\n\nAh, here's some lines starting with NT3:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 -> NT4 NT8\nNT3-> NT90 NT8\nWait, perhaps this is a typo, but in the actual rules, it's more likely that NT3 has:\n\nFrom the provided grammar, I find:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 -> NT4 NT8\nNT3-> NT90 NT8\nHmm, but perhaps the \"NT90\" is a typo. Wait, let me check the provided grammar carefully.\n\nLooking for NT3, I see:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3-> NT90 NT8\nHT: Probably it's a typo and should be NT9 maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the grammar. Let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nWait, maybe the initial lines of the grammar can give me information. Let's see, the first two S productions:\n\nS-> NT3 NT9\nS-> NT3 NT2\n\nSo S splits into NT3 and either NT9 or NT2. Then, looking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3-> NT90 NT8 (Wait, probably NT39? Or maybe it's NT9 followed by NT8?)\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar has a typo, but let's see. Alternatively, the user might have included it as NT90, which is more than two symbols, but that would not fit CNF.\n\nI think perhaps the grammar has an error. Looking through the grammar more carefully, perhaps not\u2014maybe some lines were misformatted. For the purpose of this problem, I\u2019ll assume that each rule in CNF has either a terminal or two non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-520","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the components involved.\n\nFirst, the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side, except for the start symbol, which can produce a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see that many non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) are defined in terms of other non-terminals. Each rule has two non-terminals, except for the places where they directly produce a terminal. For example, NT9 -> 't75' is a terminal production.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t22 t33 t8 t8 t14 t8 t23 t14 t88 t25 t19 t60 t60 t42 t13 t70 t75 t12 t12 t41 t40 t90 t33 t42 t70 t8 t34`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the string is made up of terminals, I'll have to trace back through the non-terminals to see if each part of the string can be generated.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar. I notice that S -> NT3 NT9. So, the string must start with whatever NT3 generates followed by whatever NT9 generates. Looking at NT9's productions, I see it can produce 't75', 't60', 't90', 't41', etc. Wait, in the string, the first part is t22 t33, so perhaps I need to see if 't22' comes from some NT's production.\n\nWait, looking at the NT9 rules, I see that it directly produces 't75', 't60', 't90', etc. So if the string starts with t75, then that's a direct production. But in the given string, the first token is t22, which isn't directly produced by any NT9. Hmm, so maybe I'm tracking the wrong terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the non-terminals that produce multiple terminals. Let's see, some NT productions lead to multiple terminals, like NT6 -> NT3 NT6. But wait, that doesn't seem helpful because it's production is two non-terminals, each of which may expand further.\n\nWait, but in the given string, it's a sequence of terminals. Each of these must be generated by some chain of productions. For instance, t8 appears multiple times, so I need to see if there's a way to produce t8 from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT8 can produce t8 or other non-terminals. Wait, looking through the NT8 productions: NT8 -> 't8', 't52', and so on. So 't8' is a terminal derived from itself and others.\n\nBut wait, in the string, t8 appears several times. Let's consider the possible derivations:\n\n- For the first t22: I need to see if it can be derived from some NT2's production because looking at the grammar, NT2 has a production NT2 -> 't33', but wait, that's not matching. Or NT2 may derive to something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree for the given string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t22, t33, t8, t8, t14, t8, t23, t14, t88, t25, t19, t60, t60, t42, t13, t70, t75, t12, t12, t41, t40, t90, t33, t42, t70, t8, t34.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT3 NT9. So the string must be a combination of the derivations of NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at NT3: Its productions are NT3 -> NT6 NT2 and NT3 -> NT4 NT8 etc. So when I see 't33' in the string, perhaps it's generated by NT2 (if NT2 can produce t33, but let me check.\n\nWait, let's check NT2's productions. Looking through the rules, NT2 can produce 't33', which is good because in the string, we have t33 as the second token. So perhaps the first NT3 in the start generates the first part, and NT9 generates the second part.\n\nWait, but S is splitting into two parts, NT3 and NT9. So let's consider:\n\nStarting with S:\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nSo, S generates two parts: the first NT3 and the second NT9.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, let's see if we can derive the second part of the string, which starts with t22.\n\nWait, but looking at the NT9 rule list:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t75, t60, t90, t41, t98, etc. Wait, but looking at NT9's definitions:\n\nNT9 has multiple rules, but the direct terminals are:\n\n- 't75' (NT9 \u2192 't75'),\n- 't60' (NT9 \u2192 't60'),\n- 't90' (NT9 \u2192 't90'),\n- 't41' (NT9 \u2192 't41'),\n- 't22' (NT9 \u2192 't22'),\n- 't34' (NT9 \u2192 't34'),\n- etc. So, is t22 a direct production of NT9? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes! I see 't22' appears as a direct production of NT9. So the last part of the string ends with t34, which is also a direct production from NT9. So perhaps the entire string is being generated by NT9.\n\nWait, but the entire string is a combination of both NT3 and NT9. Hmm, maybe each part of the string corresponds to the expansion of the two non-terminals NT3 and NT9 respectively.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The entire string is t22 t33 t8 t8 t14 t8 t23 t14 t88 t25 t19 t60 t60 t42 t13 t70 t75 t12 t12 t41 t40 t90 t33 t42 t70 t8 t34.\n\nSince S produces NT3 NT9, the string should consist of the derivation of NT3 followed by the derivation of NT9. So, the first part (before t22) is the derivation of NT3, and the second part from t22 onwards is the derivation of NT9.\n\nSo let's split the string accordingly:\n\nPart 1: t22 t33 t8 t8 t14 t8 t23 t14 t88 t25 t19 t60 t60 t42 t13 t70 t75\n\nPart 2: t12 t12 t41 t40 t90 t33 t42 t70 t8 t34 (Wait, no, actually the split should be after the last token generated by NT3.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of how the production for NT3 and NT9 work.\n\nLet me consider each part separately.\n\nFirst, let's look at the second part of the string, starting from t22. Looking at the rules, NT9 can produce 't22' as one of the direct rules. So the string t22 must come from NT9. Then after that, the rest of the string should be part of the NT9's expansion.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t22, which is part of the NT9's rule. So, the first part is before the 't22'\u2014does the entire string correspond to NT9's expansion? But then why is the start symbol producing NT3 and NT9? That seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string is generated by NT9. Let me see:\n\nSince S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the entire string must be NT3 followed by NT9's expansion. So part 1 is the expansion of NT3, ending before t22, and part 2 is the expansion of NT9, starting with t22.\n\nSo the given string is:\n\nt22 t33 t8... [Part 1? No, wait] No. Actually, no. Wait, S is NT3 NT9. So the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT3 and NT9. So the first part of the string (up to the end of NT3's expansion) should be the result of NT3's expansion, followed by NT9's expansion.\n\nSo perhaps the string is structured as (NT3's expansion)(NT9's expansion). Therefore, the split point is after the entire NT3 expansion.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first occurrence of"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a single terminal symbol. That should help in parsing, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm. But the string is quite long, so doing it manually could be tricky.\n\nLet me write down the grammar rules to have a clearer picture. The start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT9. So the string must start with NT3 and NT9 in sequence. Looking at the string, it starts with t41 t41... Wait, but t41 is a terminal, so the first part needs to be matching NT3 and NT9.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT9 can produce some terminals, like 't75', 't60', etc., and also has rules that lead to terminals. So, if the first part of the string is two t41s, maybe NT3 produces t41. Let me check the rules for NT3.\n\nLooking through, I see NT3 has a production to NT6 NT2. Hmm, not a terminal yet. NT6 has rules: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT8, etc. And NT8 has rules leading to NT3, NT4, etc. This is getting a bit complicated.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string step by step. Let's break it down:\n\nThe string is: t41 t41 t52 t99 t65 t13 t75 t91 t37 t65 t23 t90 t65 t13 t91 t91 t60 t14 t91 t99 t33 t65 t30 t34 t37 t19 t52 t8.\n\nThis is 28 tokens.

Looking at the grammar for NT3:\n\nLooking for a production that starts with NT3 and ends in t41. Let's see: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. That's not a terminal yet.

Are there any terminals directly under NT3? Checking, I don't see any. So NT3 must go through several productions that result in non-terminals that eventually produce t41.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that 't41' is the result of some NT, like NT4. Let me check the rules for NT4. NT4 has two productions: NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0 and NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT1. Hmm, but how do I get t41 from that?\n\nLooking further, NT7 \u2192 NT6 NT5, which is non-terminal to non-terminal. NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6, etc. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should start from the end.\n\nLooking towards the end of the string: ...t19 t52 t8. Let's see where that could come from. The last part is t8. Checking the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 t30 NT3? No, that's a terminal. Wait, looking at NT6's rules: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, and NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8, etc. Hmm, but maybe looking for a production that ends in t8.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t41 t41. Since S starts with NT3 NT9, both of these must produce t41.\n\nLet me see if either NT3 or NT9 can directly produce t41. Scanning the grammar for t41, looking at any rule that ends in t41.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any rule that directly produces t41. So t41 must be the result of a longer production.\n\nSo, perhaps NT3 \u2192 ... t41. Let's see: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So NT6 must produce something that eventually leads to t41. Let's check NT6.\n\nNT6 has several rules: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT8, NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT2, etc. Hmm, none of these directly result in t41. So maybe it goes further down.\n\nLet's consider NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT4 NT2. Then NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT1. So perhaps NT8 can produce t75 and t40, but t75 is not t41. Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT1 NT2 (since NT8's second production is NT6 NT1, which is NT6 \u2192 NT8... Maybe this is getting too tangled. Maybe it's better to try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to determine if a string is generated by a given grammar.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps a more manual approach.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the string and see if it can be divided into parts matching the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the beginning: t41 t41. Let's assume NT3 produces t41 and NT9 produces t41.\n\nSo, let me focus on the first part: how does NT3 generate t41.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So the first step is to split into NT6 and NT2.\n\nNow, NT6 must generate a substring that ends with t41, and NT2 must generate another part. Wait, but this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the entire string can be split into NT3 and NT9, each generating their respective parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t41 t41, which could be the output of S. But maybe it's not just that, because NT3 might produce t41 through a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a rule where NT3 eventually leads to t41. Let's see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT6 NT5\n\nThis seems like it's not leading to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT1 NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT5 NT4\n\nWait, NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9? That seems like it could lead to a loop, but the string has t41 and t19 which are not part of this.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a way to break the string into components that fit the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not generated by this grammar because some parts do not match any production rules.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the last token is t8. So the grammar must have a production that ends with t8.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT3? No, perhaps NT9 \u2192 't14' which is a terminal. So NT9 can produce t14. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 t52, NT5 \u2192 t91, and others have direct terminal productions.\n\nBut to get t8, maybe looking at NT3's rule: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Then NT6 could produce something leading to t8, and NT2 could produce something leading up to t8.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a production that ends in t8. For example, NT9 \u2192 't8', which is a terminal. So if any part of the string is t8, it must be from NT9.\n\nBut the last part is t8, which is in the string, so perhaps that's generated by NT9.\n\nWait, the string is: ... t33 t65 t30 t34 t37 t19 t52 t8.\n\nWait, the last token is t8, so if that's generated by NT9, then before that, the substring up to that point needs to be covered by the grammar.\n\nThis is getting a bit too tangled. I might need to look for any possible way the string could be split into parts matching the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string contains a part that's not present in any of the productions, making it invalid.

{"custom_id":"request-546","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar seems quite complex with many non-terminals and production rules. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are terminal symbols since the grammar's right-hand sides consist of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky Normal Form typically means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. However, looking at the given grammar, many rules have two non-terminals on the right side, which fits the CNF structure.\n\nThe string provided is: `t40 t10 t10 t10 t90 t12 t34 t52 t99 t41 t19 t41 t33 t30 t14 t88 t30 t90 t75 t88 t10 t12 t70 t65 t60 t37 t40 t33`.\n\nEach token in this string is a terminal, so I need to check if this entire sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nI know that in CNF, the derivation tree for the string must have a structure where each production splits into two non-terminals, recursively until the leaves are terminals. Since the goal is to generate this string, the string length should be 2^n - 1 for some n, but this string has 31 tokens. Let's see: 2^5 = 32, so 32-1=31. So that's feasible because 5 is the height, meaning the leftmost derivation would result in 31 symbols.\n\nBut wait, let's check the string length. 31 tokens, which fits 2^5 -1. So that's a good sign.\n\nNow, looking at each token and seeing if it's a terminal that appears in any production. Let's list the terminals present in the string:\n\nt40, t10, t10, t10, t90, t12, t34, t52, t99, t41, t19, t41, t33, t30, t14, t88, t30, t90, t75, t88, t10, t12, t70, t65, t60, t37, t40, t33.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, some of these are present on the right side of productions, others are not. For example, t40 appears on the right side of NT9 (NT9 -> t75 and t40). So t40 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, t30 appears in NT3 -> t62? Wait, no\u2014looking back, I see that in the grammar, some non-terminals like NT3, NT6, etc., have rules that include specific terminals. For example, NT2 -> t33, which is in the string.\n\nNow, to check if the string can be derived, perhaps we can start by seeing if the entire string can be split into chunks that match the RHS of a production.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string from left to right, trying to find possible productions that can generate the next terminals.\n\nBut since the grammar is quite large, manually trying to parse 31 tokens would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps we can check if each terminal matches a production's RHS.\n\nWait, looking at the string, each token must be matched by a production. So for each position in the string, we can see if it can be matched by some production. However, since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the left derivation increases the number of symbols by 1 (each production is A \u2192 BC, so each step splits a symbol into two, so the length increases by 1 each time).\n\nWait, maybe an alternative approach is to see if each terminal is a right-hand side of some production, but considering the structure of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can map the terminals to their possible sources. For example, t40 could be produced by NT9, because NT9 \u2192 t75 and t40. Similarly, t10 could be produced by NT8, since looking back, I see NT8 \u2192 t52 and t37, but also NT7 \u2192 t40 and NT1 \u2192 t19, etc. Hmm, maybe nt7 can produce t40.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals that appear in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, terminals include:\nt40, t10, t10, t10, t90, t12, t34, t52, t99, t41, t19, t33, t30, t14, t88, t75, t88, t10, t12, t70, t65, t60, t37, t40, t33.\n\nWait, the terminals in the grammar seem to be 't' followed by numbers. Let's see if each number corresponds to a production that can produce that terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the rules are in terms of non-terminals (NTs) and terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 t33, so t33 can be produced by NT2.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 \u2192 t40, so t40 can be produced by NT1.\n\nLooking back at the string, the first token is t40. So the first symbol is t40. In the grammar, t40 can be produced by NT8 (look at NT8 production: NT8 \u2192 t52 and t37, also NT8 \u2192 t41 and t10, etc., but wait, wait, looking through the production rules, I can find which rule includes a terminal as a single RHS.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there's a rule NT1 \u2192 t40. So NT1 can directly produce t40.\n\nThen, the next token is t10, which is in NT4 \u2192 t88 (no), but perhaps looking for t10 in any production. Scanning through, I don't immediately see a production that directly produces t10. Wait, but perhaps t10 comes from a non-terminal that can derive it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t10 is derived from NT2, because looking at NT2: one of the rules is NT2 \u2192 t33, but maybe NT2 can also derive to other non-terminals which can produce t10.\n\nLooking again, NT2 has rules like NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT7, etc. Maybe I need to see if any non-terminals can produce t10.\n\nLooking at the productions, there's NT7 \u2192 t40 and NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4, but not directly t10. Wait, in the given list, I see NT2 \u2192 t33. So perhaps t33 can be directly produced by NT2, but not sure about t10.\n\nWait, perhaps t10 comes from NT4, which has a production NT4 \u2192 t42 (wait, does it? Looking back, I can't find a production NT4 \u2192 t42, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong entries. Wait, the full list of rules is pretty long. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for t10 in the RHS of any production.

{"custom_id":"request-563","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the given string is generated by it. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has the left-hand side as a single non-terminal and the right-hand side as two non-terminals or terminal symbols. So, this grammar should adhere to that structure, which helps.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t37 t12 t65 t40 t88 t88 t14 t10 t12 t41 t23 t37 t34 t37 t60 t33 t30 t12 t10 t88 t42 t52 t91 t99 t65 t41 t75 t30 t22`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since it's a CNF grammar, every step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. So, the length of the string should correspond to a power of 2 minus 1, but given the string has 30 tokens, that might be possible if the derivation process branches each time. But actually, the process could have taken multiple steps, so maybe it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to try to construct a parse tree for the string according to the grammar. If each token corresponds to a production, then the entire string must be generated through a series of such steps, starting from S.\n\nLet me look at the grammar first. There are a lot of production rules, so it's a bit complex, but perhaps some key productions are present. For example, some terminals are defined in terms of other terminals, and these can be substituted as needed.\n\nLooking at the terminal symbols in the string, I see t37, t12, t65, t40, t88, t14, t10, t23, t34, t37 again, t60, t33, t30, t12, t10, t88, t42, t52, t91, t99, t65, t41, t75, t30, t22.\n\nI notice that some of these t's might correspond to non-terminals. For example, in the grammar, NT3, NT8, etc., are defined with combinations of non-terminals and sometimes terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the right-hand sides consist of non-terminals, except for the terminals, which are represented as 't' followed by some digits. So, in the string, each token is either a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nSo, each 't' followed by digits is a terminal, and the other tokens (like NT3, NT8, etc.) are non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string consists of both terminals and non-terminals. So, I need to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. Each non-terminal in the string can be expanded using the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me take the string piece by piece and see if I can find a way to derive it step by step. Starting with the entire string, perhaps I can split it into parts that correspond to the left-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to check if each chunk corresponds to a terminal or a non-terminal and can be generated.\n\nWait, another approach: since each production in CNF generates two symbols, the derivation will create a binary tree where each node is a symbol, and each internal node is a non-terminal. The leaves are the terminals.\n\nSo, the string's length is 30. Let's see if 30 can be built by starting from S, which generates two non-terminals, and each step doubles the number of symbols (plus some, depending on how many non-terminals are expanded).\n\nBut perhaps using the string length to check for possible derivations. If the string is of length 30, the number of symbols is 30. Each production doubles the length or changes it somehow. Wait, actually, in CNF, each step replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols. So, the total number of symbols increases by 1 each time you expand a non-terminal.\n\nSo, the initial S is a single symbol. To generate the string, each expansion adds 1 to the total count. So, starting from 1, after n expansions, the count is 1 + n.\n\nThe given string has 30 symbols, so the number of expansions needed would be 29. But wait, 1 + 29 = 30, so yes, that's possible.\n\nBut this doesn't directly help. Instead, maybe it's better to check if each non-terminal in the string can be expanded into the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many symbols are non-terminals, others are terminals. For example, S -> NT3 NT9, which are both non-terminals. Then, each of these can be further broken down.\n\nFor example, NT3 can be expanded into NT6 NT2, which are also non-terminals, and so on until they reach terminals.\n\nSo, let's take the first part of the string: t37 t12 t65 t40.\n\nWait, no, that's four terminals. So, perhaps the non-terminals in the grammar can expand into these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should break the string into possible chunks that match the grammar. For instance, starting from the start symbol S, which expands into two parts, then each of those can expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the string as being constructed from the grammar by expanding S step by step and seeing if the resulting symbols match the string.\n\nAlternatively, since this might take a long time, perhaps I can look for key parts of the string and see if they can be derived.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t37, t12, t65, t40, t88, t88, t14, etc. I need to see if these can be generated from the grammar.\n\nWait, the problem is that this is a complex grammar with many rules, and doing this manually might be time-consuming. Maybe I can try to find a pattern or key points.\n\nFor example, in the grammar, there's a production NT9 -> 't75' and other terminals. Similarly, some non-terminals expand into t (terminal) sequences.\n\nLooking at the given string, there's t75, which might correspond to some production.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT2 -> 't37' is present, right? Let me check: yes, ND2 -> 't37'. So, perhaps the string contains t37 which could come from NT2.\n\nAlso, looking at NT6 -> 't8', which is a terminal. So, t8 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, I don't see t8; I see t37, t40, t88, etc. So maybe t37 comes from NT2, which is a non-terminal that expands into t37.\n\nWait, no, ND2 in the grammar is defined via production rules. Looking at ND2: NT2 -> NT7 NT7, NT6 NT8, NT3 NT1, etc. Wait, but in the grammar, NT2 can be broken down into other non-terminals. For example, looking back, I think the grammar has ND2 -> NT7 NT7 or NT6 NT8, etc. So, ND2 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal that expands into other non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the last token is t22. Looking at the grammar, is there a production for any non-terminal that results in 't22'? Yes, in the grammar, NT9 -> t75, but looking further, I notice that there is a production NT5 -> 't99' and some other terminals. Wait, actually, many of the terminals are only produced by specific non-terminals, like NT2 -> 't37' or 't33', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me check the grammar again for terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT8 -> 't52', NT0 -> 't13', NT6 -> 't34', NT1 -> 't25', NT7 -> 't40', NT5 -> 't91', NT6 -> 't65', NT3 -> 't30', NT8 -> 't37', NT9 -> 't75', NT2 -> 't33', NT6 -> 't8', NT1 -> 't40', NT7 -> 't10', NT1 -> 't12', NT4 -> 't88', NT2 -> 't37', NT3 -> 't90', NT9 -> 't60', NT7 -> 't70', NT8 -> 't41', NT4 -> 't42', NT9 -> 't22'.\n\nAh, so NT9 can expand into 't22' directly as per NT9 -> 't75', but wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see that NT9 has two"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-566","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and I need to check if the string provided is part of the language generated by this grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in a flat list, so I'll try to list the production rules in a more organized way to understand how the non-terminals relate to each other. The start symbol is S, and it seems the rules primarily start with NT followed by two other non-terminals or sometimes terminals. Some of the rules include terminals like 't13', 't14', up to 't99', and a few others like 't23', 't25', etc.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate, it's a sequence of terminal symbols: t13 t14 t25 t42 t42 t23 t8 t10 t99 t88 t70 t19 t40 t90 t25 t22 t88 t25 t90 t10 t30 t60 t14 t10 t37 t12 t99 t14 t70.\n\nMy first thought is to see how these terminals can be derived from the grammar. Since it's Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, each production has two symbols on the right-hand side, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, it's only two non-terminals. So each production's right-hand side must be two non-terminals.\n\nWait a minute, I need to check if that's the case for all rules. Let me look at the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, S -> NT3 NT9. Okay, that's two non-terminals. Similarly, NT2 can produce NT8 NT9, which is also two non-terminals. However, I notice that some terminals are on the right side, like NT2 -> 't8' or 't25'. Wait, no, that can't be right because in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions must be either two non-terminals or a single terminal. But actually, in standard CNF, it's two non-terminals, so any terminal on the right would make it not CNF. So maybe I misread the grammar; perhaps the rules that have terminals are actually allowed, which would mean the grammar isn't in CNF. But the user confirmed that it's in CNF, so I must have misread the rules.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me parse the syntax correctly. The production rules are written as S -> NT3 NT9, meaning S is replaced by NT3 and NT9. Then, NT8 can produce NT0 NT2, which is two non-terminals. However, there are some rules where a production ends with a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like NT9 -> 't91' or 't37'. That would mean those rules have a terminal on the right-hand side, which is against CNF, which requires all productions to have two non-terminals on the right. This seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the rules are structured. Perhaps the user intended that each production is in the form of two non-terminals except for the ones with terminals, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the rules are written with a space, making the right-hand side two symbols, but one of them is a terminal. For example, NT2 -> 't33' \u2014 that would be a production with one terminal and one non-terminal. But according to CNF, all productions must be two non-terminals or a single terminal, not mixing both. So either the grammar is in CNF, but the rules aren't correctly written, or I'm not interpreting them right.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules are written with the right-hand side as two symbols separated by a space, meaning some have terminals, which isn't allowed in CNF. That would be a problem because the user said it's in CNF, so I might have to re-examine the list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the formatting. For example, perhaps each production's right-hand side is written with two symbols, even if they include a single terminal. That would mean that some terminals are on the right, which is allowed in CNF if a production is a single terminal. But CNF allows productions like A\u2192a, so if any of these rules are A\u2192a, that's fine, but having A\u2192a B would still be CNF. So in this case, for example, NT2 \u2192 't8' is a production where 't8' is a terminal, so that's allowed as A\u2192a, where a is 't8'. But wait, Chomsky Normal Form doesn't allow terminals on the right side of a production unless they're at the bottom. Wait no, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, productions are of two types:\n\n1. A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals.\n2. A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal.\n\nSo some productions might involve terminals, as long as they're on the right side without any non-terminals. Therefore, in this grammar, some rules have two non-terminals, some have one terminal and one non-terminal, and some might directly have terminals as the right-hand side.\n\nNow, the string provided is a sequence of terminals, so the parser would need to derive this string starting from the start symbol S. Each step of the derivation must produce exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal or two terminals?) Wait, no. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So in a derivation, each step replaces a non-terminal with either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the overall derivation will lead to the string being built up by expanding non-terminals and replacing them step by step.\n\nGiven that, the string is quite long, so I need a systematic way to check each symbol. But doing this manually for a string of approximately 30 symbols would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns or check if each terminal in the string appears in any production as a terminal. Let me go through each symbol in the string and see if it's present in any production as a terminal.\n\nThe string is:\nt13 t14 t25 t42 t42 t23 t8 t10 t99 t88 t70 t19 t40 t90 t25 t22 t88 t25 t90 t10 t30 t60 t14 t10 t37 t12 t99 t14 t70.\n\nLet me check each symbol against the productions. I'll create a list of all terminals present in the right-hand side of any production.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules:\n\nThe terminals given are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- t13 appears in NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- t14 appears in NT0 \u2192 't14', NT1 \u2192 't14', etc.\n- t25 appears in NT1 \u2192 't25' and NT2 \u2192 't25' I think. Wait, looking through:\nFrom the rule list, I see NT1 -> 't25' and possibly others. Let me scan more carefully:\nFor example, S -> 't40'\u2014 no, that's not in the rules. Wait, looking at the initial rule list, some rules produce terminals. Let's see: I see rules like NT2 \u2192 't33', NT2 \u2192 't37', etc. So the terminals are:\n\nFrom the given productions, the terminals are 't13', 't14', 't25', 't42', 't42', 't23', 't8', 't10', 't99', 't88', 't70', 't19', 't40', 't90', 't22', 't88', 't30', 't60', 't14', 't70', etc. Specifically, the string contains these terminals:\n\nt13, t14, t25, t42, t42, t23, t8, t10, t99, t88, t70, t19, t40, t90, t22, t88, t25, t90, t10, t30, t60, t14, t10, t37, t12, t99, t14, t70.\n\nNow, for each of these terminals, we need to check if they appear in any production as a terminal. Because if a terminal does not appear as a terminal in any production, it cannot be part of the language.\n\nLooking through the productions, let's see if all these terminals appear on the right-hand side of some production:\n\n- t13: Yes, in NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- t14: Yes, in NT0 \u2192 't14', NT1 \u2192 't14', perhaps others."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break down the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure should make parsing easier using algorithms like CYK, but I'm not going to use an algorithm; instead, I'll try to manually parse the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t91 t23 t41 t65 t34 t91 t75 t25 t23 t52 t33 t8 t41 t33 t52 t65 t25 t19 t42 t75 t91 t42 t14 t34 t13 t23 t14 t75 t12 t52.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, the production NT9 -> 't91' and similar. The first step is to find all the non-terminals that directly correspond to the terminals in the string.\n\nWait a minute, but the string consists entirely of terminal symbols, right? The string is a sequence of t followed by numbers, like 't91', which corresponds to a production like NT9 -> 't91'. So each token in the string is a terminal symbol, and I need to see if the grammar can derive this exact sequence.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two possible productions: S -> NT3 NT9 and S -> NT3 NT2. So the string must start with the non-terminal symbols from either of these productions.\n\nBut wait, no. Actually, the productions are NT3 -> something and NT9 or NT2 also, but NT3 and NT2 are non-terminals that further split into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if the entire string can be broken down starting from S, considering S's productions, and then see if each part can be derived into the corresponding terminals.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe a better approach is to check each token in the string and see if there's a path in the grammar leading to that terminal.\n\nBut first, let's note that each production either splits into two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT9 can produce 't91', and that's one of the 't91's in the string. Similarly, NT6 can produce 't34', and other non-terminals can produce different terminals.\n\nBut the string is a long sequence, so perhaps we can break it down into parts. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider each production and see if the string can be split accordingly.\n\nWait, but considering this might take too long, maybe I can look for any inconsistencies. For example, if any token in the string is not directly produced by a non-terminal, or if any non-terminal split doesn't match the entire token.\n\nWait, another thought: in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the string must be a series of these. But each non-terminal production in the string must be matched by a split in the grammar.\n\nLet me check each token in the string against the grammar. For each token, is it directly produced by any non-terminal? So for example, 't91' is produced by NT9.\n\nSimilarly, 't23' is produced by NT23? Wait, wait, looking at the productions, no NT23 exists. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let me look through the productions to see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT9 -> 't91', which matches 't91' in the string.\n\nBut then, looking for 't23', I need to see if any non-terminal produces 't23'. Looking through the productions, I don't see NT23 in the productions listed. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the productions: the production NT3 -> 't30' is present, but 't30' is not in the string. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the string can be broken down into parts that each match the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a more organized approach would help. Let me list each token and see if it's possible.\n\n1. t91: yes, NT9 -> 't91'.\n2. t23: looking for a production that ends with 't23'. Do any non-terminals produce 't23'? Checking, I don't see any, which might be a problem.\nWait, maybe I missed a production. Let me scan through all productions again.\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't91' (yes)\n- No NT23 production. So 't23' is not directly a terminal of any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nSince the string has 't23', but there's no non-terminal in the grammar that produces 't23', that would mean it's impossible to derive 't23' from any sequence of non-terminals, because the productions only produce terminals, and 't23' isn't a terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but 't23' is a terminal.

Hmm, the grammar is quite extensive with multiple production rules, so I'll need to figure out a way to approach this without getting lost in the complexity.\n\nFirst, let me parse the grammar. CNF means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see a lot of NT (probably non-terminals) leading into terminals and other non-terminals.

Let me check NT3's rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3 has the following productions:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nSo NT3 must expand into NT6 and NT2. Then, each of these NTs would have to produce their respective terminals or proceed further.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 in S \u2192 NT3 NT9 would lead to a recursive structure because S can't be derived to a terminal unless NT3 and NT9 both can produce terminals. Wait a minute, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so S has to derive into something that starts with NT3 and ends with NT9. Then NT9 would have to be a terminal as well.\n\nWait, looking at NT9's productions, I see a terminal 't19' among others. Let me check NT9's rules:\n\nNT9 has:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT8\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT8\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT2 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT8 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT8\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT2 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT8 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n- NT9 \u2192 't14'\n- NT9 \u2192 't12'\n- NT9 \u2192 't70'\n- NT9 \u2192 't34'\n- NT9 \u2192 't65'\n- NT9 \u2192 't88'\n- NT9 \u2192 't70'\n- NT9 \u2192 't34'\n- NT9 \u2192 't42'\n- NT9 \u2192 't34'\n- NT9 \u2192 't34'\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- NT9 \u2192 't88'\n- NT9 \u2192 't70'\n- NT9 \u2192 't34'\n- NT9 \u2192 't65'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT9 \u2192 't22'\n- NT9 \u2192 't30'\n- NT9 \u2192 't91'\n\nWait, hold on, some of these look like errors because producing NT9 \u2192 NT9 would be a recursive production that might lead to infinite loops. But some of these produce terminals like 't75', 't60', etc.\n\nLooking through, I see that NT9 can directly produce 't75' as one of its rules. So if, during derivation, NT9 is expanded directly into 't75', that part is okay.\n\nNow, back to the main structure. S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So S is NT3 NT9. NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.

{"custom_id":"request-608","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding everything I need to do here.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in CNF, which means every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. I'll look for any production rules where the left-hand side is the start symbol S. In this case, the start symbol seems to be S, and its productions are:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nNext, I notice that many of the non-terminals (NT) have productions that lead down to terminals (t followed by numbers). For example, NT9 -> 't75', which is a terminal. So the grammar seems to be a terminal rewriting system once we get down to these productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t19 t8 t88 t8 t60 t88 t30 t13 t23 t65 t41 t88 t42 t30 t13 t30 t22 t90 t70 t90 t23 t41 t8 t90 t30 t90 t14 t34 t12 t91 t19`\n\nI think I should parse this string step by step using the grammar to see if I can derive the entire string starting from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation will replace a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals, except for when a production leads directly to a terminal (but in CNF, all productions have two non-terminals, so maybe I need to track which non-terminals are terminals or not? Wait, no\u2014if the grammar is in CNF, all productions are of the form NT -> NT NT, so each production is two non-terminals. But some of these non-terminals may lead to terminals eventually. So perhaps I should check if any production in the grammar leads directly to a terminal, but looking through the rules, it seems all productions produce non-terminals until they reach the terminals like 't19', etc.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a non-terminal is rewritten into two non-terminals, then each step increases the length of the string by one. Hmm, but the string's length is 36 tokens. Wait, the string is separated by spaces, so that's 36 terms. Let me count them: t19, t8, t88, t8, t60, t88, t30, t13, t23, t65, t41, t88, t42, t30, t13, t30, t22, t90, t70, t90, t23, t41, t8, t90, t30, t90, t14, t34, t12, t91, t19 \u2014 that's 34 terms. Wait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list them:\n\n1. t19\n2. t8\n3. t88\n4. t8\n5. t60\n6. t88\n7. t30\n8. t13\n9. t23\n10. t65\n11. t41\n12. t88\n13. t42\n14. t30\n15. t13\n16. t30\n17. t22\n18. t90\n19. t70\n20. t90\n21. t23\n22. t41\n23. t8\n24. t90\n25. t30\n26. t90\n27. t14\n28. t34\n29. t12\n30. t91\n31. t19\n\nAh, so 31 terms in total. Each production step from S will lead to a string that's N symbols longer, where N is the length of the string being built. Wait, but that might complicate things. Maybe a better approach is to see if the given string can be generated by the grammar step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule replaces a single symbol with two others, which means the number of symbols in the string grows by one each time. So starting from S, after one step, you have two non-terminals. Then, each step can replace each non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the string length grows by one each time until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a more practical approach is to attempt to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be broken down according to the production rules.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t19. I need to see if there's a production that generates a non-terminal leading to t19, or directly produces t19, but looking at the rules, when I look for anything that produces t19, I don't see any. For example, NT9 -> 't40', 't75', etc. Wait, no. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see 't19' being a terminal. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the provided production rules:\n\n- I see NT9 -> 't14', t34, t12, t91, t19. Wait, no, looking more carefully through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, under NT7: NT7 -> 't40', 't10', 't19' (from the line: NT7 -> NT1 -> ...). Wait, maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, the rules as provided are:\n\nNT7 -> NT5 NT4\nNT7 -> NT0 NT8\nNT7 -> NT1 NT2\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look through each rule for NT9 and NT7 to see if they ever produce 't19'.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT7 has a rule leading to 't40' (e.g., NT7 -> 't40'), but 't19' is also reached elsewhere. Wait, looking back, under NT7: I see 't10', 't19', etc.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again at the lines under NT7:\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- Line: NT7 -> NT5 NT4\n- Line: NT7 -> NT0 NT8\n- Line: NT7 -> NT1 NT2\n- Also, elsewhere, NT7 -> 't40' (e.g., in NT0 -> 't70' (no), wait, maybe I need to check NT7: No, looking back, in the user-provided grammar, for example, NT7 -> 't40' is present in NT7: NT7 -> 't40' perhaps. Wait, I think I need to parse the entire grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is to perform a recursive descent parser, but given time constraints, maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that if the string is correctly derivable, each production must correctly split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet me see, the initial production is S -> NT3 NT9. So the string must start with whatever NT3 produces and then whatever NT9 produces.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT3: NT3 -> NT6 NT2, NT3 -> NT0 NT7, etc.\n\nBut this process is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for the parts of the string that could match the terminals generated by the grammar.\n\nFor example, since t19 is the first token, I need to see if any production of a non-terminal can generate t19. Looking through the rules, I see that NT1 and NT7 can produce t19. Let's check the rules:\n\nLooking for t19 anywhere as a terminal:\n\n- NT7 -> 't40', 't10', 't19'\nWait, no, looking back: I think the rules have NT7 -> 't40' sometimes. Wait, in the user-provided rules:\n\nLooking at NT7:\n- NT7 -> NT5 NT4\n- NT7 -> NT0 NT8\n- NT7 -> NT1 NT2\nWait, but I don't see 't19' being produced by NT7 directly. Wait, but perhaps lower in the grammar, NT7 might produce t19. For example, looking at the end of the rules:\n\n- Line: NT7 -> NT6 NT5\n- Line: NT7 -> NT6 NT4\n- Line: NT7 -> NT5 NT4\n\nHmm, perhaps not directly. Wait, maybe I should find a production that leads to t19.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking through the provided rules, t19 is only produced by nt7? Or perhaps in another rule.\n\nWait, let's check for all rules for each NT where the rule might generate t19. For example, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the entire list of NTs:\n\n- NT7 has nt7 -> 't4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-604","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal character or two non-terminals. That makes parsing a bit easier, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the string and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules. Let's write down the string to make it clearer:\n\nt10 t34 t13 t99 t40 t91 t25 t65 t60 t12 t13 t14 t40 t33 t60 t23 t23 t34 t22 t14 t25 t41 t37 t23 t65 t41 t42 t70 t52 t23 t88\n\nThat's quite a long string. Each 't' followed by two numbers seems to be a terminal symbol. The question is whether this sequence can be generated starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce two non-terminals: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So, no matter what, the entire string must start with the productions of NT3 or NT2 followed by NT9 or NT2 respectively.\n\nWait, let me make sure about that. The first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the string starts with NT3 NT9. The second is S \u2192 NT3 NT2, but since the string starts with NT3 first, it must follow the first production.\n\nTherefore, our string should begin with the symbols derived from NT3 and NT9.\n\nLet me break down NT3 and NT9. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 has the production NT0 NT7. So, NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. Then, NT0 has multiple productions. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3, NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT7, etc. Let me see the possible derivations.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 can produce 't75' or other non-terminals. For example, NT9 can become 't75' or other combinations. Since we have a terminal at the end of the string, let's check if the last part can be 't75' or another terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is t88. So, does NT9 produce 't75' or 't88'?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT9 has the production NT3 NT7 and also NT2 NT1. Also, other complex productions? Let me check the grammar for NT9:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7 and NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1, NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT8, NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT9 (this looks recursive), and also NT9 itself can be broken down into other terms. But in the string, the last token is t88, which must come from some terminal production.\n\nLet me check which non-terminals can produce t88. Looking through the grammar, the productions that result in terminal strings (since most are two non-terminals except for some that produce a single 't' followed by numbers):\n\nFor example, NT4 can produce 't88' (checking: yes, NT4 \u2192 't88' directly). Also, NT2 \u2192 't33', but t22 can be from NT9 \u2192 't22'.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt10, t34, t13, t99, t40, t91, t25, t65, t60, t12, t13, t14, t40, t33, t60, t23, t23, t34, t22, t14, t25, t41, t37, t23, t65, t41, t42, t70, t52, t23, t88.\n\nLooking for t88, I see that NT4 directly produces 't88', so that's a possible token.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9 (since the string starts with t10 which might come from NT3's derivations) and the end token is t88 from NT4, which is derived from NT9.\n\nNow, NT9 (as the second symbol) needs to be derived into something that can produce t88 and then more. But wait, actually, the string is a flat list of tokens, so perhaps S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which then expands NT3 and NT9 into their respective parts.\n\nLet me start mapping:\n\nThe string is a series of tokens:\n\n1. t10\n2. t34\n3. t13\n4. t99\n5. t40\n6. t91\n7. t25\n8. t65\n9. t60\n10. t12\n11. t13\n12. t14\n13. t40\n14. t33\n15. t60\n16. t23\n17. t23\n18. t34\n19. t22\n20. t14\n21. t25\n22. t41\n23. t37\n24. t23\n25. t65\n26. t41\n27. t42\n28. t70\n29. t52\n30. t23\n31. t88\n\nThis is a long string, 31 tokens. So, each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. So, the process is from S, which produces NT3 and NT9. So, the first part is NT3 and the second is NT9.\n\nNow, let's see what NT3 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. So, that's two non-terminals. NT0 can produce several things. Let's track what each symbol could be.\n\nLooking at NT0: it has productions like NT1 NT3, NT2 NT2, NT5 NT7, etc. So, NT0 is complicated. Similarly, NT9 can produce 't75' or other non-terminals, but we need to see if it can reach t88 eventually.\n\nBut wait, t88 is produced by NT4, so for the last part, whatever reaches NT9 must eventually produce t88 as one of the terminals. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to approach this systematically. Maybe parsing the string using the grammar.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps the start symbol must generate a sequence that can break down into the tokens. Alternatively, perhaps the start symbol can generate the necessary terminals.\n\nBut let's try to see if the entire string can be built step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, the string is parsed as:\n\nFirst part: NT3 \u2192 ?\n\nSecond part: NT9 \u2192 ?\n\nBut we need to see whether these two can produce the respective parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t10. Let's see where t10 comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, where do t10, t12, etc., appear as terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t40, t10? Let me check: NT7 can produce t40 or NT1 NT5. Wait, in the grammar, the productions for NT7 are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4\nNT7 \u2192 NT6 NT5\nNT7 \u2192 NT6 NT0\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT8\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n\nWait, none of these directly produce t10. Instead, looking at other non-terminals:\n\nLooking for 't10' in terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the list, it seems that NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT9, and perhaps other terminals. Also, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 't33' and others, but t10 is another terminal, which must come from some NT's production.\n\nWait, checking NT1: NT1 has a production NT1 \u2192 't25' or other non-terminals. So, t10 isn't directly a terminal of any non-terminal, except perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT0 \u2192 't13', so 't13' is directly produced by NT0. Similarly:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, the terminals are:\n\nt10, t34, t13, t99, t40, t91, t25, t65, t60, t12, t13, t14, t40, t33, t60, t23, t23, t34, t22, t14, t25, t41, t37, t23, t65, t41, t42,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-627","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with determining whether the given string is generated by the provided Context-Free Grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. The grammar is provided, and it's in CNF, which is a specific form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. However, looking at the grammar, I notice that there are production rules starting with terminals, such as NT9 \u2192 t70, which suggests that the terminals are on the right-hand side. This could complicate things because CNF typically deals with productions starting with non-terminals. So, maybe the grammar has been converted into a slightly extended form where terminals can appear directly on the right. That\u2019s something to keep in mind, but for the most part, the grammar is still in CNF for non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t70 t10 t22 t60 t37 t34 t75 t33 t90 t22 t40 t37 t23 t88 t30 t10 t8 t8 t75 t52 t42 t42 t88 t90 t37 t34 t30 t91 t40 t30 t70 t30`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. This involves seeing if the string can be derived through a series of productions starting from the start symbol S and following the rules until all non-terminals are expanded into terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol S, it's defined as:\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\nS \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo, any string generated must start with either NT3 followed by NT9 or NT3 followed by NT2.\n\nLet me look at the string. The first token is t70. To generate t70, I have to find a production in the grammar that results in t70. Scanning through the production rules, I see NT7 \u2192 t70, which is a direct production. So, the first non-terminal must be NT7, and it's replaced by t70.\n\nWait, no. NT7 is a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, the production NT7 \u2192 t70 is listed, meaning that when NT7 is used, it can be replaced by the terminal t70. So, for the first token t70, the prior non-terminal before S must have generated it. Let's see how that connects. \n\nSo, S can produce NT3 followed by NT9. Let's tentatively say that the first part might be NT3 producing t70. Wait, but looking at the productions, NT7 is a non-terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing NT with the terminal t. So, to get t70, the production that leads to it is NT7 \u2192 t70. So, the string starts with t70, which comes from NT7.\n\nBut S directly expands to NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. How is NT7 involved here? That's confusing. Maybe the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then each of those non-terminals are expanded. So, perhaps the string's first few tokens come from the expansion of NT3 and NT9.\n\nWait, no. Let's approach this differently. Let's parse the string backward, trying to see if each token can be matched by a production. That might help in breaking down the structure.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to reconstruct possible leftmost derivations.\n\nGiven the first token is t70, and the only way to get t70 is through NT7 \u2192 t70. So, looking at NT7, what can generate it? Let's see the rules for NT7:\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT7:\nNT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4\nNT7 \u2192 NT0 NT8\nNT7 \u2192 NT1 NT9\n\nNone of these directly produce t70, since the only terminal in NT7's rules so far is NT7 \u2192 t70. So, if the first token is t70, it must come directly from NT7. That would mean that in the derivation, the last step was the production of NT7 \u2192 t70.\n\nSo, working backward, the string can be broken as:\n\n... t70 (from NT7) t10 ...\n\nTherefore, the last production must have been (NT7 \u2192 t70). Before that, we need to derive the t10. How?\n\nLooking for t10, I see that NT10 doesn't exist. Wait, or is there a production that leads to t10? Checking the rules, I see NT10 isn't listed. Wait, no, not in the given productions. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking again, I don't see any productions resulting in t10 except NT6 \u2192 t30, NT3 \u2192 t30, etc. Wait, t10 is a terminal, and I look for NT productions that produce t10.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 t70, which we've accounted for. NT0 isn't producing t10. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check: Do any NT non-terminals produce t10?\n\nLooking through the rules for each NT:\n\n- NT8: several rules, but all produce 't's, none produce t10.\n- NT7: same as above.\n- NT5: no, all produce 't's but not t10.\nWait, perhaps the production NT10 doesn't exist. So, how is t10 produced? It seems t10 is a terminal that must come from somewhere. But looking at the production rules, no NT non-terminal ends up producing t10. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm missing a production for NT10?\n\nLooking back, I don't see NT0 producing t70, but wait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me go through the rules again quickly. Hmm, I see NT7 \u2192 t70, that's it. So, if the string has t10, there must be a production that leads to t10. But I don't see that. That would mean that the string cannot be generated, because t10 can't be produced by any NT production.\n\nTherefore, that would mean the string isn't possible. But wait, that can't be the case because the string is provided, and perhaps I'm misinterpreting the derivation steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t10 is part of a longer expansion from a non-terminal that has rules to produce t10 through other steps. Let me check. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3, and so on. But none of those seem to directly produce t10. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's go back. The string starts with t70, which comes from NT7. Then, after t70 comes t10. So, the t10 must come from somewhere in the derivation of NT9 or NT2. Because earlier, I thought the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then NT3 could produce t70.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the first part is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then NT3 expands to something and NT9 to t70.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with NT7, but S can't directly produce NT7. Wait, no. S can only produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So, S must always start with NT3, and then either NT9 or NT2.\n\nWait a second, now I'm getting more confused. Because in the string, the first token is t70, which must come from NT7. But S's production only starts with NT3. So, how can NT7 appear as the first symbol? That doesn't make sense because S can't produce t70 directly since S's left-hand side is NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2, not NT7. Therefore, the first token t70 cannot be the immediate expansion from S, unless there's a chain of productions that eventually leads to t70.\n\nBut that's impossible because S is the start symbol, and all derivations must come from it. So, the first symbol must be a terminal that results from S's expansion. But S only directly expands to NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2, neither of which produce t70. Therefore, the first token t70 can't be generated from S because S doesn't have a production that starts with t70.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because S expands into NT3 and NT9, so the first part would be NT3 and the second would be NT9. So, the first token would come from NT3, not S. Therefore, the first token t70 must be generated by NT3.\n\nSo, let's look at NT3's production rules:\n\nThe rules for NT3 include:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT8\nNT3 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 but wait, that's a terminal? Wait, looking back: I see NT3 \u2192 NT9. No, that's a non-terminal.

Wait, no, Chomsky normal form requires the right-hand side to have exactly two non-terminals except for the start symbol. Hmm, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, they all seem to have two non-terminals on the right, except when a terminal appears. Wait, no, some rules do have terminals.

Similarly, NT0 -> 't13', NT9 -> 't75', etc.\n\nSo for the string, each occurrence of these terminals must be generated by their respective non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string starts with t10. Let's see if any non-terminal directly produces t10. Looking at the rules, I don't see any production like NTX -> 't10'. So that's a problem because the grammar might not have a production rule for t10.\n\nWait, but the string includes t10, so if the grammar can't generate t10 from any non-terminal, then the string can't be in the language. So that would mean the answer is No.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any production rule that leads to t10.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I only see rules where some non-terminals produce t8, t13, t25, etc., but t10 isn't among them. So it seems that t10 is not a terminal in any production, meaning it can't be generated from the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be in the language.\n\nWait, unless there's a way for t10 to be produced through a chain of productions, but if t10 isn't produced directly, and the grammar doesn't have a path to it, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules provided, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't10'. So the steps are: the string contains 't10', but the grammar can't generate '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-647","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Hmm, first, I should probably understand what the grammar is doing. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. But wait, looking at some of these, some rules have a terminal first, like S -> NT3 NT9, or others have a mix. Oh, right, Chomsky normal form allows the right-hand side to be two non-terminals or a terminal, but they can't have more than one terminal. So, okay, that\u2019s a slight variation, but the structure is still manageable.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of t-... tokens. So, let me see: t8, t25, t34, etc. Now, each terminal in the grammar is a two-letter code, right? So, each production can generate a certain sequence of these tokens.\n\nLet me start by mapping the grammar rules to see how they produce terminals. For example, S -> NT3 NT9. NT3 -> NT0 NT7, and so on. This seems a bit complex, but maybe I can find a way to parse the string step by step.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to perform a derivation. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT3 and NT9. Let me see how NT3 and NT9 can generate their respective parts.\n\nLooking at NT3: NT3 -> NT0 NT7. Then NT0 can expand in several ways. Looking at the rules, NT0 can go to NT1 NT3, NT2 NT2, NT4 NT0, etc. This seems a bit of a tree. The string starts with t8, which is the terminal for NT3 maybe? Let me check the end productions. Oh, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT2 -> 't33' and so on.\n\nWait, the string starts with t8. Let me check which NT corresponds to t8. Looking through the productions, I see NT2->'t33', NT7->'t10', NT4->'t88' etc. Wait, actually, some of them directly produce terminals. For example, NT8 -> 't52', NT9->'t75', etc. Oh, but in the given string, the first token is t8. Let me check the grammar: looking at all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly leading to t8 as a terminal. Wait, wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, looking at the end productions: looking through the entire grammar, I see NT7 -> 't65', NT2 -> 't33', NT3 -> 't30', etc. So, t8 isn't directly produced by any non-terminal. Or is it? Hmm, looking back, maybe I missed it. Let me go through all the end productions:\n\nLooking at NT2: NT2->'t33', etc. No, t8 is not directly produced. Wait, then how is t8 appearing in the string? That might mean that the grammar doesn't produce t8 at all, so the string can't be generated. But wait, let me double-check because maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking through all the end productions:\n\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT6 -> 't34'\n- NT1 -> 't25'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT5 -> 't91'\n- NT6 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT8 -> 't37'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n- NT3 -> 't90'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT7 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't42'\n- NT9 -> 't22'\n- NT9 -> 't14'\n- NT4 -> 't99'\n- NT8 -> 't23'\n- NT5 -> 't37'\n\nWait, I think I see NT6->'t8', yes. So NT6 produces 't8'. So how does NT6 generate 't8'? Let me look at the rules for NT6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 can expand in a few ways:\n\nNT6 -> NT3 NT6\nNT4 -> NT7 NT0\nNT6 -> NT8 NT4\nWait, no, NT6 has:\n\nLooking at the given rules, the production for NT6 is:\n\nNT6 -> NT8 NT4\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7 NT0\netc. So, NT6 can expand into NT8 NT4. But wait, in the string, the first token is t8, which is 't8'. So, if the string starts with 't8', that would require that NT6 expands directly into 't8', but according to the rules, NT6->'t8' is a production, right? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, yes, in the end productions, I see NT6->'t8' under NT6:\n\nLooking through all the end productions:\n\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n\nYes, so NT6 can directly produce 't8'. So how does that fit into the string.\n\nSo, the string starts with t8. That could correspond to NT6.\n\nSo, S starts as NT3 NT9. NT3 goes to NT0 NT7. NT0 can go to various things. Let's try to see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step, building the parse tree.\n\nThe string is: t8 t25 t34 t19 t12 t22 t33 t65 t99 t13 t99 t12 t99 t23 t99 t65 t70 t99 t19 t99 t25 t33 t14 t13 t99 t99 t99 t42 t60 t25 t99 t10 t90.\n\nGiven that, let's attempt to parse this string.\n\nStart with S: S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t8. NT3 can expand into NT0 NT7.\n\nNow, NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, so the string up to now would require NT0 NT7 to produce t8. But wait, t8 is part of the string. So, maybe the next step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT7 NT9.\n\nThen, NT0 \u2192 something that produces t8. But wait, NT0 can expand into several things, including NT1 NT3, NT2 NT2, NT4 NT0, etc. Wait, but NT0 as a non-terminal can't directly produce t8 because looking at the end productions, NT0 produces things like 't13', 't65', etc., but not 't8'. Hmm, but earlier, I thought that NT6 produces 't8', not NT0. So this suggests a problem because the string starts with t8, which would require that NT6 is the direct derivation. But S starts as NT3 NT9, so how do we get NT6?\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to see whether the entire string can be generated by the grammar, perhaps by seeing if each part fits into the substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string contains a terminal 't8' which is not produced by any rule, meaning the grammar can't generate it. But wait, I found earlier that NT6->'t8' is a rule. So maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, let me confirm the rules again. Yes, looking through:\n\nNT6: \n- NT6 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT5 -> NT7 NT5\n- etc.\n\nAnd in the rules, yes, NT6->'t8' is a direct production. So, that's fine.\n\nSo, the string starts with t8. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. So now, we have NT0 NT7 NT9.\n\nNow, NT0 can expand into various things. Let's look for how NT0 can produce the next part of the string. The string after NT3 is producing t8, but NT0 isn't producing t8. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a parse tree step by step. Let me try this.\n\nThe string is: [t8] [t25] [t34] [t19] [t12] [t22] [t33] [t65] [t99] [t13] [t99] [t12] [t99] [t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-649","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t91 t13 t42 t88 t12 t34 t88 t99 t65 t25 t14 t75 t30 t88 t90 t37 t8 t88 t42 t65 t42 t99 t42 t65 t65 t41 t41 t19 t33 t42 t34 t23 t90`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals and the right-hand sides are pairs or single terminals.\n\nThe problem is to see if the string can be derived step by step using these productions. Since the string consists of a series of terminal symbols, I need to see if the grammar can produce it.\n\nI'll start by listing all the production rules and terminals involved. The non-terminals from the grammar are S, NT0, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT8, and NT9. The terminals are t91, t13, t42, t88, t12, t34, t89 (wait, t89 isn't there, but in the string it's t88 and others), and so on. \n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For instance, NT9 produces t75, t91, t60, etc. NT8 produces t52 and t37. NT6 can produce t34 or other strings. Let's check which non-terminals have direct terminals:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t91, t75, t60, t22, t14, t37, etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 t52, t37\n- NT0 \u2192 t13, t2, t41, etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 t34, t8, etc.\n- Others like NT3, NT4, NT7, etc., have productions to other non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t91. Looking at the grammar, NT9 can produce t91. So the first symbol t91 must come from NT9. Let's assume S \u2192 NT9 NT2 (as per the first rule). So the start symbol S is expanded into NT9 NT2. \n\nNow, the string after t91 is t13, t42, etc. So after NT9, which becomes t91, the next part is NT2. Let's check NT2's productions. Looking at the grammar, NT2 has multiple productions: NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8, NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7, etc. So after NT2, the next symbols should follow the production of NT2.\n\nThe next symbol after t91 is t13. T13 could be from NT0's production, since NT0 \u2192 t13. So after NT2, which would expand to something, the next part should be t13. Let me check the options for NT2. For example, if NT2 produces NT0 NT1, then t13 would come from NT0.\n\nWait, let me map this step by step:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT9 NT2.\n2. NT9 \u2192 t91.\n3. Now, the next part is NT2. The string after t91 is t13, so the next production should produce t13. Let's see if any of NT2's productions can lead to t13 directly or through a chain.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions:\n- NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- etc.\n\nAh, there's a production NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT1. NT0 \u2192 t13, so NT0 NT1 would produce t13 and then whatever NT1 produces. So if NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT1, and then NT1 \u2192 something that produces t42, then the next symbol after t13 would be t42.\n\nLet's check NT1's productions: NT1 has several, like \u2192 NT4 NT8, \u2192 NT0 NT4, \u2192 NT7 NT5, \u2192 NT9 NT8, etc. We need NT1 to produce t42.\n\nLooking for NT1 productions that lead to t42, or can lead to t42. Let's see:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8. Let's see what NT4 and NT8 can produce. NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8, etc. NT8 \u2192 t52 and t37. Wait, t42 isn't directly produced. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another path. Let's consider the immediate expansion. After NT9 (t91) comes NT2, which expands to NT0 NT1. So far, the string is t91 t13 ... (since NT0 \u2192 t13). Now, the next symbol is t42, which should come from NT1. So NT1 needs to produce t42.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions again, is there a way to get t42? For example, NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT8: if NT5 produces t37 and NT8 produces t52, that would give t37 t52, which isn't t42. Or perhaps another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me retrace. After t91 comes t13 (from NT0), then t42. So after NT2 expands, it's NT0 NT1, which gives t13 followed by something that gives t42. So the key is whether NT1 can produce t42. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8. Let's see what NT4 and NT8 can produce. \n\nNT4 has rules like \u2192 NT2 NT8 and \u2192 NT7 NT0. Suppose NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT1, which would produce t13 and then NT1 again. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8. Let's see what NT2 and NT8 can produce. NT2 could expand into NT0 NT1 again, which would produce t13. NT8 can produce t52 or t37. So combining, we get t13 t52 or t13 t37. Neither is t42.\n\nAnother production: NT1 \u2192 NT2 NT7. Suppose NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT1 (t13) and NT7 \u2192 t75 or other things. Still, not t42.\n\nWait, perhaps another path. Does any NT1 production lead to t42? Or maybe t42 comes from another non-terminal downstream.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to see if the entire string can be parsed by the grammar. Another approach is to look for each terminal and see if there's a corresponding non-terminal that can produce it, building a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string for clarity:\n\nt91, t13, t42, t88, t12, t34, t88, t99, t65, t25, t14, t75, t30, t88, t90, t37, t8, t88, t42, t65, t42, t99, t42, t65, t65, t41, m41, t19, t33, t42, t34, t23, t90.\n\nFirst, t91 must come from NT9.\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT2.\n\nThen NT2 must produce the remaining string starting after t91: t13 t42 t88 t99 t65 t25 t14 t75 t30 t88 t90 t37 t8 t88 t42 t65 t42 t99 t42 t65 t65 t41 t41 t19 t33 t42 t34 t23 t90.\n\nFrom NT2, since S is already started, wait, no: S is NT9 NT2, so after NT9 (t91), the next is NT2, which needs to produce the rest of the string except for t91.

{"custom_id":"request-662","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is quite long, and the grammar seems complicated with a bunch of productions. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All terminal symbols appear on the right-hand side of the productions, which helps in parsing, but in this case, I need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and according to the production rules, S can derive either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So the first step is to see if the string starts with either of these combinations. The string starts with 't37 t41 t37 t41...'. Wait, let me check the productions for NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- Also, other NT3 productions, but most likely, the starting point is NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the initial symbols are NT3 and NT9. Let me see what NT3 and NT9 can produce.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nSo NT3 will produce two symbols: NT6 and NT2. Let me check what NT6 can do. According to the production rules, NT6 can produce NT8 NT4 or NT5 NT7.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first part is t37 t41 t37 t41... I need to track how the non-terminals can be resolved to terminals. Let me look for the productions that directly output terminals.\n\nLooking through the list, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals: for example, NT9 \u2192 't75', NT8 \u2192 't52', etc. So each time a non-terminal appears in the string, I should check what it can produce.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step. The first part is t37 t41 t37 t41 t10 t8 t60 t75... Since S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the first step is NT3 and NT9. NT9 produces 't75' directly, so the first token is t75. But in the string, the first token is t37, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I got the initial productions wrong. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nAh, wait. The grammar's initial productions are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So S produces two non-terminals. But in the string, the first token is t37, which is a terminal. So perhaps I need to see which non-terminals produce t37.\n\nLooking at the list of productions, I see that NT8 \u2192 't52', NT9 \u2192 't75', etc. I don't see any production that directly leads to 't37' on the right side except in NT9 produces 't75', which doesn't help. Wait, looking again, I see 't37' appears in NT9 productions. Let me check specific productions.\n\nWait, in the list of productions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- But I don't see any production for NT9 that produces 't37'. Wait, looking again, I see NT8 \u2192 't52', NT3 \u2192 't30', NT7 \u2192 't70'... Hmm, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the productions to see which ones produce 't37'. Let me look through the list again.\n\nLooking through the list, I notice that some productions produce terminals:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT6 \u2192 't34'\n- NT1 \u2192 't25'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8' (Wait, is that a typo? NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 't8')\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT8 \u2192 't37'\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT6 \u2192 't88' (Another 't6' production)\n- NT1 \u2192 't40'\n- NT7 \u2192 't10'\n- NT1 \u2192 't19'\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT4 \u2192 't88'\n- NT2 \u2192 't37' (Ah, here's another production for NT2 \u2192 t37)\n- NT3 \u2192 't90'\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n- NT7 \u2192 't70'\n- NT8 \u2192 't41'\n- NT4 \u2192 't42'\n- NT9 \u2192 't22'\n- NT9 \u2192 't14'\n- NT4 \u2192 't99'\n- NT8 \u2192 't23'\n- NT5 \u2192 't37'\n\nWait, so looking carefully, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 't37', as does NT8 \u2192 't37'.\n\nSo, NT2 can produce 't37', and NT8 can produce 't37'. So in the string, the first token is 't37', which could come from either NT2 or NT8.\n\nGiven that, let me see: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Wait, but the first symbol is t37, which requires that one of the non-terminals in NT3 or NT9 leads to 't37'. But NT3's production is NT6 NT2, so maybe this is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire process of generating the string step by step, starting from S and expanding non-terminals until all are terminals. Since the string is long, this might take some time, but perhaps the initial steps can help determine if it's possible.\n\nAnother approach: look for the leftmost derivation. The string starts with 't37 t41 t37...'. So perhaps the first step is to see if the first 't37' comes from NT2 or NT8.\n\nAssuming it comes from NT2, then looking for how NT2 is derived. But NT2's productions are multiple. Let me see:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT2 can produce NT7 NT7, NT6 NT8, NT5 NT6, NT7 NT8.\n\nAlternatively, NT2 appears in other productions as well. It's becoming a bit messy. Maybe it's better to check each symbol in the string step by step, ensuring that each can be derived correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps another way is to parse the string using the grammar, ensuring that each step follows the productions. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to find a way to derive it.\n\nLet me consider that the string is a series of terminals, each of which should be matched by the productions of the non-terminals in a leftmost fashion.\n\nStarting with the first token 't37', which could come from NT2 or NT8.\n\nLet me pick NT2. Then, NT2's productions are:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n\nHmm, but in the string, after t37 is t41, then t37 again. So maybe NT2 \u2192 t37, then another t37, etc.\n\nWait, but if I choose NT2 for the first t37, what about the second t41? Maybe the next non-terminal after NT2 would produce t41. Let me check the productions where a non-terminal leads to t41.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT8 \u2192 't41' and NT4 \u2192 't88' and others. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the string starts with NT3 and NT9 is wrong. Maybe I should explore that.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9: So the first two symbols are NT3 and NT9. Let me see what these produce.\n\nNT3's production is NT6 NT2, and NT9 produces 't75' directly.\n\nSo, after NT3, we have NT6 NT2, and then NT9 is 't75'.\n\nSo, the first symbols would be:\n\nNT6 \u2192 ... , then NT2 \u2192 ..., then 't75'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t37 t41, which don't match NT6 and NT2 since NT3 is NT6 NT2, so the first symbol should be NT6. So, in the string, the first symbol is t37, which if coming from NT6, let me check NT6 productions.\n\nNT6 can produce NT5 NT7 or NT8 NT4. Does any of these produce t37?\n\nLooking at NT5 \u2192 't37', so if NT6 \u2192 NT5 NT..., that could be possible.\n\nBut wait, in the initial step, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So the first symbol is NT6, which needs to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is quite long and consists of several tokens separated by spaces. My first step is to understand the structure of the grammar and see how it can produce strings.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Each production only has two elements on the right side.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The rules from S are:\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo, S directly expands to two non-terminals: NT3 or NT2, followed by NT9 or another NT2, depending on the grammar.\n\nNext, I should look at the other non-terminals and see how they produce the terminals. It seems that each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal. For example, looking at rules like NT8 \u2192 't40', which is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t22 t30 t30 t88 t88 t90 t52 t33 t33 t34 t52 t88 t70 t70 t52 t60 t70 t23 t23 t88 t65 t23 t25 t19 t12 t41 t99 t88 t14 t42 t13 t14 t40 t65`.\n\nI notice that each token is a terminal, and I need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't22'. I need to find a production rule that starts with NT something that can produce 't22'. Looking through the rules, I do see NT2 \u2192 't33'. That's 't33', but we need 't22'. Hmm. Is there a rule for NT with 22 in it? Looking back, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't75', NT2 -> 't37', NT5 -> 't91', etc. Wait, but looking for 't22', I see that it's defined as NT9 \u2192 t22 is not present. Wait, no: looking at the rules, I don't see any NT production that ends with 't22'. Wait, actually, in the rules listed, there's NT9 -> 't75', but also NT9 -> 't60' (twice?), but I don't see any NT that directly produces 't22'. So that's a problem because the first token is 't22', but the grammar doesn't have a production that directly produces 't22' as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I missed that. Let me scan through all the terminals each non-terminal can produce. Oh, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't22' (Yes, it's there: NT9 -> 't75' and 't60' but also NT7 -> 't70', etc. Wait, wait, looking again, the rules have:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\nNT9 -> 't22' \nAnd other rules, but specifically, the production NT9 \u2192 't75' and 't60' but also NT9 \u2192 't22' is there? Wait, no:\n\nLooking back: The list includes:\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- Also, NT9 \u2192 't60' appears twice?\n\nWait, no, let me re-express the rules as I see them:\n\nList of rules includes:\nNT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\nNT9 \u2192 't75'\nNT9 \u2192 't60'\n\nAlso, looking through, I see:\nNT1 \u2192 NT0 NT4\nNT1 \u2192 NT12\nWait, but perhaps I've made a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n- NT9 -> 't75' \n- NT9 -> 't60' (appears twice? Because it's written as NT9 -> 't60', NT9 -> 't60')\n- And also, I see NT9 \u2192 't22' because in the list:\n  \"NT9 -> 't22'\" is present.\n\nWait, yes, looking at the provided grammar, there's indeed a production rule NT9 \u2192 't22'. So, that means NT9 can produce 't22' as a terminal.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't22', which means that the leftmost non-terminal(s) producing this must have 't22' as one of their expansions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can derive either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Either way, after expanding, the first part (NT3 or NT2) will produce some sequence, followed by the expansion of NT9 or NT2.\n\nBut the first token is 't22', which is derived from NT9 \u2192 't22'. So, for the string to start with t22, the derived string must have NT9 \u2192 't22' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which would mean the first production is NT3 followed by NT9. So, NT3 must produce the initial part of the string up to 't22', but wait: that can't be because in S, if you derive NT3 NT9, then the string would start with the expansion of NT3 followed by the expansion of NT9.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Actually, in context-free grammars, the entire string is generated as a linear sequence of productions. So for S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the parser would first expand NT3, then the resulting string would be immediately followed by the expansion of NT9. So, the first symbol of the string would be the first symbol of NT3's expansion, which would be 't22'.\n\nWait, but if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the initial expansion would be NT3 NT9, meaning that in the string, the first token is the first symbol of NT3's expansion, followed by the first symbol of NT9's expansion, which is 't22'.\n\nBut according to the given string, the first token is 't22'. So that would require that the first symbol in the derivation is from a non-terminal that directly produces 't22'.\n\nLooking back, the first symbols:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then NT3 must produce a string starting with 't22', and NT9 must produce a string starting with... well, let's see. Alternatively, if we take S \u2192 NT2, then NT2's expansion must start with 't22'.\n\nBut from the rules, NT2 \u2192 't33'. So if S \u2192 NT2, the first symbol would be 't33', but our string starts with 't22'. So that can't be. Therefore, the production must be S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, NT3's expansion must start with 't22', and NT9's expansion must be 't22' as its first symbol.\n\nWait, but NT9's expansion can be 't22', yes. So, let's see what NT3's production could be.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT3 has:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n... and other rules.\n\nBut looking at the NT3's production:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nSo the expansion of NT3 starts with NT6, then NT2. Let's see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT8 \u2192 't52', for example.\n\nWait, let me try to find a path where NT3 can produce 't22' as the first symbol.\n\nBut looking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, and NT8 can produce 't52', 't40', etc. Alternatively, NT6 also has NT9 \u2192 't22' as a terminal.\n\nSo, if NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, then:\n\nNT6 could go to 't65' (NT6 \u2192 't65') or expand further. Let's see.\n\nWait, NT6 also has:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n\nNT8 can produce 't52' or 't40' or more. Let's try to see.\n\nWait, perhaps NT6 can eventually produce 't22' via another production? Let me check NT6's rules:\n\nLooking back, NT6 has:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 (but maybe that's a different rule)\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT8\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT6 \u2192 NT5 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n\nWait, perhaps that's a typo.

CNF is good for parsing, especially with algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, maybe a bottom-up approach would be better.\n\nThe string is made up of symbols that are either non-terminals (denoted by 't' followed by a number) or terminals, which are specific to this grammar. Each 't' part like 't30', 't65', etc., are terminals because each corresponds to a specific rule in the grammar. For example, looking at the production rules, 't30' is produced by NT3, 't65' by NT6, 't41' by NT8, and so on.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT9. So the start is likely to be a combination of these two non-terminals expanding into the given string.\n\nI should map each term in the string to the corresponding non-terminals in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-687","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Since it's CNF, every production has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. Looking at the first few productions, they all look like S \u2192 NT3 NT9, etc. The terminals are various symbols like t91, t40, etc., and non-terminals are things like NT0, NT1, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols: \"t91 t40 t14 t75 t19 t22 t91 t30 t33 t30 t13 t60 t40 t25 t19 t52 t22 t30 t42 t70 t22 t91 t14 t10 t10 t42 t52 t88 t22 t40 t40 t52 t30 t37 t41\".\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived by the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the string into tokens. Each token is a string like \"t91\", \"t40\", etc. So the string is a list of these tokens.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will have a binary structure. Each production either splits into two non-terminals or terminates with a terminal.\n\nI think the best way is to simulate a Cocke-Younger- Kasami (CYK) algorithm or a recursive descent parser. But without coding, maybe a top-down approach or seeing if each symbol can be matched through leftmost derivations.\n\nBut given the string is quite long, it's better to break it down. Let's see the structure.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first two symbols in the string should be t91 and t40. Looking at the first tokens, it's t91 and t40. So that matches S \u2192 NT3 NT9 since NT3 produces t91 (from the given NT3 \u2192 't30') but wait, no. Wait, let me check: in the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't30' and NT9 \u2192 't75', but the start production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Wait no: looking at the productions, the first production is S -> NT3 NT9, and another S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar:\n\nThe first production is S -> NT3 NT9.\n\nThen, S -> NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, so S can produce NT3 followed by either NT9 or NT2. Since the first symbols in the string are t91 and t40, which correspond to NT9 and NT3? Wait no: looking at the given string tokens:\n\nThe first token is t91. Looking back, in the grammar, what non-terminals produce t91? Checking the productions, I see that NT7 \u2192 't70', NT9 \u2192 't91' (since in the grammar, there's NT9 -> 't75', but also a production like NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9 which becomes 't75'), wait no, I think it's better to list all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several NT... -> terminal:\n\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT1 -> 't25'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT5 -> 't37'\n- NT6 -> 't65'\n- NT7 -> 't60'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT9 -> 't91' wait no: looking back, in the grammar, some NT...-> terminals.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let's list the NT productions that directly produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, the productions that are terminals:\n\nNT8 -> 't52'\n\nNT2 -> 't33'\n\nNT6 -> 't65'\n\nNT3 -> 't30'\n\nNT7 -> 't60'\n\nNT9 -> 't91'\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nNT1 -> 't25'\n\nNT4 -> 't88'\n\nNT2 -> 't37'? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for NT2, I see several productions. One is NT2 -> 't37' (e.g., NT9 -> 't75', etc. Wait, actually, some terminals are listed as NT... -> terminal.\n\nFor example, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 -> 't52' (one line)\n\nNT2 -> 't33'\n\nNT6 -> 't65'\n\nNT3 -> 't30'\n\nNT7 -> 't60'\n\nNT9 -> 't91'\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nNT1 -> 't25'\n\nNT4 -> 't88'\n\nNT5 -> 't37'\n\nNT2 -> 't88'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all terminal directly produced by non-terminals.\n\nHere's a summary:\n\nNT0-> t13\n\nNT1-> t25\n\nNT2-> t33\n\nNT3-> t30\n\nNT4-> t88\n\nNT5-> t37\n\nNT6-> t65\n\nNT7-> t60\n\nNT8-> t52\n\nNT9-> t91\n\nAdditionally, there are some two-symbol terminal productions, like NT7 -> NT1 NT5, but that's a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in our string, the first token is t91, which must come from NT9, as NT9 -> t91.\n\nSo the first split would be S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the first two symbols must be t91 (from NT9) and something else from NT3.\n\nLooking at NT3, the productions are NT3 -> NT6 NT2, NT3 -> NT0 NT7, etc.\n\nSo if S produces NT3 NT9, then the first part is NT3. Let's see what NT3 can produce.\n\nFrom NT3's productions: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, NT0 NT7, etc.\n\nSo the first token in the string is t91, which is from NT9. So the second token must come from NT3.\n\nWhat's the second token in the string? It's t40.\n\nLooking at NT3's possible terminal outputs via its productions, maybe via a derivation chain.\n\nWait, NT3 can be split into, say, NT0 NT7. NT0 can produce t13, and NT7 can produce t60. So t13 and t60. But the next token is t40, which isn't in that path.\n\nAlternatively, another production of NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. NT6 could produce t65, and NT2 could produce t33. So t65 and t33, but the next token is t40, which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother production: NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, which would give t13 and t60. Still no t40.\n\nWait, another production of NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT8 NT4. NT8 produces t52, and NT4 produces t88. So that gives t52 and t88, but the next token is t40.\n\nAnother production: NT3 \u2192 NT4 NT8. NT4 \u2192 t88, NT8 \u2192 t52. t88 and t52? No.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps NT6 can produce some terminal. Let's check NT6's productions. NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, NT3 NT6, NT8 NT4, etc.\n\nLooking, NT6 has a direct production NT6 \u2192 't65', right? Because earlier I listed it as NT6->t65.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, yes, NT6-> 't65' is listed.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar:\n\nYes, in the productions, NT6 -> 't65' is present.\n\nSo if NT6 is a non-terminal, it can produce 't65' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 -> 't30' via some productions, but that's for NT3 as a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but if NT6 is a non-terminal, when can it produce a terminal? From NT6 \u2192 't65' is a production.\n\nSo, if in the string, after some tokens, 't65' appears, that's possible.\n\nBut in the string's first token is t91 (from NT9), then t40.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck.

{"custom_id":"request-704","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The goal is to figure out whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar. The grammar is quite extensive with multiple production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what CNF entails. CNF requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to fit that structure since all the rules have two non-terminals on the right-hand side (except the ones that directly connect to terminals like 'tX'). \n\nNext, I should consider how to approach determining if the string is generated by this grammar. One method is to construct a parse tree for the string based on the grammar's rules. Since the grammar is context-free, a recursive descent parser or a top-down approach could work. Alternatively, the Cocke-Younger-Even (CYK) algorithm could be used to check if the string is in the language.\n\nHowever, manually constructing a parse tree for such a long string might be error-prone. But since I have to do this manually, let's break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: `t88 t19 t8 t60 t60 t91 t14 t23 t33 t41 t10 t90 t23 t23 t60 t60 t99 t65 t65 t23 t37 t25 t41 t42 t70 t99 t25 t75 t42 t22 t25 t91 t99 t99 t23 t88`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of tokens, each presumably corresponding to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Each token may or may not have a corresponding production rule. The challenge is to see if each token can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first two symbols derived from S should be the result of NT3 and NT9. Let's check the string:\n\nThe first token is t88. Looking at the start symbol's production, we have S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first step is to see what NT3 and NT9 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 is defined as:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nAnd looking up NT6 and NT2:\n\nNT6 has multiple productions. One of them is NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6. Another is NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2. Also, NT6 \u2192 't8' (a terminal). Similarly, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 't33' (among others).\n\nBut wait, wait. Since we have S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the first token in the string must be the result of NT3. Let's see what NT3 produces.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nSo the first token t88 would have to come from NT3's expansion. Let's check if t88 is in any of the terminals that NT3 can produce.\n\nFrom NT6: One production is NT6 \u2192 't8'. So if NT6 produces 't8', which is different from t88.\n\nLooking for t88 in the grammar, I don't see any terminal symbol named t88. Wait, perhaps I missed that. Let me scan all the terminal productions in the grammar provided.\n\nLooking at all the rules where a non-terminal ends with a terminal symbol, like NT0 \u2192 't13', NT1 \u2192 't25', etc. I see that many non-terminals have terminal symbols as their productions. For example, NT8 \u2192 't52' and NT7 \u2192 't40', and so on.\n\nSo, in the grammar, each non-terminal can sometimes produce a terminal symbol directly. Therefore, for NT3 to produce t88, I need to check if t88 is a terminal rule for any production of NT3.\n\nLooking through the productions of NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, so it doesn't produce any terminal directly. Therefore, to produce t88, it would have to come from some other path. Wait, but from the provided rules, NT3's expansion goes through NT6 and NT2, which may themselves expand into terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me clarify.\n\nThe string starts with t88. So the first step is to see how t88 can be derived. Since t88 is a terminal, we need a production rule in the grammar where a non-terminal directly produces t88.\n\nLooking through the list of productions, I see that none of the non-terminals directly produce t88. The productions ending in terminals are like NT8 \u2192 t52, NT9 \u2192 t75, etc. But I don't see any that produce t88. Hmm, that's a problem because if t88 is not directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, then the string cannot be derived from the grammar, so the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me re-examine the grammar provided. Perhaps I missed a rule where a non-terminal produces t88.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I don't see any production where a non-terminal (like NT3, NT6, etc.) directly produces t88. All the terminal rules have specific tokens, but none seem to be t88.\n\nSo if the first token is t88, but there is no production that allows NT3 or any starting symbol to produce t88 directly or indirectly, then the string is invalid.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I missed a production. Let me go through each rule again carefully.\n\nLooking from the top, the start symbol is S, which splits into NT3 and NT9. So the first token must come from NT3, the second from NT9.\n\nThe first token is t88. So, for t88 to be produced by NT3, there's no direct production rule. Therefore, it's impossible. So the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there's a way for NT3 to produce t88 via other steps. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and each of those can produce more tokens.\n\nLet me try to see if NT6 can produce a terminal that could eventually lead to t88. Looking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6 (this seems like a recursive case)\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT6 \u2192 NT0 NT1\nNT6 \u2192 NT2 NT5\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT8 (another recursive)\n...\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\n\nAh, one of NT6's productions is 't8'. So if NT6 produces 't8', that's a terminal. Now, looking at the string, the first token is t88, but 't8' is a different terminal. Therefore, perhaps this suggests that NT6 cannot produce t88 because it can only produce t8 as a terminal.\n\nWait, unless there's another way. Let me see if any of the rules involve t88. For example, is there a non-terminal that when expanded can produce t88 via some combination?\n\nLooking again, I don't see any rules where a non-terminal is connected directly to t88. So, unless there's a production chain that ends with t88, it's not possible. But since no such production exists, the grammar can't produce t88 as the first symbol.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t88, but the grammar can't generate t88 as a terminal symbol, so the string is not part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me double-check. Looking through all the terminals in the grammar, the terminals are listed as 't13', 't25', 't30', 't37', etc. t88 is not among them. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because the first token is t88, which the grammar doesn't produce.\n\nSo, after this analysis, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given grammar. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which usually means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol. But looking at the rules, I see some exceptions where the right side has a constant terminal or maybe just a single non-terminal. Hmm, but maybe the specific form is still applicable.\n\nThe string to evaluate is quite long: `t14 t91 t14 t90 t22 t23 t33 t13 t34 t60 t10 t41 t91 t30 t99 t88 t40 t10 t8 t70 t65 t34 t65 t14 t52 t42 t33 t52 t13 t65 t88 t90 t90 t99 t70 t60`.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the grammar. The start symbol is S, which immediately expands into NT3 NT9. Then NT3 and NT9 must follow the production rules of their respective symbols.\n\nLooking at NT3: the rules for NT3 include things like NT6 NT2 and NT0 NT7. So NT3 leads to more non-terminals. Similarly, NT9 has rules ending in terminals, like 't91' and 't75'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first part is 't14 t91'. Since the start is S -> NT3 NT9, and the right-hand side must completely derive into the string, let's see how 't14' and 't91' could come from NT3 and NT9.\n\nNT9 in the grammar can produce 't75', 't65', 't91' among others. So, 't91' could be a direct production of NT9. That's promising.\n\nNow, looking at NT3: possible productions include NT9, so if NT3 can produce a string that starts with 't14', that would make sense. Looking back at NT3's rules, one of them is NT3 -> NT0 NT7. NT0 can produce 't13' or 't91' or 't70' or other things, but 't14' seems tricky because from NT0, the only direct terminal seems to be 't13', 't91', etc. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's list NT0's productions. Oh, NT0 can produce NT1 NT3 or NT2 NT2, NT4 NT0, etc. But no direct terminals except in some cases. Wait, in the later rules, I see NT0 -> 't13', so that's a direct terminal. Similarly, NT7 -> 't60' and others. So, for NT0, 't13' is a terminal, 't10' is from NT1, 't41' from NT4, etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT3's rules: NT3 can produce NT0 NT7. So, for NT0 NT7, NT0 can be 't13', and NT7 can be 't60', making 't13 t60'. But in the string, after the initial 't14 t91', the next part is 't14 t90'. Hmm, that suggests that the first part of the string might involve NT3 producing a string starting with 't14'.\n\nWait, let me think again: the start is NT3 and NT9. So NT3 must derive to a string that starts with 't14'. Let's see what options NT3 has. Looking at the grammar, NT3 can go to NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. So if NT3 is expanding to something starting with 't14', maybe the production NT3-> NT0 NT7 can give a 't14' as one of the terminals?\n\nWait, looking at NT0's productions, I don't see 't14' as a terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again. The rules for NT0: NT0 -> NT1 NT3, NT0 -> NT2 NT2, NT0 -> NT4 NT0, NT0 -> NT5 NT7, NT0 -> NT6 NT8, etc. But are there any rules that produce 't14' directly? Looking through, I don't see any. Wait, in the rules, I see NT7 produces 't40' and others, but not 't14'. Hmm, maybe NT3 can produce something that includes 't14'.\n\nWait, another approach: the string starts with 't14 t91 t14 t90', so maybe each 't14' comes from a specific production in NT3. Since NT3 is S's first rule, which is NT3 NT9, and the string starts with 't14 t91', perhaps NT3 produces 't14...' and NT9 produces 't91...'.\n\nLooking at NT3 again: it can produce NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. Let's see: if NT0 produces 't13', which is a terminal, and NT7 produces 't70', that would be 't13 t70', but that's not 't14'. Alternatively, maybe NT6 produces 't14'? Let me check NT6's productions.\n\nNT6 can produce NT8 NT4, NA but wait, no. Let me go through NT6's rules: looks like NT6 can produce NT8 NT4, NA but perhaps 't65' and others. Wait, in the grammar, NT6 has this rule: NT6 -> 't65' is there. Wait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking at NT6's rules:\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT2\n\nNT6 -> NT5 NT7\n\nNT0 -> NT5 NT7\n\nBTW, I think I may have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking specifically, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't65'\n\nSo yes, NT6 can directly produce 't65'. That's helpful.\n\nSo coming back, if NT3 produces NT6 NT2, the NT6 could be 't65', so the first element would be 't65' and the second from NT2. But in the string, it's 't14 t91', so that doesn't fit. Therefore, that production path is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, if NT3 uses NT0 NT7, then perhaps NT0 produces 't14' via some expansion, and NT7 produces 't91'. But looking at the rules, does NT0 ever produce 't14'? From the rules, I don't see any production for NT0 that gives 't14'. Wait, unless I'm missing a path.\n\nWait, perhaps NT7 can produce 't91'? Let's check NT7's productions. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT7: can it produce 't91'? Let me go through each production:\n\n- NT7->NT5 NT4\n\n- NT7->NT0 NT8\n\n- NT2->NT6 NT7\n\nWait, so NT7 doesn't have 't91' as a direct terminal. Hmm, then how does 't91' come into the string?\n\nWait, looking back, the second part is 't91 t14 t90'. So the string is: t14, t91, t14, t90, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe 't91' comes from NT9's production. Looking at NT9's rules, one of them is NT9 -> 't91', so NT9 can directly expand to 't91'.\n\nSo, in S -> NT3 NT9, if NT3 expands to some string containing 't14', and NT9 is 't91', that explains the first two tokens.\n\nWait, but looking deeper, the next tokens are 't14 t90 t22 t23 t33 t13 t34 t60 t10 t41 t91 t30 t99 t88 t40 t10 t8 t70 t65 t34 t65 t14 t52 t42 t33 t52 t13 t65 t88 t90 t90 t99 t70 t60'\n\nSo after 't91', we have 't14 t90'. So perhaps the structure is NT9 is 't91', and then NT3 must produce a string starting with 't14 t90'.\n\nHmm, but NT3's production paths can't seem to start with 't14' directly. Wait, unless I'm missing a rule where NT3 can directly produce 't14' through some intermediate steps. Let me check NT3 again.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules:\n\nNT3-> NT6 NT2\n\nNT3-> NT0 NT7\n\nWhat about NT6? NT6 can produce 't65', but maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, the 't14' could come from NT0, but how?\n\nWait, NT0 can produce 't13"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by listing all the productions. The start symbol is S, which immediately expands to NT3 NT9. So, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then, NT3 can expand in various ways, for example, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and so on.\n\nNow, the target string is a sequence of t... tokens like t22, t60, etc. I need to check if this string can be derived using the given productions.\n\nMaybe I should approach this by building a parse tree from the string upwards to see if it can be reduced to the start symbol S. Alternatively, I can use a top-down or bottom-up approach. Since the string is quite long, a bottom-up approach (like using a CYK-like algorithm) might be more manageable, but since I'm just thinking through it, maybe I'll try a top-down approach by tracing possible derivations.\n\nLet's break down the string:\n\nt22 t60 t12 t42 t12 t52 t75 t70 t52 t91 t42 t91 t22 t40 t65 t30 t42 t10 t13 t22 t25 t52 t75 t33 t90 t70 t52 t14 t22 t88 t13 t99 t40 t60 t60 t37 t70\n\nHmm, that's a lot of tokens. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe start symbol S produces NT3 and NT9. So, the first expansion must be NT3 followed by NT9. Let's check the string: the first token is t22. Let's see where t22 is generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see tokens like NT2 -> t25 (from NT0 -> NT2 NT2, NT2's rules have some terminal outputs, e.g., NT2 -> t33, t37, t22, t25, etc.). So, t22 could be generated by NT2.\n\nLooking at production rules for NT2 and others:\n\n- NT2 has several productions with terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 t22, NT2 \u2192 t25, NT2 \u2192 t23, etc. So, t22 is a direct production of NT2. Similarly, other tokens like t60, t70, etc., might be direct productions of certain NTs.\n\nWait, but to structure the derivation, the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first part of the string must be a derivation of NT3 followed by NT9.\n\nSo, looking at the first token t22. That could come from NT3. Let me see which productions are possible for NT3.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 has productions like:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT3 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- others may not directly produce t22, but let's check.\n\nBut wait, in the first step, S expands to NT3 and NT9, so the entire string must be a derivation of NT3 followed by NT9. Therefore, the entire string must be split into two parts: one part from NT3 and another from NT9.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is split into two parts. Let me check if t22 is in the first part (derived from NT3) and the rest of the string is from NT9.\n\nWait, the first token is t22. Let's see how t22 could be generated. Looking at the productions, I see NT2 \u2192 t22, but NT3 must expand into something that starts with t22 as the first token. So, perhaps NT3 is derived into a series of tokens starting with t22.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parsing is done by seeing the entire string as a combination of the two NT3 and NT9 parts.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to segment the string into subparts that correspond to the possible expansions of NT3 and NT9.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I should start by considering that the first term t22 could be the result of NT3 expanding. Let me see how.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nNT3 can expand into NT6 and NT2. Let's see what NT6 can do. From the grammar, NT6 has productions like:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n\nWait, let's look for t22. From NT6, we have NT6 \u2192 t37? I don't see a direct production for NT6 to t22. Hmm, perhaps NT6 isn't the right path here.\n\nWait, let me check the NT2 rules. Looking back, NT2 has productions like:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t22, t25, t23, t27, etc. So, NT2 can directly produce t22. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 t22 is another possibility, but I don't see that in the rules. Wait, actually, in the rules for NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2, so t22 is a possible production from NT2 as per NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this too much. Let's think step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be divided into two parts: the first part from NT3 and the second from NT9.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt22 t60 t12 t42 t12 t52 t75 t70 t52 t91 t42 t91 t22 t40 t65 t30 t42 t10 t13 t22 t25 t52 t75 t33 t90 t70 t52 t14 t22 t88 t13 t99 t40 t60 t60 t37 t70\n\nWait, that's 38 tokens. So, if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, each side must generate 19 tokens each. But t22 is the first token, so perhaps that's from NT3's side.\n\nBut NT3's productions are:\n\n1. NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n2. NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n3. NT3 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n4. (other possible rules not directly relevant)\n\nSo, let's try to see how NT3 can produce tokens.\n\nLooking at one possible way: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nThen, NT6 can produce t90 via NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5 and NT4 \u2192 t88... Wait, perhaps that's getting too deep.\n\nAlternatively, another production of NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT8 NT4. Let's see.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n\nNT8 can expand into t52 (from NT8 \u2192 t52) as per the grammar. So, if the first token is t22, perhaps NT8 can't produce t22. Wait, no, looking at NT8's rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t52 (if I recall correctly). So, the first token t22 can't come from NT8 \u2192 t52. So that path is impossible for the first token being t22.\n\nAnother production for NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. Let's see.\n\nNT0 can produce t13 (from NT0 \u2192 t13). But t22 is first, so that path seems unlikely.\n\nAnother production: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Then, NT6 can produce t37, but that's just one of its possible expansions. Wait, but NT6 has rules like NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, but also NT6 \u2192 t37? Looking back, I think the grammar list is quite comprehensive, so I should confirm each production step.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar again, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t37? No, wait: looking at the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5 (twice) and some other rules, but no direct t37. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, I think I might have missed it. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, under NT6, there are:\n\nNT6 -> NT4 NT5\nNT6 -> NT8 NT4\nNT6 -> NT0 NT7\nNT6 -> NT9 NT2\n\nWait, perhaps from NT6, the possible terminals are:\n\nI don't see a direct production for NT6 \u2192 t37. So, perhaps the only way NT3 can produce t22 is if NT6 \u2192 t22 in some way, but from the rules, NT6's productions are all combinations of non-terminals except for perhaps another place.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-726","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite complex, with many production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of tokens like 't22', 't19', etc.\n\nFirst off, I remember that CNF grammars have production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. All right, so the given grammar adheres to that structure because every production rule starts with a single non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. So that's good.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if the provided string can be generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals, each presumably representing a production step. Each 't' followed by a number is probably a terminal symbol in the grammar. So the string is a series of these terminals, which I need to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar's production rules.\n\nLooking at the string: `t22 t19 t90 t33 t91 t14 t37 t30 t90 t22 t22 t91 t22 t10 t65 t34 t52 t37 t23 t30 t90 t30 t14 t33 t40 t99 t14 t90 t13 t19 t99 t75 t65 t10 t8 t42 t70`.\n\nI think the first step is to see if this string can be broken down according to the production rules of the grammar. Since the grammar is CNF, it's easier to think in terms of bottom-up parsing or using the recursive descent method.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if all the terminals in the string can be matched by the terminals in the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, so I need to see if all these strings exist in the right-hand side of any production rule.\n\nBut wait, the grammar doesn't seem to have all these terminals. Let me check. The grammar's right-hand sides include rules like S -> NT3 NT9, and other rules that have combinations of non-terminals and terminals. For example, some production rules produce one of the 't' tokens, like NT1 -> 't40'. So if the string contains a 't40', that's fine because NT1 can produce it.\n\nBut for other terminals like 't22', 't19', etc., I need to see if there are production rules that produce them. Let's go through some of the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- NT2 -> 't33' (so 't33' is possible)\n- NT6 -> 't8' (so 't8' is possible)\n- NT3 -> 't30' (so 't30' is possible)\n- NT8 -> 't52' (so 't52' is possible)\n- NT9 -> 't75' (so 't75' is possible)\n- NT0 -> 't13' (so 't13' is possible)\n- NT7 -> 't40' (so 't40' is possible)\n- NT1 -> 't40' (so 't40' is possible)\n- NT4 -> 't88' (so 't88' is possible)\n- NT5 -> 't37' (so 't37' is possible)\n- NT2 -> 't37' (so 't37' is possible)\n- NT9 -> 't60' (so 't60' is possible)\n- NT7 -> 't70' (so 't70' is possible)\n- NT8 -> 't41' (so 't41' is possible)\n- NT4 -> 't42' (so 't42' is possible)\n- NT9 -> 't22' (so 't22' is possible)\n- NT9 -> 't14' (so 't14' is possible)\n- NT9 -> 't12' (so 't12' is possible)\n- And so on.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice terms like 't22', 't19', 't91', 't33', etc.\n\nWait, does the grammar have 't19'? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT2 -> 't33', but I don't immediately see a production that produces 't19' or 't91'. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT5 -> 't37'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT7 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't42'\n- NT9 -> 't22'\n- NT9 -> 't14'\n- NT9 -> 't12'\n- NT4 -> 't99'\n- NT8 -> 't23'\n- NT5 -> 't37'\n\nSo, where's 't19'? I don't see a production rule that directly produces 't19'. Similarly, 't91' is not present.\n\nWait, maybe 't19' comes from a combination of non-terminals that can produce 't19'. But I can't see any. Let me think: NT19 isn't a non-terminal in the grammar, so perhaps it's derived via multiple steps. Alternatively, maybe the string is trying to use a terminal that the grammar doesn't produce.\n\nIf the string has a terminal that's not a production in the grammar, then it cannot be generated. So let's check each terminal:\n\n1. t22: Yes, NT9 -> 't22' exists.\n2. t19: Not in the grammar's terminals.\n3. t90: Not in the grammar's terminals. Let me check: NT10? No, looking at the rules, I don't see a production for 't90'.\n4. t33: Yes, NT2 -> 't33'.\n5. t91: The grammar includes several NT rules, but I don't see 't91' as a terminal. Oh, wait, looking again, I see NT9 -> 't60', but 't91' may come from elsewhere? Or maybe it's not present.\n\nWait, double-checking: The production rules include NT1 -> 't40', NT4 -> 't88', NT7 -> 't40', etc., but nothing seems to produce 't91' directly.\n\nSo, the string has 't19', 't90', 't91', and 't60' which may not be present in the grammar as terminals. Since the grammar's terminals are specified in the right-hand sides of some non-terminals, any token in the string that isn't among those can't be generated.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains terminal symbols that are not in the grammar's production rules.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: Are there any non-terminals that could potentially produce these tokens through other means? Like, for example, if a non-terminal can derive into a terminal that isn't directly present.\n\nBut in the given grammar, every production rule either goes to two non-terminals or to a terminal. The terminals are only the ones specified as values in the production rules. So, for example, NT8 -> 't52' corresponds to that terminal. So any terminal not in that list can't be produced.\n\nSince the string includes 't90', 't19', 't91', etc., which are not present in the grammar's terminals, the string cannot be generated by it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is No because the string includes terminal symbols not present in the grammar's right-hand sides.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-741","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t10 t30 t41 t40 t23 t70 t25 t60 t60 t25 t34 t52 t13 t30 t25 t22 t88 t10 t22 t91 t37 t41 t41 t25 t65 t88 t14 t52 t90 t91 t34 t75 t65 t25 t14 t41 t23 t23`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form looks like. CNF typically requires each production rule to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol shouldn't appear on the right side of any production (unless it's the single symbol, which is allowed in some definitions). \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, each production starts from S or NT, and each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which fits the CNF structure since both NT3 and NT9 are non-terminals. Similarly, some of the production rules have terminals as right-hand sides, like NT9 \u2192 't40' and NT0 \u2192 't13'. \n\nSo the grammar seems to be in CNF. Now, I need to check whether the given string can be derived from this grammar.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals, all of which are two-digit numbers, such as t10, t30, etc. Each of these must correspond to the terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nThe approach I should take is probably using a parsing algorithm, like the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing strings according to a CFG in CNF. But since the string is quite long, applying the CYK algorithm manually would be time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to see if the string can be broken down step by step using the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to model the parse as a tree, starting from the start symbol S and trying to expand it to reach the given string. Since every production rule in CNF has two symbols on the right-hand side, the parse tree will have a binary structure.\n\nLet me outline the steps I think I should take:\n\n1. **Understand the grammar structure**: Identify non-terminals and terminals. All rules where the right-hand side is a terminal (like NT9 \u2192 't40') are terminal productions. Others are non-terminals.\n\n2. **Check for the start symbol**: The start symbol is S, which expands into NT3 and NT9, as per the first rule S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\n3. **Identify all the terminals in the string**: Every token in the string is a terminal symbol 't' followed by two digits. I need to check if each of these exists as a terminal in the grammar. If any terminal in the string is not present in the grammar's terminal symbols, the string can't be derived, and the answer is No.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are: t10, t30, t41, t40, t23, t70, t25, t60, t52, t13, t88, t91, t34, t75, t65, t22, t14. Wait, looking again, the terminals seem to be:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't40'\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't34'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't25'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't8' \u2192 Wait, is t8 a terminal here? Or is that a typo? Because in the string, the terminals are all two-digit numbers ending with 0, like t10, t30, etc. So 't8' would be a single character, but in the string, it's part of 't10', etc., so 't8' isn't present. Wait, the string provided uses 't10', which would be 't' followed by 1 and 0, so the string uses two digits after 't'.\n\nNow looking at the grammar's terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\n\nND5 \u2192 't91'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't8' \u2192 Hmm, that's a terminal with only one digit, which conflicts with the string's structure.\n\nWait a minute, this could be a problem. The string consists of 't' followed by two digits, like 't10', which is three characters. But in the grammar, 't8' is a terminal, which would be two characters ('t' and '8'), but the string has three characters for each terminal? No, wait, in the string, each terminal is written as 't10', which is three letters: t, 1, 0. So each terminal is three in length. But in the grammar, the terminals are 't40' (three letters), 't13' (three letters), 't34' (three), 't25' (three), 't91' (three), 't8' (two letters), which is a problem because in the string, each terminal is three letters. So that would mean the grammar has a terminal 't8', which is only two letters, but the string only has three-letter terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, I don't see 't8' as a terminal; the string's first few are t10, t30, etc. So, the grammar's terminals are: 't10', 't30', 't41', 't40', 't23', 't70', 't25', 't60', 't60', etc. Also, 't52', 't13', 't34', 't75', 't65', 't22', 't88', 't14'. \n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to list all the terminals in the grammar from the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't91'\n\nND6 \u2192 't8' \u2192 Wait, perhaps it's a typo. Maybe 't8' is a two-character terminal, but in the string, all terminals are three characters like 't10', 't30', etc. So this discrepancy is something to note.\n\nBut in the given grammar, there is a production NT6 \u2192 't8', which is a two-character terminal, but in the string, every token is three characters, which is 't' followed by two digits. So that would mean that the grammar contains a terminal with two characters but the parser we are using requires that each terminal is three. Therefore, this could cause an issue, but actually, in the string, each terminal is exactly three characters, so the grammar's NT6 \u2192 't8' would not match 't10' because 't8' is two characters. Hmm, maybe that's a problem.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps the N terminals in the grammar have multiple terminals. For example, in the start rule:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8\n\nAnd each right-hand side either is a terminal or another non-terminal. But in the string, when we see t10, t30, etc., each is a single three-character string. So perhaps in the grammar, there are multiple productions that result in those strings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of each symbol in the string as a single terminal and match it against the grammar's terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the terminals are defined as, for example:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't40'\n\nBut in the string, we have 't10', which is 't' followed by '1' and '0', making it 't10' as a single token. The issue is whether 't10' is present as a terminal in the grammar. Looking at the grammar provided, I don't see a production that directly produces 't10'. I see productions for 't30' (from NT0 \u2192 't30'), 't40' (NT9 and NT7), 't13' (NT0), 't8' (probably a typo), etc. So 't10' is not directly a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the grammar rules. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.

{"custom_id":"request-745","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t23 t37 t8 t12 t75 t8 t52 t25 t60 t65 t8 t52 t25 t75 t34 t8 t91 t99 t22 t30 t23 t34 t40 t91 t12 t42 t52 t23 t41 t22 t14 t19 t34 t65 t91 t60 t90 t91`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form for context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps in parsing because each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven the grammar, I see that it's in CNF because all rules are for a single non-terminal producing either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol, which are all the 't's at the end of the production rules.\n\nNext, I need to check if the provided string can be generated by the grammar. The string consists of a series of terminal symbols: t25, t8, t23, etc. My first thought is to see if each of these terminal symbols is present in the grammar, but I notice that the grammar only uses certain terminals: t25, t34, t52, t60, t65, t75, t8, t91, t99, etc. So the string uses a mix of t23 and others that aren't present in the grammar. \n\nWait, let's check the grammar rules. Looking through the production rules, I see that some terminals are on the right-hand side. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, and NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT9, etc. But do any of the terminals from the string (like t23 or t37) appear in the grammar? I go through the list again. No, I don't see any production rules that produce t23 or t37. It seems like all the terminals in the grammar are specific to certain non-terminals, like NT0, NT1, NT2, etc., converting into these t terms, but not every t term is covered.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the t terms in the string are all covered. Let me look at each t term in the string and see if it appears anywhere in the grammar's RHS. Starting with t23: looking through the rules, I see NT2 \u2192 several rules, and some of them produce t37, t25, t52, etc. But no rule produces t23. Similarly, t37 was in a rule (NT8 \u2192 t37). Wait, looking back at the rules: NT8 has rules like NT8 \u2192 t37, yes. So 't37' is in the grammar. \n\nWait, but let me check each t in the string. \n\n- t23: Checking if 't23' is in any production. Looking at nt2 rules:\nNT2 has multiple productions; none produce t23 directly. From the provided rules, NT2 produces t33, t37, t12, t52, t25, etc. So t23 is not directly produced by any NT2 rule. So t23 isn't present in grammar's RHS terminals. That might be a problem because the string contains t23, which can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. Are there any NT2 rules that produce t23? Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I don't see any rule that ends with t23. The rule for NT2 includes t37, t25, t33, t52, t23 was somewhere else?\n\nWait, the user provided a list of rules, perhaps I overlooked t23. Let me cross-reference:\n\nLooking for 't23' in the right-hand sides of the rules. From the given rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t34\n- NT8 \u2192 t37, t8, etc.\nWait, I don't see 't23' in any RHS in the rules. So the NT2 can't produce t23. Therefore, t23 would require NT2 to somehow generate it, but from the rules, that's not possible.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the string, the first word is t23. Since t23 isn't a terminal in any production, the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe t23 is a derived terminal? No, in CNF, terminals can't be derived further. So if the string contains a terminal that's not an explicit terminal in any production, the string isn't in the language.\n\nTherefore, since the string contains t23, which isn't present in any production, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding what I have.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies the analysis.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t8 t60 t42 t40 t37 t52 t52 t8 t25 t90 t22 t65 t13 t52 t65 t99 t75 t25 t12 t88 t99 t75 t99 t75 t41 t75 t25 t34 t52 t23 t88 t90 t70 t34 t70 t22 t70 t23.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, a lot of the non-terminals are transformed into other non-terminals and some terminals, like t30, t8, t60, etc. So, I need to see how the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the production rules for S, there are two options: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So, the derivation will start with S, which splits into two non-terminals. Let's see what these non-terminals can produce.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9. From the grammar, NT3 can produce NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. Similarly, NT9 can go to NT1 NT5 or NT6 NT1. I think this might get complicated since each non-terminal can have multiple options.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So, NT3 and NT2. Let me check how NT3 and NT2 can produce.\n\nNT3 can be NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. Let's say it becomes NT6 NT2. Now, NT6 can go to NT4 NT5, NT9 NT2, NT8 NT4, etc. Hmm, not sure. Another path is NT0 NT7. NT0 can go to NT2 NT2, NT1 NT3, etc.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for the terminals in the string and see if they match any production rules.\n\nThe string starts with t8. In the grammar, t8 is directly a terminal, with a production like NT6 \u2192 t8. So, to get t8, the non-terminal must be NT6 producing t8.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll break it down step by step, trying to match each token from the grammar.\n\nFirst token: t8. So, NT6 can produce t8, so perhaps we start with NT6 t8. Then the next token is t60.\n\nBut wait, the overall structure is S starts with NT3 and NT9 or NT3 and NT2. So, perhaps the first part should be deriving t8 from NT6, which would have to come from NT3 or NT0, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into parts that match certain production rules. Let me see if I can find a way to derive the entire string.\n\nWait, the string has t8 at the start, which is t8. Since t8 is a terminal, it's produced only directly by NT6 \u2192 t8. So, perhaps the first part of the derivation is NT6 \u2192 t8.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t8, which must come from NT6. Then, the next token is t60. So, after t8, we need another non-terminal that can produce t60.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t60? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT1 \u2192 t40, NT2 \u2192 t37, etc. Wait, t60 is a terminal as well, is it a production directly?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several rules where terminals are written with arrows, like NT3 \u2192 t30, NT8 \u2192 t37, etc. So, t60 is a terminal in the grammar. So, one of the non-terminals must have a production to t60.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT0 \u2192 t13, NT2 \u2192 t33, etc. Wait, where is t60? Let me scan the rules.\n\nAh, here: NT1 \u2192 t40, NT7 \u2192 t40, NT5 \u2192 t91, etc. Wait, do any of the non-terminals produce t60? Looking again, I don't see any. That can't be right because the string includes t60. Did I miss it?\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list. Let me check again. Scanning through the production rules, I don't see any that produce t60 directly. Oh, maybe t60 is part of a longer production? Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, in the rules, for example, NT6 \u2192 t65 or NT3 \u2192 t30. Hmm, I don't see any NT producing t60. So, perhaps the string cannot be derived because t60 isn't present in the grammar as a terminal. But that can't be right because the user said the grammar may define the string or not. So maybe I missed a rule that produces t60.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is written with a different capitalization? Let me check the rules again. Hmm, looking through all the rules, I don't see any with 't60'. So that's a problem. If the string has 't60', but the grammar doesn't have that as a terminal, then it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait a minute, did I make a mistake in reading the rules? Let me check again.

Hmm, I see NT0 \u2192 t13, NT3 \u2192 t30, NT5 \u2192 t91. No, I don't see any rule that produces t60.

So, perhaps the string is an example with a mistake, or perhaps t60 is a non-terminal that can produce other things. But no, in the grammar, t60 isn't a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-764","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with one non-terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, I know that the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. The task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol S is always expanding into two NT symbols, like NT3 NT9, or NT3 NT2. Each of these NT productions eventually breaks down into terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from left to right using the grammar's rules. But since I'm just thinking through it, I'll outline a possible way to do this.\n\nLet me start by listing all the NT productions and see which ones can lead to the given string. For example, NT0 can go to NT1 NT3, which further breaks down into 't40' or something else. Similarly, NT6 can produce 't34' or other NT symbols.\n\nI notice that the string has tokens like 't60', 't19', 't19', 't22', etc. I'll try to match these tokens with the possible NT productions.\n\nStarting with the first token 't60'. Looking at the NT productions, NT5 can go to 't37', but I don't see NT5 leading to 't60'. Maybe NT9 can produce 't60' via some chain. Wait, in the grammar, NT9 can go to NT3 NT7 or NT6 NT1. NT6 can generate 't65', so let's see:\n\nIf NT9 -> NT6 NT1, then NT6 -> 't65', and NT1 -> 't40', so that would produce 't65 t40', which doesn't match 't60'. Hmm, maybe another path.\n\nLooking back, NT0 can produce 't13' or 't19' or 't22'. Oh, wait, NT0 has several productions. For example, NT0 -> NT2 NT2, which could lead to a sequence involving 't19' or 't22' if NT2 can produce those.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t60, so maybe it's produced by NT9 -> NT3 NT7. Then NT3 could produce 't30' or something else. Wait, NT3 can go to NT6 NT2. If NT6 is 't34' and NT2 is 't19', that would give 't34 t19', but the first part of the string is 't60'... Maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts from S -> NT3 NT9. If NT3 can produce something and NT9 something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if all tokens can be derived step by step. Let's take the first token 't60' and see which NT can produce it.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see that some NTs can directly go to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT6 -> 't65'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't70' etc.\n\nBut I need to find an NT that can produce 't60'. Looking at the list, the grammar directly maps NT9 -> 't60'? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT9 can go to NT3 NT7 or other things. Does any NT directly go to 't60'? From the list above, I don't see any NT directly mapping to 't60'. So perhaps 't60' is produced through a chain of NT productions.\n\nWait, let me check the NT rules again. Oh, I see NT0 -> 't65' and NT7 -> 't70', but 't60' is not directly produced by any NT. Maybe it's a result of combining NT0 and NT6 or something else.\n\nWait, maybe 't60' is produced by NT3. Looking at NT3: NT3 -> NT6 NT2. If NT6 can produce 't34' and NT2 can produce 't22', that would give 't34 t22', which is not 't60'. Alternatively, if NT6 -> 't8' and NT2 -> 'something', but that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe 't60' is produced by NT9 -> NT6 NT1. NT6 could be 't34' and NT1 -> 't19', making 't34 t19'... Not matching 't60'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't60' is elsewhere. Maybe NT5 -> 't60'? But looking, NT5 can go to 't37' or 't91'. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't60' comes from a longer chain. Wait, maybe NT6 can go to NT9, which can go to 't60'? Let me see: NT6 can produce 't34' or 't8' or 't42' via different paths. If NT6 -> NT9 NT2, and then NT9 can produce 't60', but I thought NT9's direct production doesn't go to 't60'. So maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the first 't60' is produced by S -> NT9 NT3, and NT9 is 't60' somehow. Or maybe S isn't the starting point. Wait, no, the start symbol is S, and S produces two NTs. So if S-> NT3 NT9, then NT3 and NT9 need to derive the first and second tokens, respectively.\n\nSo the first token is 't60'. Let's hypothesize that NT3 starts with 't60'. But NT3 can go to NT6 NT2. So 't60' would be the result of NT6 and NT2 producing something. Wait, that doesn't make sense unless NT6's production leads to 't60' via another step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT9 produces 't60' indirectly. Let me see if any NTs can produce 't60' through a chain. From the rules, NT9 -> NT1 NT19. Wait, but NT1 can produce 't40' or 't19' or 't12'. Hmm.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for tokens that can only be produced by specific NTs.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't60'. Let's see if any NTs can directly produce 't60'. From the rules, no NT directly goes to 't60'. So it must be produced through a chain of NTs.\n\nPerhaps starting from S, which is NS -> NT3 and NT9. Suppose the first symbol is NT3 producing something leading to 't60' and then NT9 producing the next symbols. Let's see.\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2. So 't60' could be the combination of NT6 and NT2. Now, NT6 can produce several things: 't65', 't34', 't8', etc. If NT6 produces 't34', then NT2 must produce 't26' to get 't34 t26' but that's not 't60'.\n\nAlternatively, if NT6 produces 't65', then NT2 must produce something else. Wait, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree for the entire string and see if it can be split into the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me try segmenting the string:\n\nt60 t19 t19 t22 t14 t33 t22 t91 t40 t90 t37 t70 t90 t8 t99 t60 t88 t30 t65 t70 t22 t10 t91 t10 t91 t34 t42 t52 t14 t8 t10 t60 t30 t88 t75 t25 t34 t22 t91.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for patterns in the string. Let's see:\n\n- The string has 't60' twice. So perhaps two different NTs produce 't60'.\n- There's a part with 't90 t8 t99 t60 t88', which perhaps comes from NT9 -> 't90', 't8', 't99', 't60', 't88'.\n\nWait, looking at NT0: NT0 can go to 't13' or 't65' or 't22' or 't91' etc. Hmm.\n\nI'm starting to feel stuck. Maybe a better approach is to try to see if the entire string can be split into the rules step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use induction or look for reductions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string represents a series of applications of the grammar's rules. Each NT step could produce two tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-780","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm presented with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a lot of non-terminals, and the string to evaluate is quite long, containing several tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the grammar seems to have multiple non-terminals that eventually derive to terminal symbols. \n\nThe provided string is: `t65 t23 t42 t12 t13 t25 t88 t23 t33 t33 t10 t75 t10 t33 t70 t34 t34 t19 t10 t12 t52 t52 t70 t22 t12 t65 t65 t33 t41 t99 t13 t65 t42 t75 t65 t60 t13 t90 t60 t14`. \n\nMy task is to parse this string and check if it can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser might be suitable, or possibly a CYK algorithm if I can map the terminals to the grammar's structure.\n\nBut before jumping into parsing, I notice that each terminal in the string corresponds to a production rule ending with '\u2192 a'. For example, 't65' is produced by NT0, 't23' by NT8, and so on. This suggests that every token in the string is a result of a single production step, meaning the entire string should be a single derivation tree.\n\nTo validate this, I should map the order of terminals to see if they can form a valid parse tree. Given the grammar's complexity, it might be easier to approach this by looking for the start symbol S and see how it can generate the string. However, the start symbol S generates NT3 and NT9, each of which might further split into other non-terminals. Ultimately, each non-terminal must derive into a terminal sequence that matches the string.\n\nI can try to break down the string into smaller parts and see how they might be derived from the grammar. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't65 t23 t42 t12'. According to the grammar, 't65' can be produced by NT3 when it has certain other non-terminals that produce 't23' and 't33' (from S \u2192 NT3 NT2 becomes t65 t23 t33). Then, each of these non-terminals might produce other parts of the string.\n\nHowever, manually checking each production step would be time-consuming. Instead, maybe I can observe that each production of S splits into two non-terminals, each of which then produce more tokens. The string must be structured such that each non-terminal's derivation corresponds to a segment of the string.\n\nGiven the length of the string, I can assume that each part of the string comes from a complete derivation of one non-terminal. For example, the first token 't65' is part of S's initial split, so it might be part of a larger segment generated by NT3 and NT2.\n\nI can try to group the tokens into possible derivations. For example:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT2 \u2192 (derivations leading to 't65') 't23' 't33' or 't23' 't70' etc., depending on NT2's productions.\n\nWait, looking at S \u2192 NT3 NT2, and the first token is 't65', which is from NT3. NT3 produces 't65' only if it's via a production like NT3 \u2192 't30' or maybe something else. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Looking back, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 is one of the productions, which then could produce tokens. But wait, in the grammar, NT3 also has a production NT3 \u2192 't65'? Or is that NT6? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So, the only way for 't65' to appear under NT3 is if it's a terminal that NT6 or NT2 produces. Wait, in the grammar, NT6 has several productions, one of which is NT6 \u2192 't8' (I think). No, looking again: \n\nLooking at NT6 productions: NT6 can produce 't8' as a terminal? Wait, no, the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, looking into the grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce 't65', 't23', etc.?\n\nYes, for example, NT9 \u2192 't75', and other terminals are defined as such. So, 't65' can be produced by NT6, because looking at the productions, I see NT6 \u2192 't65' according to one rule.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules more carefully. For NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6 | NT4 NT5 | NT0 NT1 | NT5 NT7 | NT2 NT7 | NT9 NT2 | NT4 NT8 | NT9 NT8 | NT1 NT2 | NT2 NT1 | NT3 NT1 | NT1 NT8 | NT3 NT5 | ... Wait, looking for NT6 productions that end with a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, all productions are in the form of A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, I don't see any NT6 \u2192 a, which would mean 't65' is produced by NT6. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking through all the productions, for example, NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, etc. Wait, no 't65' is not a production of NT6 because none of the right-hand sides are a single terminal. However, looking at NT2 \u2192 't25' (because in the grammar, NT2 \u2192 't25' I think?), perhaps. Wait, no, in the grammar, some of the productions are like NT2 \u2192 't33'? For example, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't33' is one of the productions. So if NT2 can directly produce 't33', then the terminal 't33' is generated by NT2.\n\nBut in the initial string, the first group is 't65 t23 t42 t12 ...'. So, to have 't65' as the first symbol, it's likely that the grammar derivation starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT2, and then NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, producing 't65' as the first symbol.\n\nBut wait, in NT3's definition, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So, to get 't65', NT6 must produce 't65' as a terminal, which would require NT6 to have a production of NT6 \u2192 't65'. Looking at the given grammar, do any rules for NT6 produce 't65' as a terminal?\n\nLooking back, I see: NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, etc. Wait, I don't see a direct production of 't65' from NT6. So, perhaps 't65' is produced by NT3 via NT6 and then NT3 must produce 't65' through NT3's own rules. This seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial token 't65' comes from NT0, as per the production NT0 \u2192 't65'. Let me check the grammar: looking through all the NT0 productions, yes, in the grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 't13', NT0 \u2192 't65', and others. So, NT0 can produce 't65' as a terminal. So, the first token could be from NT0 \u2192 't65'.\n\nThen, the next tokens are 't23', 't42', etc. Wait, after 't65' comes 't23', which would come from another production. Let me think.\n\nThe start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So, if S starts the derivation, first NT3 and NT2 are pushed to the stack. Then NT3 needs to derive a sequence, and NT2 another.\n\nIf the string starts with 't65', that would correspond to NT3 \u2192 't65' via some production. So, if NT3 can produce 't65', that would make sense.

{"custom_id":"request-783","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, context-free grammars (CFGs) consist of a set of production rules. The grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and analysis, but also limits the types of strings we can generate.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that it's quite extensive. Each non-terminal (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) has multiple production rules that combine other non-terminals or terminals. My goal is to parse the string and see if it can be built using these rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t14 t90 t42 t13 t8 t22 t30 t40 t34 t33 t23 t41 t65 t99 t19 t12 t52 t65 t70 t60 t19 t30 t22 t8 t88 t60 t40 t25 t90 t12 t65 t42 t8 t25 t10 t13 t60 t88 t88 t91`.\n\nI'll break this down step by step. Each token in the string is either a terminal or part of a production. My approach will be to see if I can group the tokens into non-terminals that match the grammar's rules.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't14'. Looking through the grammar, I check where 't14' appears. In the production rules for NT9, I see NT9 -> t14. So 't14' can be produced by NT9, which is useful.\n\nNext, the second token is 't90'. Checking NT9 \u2192 t90, so 't90' is also produced directly by NT9. So far, both 't14' and 't90' come from NT9.\n\nMoving on, the third token is 't42'. NT9 \u2192 t42 is a production rule, so that fits as well.\n\nThe fourth token is 't13'. NT0 \u2192 t13 is a production rule, so that's a match.\n\nFifth token: 't8'. Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see 't8' as a direct production. I need to see if it can be derived from a non-terminal. Scanning the non-terminals, I notice NT8 has a rule that can expand to 't8' under some conditions. Let's check NT8's rules. One of them is NT8 \u2192 t8, directly producing 't8'. So 't8' is a terminal that can appear directly.\n\nNext, 't22'. Checking the grammar, I see NT2 \u2192 t22 is a production rule, so 't22' can be derived from NT2.\n\nContinuing with 't30', NT3 \u2192 t30 is a production rule, so that fits NT3.\n\nThen 't40'. NT8 \u2192 t40 is a production rule, so that matches.\n\n'T33' next: Wait, the string has 't33' after 't40'. Let's check if 't33' can be produced. Going through the grammar, looking for any production that leads to 't33'. Hmm, looking at NT3's rules: I notice NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, which further breaks down. Let's see: NT0 can produce 't13' directly, and NT7 has a production NT7 \u2192 t40. So NT3 can produce 't0' and 't40' as part of it, but wait, that would give us 't13 t40', not 't33'. Maybe there's another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't33' is part of another non-terminal's expansion. Let me check the rules of NT2: NT2 \u2192 t33 is a rule, so 't33' can be directly produced by NT2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 't33' is the token, but in the grammar, NT2 has a production rule NT2 \u2192 t33. Wait, no, looking back: I think I might be misremembering. Let me check the grammar again. The rule for NT2 is: NT2 -> t33, yes, so 't33' can be produced directly by NT2.\n\nWait, but in the current position, after 't40', I have 't33'. So I think I'm miscounting the tokens. Let me list the entire string again to ensure I'm not making a mistake:\n\nString: t14 t90 t42 t13 t8 t22 t30 t40 t34 t33 t23 t41 t65 t99 t19 t12 t52 t65 t70 t60 t19 t30 t22 t8 t88 t60 t40 t25 t90 t12 t65 t42 t8 t25 t10 t13 t60 t88 t88 t91.\n\nWait, let's count the tokens to make it easier:\n\n1: t14\n\n2: t90\n\n3: t42\n\n4: t13\n\n5: t8\n\n6: t22\n\n7: t30\n\n8: t40\n\n9: t34\n\n10: t33\n\n11: t23\n\n12: t41\n\n13: t65\n\n14: t99\n\n15: t19\n\n16: t12\n\n17: t52\n\n18: t65\n\n19: t70\n\n20: t60\n\n21: t19\n\n22: t30\n\n23: t22\n\n24: t8\n\n25: t88\n\n26: t60\n\n27: t40\n\n28: t25\n\n29: t90\n\n30: t12\n\n31: t65\n\n32: t42\n\n33: t8\n\n34: t25\n\n35: t10\n\n36: t13\n\n37: t60\n\n38: t88\n\n39: t88\n\n40: t91.\n\nOk, I'm now confident in the list. So token 9 is t34, 10 is t33, 11 is t23, etc.\n\nLet me see how these tokens fit together. Starting from the beginning.\n\nFirst four tokens: t14, t90, t42, t13.\n\nThese all are directly produced by NT9, NT9, NT9, NT0. So perhaps the first part of the parse tree is NT9 \u2192 t14, but wait no, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and NT3 can produce t13, t8, etc. But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nLet me start by trying to parse the string.\n\nFirst, the entire string starts with t14, t90, t42, t13. These are all terminals. So perhaps the initial part is a combination of NT9s or other non-terminals. Wait, but the grammar is a bit complex, with multiple non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLet me try to find the structure by working from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the start symbol S expands into NT3 and NT9. So the parse tree will have S as the root, with NT3 as the left child and NT9 as the right child.\n\nSo the string must be a combination of the expansions of NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the string: after S's two productions, NT3 and NT9, the combined expansion must produce the entire string.\n\nSo for the string to be generated, the first part (from NT3) is a string that must be matched by NT3's expansion, and the second part (from NT9) is a string matched by NT9's expansion.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts: the part generated by NT3 and the part generated by NT9.\n\nLet me see if I can find a split point. Looking at the string:\n\nt14 t90 t42 t13 t8 t22 t30 t40 t34 t33 t23 t41 t65 t99 t19 t12 t52 t65 t70 t60 t19 t30 t22 t8 t88 t60 t40 t25 t90 t12 t65 t42 t8 t25 t10 t13 t60 t88 t88 t91\n\nWait, that's 40 tokens. But S expands into two parts, so perhaps the entire string is the concatenation of two parts"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-798","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to check is \"t33 t70 t90 t60 t12 t13 t75 t41 t10 t37 t42 t14 t8 t33 t19 t65 t90 t99 t37 t34 t91 t10 t42 t34 t40 t34 t40 t40 t40 t75 t41 t14 t90 t8 t90 t70 t60 t8 t14 t90\".\n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each rule produces two non-terminals on the right side, and the start symbol S produces two non-terminals initially. The terminals are the ones that appear on the right side of the productions. In this case, the terminals are strings starting with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the terminals are 't' followed by two-digit numbers, like 't33', 't70', etc. The non-terminals are words without 't', such as S, NT3, NT9, etc.\n\nThe string starts with 't33', so I need to find if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals. However, when dealing with a full string, the derivation tree will have the start symbol producing non-terminals, and each of those producing more non-terminals until eventually, terminals appear.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using a top-down approach, typically with something like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just doing it manually, I'll try to see if each 't' can be matched by some production.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, every production has two non-terminals on the right. So the entire string must be derived starting from S, and each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals, until we get to terminals. So the string is a concatenation of terminals, each of which comes from a terminal production rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any rules that directly produce 't's except the rules where the RHS is a terminal and a non-terminal, i.e., the rules like S \u2192 NT3 NT9, where the right-hand side is non-terminals, but the non-terminals might produce terminals.\n\nWait, no. The productions in CNF must have all terminals only on the left side, right? Or more accurately, the grammar is in CNF if every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals, except for the base case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. In CNF, each right-hand side is two non-terminals, but the terminal symbols are only present in the start symbol's top-level production.\n\nHmm, now I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. However, in this case, looking at the given grammar, all the productions have two non-terminals on the RHS, except for some that end with a terminal? Or do they all have non-terminals except one?\n\nWait, the grammar provided doesn't show any rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. For example, in the provided grammar, the rule S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then many other rules NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT2, etc. But then it seems that some non-terminals produce 't's, but in the initial productions, both parts are non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, like for NT9 \u2192 \"t75\", which is a terminal production. Oh, okay, so some of the non-terminals produce a single terminal. So that changes things because in CNF, you can have both two non-terminals and one terminal. Wait, no, actually, no, Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions are either two non-terminals or one terminal. So in the given grammar, some productions like NT9 -> \"t75\" are allowed because they produce a single terminal.\n\nTherefore, in this grammar, some non-terminals can directly produce a terminal, while others produce two non-terminals.\n\nBut then, when the entire string is a series of such terminals, the production rules would need to split the string into parts, each part corresponding to a terminal or two non-terminals, which in turn produce more terminals or non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, to parse the string, we can start by trying to split the string into parts as per the grammar. Each split must correspond to the productions.\n\nSo first, the string is:\n\nt33 t70 t90 t60 t12 t13 t75 t41 t10 t37 t42 t14 t8 t33 t19 t65 t90 t99 t37 t34 t91 t10 t42 t34 t40 t34 t40 t40 t40 t75 t41 t14 t90 t8 t90 t70 t60 t8 t14 t90.\n\nI think I need to see if the entire string can be broken down according to the productions in the grammar.\n\nFirst step: Identify the order in which to split the string. Since this is a leftmost derivation, perhaps, the first step is to find a production that starts with the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't33'. In the grammar, where does 't33' appear? Let me scan the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the rules where the RHS ends with 't33':\n\nLooking at the bottom of the grammar list:\n\nNT2 -> NT1 NT2\n\nWait, I'm scanning through all the rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 \"t34\"\n\nNT2 \u2192 \"t33\"\n\nSo, in the given grammar, there is a production rule 'NT2 -> \"t33\"'. So 't33' is produced by NT2.\n\nSo, for the first token 't33', it must come from NT2. So in the derivation, the start symbol S must produce two non-terminals, say A and B, where one of them (A, say) produces 't33', and the other produces the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but S can only produce two non-terminals. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then, the NT3 and NT9 would each produce non-terminals or terminals. But looking at the string, the first token is 't33' which comes from NT2. So that production must be NT2. But in the initial production, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so both NT3 and NT9 must produce sequences that form the rest of the string.\n\nWait a minute, that seems conflicting. If S splits into NT3 and NT9, then the entire string must be derived from NT3 and NT9. But the first token is 't33', which comes from NT2, which is not directly produced by S's initial productions. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first step is that S can produce NT3 and NT9, each of which then produce more non-terminals. But the string starts with 't33', so that 't33' must come from the derivation of NT3, perhaps through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see how each 't' can be matched in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a recursive descent parsing approach could be used, where each non-terminal is checked against its productions. But since I'm doing it manually, I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, starting with the entire string:\n\nt33 t70 t90 t60 t12 t13 t75 t41 t10 t37 t42 t14 t8 t33 t19 t65 t90 t99 t37 t34 t91 t10 t42 t34 t40 t34 t40 t40 t40 t75 t41 t14 t90 t8 t90 t70 t60 t8 t14 t90.\n\nWe'll start by looking for the leftmost terminal 't33'. In the grammar, 't33' is produced by NT2 (from the rule NT2 \u2192 \"t33\"). So, to get 't33', we need a production where NT2 \u2192 \"t33\".

{"custom_id":"request-800","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user has provided a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. CNF means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. So every production is of the form A -> BC, with B and C being non-terminals or terminals. Looking at the given grammar, it's a bit lengthy, but I notice that some symbols like NT0, NT1, etc., seem to be non-terminals, and some have terminal symbols like 't12', 't30', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols: t12 t30 t65 t30 t42 t33 t65 t30 t65 t75 t8 t60 t14 t75 t90 t23 t8 t34 t90 t70 t65 t30 t34 t33 t13 t19 t90 t12 t23 t12 t70 t42 t23 t37 t88 t99 t88 t75 t25 t10 t19.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse this string according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or some form of top-down parsing. Alternatively, I might need to check each step to see if I can derive the string using the given rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The productions for S are:\n- S -> NT3 NT9\n- S -> NT3 NT2\n\nSo S splits into NT3 and either NT9 or NT2. Now, I'll look at the string. The first two symbols are t12 and t30. So the first step is to see if either of the NT3 productions can lead to t12 t30... Wait, but NT3 is a non-terminal; in the string, these are terminals, so NT3 must expand into t12 t30, but NT3 is part of the grammar, and in the grammar, NT3 has its own productions. Let me check what NT3 can expand into.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT3's productions:\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT3-> ... other rules?\n\nWait, I don't see any other rules for NT3 beyond NT6 NT2 and NT0 NT7. So NT3 can be split into two non-terminals: either NT6 and NT2 or NT0 and NT7.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first symbol is t12. So probably, the NT0 or NT6 might be the ones that start with t12. Looking at the grammar rules for NT0, I see:\n- NT0 -> NT1 NT3\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT1\n- And others, but I think I have enough for now.\n\nBut wait, let me consider where t12 comes from. Looking at the terminals, I need to see which non-terminals expand into t12. Looking through the grammar, some non-terminals like NT1, NT2, etc., have specific terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the production rules for the non-terminals, I see that for example, NT0 expands into 't13' in one rule. Similarly, NT2 has 't33' as a terminal symbol, and so on. But the problem is that in the grammar, many symbols have multiple productions where some produce terminals and others produce non-terminals.\n\nFor instance, NT2 has:\n- NT2 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT8\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT6\n- NT2 -> NT3 NT1\n- NT2 -> NT8 NT9\n- NT2 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT2 -> NT8 NT8\n- And others that produce terminals like t23, t33, t37, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 has:\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT7 -> NT6 NT5\n- NT7 -> NT0 NT8\n- NT7 -> NT3 NT8\n- NT7 -> NT5 NT7\n- NT7 -> NT9 NT8\n- NT7 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT7 has 't10', 't40', etc.\n\nBut the main issue is that the string starts with t12. Let me check which non-terminal can produce t12 as the first symbol. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t12, except maybe in the productions of NT6 or NT3.\n\nWait, looking at NT3's rules:\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n\nSo in the first step, S -> NT3 NT9 or S-> NT3 NT2, but the first two symbols are t12 and t30. So maybe S -> NT3 NT2, because the second symbol is t30.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nS can be NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let's say S -> NT3 NT9. Now, the first symbol is t12, so we need to expand NT3. Looking at NT3's rules:\n\n1. NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n2. NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n3. NT3 -> others, but probably not necessary.\n\nSo, first, NT3 can be split into NT6 and NT2.\n\nNow, the first two symbols are t12 and t30. Let's assign t12 to NT6 and t30 to NT2? Wait, NT2 can produce 't33', which is not t30. So maybe that's not possible. So perhaps the first T is from somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps NT6 can produce t30? Looking through NT6's rules:\n\nNT6 has productions:\n- NT6 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT6 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT6 -> 't30'\n- Also others, but the important one is NT6 -> 't30'.\n\nSo, to produce t30 as a terminal, NT6 must directly expand to 't30'.\n\nSo, if the first symbol is t12, maybe that's from NT0, but in the NT3 expansion, the symbols are NT6 and NT2. Wait, no, S-> NT3 NT9, but the string starts with t12, which could be the expansion of NT3 into either NT6 and NT2 or NT0 and NT7.\n\nSo let me think: The production for NT3 is to split into NT6 and NT2. So the first token in the string would be the expansion of NT6 or NT2.\n\nWait, but if S-> NT3 NT9, then the first symbol is the expansion of NT3, which is either NT6 and NT2. So the first two symbols would be the expansion of NT6 and NT2.\n\nSo, if the first symbol is t12, which could be from NT6 (since NT6 can produce 't30'), but that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the first part is from NT0.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to match the string step by step.\n\nLet me consider the string: t12 t30 t65 t30 t42 t33 t65 t30 t65 t75 t8 t60 t14 t75 t90 t23 t8 t34 t90 t70 t65 t30 t34 t33 t13 t19 t90 t12 t23 t12 t70 t42 t23 t37 t88 t99 t88 t75 t25 t10 t19.\n\nIt's quite lengthy. Maybe I can try to find the parse tree.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to check if each step in the grammar can produce the required symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for conflicts or see if any part of the string cannot be derived.\n\nWait, another approach: using the CYK algorithm. But since the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm can be applied.\n\nBut I'm not very familiar with implementing CYK, but perhaps I can try.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long, but perhaps I can do a partial parse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for any step where a production cannot produce the next symbol.\n\nFor example, let's see the beginning: S-> NT3 NT9.\n\nNT3 -> ... Let's say it's NT6 NT2.\n\nSo, the first symbol t12 would have to come from NT6. Looking at NT6's productions, one is 't30', which is not t12.\n\nWait, so maybe NT6 can expand to a non-terminal that eventually produces t12.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions again:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-820","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, first off, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t88 t60 t10 t65 t14 t40 t25 t10 t60 t19 t65 t65 t10 t40 t34 t33 t70 t91 t41 t34 t65 t60 t42 t41 t41 t70 t40 t91 t33 t60 t8 t8 t42 t33 t42 t41 t8 t34 t99 t40 t90 t14`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has a bunch of rules that turn non-terminals into terminals, like S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which eventually become specific t's. So each terminal in the string must be reachable from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it generates NT3 and NT9. So from S, we have two branches: one with NT3 and one with NT9. Each of these will generate more symbols based on their rules.\n\nLet me check what NT3 and NT9 produce. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 ... (various options, including 't33')\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- NT9 \u2192 't75' or other terminals like 't91', 't70', etc.\n\nWait, but in the start symbol's rule, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the entire string starts with NT3 followed by NT9. So the parse tree must start with NT3 and NT9.\n\nBut looking at NT3's production: it becomes NT6 and NT2. Then NT2 can be further expanded, and so on.\n\nI'm getting a bit lost in the symbols. Maybe I should consider the number of symbols and whether they can reach the terminals.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't88', which is a terminal. In the grammar, is there a rule that directly produces 't88'? I'm looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT2 \u2192 't33', 't65', 't8', etc. NT9 appears to produce 't75', 't91', 't22', etc. NT4 \u2192 't88' is one of its productions. So 't88' can be directly generated by NT4.\n\nSo, in the string, the first word is 't88', which must come from NT4. Let's see, NT4's rules include NT7 NT0 and NT2 NT1.\n\nWait, so if the first symbol is 't88' (from NT4), then that part of the production would be 't88', but in the string, it's the very first symbol, so there's no context before it. So that would mean that the parse tree for 't88' would be a single production. But looking at the grammar, NT4 can't produce a terminal directly in a single step because all rules have non-terminals on both sides. Wait, no\u2014actually, in some rules, NT4 can produce a terminal? Or not?\n\nWait, no. In the grammar, for example, NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0, NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT1, etc. None of these are direct terminals. But I see a rule for NT9 \u2192 't75', which is a terminal. So the only way a terminal can appear is through those specific rules where a non-terminal directly becomes a terminal.\n\nSo to get 't88', it must come from a production rule where the non-terminal expands directly to 't88'. Looking through the rules, yes, NT4 \u2192 't88' is a production. So that means in the parse tree, a node labeled NT4 directly produces 't88'.\n\nSimilarly, the string's second symbol is 't60'. Let's see where that can come from. Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't60'. Wait, maybe through some other non-terminals?\n\nWait, maybe 't60' can be derived from a series of non-terminals. Let me think: perhaps from NT6, NT0, or other similar non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT6's rules: NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6, NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, etc. Wait, but those are non-terminals. So, to get to 't60', I might need to break down further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't60' is a terminal in one of the rules, but I don't immediately see it in the production rules provided. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar again to make sure I don't miss any rules that directly produce a 't' terminal. Looking through all the non-terminals, I don't see any other 't's except for the ones listed. So each 't' in the string must be directly generated by a non-terminal that has a rule producing that 't'.\n\nSo for each 't' in the string, we need to have a corresponding rule in the grammar that directly outputs that 't'. Let's confirm:\n\n- 't88' is produced by NT4.\n- 't60' is not directly produced by any of the non-terminals. Wait, check the grammar for terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules again, I think the grammar only has specific rules that produce certain 't's, like 't88', 't65', 't10', etc. So if 't60' is not in the list of terminals produced by any non-terminal, then the grammar cannot generate that.\n\nWait, but the string has 't60' which may not be among the terminals. Looking at the provided grammar rules, are any non-terminals directly producing 't60'? Let me go through each rule.\n\nLooking at NT0: NT0 \u2192 't13', 't22', 't34', 't57', 't70', 't75'.\n\nSimilarly, NT2: 't65', 't10', 't19', 't33', etc.\n\nNT3: 't30', 't88', etc.\n\nNT4: 't40', 't88', etc.\n\nNT5: 't37', 't60'... Wait, wait! Looking at the grammar, NT5 has a rule NT5 \u2192 't37', 't60'. Yes! So 't60' can be directly produced by NT5.\n\nSo, in the string, when there's 't60', it must come from a NT5 production.\n\nSimilarly, let's check all the 't's in the string:\n\nt88: NT4\nt60: NT5\nt10: NT2\nt65: NT2\nt14: Hmm, does any non-terminal directly produce 't14'? Looking through the rules, I don't see any production that directly outputs 't14'. Wait, checking all the non-terminals:\n\nNT0: 't13', 't22', 't34', 't57', 't70', 't75'.\nNT2: 't65', 't10', 't19', 't33', 't60', etc.\nNT3: 't30', 't88', 't90', 't99', etc.\nNT4: 't40', 't88', 't90', etc.\nNT5: 't37', 't60', 't65', 't70', etc.\nNT6: 't34', 't42', etc.\nNT7: 't40', 't70', etc.\nNT8: 't52', 't65', etc.\nNT9: 't25', 't37', etc.\n\nWait, 't14' is not in any of the terminals, so the grammar doesn't have any rule that directly produces 't14'. So if the string has a 't14', that would be a problem because the grammar can't generate it.\n\nWait, but the second 't14' in the string is at position 8: the string is:\n\nt88 t60 t10 t65 t14 t40 t25 t10 t60 t19 t65 t65 t10 t40 t34 t33 t70 t91 t41 t34 t65 t60 t42 t41 t41 t70 t40 t91 t33 t60 t8 t8 t42 t33 t42 t41 t8 t34 t99 t40 t90 t14\n\nSo there's a 't14' at positions 4 and 31.

Let's see, the string is a series of symbols separated by spaces: t13 t65 t40 t37 t99 t90 t91 t40 t13 t30 t88 t10 t99 t25 t75 t30 t91 t75 t34 t65 t91 t52 t19 t22 t60 t14 t65 t70 t30 t14 t65 t91 t13 t10 t40 t10 t40 t30 t8 t30 t88 t41. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar rules. This is Chomsky normal form, so every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A,B,C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because each production starts with a non-terminal and splits into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI notice that the initial symbol is S, and from the rules, S directly expands into NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So S always starts with NT3, then something, and then NT9 or NT2.\n\nThe string starts with t13, which I think corresponds to a terminal symbol. Looking at the production rules, I need to check which non-terminals can produce t13. Scanning through the non-terminals, I see that NT0, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, etc., all produce some terminals. \n\nWait, looking specifically, the terminals are things like t13, t65, t40, etc., each corresponding to a variable in the string. So each step in the derivation must replace a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLet me list out the possible terminals each non-terminal can derive:\n\nLooking at the production rules for each NT and terminal a:\n\n- NT0:\n  - production to t13\n  - production to t65\n  - production to t25\n  - production to t40\n  - production to t91\n  - production to t70\n  - production to t30\n  - production to t14\n  - production to t65 (but since it's to 't65' twice here, I need to note)\n  \n- NT1 produces t40.\n\n- NT2 produces t33, t37, t60, t88, t10, t99, t22, t60 again, etc.\n\n- NT3 produces t30.\n\n- NT4: t88, t23, t99, t90, t42, t99 again, etc.\n\n- NT5: t91.\n\n- NT6: t65, t34, t8, t91, t75, t37, etc.\n\n- NT7: t40, t10, t70, t13, t70, t52, etc.\n\n- NT8: t52, t37, t65, t68, t8, t37, t40, etc.\n\n- NT9: t75, t30, t22, t37, t90, t14, t65, etc.\n\nHmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to list the terminals each non-terminal can directly produce.\n\nEach Non-Terminal (NT) has production rules that either split into two NTs or produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through, each NT can have multiple rules leading to terminals or other NTs. For example, NT0 can produce t13, t65, t25, t40, t91, t70, t30, t14, etc. Let me make a list for each NT:\n\n- NT0: t13, t65, t25, t40, t91, t70, t30, t14\n- NT1: t40\n- NT2: t33, t37, t60, t88, t10, t99, t22, t60, t34, t91, t52, t19, t22, t65, t70, t99, t25, t91, t30, t14\n- Wait, let me check the rules again. Each production for NT2 is followed by two NTs or a terminal.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nNT2's rules:\n2\u2192 t33\n2\u2192 t37\n2\u2192 t60\n2\u2192 t88\n2\u2192 t10\n2\u2192 t99\n2\u2192 t22\n2\u2192 t99\n2\u2192 t65\n2\u2192 t14\n2\u2192 t60\n2\u2192 t34\n2\u2192 t91\n2\u2192 t30\n2\u2192 t14\n2\u2192 t65\n2\u2192 t70\n2\u2192 t99\n2\u2192 t25\n2\u2192 t91\n2\u2192 t14\n2\u2192 t65\n2\u2192 t70\n2\u2192 t99\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps instead, each production for NT2 is of the form NT2 -> AB or NT2 -> a, where a is a terminal. So for instance, looking at the production rules, each line starts with 'NT2' and the right-hand side is two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo for each rule, let me identify the terminal productions for NT2:\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\nNT2 -> t33: this is a terminal production.\nNT2 -> t37\nNT2 -> t60\nNT2 -> t88\nNT2 -> t10\nNT2 -> t99\nNT2 -> t22\nNT2 has several rules: let's list all terminals:\n\nNT2's terminal rules are:\nt33, t37, t60, t88, t10, t99, t22, t99 (again), t65, t14, t60 (again), t34, t91, t30, t14 (again), t65, t70, t99 (again), t25, t91, t14, t65, t70, t99. Wait, this seems repetitive. So perhaps NT2 can produce terminals like t33, t37, t60, t88, t10, t99, t22, t65, t14, t34, t91, t30, t25.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all unique terminals that NT2 can produce. Let's go through each NT2 production:\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> t33\n- NT2 -> t37\n- NT2 -> t60\n- NT2 -> t88\n- NT2 -> t10\n- NT2 -> t99\n- NT2 -> t22\n- NT2 -> t65\n- NT2 -> t14\n- NT2 -> t34\n- NT2 -> t91\n- NT2 -> t30\n- NT2 -> t25\n\nWait, let me count.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a grammar in Chomsky normal form means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where A is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, I see a mix of both, like \"S -> NT3 NT9\" which are non-terminals, and some productions like \"NT9 -> 't40'\". Wait, are these productions terminal or non-terminal? Because some produce terminals while others produce non-terminals.\n\nLooking closer, each production is like \"NTX -> NTY NTZ\" or \"NTX -> 't??'\". So the non-terminals are prefixed with NT, and the terminals are strings starting with 't'. Right, so the key is to work backwards from the given string and see if each terminal can be directly derived from a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe string given is: `t22 t91 t19 t70 t70 t60 t25 t70 t88 t52 t42 t42 t70 t19 t33 t99 t33 t33 t25 t65 t52 t13 t88 t40 t14 t88 t75 t30 t41 t91 t19 t52 t8 t41 t8 t14 t10 t14 t88 t99 t60 t41 t88`\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived by the grammar. That means each terminal can be matched by some production. Let's start from the first symbol and see where it can come from.\n\nThe string starts with t22. Looking at the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 't40' is a production, but wait, is there a production NTX that directly gives 't22'? Let me scan the grammar. Oh, under NT1 -> NT9 NT8 and other productions, but looking for 't22'...\n\nWait, scanning the productions, I notice that some non-terminals have productions like NT9 -> 't75', NT1 -> 't25', etc. Let me check if 't22' is a terminal in any production. Yes! I see NT9 has two productions: NT9 -> 't60' and NT9 -> 't40'. Wait, no, in the grammar provided, I see NT9 and NT0 and others are defined as 't??', for example, NT0 -> 't13', NT1 -> 't25', etc. So I need to find which non-terminal can produce 't22' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't22'. Wait, but wait, maybe I missed it. Let me re-examine the productions.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT9 -> 't60', 't75', etc. Then NT2 has 't33', 't37', etc. Let me check each production carefully. Hmm, does any non-terminal have a production that ends with 't22'? Let me go through each NT with a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, I see this: NT6 -> 't8', NT0 -> 't13', NT1 -> 't25', NT2 -> 't33', NT3 -> 't30', NT4 -> 't88', NT5 -> 't91', NT6 (again) -> 't8', NT7 -> 't40', NT8 -> 't52', NT9 -> 't60', 't75', etc. So none have 't22'.\n\nWait, did I miss any non-terminal that can produce 't22'? Let me check the grammar again. Oh hold on, the last few productions: for example, \"NT9 -> 't75'\", \"NT2 -> 't33'\", etc. Hmm, I don't see a 't22' as a terminal in any production. That can't be right because the string has 't22' as the first symbol, so the grammar can't produce that symbol. Therefore, the answer must be 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the grammar. Perhaps I missed 't22' in the NT productions. Let me go through each NT one by one.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT6 -> 't8', NT0 -> 't13', NT1 has 't25', NT2 't33', NT3 't30', NT4 't88', NT5 't91', NT6 again 't8', NT7 't40', NT8 't52', NT9 't60', 't75', etc. I don't see any 't22'.\n\nWait, is there a possibility that the grammar has indirect production for 't22'? Like maybe from NT1, which is 't25', but that's not 't22'. Or NT2 has 't33'. Hmm, no. It seems like the string starts with a symbol that's not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Perhaps some NT can derive a string that includes 't22', but in the given string, it's a single symbol, so the entire string must be built from top-down, deriving each terminal.\n\nWait, but if the grammar doesn't have a non-terminal that can produce 't22' as a terminal, then the string cannot be generated. So, for example, looking at the string, the first token is 't22', which would come from some NT. But in the grammar, no NT directly produces 't22'. That would mean the grammar cannot generate that string, so the answer must be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that the grammar is defined with non-terminals S, NT0, NT1, etc., and terminals like 't22', 't41', etc. My task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string given is: `t22 t41 t91 t75 t70 t42 t65 t65 t88 t23 t40 t25 t19 t25 t75 t75 t14 t75 t70 t90 t70 t41 t65 t34 t60 t19 t19 t40 t75 t33 t10 t60 t33 t14 t33 t41 t60 t99 t99 t10 t22 t88 t75`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has several production rules.

Only some produce terminals directly, like NT9 -> 't75' and others like NT0 -> 't13'. So this suggests that the grammar is a binary tree structure, generating sequences of terminals where each production splits into two parts.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string is a concatenation of these terminal symbols, and we need to see if they can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I think of the string as a series of symbols and see if a parsing strategy can derive them using the given rules.\n\nLet me note that the initial symbol S -> NT3 NT9. So the string must start with NT3 and then NT9. Looking at the string, it starts with 't22' which is part of NT3's production.\n\nLooking into the grammar rules associated with NT3, I see that NT3 -> NT6 NT2. So the first symbol 't22' must come from either NT6 or NT2. Wait, looking at the terminals, NT3 is defined as producing 't30', 't37', etc. Wait no\u2014the NT3 has production rules that expand into other non-terminals, but in the list, I see NT3 has some rules like NT3 -> NT6 NT2, NT3 -> NT0 NT7, etc., and also NT3 -> 't30', 't65', 't90', etc. Wait, for example, in the given rules, I see NT3 -> 't30', 't65', etc. So the terminals associated with NT3 include 't30', 't65', 't90'.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't22', which corresponds to NT3. Looking at the rules for NT3, I see NT3 can produce 't30' (via rule NT3 -> 't30'), but I don't see a rule directly producing 't22'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait the grammar rules given include:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\nNT3 -> 't30'\nNT3 -> 't65'\nNT3 -> 't90'\n\nWait, I don't see a production for NT3 -> 't22'. But in the string, the first symbol is 't22'. That suggests that NT3 directly produces 't22' if such a rule exists. But from what I can see, the given rules for NT3 don't include 't22'. So that could be a problem. Wait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't90'\n\nNo 't22' as a terminal for NT3. So if NT3 cannot directly produce 't22', then how does the first symbol 't22' come into play? That suggests that perhaps the parsing starts with a different non-terminal or there's an error in the string.\n\nWait, but the starting symbol is S -> NT3 NT9. So the entire string must start with NT3, which would then expand. But if NT3 can't directly produce 't22', then the string cannot start with 't22'. Therefore, the string should start with a symbol that NT3 can produce as a terminal. So this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my interpretation is wrong. Maybe the string is a sequence of tokens derived through the grammar's productions, and the initial NT3 can lead to 't22' via a chain of productions. Let me check: Are there any paths from NT3 that can lead to 't22'?\n\nLooking again, NT3 produces 't30', 't65', 't90'. None of these is 't22'. So perhaps 't22' is produced by another non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see other non-terminals like NT2, which have 't22' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions: I see NT2 -> 't22' from rule NT2 -> 't22'. Also, other rules. So for instance, S starts with NT3 and then NT9. Now, NT3 could produce, via 't30', but that's not 't22'. So where does 't22' come from?\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with 't22', which would require that NT3 has a production to 't22'. But from the grammar, I don't see NT3 directly producing 't22'. However, 't22' is a terminal associated with NT2, as in NT2 can directly produce 't22'.\n\nSo perhaps the expansion goes like this: S -> NT3 NT9 -> ... -> 't22' ... So how can S produce a string that starts with 't22'? It must be that somewhere in the expansion of NT3 and NT9, 't22' appears as the first terminal.\n\nBut how? Since S starts with NT3, which must expand into something that starts with a terminal. Unless NT3 can somehow lead to a string that starts with 't22', but from the production rules of NT3, it seems it only can produce 't30', 't65', or 't90' directly, and other non-terminals indirectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production where NT3 can expand into NT2 followed by NT0, or something else that eventually leads to 't22'. Let me try to see.\n\nLooking at NT3's production: NT3 -> NT6 NT2. So if NT3 expands to NT6 NT2, then we have NT6 and NT2. Now, NT6 has productions like NT6 -> NT4 NT5, etc. Let me see if NT2 can produce 't22'.\n\nLooking at NT2's rules: Yes, NT2 -> 't22'. So if somewhere the expansion leads to NT3 -> NT6 NT2 -> (something) 't22', then 't22' can appear early in the string.\n\nBut the problem is that S starts with NT3 and then NT9. So the first step is S-> NT3 NT9. Now, NT9 can produce, among others, 't91', 't88', etc., but let's see if it can lead to 't22'. Looking at NT9's rules, I don't see any rule where NT9 directly produces 't22'. Wait, but looking again, the rules for NT9 include:\n\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT9 -> 't22'\n- NT9 -> 't90' (Wait, no, looking at the provided rules again, I see:\n\nWait in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't22'\n- NT9 -> 't14'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- etc. So yes, NT9 directly can produce 't22'.\n\nWait, but the initial expansion is S -> NT3 NT9. So NT3 would first expand into NT6 NT2, and NT9 might expand into 't22'. But let me think about this: if S is broken into NT3 and NT9, and NT3's first expansion is NT6 NT2, which then can expand further as needed.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't22', which would come from NT9 if NT9 produces 't22' directly. But in that case, S has NT3 followed by NT9, so maybe that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the parse tree is such that the initial NT3 expansion leads to some NT2s, and then one of the NT2s can produce 't22'.

The string is pretty long, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which should make it a bit easier since each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I'll write down the string to keep track: t8 t40 t40 t52 t37 t10 t25 t33 t14 t60 t14 t37 t23 t8 t13 t8 t90 t60 t42 t90 t90 t10 t99 t10 t33 t91 t22 t88 t70 t90 t91 t10 t65 t30 t91 t33 t42 t91 t41 t65 t25 t52 t90 t33 t19.\n\nLooking at the grammar's terminal productions, I can map each terminal symbol to its corresponding NT. For example, t8 is NT8, t40 is NT0, and so on. Each of these NTs has a production that leads to them, so I'll need to see if these NTs can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has productions S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So any string starting with NT3 followed by either NT9 or NT2 should be considered. But let's look at the string: it starts with t8, which is NT8. So the first step is to see if NT8 can be derived from S.\n\nWait, no. S produces NT3, which then produces other NTs. Hmm, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree starting from S and see if it can generate this string.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or a method to decompose the string step by step. Let me list the possible NTs from the string:\n\nLooking at the string, we have t8 (NT8), t40 (NT0), t52 (NT2), etc. So let's list all the NTs in the string: NT8, NT0, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT9. \n\nWait, the string's terminals are:\n\nt8 (NT8), \nt40 (NT0),\nt52 (NT2),\nt37 (NT?), \nWait, the grammar only has certain NTs as terminals. Let me map each terminal to their corresponding NT:\n\nt8 \u2192 NT8,\nt40 \u2192 NT0,\nt52 \u2192 NT2,\nt37 \u2192 I don't see NT37 in the grammar's production rules. Hmm, wait, the grammar's NTs are mostly letters like NT0, NT1, etc., so perhaps each terminal is one of these NTs. So t37 must be NT37, but looking at the productions, I don't see NT37 except in the rule S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so perhaps that's not a terminal. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each NT can only produce a finite number of other NTs until a terminal is reached. So each symbol in the string must correspond to an NT that eventually produces a terminal. But in the problem, the string is composed of terminals, so each symbol in the string must be a terminal, which is the result of an NT production.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the NTs are on the left side of \u2192, and the right side is combinations of NTs or terminals. Each terminal production ends with a terminal symbol. So each NT must directly produce a single terminal or a combination of NTs. So, in the string, each symbol like t8 must be a terminal that an NT can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8: no terminal here.\nWait, some NTs do produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't52' (which is t52 as a terminal)\nSimilarly, NT9 \u2192 't75', NT6 \u2192 't8', NT0 \u2192 't13', NT1 \u2192 't25', NT7 \u2192 't40', etc. So each NT has a production where it can terminate with certain terminals.\n\nSo, in our string, the first symbol is t8. So we need to see if NT8 can derive t8. Looking at NT8's productions, one of them is NT8 \u2192 't52', so NT8 can produce t52. Wait, but t8 is another terminal. Let me check if NT8 can produce t8. Looking at the grammar rules for NT8:\n\nNT8 has these productions:\n\u2192 NT6 NT8\n\u2192 NT4 NT2\n\u2192 NT3 NT7\n\u2192 NT9 \u2192 Wait, looking again: The grammar has multiple NT8 productions, none of which directly produce t8 except one might. Looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT8: \n\u2192 NT6 NT8 (no terminal)\n\u2192 NT4 NT2 (no terminal)\n\u2192 NT3 NT7 (no terminal)\n\u2192 Is there any rule that directly produces t8? Let me scan the production rules again. I don't see any NT8 \u2192 't8' directly, but maybe through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t8 is derived via NT3 or NT6, which can produce t8. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT6: \u2192 NT8 \u2192 't65' \u2192 Wait, looking in the rules: NT6 has \u2192 NT8 and other rules. Wait, in the grammar, NT6's rules include:\n\n\u2192 NT8 \u2192 't65'?\n\nNo, let's check:\n\nThe NT6 rules are:\n\u2192 NT3 NT6\n\u2192 NT4 NT5\n\u2192 NT9 NT2\n\u2192 NT5 NT7\n\u2192 NT3 NT1\n\u2192 NT4 NT0\n\u2192 NT2 NT5\n\u2192 NT8 \u2192 't65'\nWait, looking at the rules I provided:\n\nLooking at the list, yes, there's NT8 \u2192 't65'.\n\nBut wait, NT6 has a production: yes, NT6 \u2192 NT8 (and then NT6 can be further decomposed into another NT6, but in one step, it's a production to NT8. So if NT6 can produce 't65', then for NT6 to become 't65', that could be a way.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me map each NT in the string to their possible productions and see if we can derive the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: \nt8, t40, t52, t37, t10, t25, t33, t14, t60, t14, t37, t23, t8, t13, t8, t90, t60, t42, t90, t90, t10, t99, t10, t33, t91, t22, t88, t70, t90, t91, t10, t65, t30, t91, t33, t42, t91, t41, t65, t25, t52, t90, t33, t19.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, each NT has certain productions that either produce another NT or a terminal.\n\nWait, this is taking too long. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be parsed according to the grammar's rules.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t8. So looking for NT8 productions that produce t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does NT8 produce 't8' directly? No, I don't see any production for NT8 that ends with 't8'. So maybe 't8' must be produced by another NT and then that NT must have a production that includes NT8 ending with 't8'. Alternatively, maybe 't8' is a terminal produced by another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at each NT and see what terminals they can produce.\n\nFor example, NT0 \u2192 't13', so in the string, any occurrence of 't13' must come from NT0. Similarly, NT1 \u2192 't25', so 't25' must be via NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to see if the string can be broken down into the possible NT sequences.\n\nBut this might take a lot of time. Alternatively, maybe I should look for possible starting points. The start symbol is S, which can go to NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let's see:\n\nIf the string starts with NT8, it's 't8'. So the root must be a production leading to t8, but since the start symbols are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2, then S leads to combinations involving NT3, which itself branches into other NTs. So perhaps the start symbol S leads to a tree where the first NT3 is decomposed further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this.

{"custom_id":"request-859","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That simplifies things a bit because CNF has specific properties that might help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some rules have 'NT' followed by another 'NT', like S \u2192 NT3 NT9. But many rules are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, where X, Y, Z are numbers. The terminals are represented as 't' followed by numbers, like 't19', 't30', etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t19 t99 t52 t90 t19 t22 t10 t8 t10 t42 t40 t99 t8 t8 t70 t8 t70 t99 t34 t40 t14 t60 t60 t33 t13 t22 t65 t65 t8 t42 t37 t13 t19 t52 t37 t40 t99 t34 t75 t14 t42 t99 t23 t60`.\n\nThat's a long string with a lot of 't' tokens. I need to find a derivation in the grammar that starts with S and ends with this string, following the productions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the start symbol**: S.\n2. **Check if S can derive the entire string**:\n   - The initial rule for S is S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So S \u2192 NT3 NT9 is one option, and S \u2192 NT3 NT2 is another. I'll need to explore both.\n\nFirst, let's take S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then, the string starts with t19, which is part of NT3 or NT9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't75'. So the last token of the string is t75, which matches NT9's production. That's a good sign.\n\nNow, the string starts with t19. Let's see where t19 comes from. Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT1 \u2192 't40', NT7 \u2192 't40', etc. Wait, t19 comes from NT9's rules: NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7 and NT1. Hmm, not sure. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT9's productions: \n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n\nSo, t75 is the terminal, but t19 might come from NT9's rule. Wait, no, t19 is the first token. So perhaps the initial NT3 and NT9 would produce 't19' from NT3.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT8\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n\nWait, t30 is a terminal, but the string starts with t19, not t30. So perhaps I have to look for a way that NT3 can produce t19. But from the rules, I don't see NT3 producing t19. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first production for S is S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Let me check that.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT3 NT2, the string starts with NT3 \u2192 t19. Is that possible? Let's see if NT3 can produce 't19'.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\nNo, NT3's rules produce other non-terminals or t's like t30, t25, etc., but no 't19' directly. So t19 would have to come from a chain of non-terminals expanding to 't19'. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that produces t19. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let's double-check the grammar rules. Are there any NT that produce t19? Let me scan through all the rules.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't40', 't25', 't99', 't42', etc.\n- NT2 has several rules, like NT2 \u2192 't33', 't37', 't65', etc.\n- NT7 can produce 't70', 't40', etc.\n- NT8 has several rules, including 't52', 't37', 't8', etc.\n- NT9 has 't75', 't60', etc.\n- NT0 has 't13', 't40', etc.\n- NT6 has 't65', etc.\n\nI don't see any NT that directly produce 't19'. So the initial step where S \u2192 NT3 NT2 would require that one of the NT3 or NT2 rules results in t19. But neither seems to.\n\nWait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me re-examine the string: the first token is t19, which has to come from NT3 or NT2.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then the first part is NT3 \u2192 t19, but NT3 doesn't have a rule for 't19', so that's impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if S \u2192 NT3 NT2, then the first part could be NT3 \u2192 t19, which is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps NT2 can produce t19? Let's look at NT2's rules.\n\nLooking at NT2's rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT1 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT2\u2019s production list doesn\u2019t include t19.\n\nSo NT2 can\u2019t directly produce t19 either. Therefore, any initial production for S would require that one of the NT3 or NT2 rules somehow ends up generating t19, but looking at the grammar, I don\u2019t see that happening.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a chain where a series of non-terminals that eventually leads to t19. Let me think: For example, NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. Then, NT0 could produce more terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT0 \u2192 't2 NT2'\n- etc.\n\nWait, but none of these NT0 rules produce t19. Similarly, NT7's rules are:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT8\n- NT7 \u2192 't60'\n- etc.\n\nAgain, no t19.\n\nSo, if neither S \u2192 NT3 NT9 nor S \u2192 NT3 NT2 can generate a t19 at the beginning, then the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with a production that comes from a different starting point, but I think the only starting points are S's two rules: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nGiven that, and since S can't generate t19 from either side, the string can't be generated. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-878","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the structure of both the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for parsing because it simplifies the process, but here, I don't need to parse; I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So, regardless of which production is used, the string will start with NT3 followed by either NT9 or NT2. NT3, NT9, and NT2 are non-terminals, so they need to be expanded into terminals or other non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: \n\nt30 t75 t90 t19 t88 t10 t33 t75 t13 t42 t12 t42 t13 t90 t25 t41 t37 t60 t70 t19 t30 t65 t40 t10 t22 t33 t13 t90 t60 t12 t10 t75 t19 t40 t88 t91 t60 t91 t19 t65 t75 t19 t10 t12 t90.\n\nEach \"t\" followed by two digits is a terminal symbol. Let's list them as tokens for clarity:\n\nt30, t75, t90, t19, t88, t10, t33, t75, t13, t42, t12, t42, t13, t90, t25, t41, t37, t60, t70, t19, t30, t65, t40, t10, t22, t33, t13, t90, t60, t12, t10, t75, t19, t40, t88, t91, t60, t91, t19, t65, t75, t19, t10, t12, t90.\n\nI notice that the string is quite long, so I need an efficient way to track its derivation.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first two non-terminals are either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let's examine both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNT3 can be expanded into various non-terminals. The productions for NT3 include NT6 NT2. Let's see: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Now, NT6 can be expanded further. NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, for example. Let's see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4.\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT1. Wait, that leads to recursion, which would make it hard. Alternatively, NT8 could be a terminal? Looking at the rules, NT8 can produce several non-terminals, but the only terminals in the grammar are specific instances like t30, t75, etc. I don't see NT8 directly as a terminal; it only appears on the right side of productions.\n\nWait, looking back, some NT symbols have productions that end with a terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 t91. So, some NTs can produce terminals.\n\nBut when S expands to NT3 NT9, NT3 gets expanded into NT6 NT2, then NT6 might produce NT8 NT4, and NT8 could produce other NTs. This seems complex.\n\nCase 2: S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Then NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4. NT8 can produce NT6 NT1, but that's recursive. Alternatively, NT8 might produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nThis approach is getting too convoluted. Maybe it's better to look for a way to map the symbols in the string back to the grammar's terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the string, I see t30, t75, etc. Let me check if these terminals appear in the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n- NT3 can produce t30 (from NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, NT0 \u2192 t13? Wait, no: From NT0's productions, one is NT0 \u2192 t13. So perhaps NT0 can generate t13, but how does that tie into NT3?\n\nWait, let's check the grammar rules more carefully. The NT3 productions are:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\nNT0 -> NT1 NT3\nNT0 -> NT2 NT2\nNT0 -> NT5 NT7\nNT1 -> NT4 NT8\nNT2 -> NT7 NT7\n...\nAnd one of the terminals:\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, which can be broken down further. NT0 can then produce t13 from NT0 \u2192 t13. Wait, actually, earlier I saw that NT0 has a production NT0 \u2192 t13, yes. So if NT0 can generate t13 directly, then NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7 could, through expansion, generate t13 and other symbols.\n\nSimilarly, for NT7: looking at the productions, NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4. I don't see NT5 or NT4 being terminals, but some have productions that include terminals, like NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5, which is recursive and doesn't include terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, some NT symbols directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t8 (from NT6 \u2192 t8)\n- NT5 \u2192 t37 (from NT5 \u2192 t37)\n- NT2 \u2192 t33 (from NT2 \u2192 t33)\n- NT9 \u2192 t60 (from NT9 \u2192 t60)\n- NT8 \u2192 t52 (from NT8 \u2192 t52)\n- NT0 \u2192 t13 (from NT0 \u2192 t13)\n- NT1 \u2192 t40 (from NT1 \u2192 t40)\n- NT7 \u2192 t40 (from NT7 \u2192 t40)\n- NT4 \u2192 t88 (from NT4 \u2192 t88)\n- NT3 \u2192 t30 (from NT3 \u2192 t30)\n- NT9 \u2192 t75 (from NT9 \u2192 t75)\n- NT6 \u2192 t65 (from NT6 \u2192 t65)\n- NT1 \u2192 t25 (from NT1 \u2192 t25)\n- NT7 \u2192 t70 (from NT7 \u2192 t70)\n- NT5 \u2192 t91 (from NT5 \u2192 t91)\n- NT9 \u2192 t22 (from NT9 \u2192 t22)\n- NT9 \u2192 t19 (from NT9 \u2192 t14) (Wait, no: Looking back, NT9's productions: looking at the list, there's NT9 \u2192 t60 and others, but not t19. Wait, I may have missed that. Let me scan the NT9 productions.\n\nAh, yes: NT9 \u2192 t60 and others, but also NT9 \u2192 t75 and others. Wait, perhaps I got confused because there are multiple rules for NT9. Let me list all the NT9 productions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t75 (from one rule)\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT9 \u2192 t90\n- NT9 \u2192 t22\n- NT9 \u2192 t14 (Wait, did I see that? Looking back, yes: \"NT9 -> t22\" and \"NT9 -> t14\" is another production, so NT9 can produce t14 directly as well.\n\nWait, but in the string we have t30, which is a terminal in NT3. Similarly, t75 is a terminal in NT9, t40 is in NT1, and so on.\n\nSo, going back: The string has t30, which is generated by NT3 \u2192 t30. So, the occurrence of t30 must come from an NT3 production. Looking at the grammar, NT3 can produce t30 via NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, and then NT0 can produce t13. But in the string, following t30 is t75, t90, etc. So, perhaps after t30, the next NT0 produces t13, but how does that connect? Alternatively, maybe the initial production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then NT3 becomes t30, and NT9 becomes t75, but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string step by step, treating each terminal as it comes and seeing if it's allowed.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into segments that might correspond to the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t30, which as per the grammar can come from NT3 \u2192 t30.

{"custom_id":"request-905","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I'll look at the grammar and the string to understand how they might relate.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or A \u2192 S, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that most productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz (non-terminals to other non-terminals), and a few are terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 't75' is a terminal production.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t13 t34 t23 t22 t10 t42 t10 t12 t40 t70 t42 t13 t33 t34 t14 t12 t12 t12 t90 t40 t23 t65 t40 t88 t40 t30 t70 t37 t65 t65 t37 t88 t41 t13 t60 t88 t30 t60 t88 t34 t13 t23 t33 t65 t42 t25.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either directly produces a terminal or produces two non-terminals. So, when generating a string, each step either appends a terminal or splits into two non-terminals, which then can be further expanded.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string using the grammar. However, since the string is quite long, I might look for patterns or key productions that can help me break it down.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't13'. From the grammar, I see that NT0 \u2192 't13' and NT3 \u2192 't30' (but that might not be needed right now). So, one of the productions that directly produces 't13' is NT0 \u2192 't13'. So the first symbol is produced by NT0.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, NT0 can derive 't13' directly. Alternatively, NT0 also has some other productions like NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT7, etc. So, the first symbol 't13' must come from NT0 \u2192 't13', so the current part of the string starts with NT0.\n\nNow, moving forward, after 't13', the next symbol is 't34'. I need to find what comes after the production of NT0. Let's look at the possible productions for NT0 that involve other non-terminals. NT0 can go to NT2 NT2, NT5 NT7, or other combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't13', the next is 't34'. So after NT0 \u2192 't13', the next symbol is 't34'. Therefore, the next part must come from NT0's other production, which is probably a non-terminal. So, perhaps NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT7 because that would split into NT5 and NT7, which might produce 't34' each.\n\nWait, but let's see: if NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT7, then after 't13', we have NT5 and NT7 to produce 't34'. So, each of those non-terminals needs to produce 't34'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does NT5 produce 't34'? Checking the productions: NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5 (which is two non-terminals), NT5 \u2192 NT2 NT7, and a few others. Wait, in the given grammar, there's NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5 and NT5 \u2192 NT2 NT7. Hmm. Alternatively, checking if any NTx produces 't34', like NT2 might produce 't34' because in the productions, NT6 \u2192 't34' and NT2 \u2192 't34' via NT9 \u2192 't34' possibly? Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT6 \u2192 't34' as a production. Also, NT2 might produce 't34' as well.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, yes, there is a production NT6 \u2192 't34' and a production NT2 \u2192 't34' (looking through the list, for example, NT2 \u2192 't34' is not directly present, but looking through all the productions, yes, there are NT2 that go to 't34' because one of the productions is NT2 \u2192 't34' (looking for \"t34\" in the grammar). Indeed, looking through the provided grammar, I see that NT2 \u2192 't34' is a production: \"NT2 --> t34\" or somewhere there?\n\nActually, in the given grammar, yes, looking at the productions, I can see NT6 \u2192 't34' is a production, and also NT2 \u2192 't34' is present. So both NT6 and NT2 can directly produce 't34'.\n\nSo, perhaps, NT5 can produce 't34' via NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT2, for example, and each of those can produce 't34' in one step. Wait, no, that's not direct. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when NT5 is derived, it might produce something else, but if the next part of the string is 't34', then we need NT5 to produce 't34' directly or through a combination that ends with 't34'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's simpler: after NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT7, we need NT5 and NT7 to produce the next symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step, trying to find a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the string to find if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string:\n\nt13 t34 t23 t22 t10 t42 t10 t12 t40 t70 t42 t13 t33 t34 t14 t12 t12 t12 t90 t40 t23 t65 t40 t88 t40 t30 t70 t37 t65 t65 t37 t88 t41 t13 t60 t88 t30 t60 t88 t34 t13 t23 t33 t65 t42 t25.\n\nFirst, the entire string must be produced by the start symbol S. So, S must expand into the entire string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can expand into NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let's see which one fits.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, 't13', which is produced by NT0, and then followed by more symbols. But S is a combination of non-terminals, so perhaps S must expand into two parts.\n\nWait, S is the start symbol, so any derivation must start from S. For example, S could first expand as NT3 \u2192 'something' followed by NT9 \u2192 't75'. Or NT2 \u2192 't34' followed by other options.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two productions: NT3 NT9 or NT2, etc. So to match the string starting with t13, perhaps one of the non-terminals after expanding from S starts with t13.\n\nBut looking at the productions for NT3 and NT2, do they derive t13? NT3 can derive 't30', for example, or others. NT2 can derive 't34', which would match the first 't34' in the string.\n\nWait, no, in the string, the first symbol is 't13', then 't34', etc. So perhaps the initial expansion from S is something that starts with t13, then t34.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial S must start with NT0, which can produce 't13' directly. So, S could expand into NT0 something, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, S can expand into NT3, but does NT3 produce 't13'? Looking through the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't30', for example, but not 't13'. So if S starts as NT3, the first symbol would be something else, so that might not fit.\n\nTherefore, perhaps S starts with NT9. Looking at the productions, NT9 can expand into 't75' or other non-terminals. But the string starts with 't13', so perhaps the first symbol comes from another production.\n\nWait, perhaps S expands into NT0 and NT9. Let's see: NT0 can produce 't13', and NT9 can produce 't75', but that doesn't fit with the string's first symbol being 't13' and second being 't34', unless NT9 produces something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S expands into NT9 and NT2. Let's see: NT9 could produce 't75', but the string starts with 't13', so that wouldn't work.\n\nWait, maybe S expands into NT3 and NT9 or NT2, and each part"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-898","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. The goal is to determine if the string can be generated by the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar structure. It looks like each production rule starts with a non-terminal and is rewritten into two non-terminals. That's Chomsky normal form, so that part checks out.\n\nNow, looking at the string: it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. I think each 't' is a terminal, so I'll need to see if each part of the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nI'll list the string parts to process:\nt14 t13 t10 t65 t65 t42 t14 t12 t22 t12 t99 t65 t60 t8 t12 t65 t34 t70 t13 t70 t60 t75 t40 t65 t70 t19 t23 t40 t52 t70 t75 t14 t99 t70 t23 t30 t91 t40 t8 t60 t8 t42 t52 t90 t13 t75.\n\nThat's quite a long string. I'll need to map each terminal to the non-terminals they come from. Let's look at the grammar rules to see where each 't' might come from.\n\nFrom the grammar, each rule seems to have specific terminals as their right-hand sides. For example, S -> NT3 NT9, and then NT3 and NT9 have their own rules. Each NT has a rule that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and trying to break it down into parts that match the grammar rules. I can approach this by trying to start from the top symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT3 NT9. So the string should start with NT3 followed by NT9. Let's check the string:\n\nFirst, 't14' must come from NT3. Looking at the rules for NT3, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2 (among others; but actually, checking all rules for NT3, the only rules are NT3 -> NT6 NT2 and NT3 -> NT0 NT7. Wait, let me confirm. In the grammar, under NT3, the rules are:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\n\nSo NT3 can be rewritten into NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. Now, 't14' is a terminal. Does any of these production rules result in 't14'? Let's look at each part of the rule:\n\nIf NT3 -> NT6 NT2, then 't14' would have to come from NT6 or NT2 after more productions. Similarly, if NT3 -> NT0 NT7, then 't14' would come from NT0 or NT7.\n\nWait, but looking further down, I see some terminals in other NTs:\n\nLike NT6 can go to NT8 NT4, etc., and some NTs have direct terminal outputs. For example, NT9 -> 't75', but that's a single terminal.\n\nSo perhaps I should track where the terminals come from. Let me make a list:\n\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT6 -> 't34'\n- NT1 -> 't25'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT5 -> 't91'\n- NT6 can also go to 't8' via NT6 -> NT8 NT4, but NT8 can become 't52'.\n- Similarly, NT3 can go to 't30' via NT3 -> NT6 NT2, but that's more steps.\n\nWait, let me check which NTs produce a single 't':\n\nLooking at all the NT rules, some of them have terminals listed as possible results. For example:\n\nNT8 -> 't52' (I think I see that at the very end of the grammar)\nNT0 -> 't13', 't34', etc.\nNT6 -> 't34', wait, in the list above, there's NT6 -> 't8' as one of the rules, but I also see NT6 -> NT8 NT4, and so on.\n\nWait, let me clarify each NT rule:\n\nFor each non-terminal, I need to see what terminals they can produce directly. So for example:\n\n- NT9 has a rule NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT8 has a rule NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT0 has rules like NT0 -> 't13', 't25' (from NT7), etc.\n\nSo for each 't' in the string, I'll check which non-terminal can produce that 't'.\n\nSo let me go step by step through the string, checking each terminal.\n\nStarting with the first part:\n\n1. t14: Must come from either NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. So either NT6 or NT0 produces t14, but looking at the rules I've listed, none of the NTs directly produce t14. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look more carefully. Let me check each NT rule again.\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\nNT1 has rules leading to t25, t40, etc.\nNT2 leads to 't33', 't65', etc.\nNT3 can go to t30 via 'NT3-> NT6 NT2' (if NT6 then NT8, etc.)\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me take it one step at a time.\n\nEach 't' must come from some NT. Let me check each 't' in the string and see which NT it can come from.\n\nt14: Looking through all the NT rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t14. So maybe t14 comes from a deeper production.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look through all NT rules for possible derivation paths that result in t14.\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\nFor example, let's see if any NT can lead to t14.\n\nLooking at NT6:\n\nNT6 rules include NT6 -> NT4 NT5, NT6 -> NT8 NT4, NT6 -> NT9 NT2, etc. None of these seem to directly produce t14.\n\nWhat about NT2:\n\nNT2 -> 't33', 't65', 't37', 't70', 't12', 't8', 't53', etc. (I see from the grammar that NT2 leads to 't33', 't65', 't37', 't70', 't12', 't8', 't53', but wait, looking more carefully: in the grammar list, I see NT2 has several rules, some of which are terminals.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking for nt2 rules that produce t14. From the grammar, I don't see NT2 directly leading to t14. Similarly, NT9 has a rule NT9->t75, but that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at all the NT rules and their terminals. Let's go through each NT and see which terminals they produce.\n\n1. NT1 -> 't25', 't40', 't04', 't19', 't23'\n\n2. NT2 -> 't33', 't65', 't37', 't70', 't12', 't8', 't53'\n\n3. NT3 -> 't30', 't62' (wait, looking at NT3's rules: NT3 has NT3 -> NT6 NT2 (twice?), and NT0 NT7. But do any NTs directly produce t30 or t62? Wait, NT3 can go to 't30' via NT3 -> NT6 NT2, but that's a two-step production, right? Because NT3 first becomes NT6 NT2, and then each of those can lead to further productions until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to process the string step by step, reducing from the start symbol S.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, this might be time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to check each 't' in the string and see if there's a path in the grammar that starts with S and ends with that 't'.\n\nWait, another approach: count the number of times a symbol appears in the string. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production step adds one symbol at a time. But that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the string as needing to be derived by S, considering each 't' as the result of some production. But this might be tricky without a step-by-step breakdown.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is constructed by starting with S->NT3 NT9.

{"custom_id":"request-917","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided with various production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. I've been told to end my response with 'Yes' or 'No', so I need to figure that out.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol which may appear on the right as well. This form helps in parsing and analyzing the grammar more easily.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and from there, we can see that each production rule either starts with S or another non-terminal, splitting into two parts. The first part of the string is already split into tokens, all of which seem to be numbers followed by letters, like 't37', 't75', etc. These are probably terminal symbols, which are the actual characters that make up the string.\n\nThe first step is to look at the string and see how it can be constructed using the given grammar. Since the string is quite long, with 39 tokens, it's going to be a bit time-consuming, but let's try to break it down.\n\nStarting with S -> NT3 NT9. So the string must start with NT3 followed by NT9. Looking at the string, the first token is 't37'. Does this correspond to NT3? Let's check the grammar rules for NT3.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT3 -> NT0 NT7. Hmm, that's a production rule, but does that mean NT3 can only become NT0 and NT7? So if NT3 is 't37', then I need to find where 't37' is generated. Looking through all the rules, I notice that some terminals are directly mapped by rules like NT6 -> 't34', NT8 -> 't52', etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't37', which isn't directly a terminal in the grammar. Let me check again. The terminal 't37' appears in several rules. For example, NT0 -> 't37' is not in the rules, but NT2 -> 't37' is one of the rules: NT2 -> t37. Similarly, NT6 -> 't34', and NT8 -> 't52', etc. But in the given string, I don't see 't37' as a terminal in the string. Wait, looking again: the string is `t37 t75 ...` Yes, the first token is 't37', but according to the grammar, 't37' is a terminal, and it's assigned to NT2. So to generate 't37', the production rule must be NT2 -> t37.\n\nSo, S -> NT3 NT9. Therefore, the first part should derive to NT3, which is 't37', and the second part, NT9, should derive to the second token in the string. Wait, no. Let me correct that. The string is the concatenation of symbols, so S generates two symbols: NT3 and NT9, which would appear as 't37' (if NT3 is 't37') followed by whatever NT9 is. But in the string, the first token is 't37', which is indeed NT3's terminal. Then the next token is 't75', which would be the terminal corresponding to NT9. Let's check if NT9 has 't75' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT9 has several production rules leading to terminals. Specifically, NT9 -> 't75' is a rule. So yes, NT9 can produce 't75'. Therefore, the first two tokens are matched by S -> NT3 NT9, which would produce 't37' 't75'.\n\nNow, moving to the next part of the string. The third token is 't14'. Let's see which non-terminal can produce 't14'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT4 has rules where 't88' is a terminal, but 't14' isn't directly mapped. However, perhaps 't14' is the result of some production. Wait, let's check the rules for NT0: NT0 has a rule 't13', so 't14' must come from another NT. Looking deeper, NT2 -> 't37' is one of its rules, but 't14' isn't listed. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production rules for some non-terminals allow for combinations that result in these tokens. Since this is getting complicated, maybe a better approach is to see if the string is reducible under the given grammar, step by step.\n\nStarting with S->NT3 NT9:\n\n1. NT3 -> NT0 NT7: So the string becomes t37 followed by NT0 NT7 followed by NT9.\n\nLooking at the string after 't37', the next tokens are 't75', 't14', etc.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string from the beginning, seeing how each part can be generated from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is long, maybe it would be more efficient to see if any of the non-terminal rules can directly match the starting tokens, but that might require breaking down the string into possible derivations.\n\nLet's think differently: The string starts with 't37 t75 t14 ...'\n\nWe know that S->NT3 NT9, so NT3 is 't37', NT9 is 't75'. So after S, we have both of these tokens, which are the first two symbols. Now, the rest of the string must be derived from the intermediate symbols after S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, after S, we have NT3 and NT9. Let's expand NT3 and NT9.\n\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7. So after 't37', NT3 becomes NT0 NT7. Now, the string is 't37 t75 t14 t19...' So after 't37 t75', we have 't14', which must be derived from NT0 or NT7.\n\nWait, but NT0 is a non-terminal and can produce 't13' as a terminal. Maybe 't14' is derived from NT0 somehow, but 't14' isn't directly a terminal of NT0. Let me check all the rules for non-terminals that can produce 't14'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't14'. Wait, checking the rules:\n\n- NT8 -> 't52', 't37', etc., but not 't14'.\n- NT6 -> 't34', 't90', etc.\n- NT2 -> 't37', 't65', etc.\n- NT4 -> 't88', 't40', etc.\n- NT9 has 't75' as a terminal rule, and other non-terminals.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. So perhaps 't14' isn't directly a terminal in the grammar. Did I miss any?\n\nWait, looking again: in the grammar, I see NT9 -> 't75' as one of the rules. But no NT has 't14' directly. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the initial parse.\n\nLet me go back. If the first two tokens are 't37' and 't75', and they correspond to NT3 and NT9, which is correct. Then, the next token is 't14', which must come from expanding one of the non-terminals that were produced after S.\n\nSo after S, we have NT3 -> NT0 NT7, so the current string after substitution is 't37' 't75' (from NT9) followed by NT0 and NT7. Now, the next part of the string is 't14 t19...'\n\nSo, 't14' must be a terminal produced by either NT0 or NT7 or some other non-terminal in a deeper expansion.\n\nWait, maybe we can look for a production that gives 't14' as a result of some combination. Let me check if any rules can derive 't14'.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, most seem to produce more non-terminals, but perhaps through multiple steps. Maybe 't14' is the result of expanding NT0 or NT7.\n\nLooking at NT0, it has multiple production rules. For example, NT0 -> NT1 NT3, NT2 -> NT7 NT7, etc. But none of these directly produce 't14'. Let's see:\n\nNT0: NT0 -> NT1 NT3, NT2 -> NT7 NT7, NT1 -> NT8 NT4, etc. So to produce 't14', let's see if any of these rules can generate 't14' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps 't14' is a result of expanding NT4, which has a rule NT4 -> NT2 NT1. Let me check if NT4 can produce 't1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-918","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the problem and the tools I can use.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, each possibly corresponding to a production rule's right-hand side.\n\nThe string to check is: `t75 t25 t8 t34 t70 t25 t19 t70 t34 t19 t91 t34 t40 t99 t75 t33 t40 t10 t33 t90 t41 t65 t34 t88 t8 t88 t30 t8 t41 t40 t13 t41 t30 t25 t60 t25 t41 t75 t41 t13 t75 t90 t60 t42 t13 t75 t12`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I have a bunch of production rules that generate terminals. My job is to see if this string can be derived by applying these rules step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use a stack-based approach or a recursive descent parser. Alternatively, I can model this as a traversal of the grammar's parse tree, where each non-terminal's expansion corresponds to one of its production rules.\n\nGiven the string length of ~35 tokens, I need to break it down into smaller parts that match the possible productions.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules first to see which non-terminals generate which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', 't8', 't37', etc. So NT2 can produce multiple terminals.\nWait, let me list some terminals more carefully:\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I notice that many produce specific terminals. For example:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13', 't34', 't40', 't60', etc.\n- NT1 \u2192 't25', 't40', etc.\n- NT2 has multiple 't' strings, like t25, t33, t34, t8, t88, t37, etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't30', etc.\n- NT4 has t40, t42, etc.\n- NT5 has various 't's.\n- NT6 has t8, t34, etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't10', 't40', etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 't25', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 t37, t40, etc.\n\nEach of these terminals can be produced by certain non-terminals. So the strategy would be to check if the string can be split into substrings, each of which matches one of these non-terminals' productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the parse would involve replacing a non-terminal with exactly two other elements. So the string being generated would consist of these non-terminals being expanded into two symbols at a time.\n\nBut given that the string is long, I might need to identify the possible structures by matching the given string against possible combinations of the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can start by trying to parse the string step by step, applying the grammar rules.\n\nGiven the start symbol is S, which can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, hold on. Looking at the start symbol S:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\nS \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo S must be split into two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals can then be further expanded.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part of the string is 't75 t25 t8...'. I need to match this against possible expansions.\n\nLet me try to see if 't75 t25 t8...' starts with any production. Since S is S1 S2, where S1 and S2 are non-terminals, each S1 and S2 will need to produce sequences starting with 't75 t25 t8...'.\n\nWait, but when S is expanded as S1 S2, the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of S1 and S2. So the string should be matched as S1's expansion followed by S2's expansion.\n\nSo for S to generate the string, 't75 t25 t8 t34 t70 t25 t19 t70 t34 t19 t91 t34 t40 t99 t75 t33 t40 t10 t33 t90 t41 t65 t34 t88 t8 t88 t30 t8 t41 t40 t13 t41 t30 t25 t60 t25 t41 t75 t41 t13 t75 t90 t60 t42 t13 t75 t12' must be split into two parts generated by S1 and S2, where S is S1 S2.\n\nSo let me see what S1 and S2 can be.\n\nLooking at the production options:\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nSo S1 is NT3, S2 is NT9.\n\nOr Case 2: S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo S1 is NT3, S2 is NT2.\n\nI'll try both cases.\n\nLet's try Case 1: S1 is NT3, S2 is NT9.\n\nNow, I need to check if the string starts with NT3's expansion followed by NT9's expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 has the production rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT4\nNT3 \u2192 NT2 NT5\nNT3 \u2192 NT9 (among others? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nFor NT3, do I see a direct production to a terminal? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT3 \u2192 terminal. All seem to be S rules or NT leading to other NTs except NT0\u2192't13' via productions.\n\nWait, perhaps looking again:\n\nLooking at NT3's production rules:\n\nFrom the given grammar, under NT3, the production is:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT4\nNT3 \u2192 NT2 NT5\nNT3 \u2192 NT9 (Wait, I think I might have misread. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 has the rule 'NT3 -> NT6 NT2' and others, but does it have a direct terminal production? Checking the full list, I don't see any rule where NT3 directly goes to a terminal. So NT3 can only produce sequences of two non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, S1 can't directly produce a terminal. Similarly, S2 would be either NT9 or NT2, neither of which seem to have terminal productions.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me look again. Maybe I was too hasty. Let me check all the NT rules to see if any produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't34', for example, under NT6: NT6 \u2192 't8', 't37', etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT0's rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't13', 't34', 't40', etc. So NT0 can produce terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 \u2192 't25', 't40', etc.\n\nNT2: multiple terminals, so NT2 can produce terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT3: I don't see any direct productions to terminals. So NT3 can only produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, this is crucial. So S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nIf S is split into S1 NT3 and S2 NT9 or NT2, then both S1 and S2 must be non-terminals because NT3 can only produce non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, S2 would be NT9 or NT2. Let's see the possible productions for NT9 and NT2.\n\nNT9 has several production rules, including some that produce terminals. For example, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't75' and others like 't91', etc. So NT9 can produce 't75' as a terminal.\n\nSo perhaps in this case, the string starts with 't75', which could be NT9 directly. So if the expansion of S is NT3 NT9, and the string starts with 't75', that could fit if the expansion of NT9 is 't75'.\n\nWait, so in S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the first symbol would be the result of NT3's expansion. But NT3's all productions lead to non-terminals. So the first symbol, 't75', must come from NT9's first symbol, which would mean that the expansion would have to have the terminal 't75' as the first symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-939","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol, which might have a single terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string to determine what language it's from. The string is: `t22 t91 t34 t19 t52 t12 t70 t14 t75 t88 t52 t8 t25 t99 t65 t33 t37 t41 t10 t99 t99 t37 t91 t40 t25 t10 t8 t25 t60 t90 t22 t30 t91 t25 t12 t22 t65 t25 t70 t42 t22 t22 t91 t25 t65 t25 t75 t34`. \n\nIt looks like it's a sequence of tokens where each token seems to be a two-digit number followed by 't', but I notice some tokens are three letters like 't91' and 't40', while others are two letters. Wait, no, actually all are two letters, like 't22', 't91', etc., so each token is 't' followed by two digits. That could be important.\n\nNow, the grammar has all the production rules ending with terminals, except some might be non-terminals, but I think in CNTF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A is a non-terminal, and B and C can be either terminals or non-terminals. Wait, but in this case, I don't see any non-terminals except for the starting symbol S, which is being expanded into other non-terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, like S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so S is a start symbol, and then NT3 and NT9 are other non-terminals. \n\nThe string provided is a list of terminals, so each token in the string is a terminal. So the question is, can the grammar derive this sequence of terminals step by step? \n\nTo approach this, I can use the concept of parse trees. Each parse tree would expand the non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain. But since the string is quite long, it's impractical to build a parse tree manually, so I need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother way is to model the grammar as a CFG and use the CYK algorithm or other parsing algorithms, but since I'm working manually, I'll try to find patterns or derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that NT8, NT9, NT3, etc., all derive into combinations of NTs and some tokens. So each production is replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals, except the ones that substitute into terminals, like NT8 \u2192 't52', meaning when NT8 appears, it can be replaced by 't52'. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't75' and others. \n\nSo if I can trace back each 't' in the string and see if there's a path in the grammar that can generate that 't', but more than that, it's about the sequence. \n\nWait, maybe I should start from the string and see if each part is covered by the grammar's productions. \n\nLet me break down the string into parts. The string is: \n\nt22 t91 t34 t19 t52 t12 t70 t14 t75 t88 t52 t8 t25 t99 t65 t33 t37 t41 t10 t99 t99 t37 t91 t40 t25 t10 t8 t25 t60 t90 t22 t30 t91 t25 t12 t22 t65 t25 t70 t42 t22 t22 t91 t25 t65 t25 t75 t34\n\nEach 't' is followed by two digits. Now, looking at the grammar, each non-terminal can lead to certain terminals or other non-terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 't52', so if we have 't52' in the string, it can be generated by NT8.\n\nLooking at the string, there are several 't52's. Let me check if that's possible. Since NT8 can derive 't52', then any occurrence of 't52' in the string must be preceded by an NT8 that produces it.\n\nBut in the string, after some other terms, we have t52, t52, t52 in parts. For example, t88 comes before t52. So I need to see if 't88' and 't52' can be connected through the grammar.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar rules for NT8: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8, or NT4 NT8, or NT2 NT2 (but I think in the rules above, some are missing, but from the provided rules, NT8 has several productions to other NTs. For example, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8, NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT1, etc.\n\nWait, looking closely at the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 has several rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n\nWait, but in the provided rules, there are more variations, like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8, etc.\n\nBut each NT8 can also be a terminal when certain productions apply. Looking at the given rules, yes, several NTs end with terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 't52' (if I'm looking at the end, it should be NT8 \u2192 't52', right? Let me check the end:\n\nLooking at the rules, the last are:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't88'\n\nWait, no, looking through the provided rules, for example, NT8 \u2192 't52' is present: \n\nAt the end, it says:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't52'\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the given rules have:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't52'?\n\nWait, let me scan through the provided rules:\n\nLooking for NTx \u2192 't...', I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't34'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't37'\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, that's in the middle of the provided rules, so NT8 \u2192 't37' is one rule, and in other places, like:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't91'\n\nBTW, I'm seeing NT9 has multiple terminals, like 't22', 't91', etc.\n\nWait, let me find all rules where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't65'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't37'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't40'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't37'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't90'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't70'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't41'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't88'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't22'\n\nWait, that's all the terminal rules I can find. So each of these rules can only produce specific terminal strings.\n\nSo if a string contains a token like 't22', it must be produced by NT9 \u2192 't22'. Similarly, 't91' must come from NT5 \u2192 't91', etc.\n\nNow, let's check the string for any such tokens that are not in the terminal list. Wait, every token in the string is present in the terminal list. For example, 't22', 't91', 't34', etc., are all covered by some NT rule. So first, the string can be produced by the grammar because all terminals are covered.\n\nBut the problem is, the order in which they appear matters. They must form a correct sequence as per the grammar's pushdown process.\n\nSo for the string to be a valid derivation, the terminal symbols must correspond to a left- or right-most expansion. Since it's ambiguous, perhaps, but let's see.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, we're using leftmost derivations.\n\nEach step replaces the left-most non-terminal.\n\nSo, I can approach this by trying to find a way to decompose the string into a series of such steps.\n\nBut given the length of the string, this may not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to look for any tokens in the string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-942","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CFGs can be a bit tricky, but I remember that CNF has specific characteristics, like each production rule having exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the start symbol is S, and the productions all seem to follow the two symbols on the right, except for S->NT3 NT9 and S->NT3 NT2, which both have two non-terminals, so that fits. Also, there are special cases where non-terminals are replaced directly by terminals, like NT9 -> 't37', etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' followed by numbers. The string is: t37 t23 t8 t52 t41 t33 t88 t22 t23 t22 t8 t70 t88 t12 t91 t37 t99 t90 t75 t14 t19 t30 t40 t37 t19 t8 t34 t41 t30 t40 t60 t19 t42 t19 t33 t14 t75 t99 t70 t88 t75 t90 t30 t14 t34 t90 t42 t23.\n\nOkay, so the first thing I should do is parse the string from left to right, trying to find the correct sequence of productions that generate it. Since it's a CFG in CNF, parsing can be done using the CYK algorithm, but manually, I might try a recursive descent approach or look for possible parse trees.\n\nAlternatively, since each production has at most two non-terminals on the right, for each production, it might help to look for possible decompositions.\n\nFirst, I should check if the string starts with any terminal symbols that directly come from the start symbol.\n\nWait, the start symbol S tends to produce NT3 and another non-terminal, so S-> NT3 NT9 or S->NT3 NT2. Looking at the string, the first symbols are t37, which is a terminal. So let's see if the first part can be generated by some NT.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, I see NT9 -> 't37', which matches the first symbol t37. That would mean that the first part is generated by NT9. Let's look at NT9's productions. Scanning through, I see NT9 can go to NT1 NT5, or 't37'. So possibility: NT9 -> 't37'. But wait, that's an option. So the first symbol is generated directly by NT9.\n\nSo the string starts with t37, which is directly from NT9. So after NT9, we have the rest of the string: t23 t8 t52 t41 t33 t88 t22 t23 t22 t8 t70 t88 t12 t91 t37 t99 t90 t75 t14 t19 t30 t40 t37 t19 t8 t34 t41 t30 t40 t60 t19 t42 t19 t33 t14 t75 t99 t70 t88 t75 t90 t30 t14 t34 t90 t42 t23.\n\nSo the first step is that NT9 -> 't37', so we take off the first symbol, and now the rest of the string is 't23 t8 t52 t41 t33 t88 t22 ...' up to the last symbol.\n\nNow, what's after NT9? The rules for NT9: NT9 -> NT1 NT5 or NT1 NT3 (wait, let me check: looking through the rules, I see NT9 -> NT1 NT5, NT9 -> 't37', but not NT9 -> NT1 NT3. So that's not correct. Wait, the rules:\n\nLooking for NT9:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT9 -> 't37'\n\nSo NT9 can produce either 't37' or NT1 NT5. The first symbol is 't37', which we've consumed, so now we have to parse the remaining string as the result of NT9 -> NT1 NT5. So the next step is to see if NT9 produces NT1 and NT5, meaning that the rest of the string is generated by NT1 followed by NT5.\n\nBut wait, after the first symbol, the rest of the string is the production of NT9 -> NT1 NT5, so the next symbols should be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT1 and NT5.\n\nSo the next part is: t23 t8 t52 t41 t33 t88 t22 t23 t22 t8 t70 t88 t12 t91 t37 t99 t90 t75 t14 t19 t30 t40 t37 t19 t8 t34 t41 t30 t40 t60 t19 t42 t19 t33 t14 t75 t99 t70 t88 t75 t90 t30 t14 t34 t90 t42 t23.\n\nSo let's split this into two parts: the production from NT1 and NT5. Let's see, the next non-terminal to parse would be NT1. So we need to parse the first part into NT1 and then the next part into NT5.\n\nWait, but NT1's rules: let me check them.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT1 can go to NT4 NT8, NT1 -> NT8 NT4, NT1 -> NT3 NT7, NT1 -> NT6 NT7, NT1 -> NT7 NT5, NT1 -> NT0 NT4, NT1 -> NT4 NT0, etc. So there are multiple options. I need to find which one fits.\n\nThe first symbols after 't37' are 't23', which is a terminal. Let's see if any of NT1's productions can produce 't23' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT1's options:\n\nNT1 -> NT4 NT8\nNT1 -> NT8 NT4\nNT1 -> NT3 NT7\nNT1 -> NT6 NT7\nNT1 -> NT7 NT5\nNT1 -> NT0 NT4\nNT1 -> NT4 NT0\nNT1 -> NT2 NT2\nNT1 -> NT5 NT0\nNT1 -> NT0 NT4\nNT1 -> NT7 NT5\nNT1 -> NT9 NT8\nNT1 -> NT4 NT0\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me see all NT1's rules:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT1 -> NT4 NT8\nNT1 -> NT8 NT4\nNT1 -> NT3 NT7\nNT1 -> NT6 NT7\nNT1 -> NT7 NT5\nNT1 -> NT0 NT4\nNT1 -> NT4 NT0\nNT1 -> NT2 NT2\nNT1 -> NT5 NT0\nNT1 -> NT0 NT4\nNT1 -> NT7 NT5\nNT1 -> NT9 NT8\nNT1 -> NT4 NT0\nWait, I see multiple entries for NT1, but I think in the given list, some may have been duplicates but perhaps written multiple times. So looking through, for example:\n\nNT1 -> NT4 NT8 (multiple entries but same rule)\nNT1 -> NT8 NT4\nNT1 -> NT3 NT7\nNT1 -> NT6 NT7\nNT1 -> NT7 NT5\nNT1 -> NT0 NT4\nNT1 -> NT4 NT0\nNT1 -> NT2 NT2\nNT1 -> NT5 NT0\nNT1 -> NT0 NT4\nNT1 -> NT7 NT5\nNT1 -> NT9 NT8\nNT1 -> NT4 NT0\nNT1 -> NT2 NT2\nNT1 -> NT5 NT0\nNT1 -> NT7 NT5\nWait, perhaps some duplicates but same rules. So, the first production option for NT1 is NT4 NT8. The terminal 't23' is the next in the string. So does any rule for NT1 start with 't23'? Looking at the non-terminals, I see NT1 can produce NT5 NT0, which would go further. But none directly produce 't23' as a terminal except through NT9, but that's already processed.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a production where NT1 directly leads to a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see that NT1 is part of the productions that take two non-terminals, so it doesn't directly produce any terminals. Wait, no, in the given grammar, all rules have two non-terminals on the right.

{"custom_id":"request-955","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, context-free grammars (CFGs) are defined by rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side can consist of any combination of terminals and non-terminals. Chomsky Normal Form specifically requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. So, looking at the rules provided, it seems they're indeed in Chomsky Normal Form because each rule either has two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the task is to check if the given string is part of the language defined by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Wait, but in CFGs, the language is made up of terminal symbols, and the non-terminals are placeholders for other symbols. So, whenever we see a non-terminal symbol in the string, we must make sure that it can be replaced according to the grammar rules until only terminals remain, and the entire string matches the constructed sequence.\n\nLooking at the string: t91 t75 t91 t52 t41 t25 t75 t65 t22 t42 t70 t99 t14 t91 t25 t14 t99 t60 t90 t37 t13 t34 t25 t23 t8 t8 t37 t13 t52 t13 t88 t19 t25 t70 t14 t34 t91 t25 t40 t34 t88 t33 t37 t23 t91 t30 t60 t10 t91. \n\nWait, let me count the tokens. That's quite a long string... I see over 60 tokens, but some of them are non-terminals since the replacements involve symbols like S, NT0, NT1, etc. Oh, no, wait\u2014the replacements in the rules are all non-terminals, except when they're replaced by terminals like 't's. So each token in the string could be a terminal or a non-terminal that needs expansion. But in this case, the string seems to consist of uppercase letters 'T' followed by numbers, which might all be terminals. Wait, no\u2014actually, I need to check if these are terminals or if any could be non-terminals based on the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, all the symbols that aren't terminals are non-terminals, like S, NT0, NT1, etc. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t30, t40, t52, etc. So in the string, any token that's of the form tX (like t91, t75, etc.) is a terminal. The rest, like NT0, NT1, etc., are non-terminals that can be expanded.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, all the symbols are like t91, t75, etc., so the entire string is a sequence of terminals. Therefore, to determine if this string is generated by the grammar, we need to see if there's a derivation starting from S, expanding non-terminals into other symbols, and eventually the entire string of terminals is produced.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two symbols or a single terminal. So, the strategy to check if the string is produced by the grammar could involve parsing the string from left to right, using the grammar to see if it can generate this exact sequence.\n\nHowever, CFGs can generate complex dependency structures, so a simple left-to-right parsing might not suffice. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to construct a leftmost derivation starting from S and see if I can build the given string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first few symbols: t91, t75, t91, t52, t41, etc. The starting symbol is S, which has the rule S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNow, NT3 has a production rule. Looking it up: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So NT3 is replaced by NT6 and NT2. Now, NT6 can go to NT9 and NT2. So NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2.\n\nSo now the string is becoming NT9 NT2 NT9 NT52... Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think differently. Instead of expanding all the way, maybe I can try to match the string to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each non-terminal should expand into a sequence of terminals, and the overall string should be a combination of these expansions. So, let me map which non-terminals can expand to which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each non-terminal can be mapped to certain terminals based on their production rules. But some non-terminals seem to have multiple production rules, so they can expand into different sequences.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is that the given string is a series of 't's followed by numbers. Each of these could correspond to terminals in the grammar, so the non-terminals must expand into sequences that form this string when all non-terminals are expanded.\n\nSo, the overall approach could be:\n\n1. Identify non-terminals in the grammar and what terminals they can expand into.\n2. See if the given string can be built by expanding non-terminals step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Another approach is to model this as a derivation: starting from S, apply production rules until you get all terminals, and see if the string matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct the right sentential form by expanding S and see if the entire token list matches.\n\nLet's try to build the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the string is T(NT3) T(NT9). NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So now we have NT6 NT2 NT9.\n\nThen, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2. So now NT9 NT2 NT2 NT9.\n\nWait, this seems confusing. Let's take it step by step.\n\nExpanding S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNow, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So replacing NT3, the string becomes NT6 NT2 NT9.\n\nNext, expand NT6 (from NT3's production):\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2.\n\nSo now the string is NT9 NT2 NT2 NT9.\n\nWait, but this seems to be getting longer, but the original string is a specific sequence. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar by applying various rules step by step. Since the string is quite long, this could take a while, but let's try.\n\nFirst, break down the string into tokens:\n\nt91, t75, t91, t52, t41, t25, t75, t65, t22, t42, t70, t99, t14, t91, t25, t14, t99, t60, t90, t37, t13, t34, t25, t23, t8, t8, t37, t13, t52, t13, t88, t19, t25, t70, t14, t34, t91, t25, t40, t34, t88, t33, t37, t23, t91, t30, t60, t10, t91.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I notice that each non-terminal can produce certain terminals. For example, look up where tX are defined:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13', 't25', 't40', etc.\n- NT1 \u2192 't25', 't40', 't70', etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', 't37', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't60', etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal can only expand into a specific terminal. So, maybe each non-terminal is associated with a particular terminal. Let's check.\n\nLooking for all rules that directly produce a terminal:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't13', 't25', 't37', 't40', 't52', 't60', 't65', 't88', 't90', 't91', etc.\nNT1 \u2192 't25', 't40', 't70', 't75', 't88', 't91', 't99', 't22', etc.\nNT2 \u2192 't22', 't23', 't33', 't37', etc.\nNT3 \u2192 't30', 't37', etc.\nNT4 \u2192 't42', etc.\nNT5 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I've got a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and a string that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t75 t52 t42 t37 t37`... wait, actually, the string is quite long. Let me count the tokens to make sure I don't miss any.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grams given. The grammar is in CNF, meaning every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the top-level productions, the only starts are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So the string must start with either 't30' (from NT3) and then 't90' (from NT9), or 't30' (from NT3) and then 't52' (from NT2). Wait, let me check the productions for NT9 and NT2.\n\nLooking at NT9 \u2192 NT2 NT9 as a production, but in the terminal list, NT9 \u2192 't75' is present, so it can be derived as 't75'. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't33'. So if the string starts with 't75', that would come from NT9. Alternatively, if it started with 't52', that would come from NT2.\n\nBut the string starts with 't75', which is from NT9, so it must be generated via the S \u2192 NT3 NT9 path. So the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNow, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and in the terminals, NT6 \u2192 't8' and NT2 \u2192 't33'. So NT3 would produce 't8' followed by 't33', making 't8 t33'. So the string should start with 't8 t33'. But wait, the string starts with 't75 t52 t60...'. That doesn't match. Because 't75' is from NT9, but if S is using NT3 NT9, then NT3 must be deriving to 't8 t33'. So the string shouldn't start with 't75 t52' unless there's another path.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me write down the string again:\n\nt75 t52 t60 t42 t33 t37 t33 t34 t14 t30 t75 t90 t42 t70 t70 t75 t75 t30 t34 t40 t19 t65 t88 t65 t8 t22 t34 t37 t65 t8 t33 t25 t14 t19 t42 t30 t33 t22 t33 t22 t75 t99 t90 t70 t14 t90 t14 t60 t22.\n\nWait, the initial two tokens are t75 and t52. Let's see where 't75' comes from. Looking at the terminals, NT9 \u2192 't75', so in the S \u2192 NT3 NT9 path, NT3 must derive to 't8 t33' (from NT6 \u2192 't8' and NT2 \u2192 't33'). But that would only give us 't8 t33', not 't75 t52'.\n\nAlternatively, if the start was S \u2192 NT3 NT2, which gives us 't8 t33' as well. So the initial tokens should be 't8 t33', but the string starts with 't75 t52', which doesn't fit. So is the string even possible?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check the productions again for NT3. NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, which in turns produce 't8 t33'. So NT3 can only produce 't8 t33' as per its rules. Therefore, the first two tokens in the string must be 't8 t33', but the string starts with 't75 t52', which is incompatible.\n\nSo unless there's another production for NT3 that I'm missing. Let me check all the productions for NT3. Scanning through, I see NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and in terminals, it's also possible that NT3 could produce other things. Wait, looking back, under NT3: 'NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2' is the only production. There's no direct terminal production, only through NT6 and NT2, which produce 't8' and 't33', respectively.\n\nSo the first two tokens should be 't8 t33', but the string starts with 't75 t52'. So the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nWait, unless I messed up which NT produces which. Let me double-check. NT9 leads to 't75', and NT2 to 't33'. So if the string starts with 't75 t52', then perhaps the initial part is NT9 producing 't75' followed by something else. But the S starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Both NT3 and NT9 start with NT3 as 't8 t33' or NT2 as 't33'.

Wait, the string starts with t75 t75, so the first symbol is t75, which likely comes from NT7. So the first token is NT7. Let's see what the first rule for NT7 is. The first production for NT7 is NT5 NT4, but wait, I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, in the grammar, NT7's production is given as NT7 -> NT5 NT4, right? Let me check.\n\nYes, looking back, the grammar for NT7 is:\n\nNT7 -> NT5 NT4\n\nSo, if NT7 is producing t75, that would mean that NT7 is using the first production, which is NT5 and NT4. But wait, the string starts with t75 t75. So perhaps the breakdown is more like starting with NT7, which breaks into NT5 and NT4, but NT5 and NT4 would each produce some terminal?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Sorry, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, the string starts with t75 t75. That would mean that the first NT7 is generating t75, but according to the grammar, NT7 has to produce a combination of two non-terminals. So how does NT7 produce t75? Because the only way NT7 would be able to produce t75 is through some internal rule that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking back, I think the grammar has some terminals. For example, in the given rules, there's a NT6 -> 't34', so NT6 can produce t34. Similarly, NT7 has rules that produce 't40' and 't52'. Wait, wait, looking through the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at each production rule, some of them are like NT7 -> NT6 NT8, but some have productions that are terminals. For example, are there any rules where NT7 directly produces a terminal? Let me scan:\n\nNT7 -> NT6 NT8\nNT7 has no direct productions to terminals; all its productions are to other non-terminals. The same goes for other NT's.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check: the grammar rules are given, and some of them are like NT6 -> 't8', which are terminals. So, NT6 can produce 't8' as a terminal. Similarly, NT3 -> 't30', etc.\n\nSo, in the grammar, there are many non-terminals that can produce terminals at the base level.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\nNT1 -> 't25'\nNT2 -> 't33' etc.\n\nSo, each of these is a production that a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo, to generate the string, we have to see if it can be built by applying these production rules.\n\nSo, the first step is to see how the string can be broken down into the non-terminals.\n\nStarting with the string: t75 t75 t10 t88 t12 t13 t10 t19 t99 t42 t91 t88 t10 t30 t33 t34 t88 t33 t30 t91 t12 t30 t34 t23 t52 t42 t19 t60 t88 t40 t34 t34 t42 t19 t91 t40 t10 t30 t10 t99 t23 t52 t13 t25 t90 t60 t40 t60 t65 t30.\n\nLet me write down the sequence of symbols: [t75, t75, t10, t88, t12, t13, t10, t19, t99, t42, t91, t88, t10, t30, t33, t34, t88, t33, t30, t91, t12, t30, t34, t23, t52, t42, t19, t60, t88, t40, t34, t34, t42, t19, t91, t40, t10, t30, t10, t99, t23, t52, t13, t25, t90, t60, t40, t60, t65, t30].\n\nThis is quite long, so maybe I can look for patterns or rules that produce this.\n\nFirst, let's see the initial t75 t75. So, these two t75's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, where do t75's come from?\n\nIn the rules, we see that NT7 can produce 't40' and 't52' as terminals, but t75 might come from NT7's rules. Wait, no. Looking at the grammar rules, NT7's productions are:\n\nNT7 -> NT5 NT4\nNT7 -> NT0 NT8\nNT7 -> NT1 NT0\nNT7 -> NT7 NT5\n\nHmm, none of these directly produce a terminal like t75. So maybe t75 comes from some other rule.\n\nWait, looking at NT9 rules: NT9 has several productions, but none of them seem to produce 't75'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S and NT3 NT9, so the string is a combination of NT3 and NT9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step, breaking it into possible NT rules.\n\nLet me consider each symbol in the string and see how it can be broken down into non-terminals.\n\nStarting with t75: since NT7's productions don't directly produce t75, maybe t75 comes from another rule. Wait, looking at the grammar, some other rules might combine to produce t75. Alternatively, perhaps t75 is part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, let me think about the grammar again. Maybe t75 could be part of a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t75 is the result of a longer expansion from some non-terminal. Let's say, for example, if we have a non-terminal that can derive to t75 through a chain of productions.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see any direct rule for producing t75 except perhaps in the combinations. Wait, no, looking through the grammar, I don't see a production where, say, NT7 directly produces 't75'. Wait, so t75 must come from a more complex chain.\n\nWait, for example, if"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-979","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. That's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific rules. Every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol isn't allowed to be a terminal. The grammar provided seems to follow this structure, so that's good.\n\nThe given grammar has variables NT0 to NT9 and some terminals like 't37', 't52', etc. The string we need to evaluate is a series of these terms: `t37 t52 t10 ...` (and so on). The goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n2. S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo any string generated by S must start with the first two symbols from either of these productions.\n\nThe string starts with 't37 t52 t10 ...'. The first part is 't37 t52', which looks like the two symbols after S. So let's check what S can produce.\n\nFrom the first production of S: NT3 and NT9. From the grammar, what do NT3 and NT9 produce?\n\nChecking the productions:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n\nSo, the first step for the first production would be 't37' (since NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and looking at NT6 \u2192 't8'? Wait, no, the grammar seems to have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, let me cross-check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions are given as rules with non-terminals on the left and have terminals on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT3, etc. So the actual terminals are given in some rules. For instance, looking at the rules, some non-terminals like NT3, NT8, etc., have productions that result in terminals. Other non-terminals have more complex productions.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some rules directly produce terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 't75' is one of the rules. So terminal symbols are concrete, while others are non-terminals that need to be expanded further.\n\nSo, let's clarify the initial expansion. The string starts with 't37', so let's see if NT3 can produce a terminal that would precede 't52'.\n\nWait, looking back, from the grammar:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't8' is one of the rules. So NT6 can be a terminal 't8'.\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Now, if we substitute NT6 with 't8' and NT2 with what? Let's see NT2's productions:\n\nNT2 has several productions, for example, NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7, which would produce more NT7s, and so on. Alternatively, NT2 can produce terminals like 't33' and 't37' depending on specific rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT2 \u2192 't37'\n\nSo yes, NT2 can directly produce 't33' or 't37'.\n\nSo, the production of NT3 is NT6 NT2. Let's substitute NT6 as 't8' and NT2 as 't37' (for example). So this would give us 't8 t37'.\n\nBut in our string, after the first 't37', we have 't52'. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm confusing NT3's production. Let's see:\n\nWait, NT3's first production is NT6 NT2. And in the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't8' is one rule. So if NT6 is expanded to 't8', then NT3 \u2192 't8' followed by NT2. Now, looking at the string, after 't37', the next term is 't52', which is one of NT8's productions. Wait, but NT3 isn't directly connected to NT8 in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nThe initial step: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Let's pick that as the first production for S, giving us symbols NT3 and NT9.\n\nSo, after expanding S, the string starts with whatever NT3 produces followed by NT9's production.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\n1. NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n2. (Others? Wait, let me check the grammar again.)\n\nLooking through the grammar, after the initial entries:\n\nYes, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 is the only production for NT3 in the given rules. So NT3 must produce NT6 NT2.\n\nNow, let's take the first symbols:\n\nThe string starts with 't37', so perhaps NT3 \u2192 't37'?\n\nWait no, NT3 is a non-terminal that expands to NT6 NT2. So we need to check what NT6 and NT2 expand to.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT6:\n\nYes, NT6 \u2192 't8'. That's one of the productions. So NT6 can directly produce 't8'. Then, for NT2:\n\nNT2 has several productions that produce terminals, such as:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT2 \u2192 't37'\n- NT2 \u2192 't52' (Wait, is there a 't52' rule for NT2? Let me check.)\n\nLooking through, I don't see NT2 \u2192 't52' directly. Let me check the provided rules.\n\nLooking in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- And others... Wait, I don't see any NT2 producing 't52' directly. So 't52' must come from another production.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't37 t52...'. So, is it possible that the expansion could go through NT9?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Let's check the alternative production for S: S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, no, the string starts with 't37', which might be produced by S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Because NT3 is a non-terminal that can maybe produce 't37' after some expansion. Let me see.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to map the initial steps.\n\nThe string is: t37 t52 t10 t8 t34 t42 t22 t41 t70 t22 t12 t88 t91 t70 t70 t52 t75 t88 t75 t90 t33 t25 t22 t70 t90 t90 t90 t30 t13 t22 t23 t25 t12 t14 t75 t90 t37 t91 t34 t19 t10 t13 t99 t70 t34 t60 t40 t75 t13 t23.\n\nWait, let me check the start symbol S. S can be NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let's see what those lead to.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nSo, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 (from production 1). Then, NT6 \u2192 't8', and NT2 \u2192 can produce several things. Let's see:\n\nIf NT2 \u2192 't37', then the initial part would be 't8 t37'. But the string starts with 't37 t52', which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way for NT3 and NT9 to produce 't37 t52'? Let's see:\n\nWait, after NT3 expands to 't8' and 't37'... Wait, no, NT3 expands to NT6 and NT2, not to the terminals directly unless NT6 and NT2 can produce the terminals.\n\nSo, in the first expansion:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nThen, each of these can be replaced further:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't8' ( productions: \"NT6 \u2192 't8' ), so 't8'.\n\nNT2 can \u2192 't37', 't33', 't52', etc. Wait, from the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that NT2 \u2192 't33', 't37', 't52', maybe?\n\nYes, in the grammar:\n\nLooking again, line by line:\n\nLooking through all the NT2 productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-16","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the string `t30 t22` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies parsing because each step in a derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. In CNF, the start symbol must be a non-terminal, so that's correct. The production S \u2192 NT3 NT9 is the first step. So, to derive the string `t30 t22`, the initial production would involve S generating NT3 and NT9.\n\nEach of these non-terminals (NT3 and NT9) will have their own productions. Let's look at NT3. From the grammar, NT3 can produce NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7, among others. I'll need to see which path leads to terminals including 't30' and 't22'.\n\nLet's check NT3. For instance, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. If I can derive 't30' from NT6 and 't22' from NT2, that would work. Let's see. NT6 has productions like NT3 NT6, which could go deep, but let's look for terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2. Wait, NT9 in the grammar has productions like NT3 NT7, and NT9 also has a production to 't60' and 't41', etc. Hmm, perhaps there's a more straightforward path.\n\nLooking at NT3, another option is NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. If I can derive 't30' from NT0 and 't22' from NT7, that might work. But wait, NT0 has productions that sometimes result in terminals, like NT0 \u2192 't13' or others. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT0, in the grammar, one of its productions is NT0 \u2192 't13'. So if NT0 can produce 't13', then if we have 't30' somewhere else, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Let's explore NT6 and NT2. NT6 can produce NT8 NT4. So NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4. NT8 can produce 't37' (looking at the rules: NT8 \u2192 't37' directly). So if NT8 \u2192 't37' and NT2 produces something else.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me see if any NT in the grammar can directly produce 't30'. Checking the production rules, NT3 can produce 't30' via NT3 \u2192 't30' (third line in the grammar: NT3 \u2192 't65' \u2192 Wait, no, wait: Looking through the rules, let me find any NT ending with t30. Hmm, I see that NT3 has a production to 't30' directly. Let me check.\n\nLooking through each production, I see that NT3 \u2192 't30' is indeed present. So if NT3 can derive 't30', then perhaps that's part of the string.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT9, since the string is `t30 t22`, the other part must be 't22'. Let's see how NT9 can produce 't22'. Checking the NT9 productions: NT9 \u2192 't75' directly, but that's not helpful. Wait, looking through the rules, maybe there's a way for NT9 to produce 't22' through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that in the grammar, there's NT2 \u2192 't33' somewhere? Or perhaps I should check all NTs that can produce terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a way for NT3 to produce 't30' and NT9 to produce 't22'. Let me check NT9.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT9 has several productions. One is NT9 \u2192 't22' (looking at the end of the list, I see NT9 \u2192 't22' in the grammar). So NT9 can directly produce 't22'. That's perfect.\n\nSo putting it together: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then, NT3 \u2192 't30', NT9 \u2192 't22'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it a bit structured, but still, I'll have to parse through it.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and from the productions, S rules seem a bit complex. S can produce combinations like NT3 NT9 or other similar terms. It looks like most of the non-terminals are splitting into two other non-terminals, which might form a tree structure.\n\nNow, looking at the string \"t30 t60\", these are terminals, so I need to see if the non-terminals can be expanded into these.\n\nThe string has two parts: \"t30\" and \"t60\". I'll handle each part separately.\n\nStarting with \"t30\", let's see where that can come from. Looking at the grammar, NT3 can expand to \"t30\" as per one rule. So it's straightforward that NT3 can produce \"t30\".\n\nNext, \"t60\". I look through the grammar to see where \"t60\" can come from. Scanning the rules, I notice NT6 can expand into NT3 NT6 and also into NT4 NT5. Wait, that's a recursive structure.\n\nLooking deeper, NT6 can also produce \"t65\" as per its rules. Hmm, but \"t60\" isn't directly a terminal for NT6. So maybe I need to see if \"t60\" can be reached through other paths.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I missed something. Let me check the NT6 rules again.\n\nOh, wait, at the end of the grammar, I see several lines like:\n\nNT6 -> NT8 NT4\nNT6 -> NT8 NT5\nNT6 -> NT9 NT2\nNT6 -> NT3 NT1\nNT6 -> NT4 NT5\nNT6 -> NT8 NT1\nNT6 -> NT3 NT8\nNT6 -> NT9 NT3\nNT6 -> NT8 NT8\nAnd other NT6 productions leading to terminals.\n\nLooking through all these, I spot that NT6 can produce \"t65\" through some rules, but not \"t60\". Hmm. Is there a way NT6 can reach \"t60\"?\n\nWait, another thought: maybe through other non-terminals. Let's see if any of the non-terminals can reach \"t60\".\n\nLooking at NT0, it can produce \"t13\". NT1 can produce \"t40\". NT2 has a rule producing \"t60\". Wait, yes, indeed, in the grammar, NT2 can produce \"t60\" as per one of its rules:\n\nNT2 -> NT9 NT6\n\nAh, but NT9 can produce \"t75\", which might not help here. Or wait, no, looking again at the grammar rules, I see that NT2 has a production to \"t60\":\n\nWait no, let me check the grammar again more carefully. Let me list the NT2 productions:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT2 -> NT9 NT6\nNT2 -> NT5 NT6\nNT2 -> NT7 NT8\nNT2 -> NT6 NT8\nNT2 -> NT8 NT9\nNT2 -> NT3 NT1\nNT2 -> NT5 NT0\nNT2 -> NT1 NT2\nNT2 -> NT2 NT2\nNT2 -> NT9 NT8\nNT2 -> NT6 NT9\nAnd under NT2, there's a rule:\n\nNT2 -> \"t33\" \u2014 wait, no, the production lines in the grammar show that NT2 can produce \"t33\", but looking through the provided grammar, I don't see NT2 directly producing \"t60\". Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the terminals incorrectly.\n\nWait, let me check each terminal value assigned to NT2 and others.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 -> \"t33\" \u2014 that's one production, producing \"t33\".\nOther NT2 productions include NT9 NT8, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps \"t60\" isn't directly reachable through NT2. Maybe via another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at NT9 in the grammar, is there a production for NT9 that can produce \"t60\"? Let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar, does any NT9 production lead to \"t60\"? Scanning:\n\nI see rules like NT9 -> 't75', but nothing that produces \"t60\". So perhaps \"t60\" is produced by NT6 or NT2 elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me go back to NT2.\n\nIn the grammar, under NT2, is there a rule that leads to \"t60\"?\n\nLooking at the provided grammar lines, I see:\n\nAh! Yes, looking at the end of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 -> NT6 NT9 \u2192 which could potentially lead to \"t65\" and \"t75\", but that's maybe not helpful. Wait, but earlier in the grammar, NT2 has a rule where it can produce \"t60\" when... wait, wait, in the grammar, are there any rules where NT2 directly can produce \"t60\"?\n\nWait, perhaps I didn't notice it. Let me check all the NT2 rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT2 -> NT9 NT8\nNT2 -> NT5 NT6\nNT2 -> NT7 NT8\nNT2 -> NT6 NT8\nNT2 -> NT8 NT9\nNT2 -> NT3 NT1\nNT2 -> NT5 NT0\nNT2 -> NT1 NT2\nNT2 -> NT2 NT2\nNT2 -> NT9 NT8\nNT2 -> NT6 NT9\nAnd then later lines:\n\nNT6 -> 't65'\nNT9 -> 't75'\nWait, but in the NT2 rules, there's no direct production to \"t60\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another non-terminal leads to \"t60\". Let's see: looking for rules that produce \"t60\".\n\nWait, looking back, I see in the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> NT6 NT8 \u2192 No.\nNT6 -> NT9 NT2 \u2192 which could be \"t75\" and \"t33\"?\nWait, no, wait: NT6 -> NT9 NT2 would first produce the terminal for NT9 and then for NT2. But looking at the grammar, NT9 has:\n\nNT9 -> 't75' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 has a rule NT2 -> 't33'.\n\nSo, if the process goes NT6 -> NT9 NT2, that would produce 't75' 't33', but that's not our case.\n\nWait, perhaps \"t60\" is reached from another path.\n\nWait, looking again, let me check if any non-terminals have a production with \"t60\".\n\nIn the grammar, is \"t60\" written as a terminal for any non-terminal?\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't90' \nNT1 -> 't25' \nNT7 -> 't40' \nNT7 -> 't70' \nWait, but \"t60\" doesn't appear as a terminal anywhere in the grammar. So, does that mean that \"t60\" can't be generated? Or maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the string is \"t30 t60\", so it must be generated. So I must have missed a rule where a non-terminal can produce \"t60\".\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps a non-terminal splits into two that each produce a terminal, including \"t60\". Let's check all the rules where a non-terminal is split into two terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice rules that directly split into two terminals, like:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9 \u2192 which becomes 't30' 't60' because NT3 is 't30' and NT9 is 't90'. No, wait, wait. NT9 is 't75', not 't60'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me list each non-terminal and their terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't65'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't91'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't75'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't52'\n\nNT7 also has a rule NT7 \u2192 't10', but that's separate.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, I see several NT non-terminals that produce specific terminals. So if \"t60\" is in the string, perhaps it's generated as a result of some combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which usually has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar rules provided. I notice that many of the non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) eventually reduce to terminal symbols. For example, NT9 becomes 't75', which means whenever NT9 is part of a derivation, it will produce t75.\n\nThe string we're testing is `t13 t10 t14`. Each part of this string must be the result of a production from a non-terminal. So I'll break it down into three parts: t13, t10, t14, and see if each can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see a few rules where non-terminals reduce to a single terminal. For instance:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13' (so when NT0 is derived, it becomes t13)\n- NT7 \u2192 't70' (gives t70)\n- NT1 \u2192 't40' (gives t40)\n- NT2 \u2192 't37'\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT4 \u2192 't88'\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n\nSo for the string `t13 t10 t14`, let's see each part.\n\n1. The first part is `t13`. From the rules, I see NT0 \u2192 t13. So the first non-terminal is NT0, which can produce t13. So one part is satisfied.\n\n2. The second part is `t10`. Looking through the rules, I don't see any direct production that ends with t10. Let me check again. There's a NT7 \u2192 t70. Hmm, but I don't see anything that reduces to t10. Did I miss any rules? Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking through all the rules for NT2, for example, but I don't see any. Maybe a larger rule produces t10. Wait, are there any rules where a non-terminal directly produces t10? I don't think so. So `t10` doesn't seem to be part of any production except maybe through a larger rule, but I don't see that. Maybe I need to check if any non-terminals produce a t10 when derived.\n\nWait, perhaps in a more complex derivation. Let me think. Do any of the rules when expanded produce t10? Let's see, maybe from a path that eventually reduces to t10. For example, does NT2 \u2192 t37, but that just gives t37. NT7 \u2192 t70, which gives t70. NT5 \u2192 't91', which gives t91. Hmm, I don't see how to get t10. Maybe it's not possible. So `t10` isn't a terminal, so perhaps it's not in any production.\n\n3. The third part is `t14`. Looking through the rules, I see NT1 \u2192 t40, which is t40. So no, not t14. NT9 \u2192 t75, no luck. Maybe through a non-terminal that can produce a t14, but I don't see any rules where a non-terminal directly produces t14. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string is in the form of three separate terminals, meaning that each is generated by a non-terminal. But if `t14` isn't a terminal, then it can't be produced by any rule in the grammar because all the right-hand sides are either non-terminals or terminals, and non-terminals only reduce to terminals eventually. So if `t14` isn't a terminal in any production, then it can't be part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and should check again. Let me make sure I didn't miss any rule.\n\nLooking through the list of rules again, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly goes to `t14`. So `t14` can't be generated by any rule, meaning that it's impossible for the grammar to produce `t14` as a symbol.\n\nTherefore, the string `t13 t10 t14` cannot be generated by the grammar because each symbol must be derived from some non-terminal, and `t10` and `t14` aren't terminals in any production. Also, the first part `t13` is okay because NT0 can produce it, but the others can't.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the string isn't in the language because it contains symbols that aren't terminals as defined by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-30","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the string \"t90 t90 t37\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and the string I'm dealing with.\n\nThe grammar is written in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. The terminals in this grammar are things like 't40', 't52', etc., which appear in the rightmost productions of the non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t90 t90 t37\". Since the grammar rules are in CNF, each production splits the string into pairs of symbols, each pair corresponding to a production rule. So, the entire string is split into three pairs: (t90, t90), (t90, t37). Wait, no\u2014if the string has three tokens, that would split into two pairs? Let me think. No, the entire string is split into consecutive pairs because each production is two symbols. So \"t90 t90 t37\" would have to be split as (t90, t90) and (t37) but that can't form a production since each production is two symbols. Alternatively, maybe the string is \"t90 t90 t37\" which is three tokens. So it's an odd number, which might mean it's impossible unless one of the tokens is a non-terminal that can produce a terminal and something else. But wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be exactly two symbols, and the entire string must be generated through a series of such production steps. So each step doubles the number of symbols, but in the end, the string must consist of terminals, meaning that each step must lead to a terminal at the leaves.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a context-free grammar, each production is a single step, and the derivation proceeds until you get all terminals. So for the string \"t90 t90 t37\", that's three symbols. That would require that the start symbol S could produce a string of three terminals, but since each production is two symbols, that would require that the non-terminals can produce a terminal and a non-terminal, but the end must have all terminals.\n\nBut let me see the start symbol S. Looking at the grammar, the productions for S are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So S can only produce two non-terminals. Therefore, S cannot directly produce three terminals. So that already suggests that \"t90 t90 t37\" can't be generated by this grammar because S can only produce two parts, and each of those can split into more parts, but the total number of terminals would have to be a power of two, perhaps. But here, we have three, which is not.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The start symbol S is S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Each of those non-terminals can be split further, but each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. The entire string is a sequence of terminal symbols. The number of terminals in the generated string must be 2^n, where n is the number of production steps. So for example, starting with S, which is two non-terminals. Each of those can split into two, so the next level could have four non-terminals, and so on. However, if at any point a non-terminal produces a terminal, that path contributes one terminal. So the total number of terminals is equal to the number of times we follow a path from S down to leaves that are terminals. So the number of terminals can vary, but it depends on how many non-terminals you replace with terminals along the way.\n\nSo, the string has three terminals: t90, t90, t37. The question is, can this be generated by any derivation path starting from S?\n\nBut wait, let's check the possible end productions. The only way to get a terminal is through a production rule where the non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, like \"NT2 -> 't33'\", \"NT6 -> 't8'\", etc. So each non-terminal can potentially produce a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nSo, in this case, the string has three terminals, which would imply that somewhere in the derivation, two of the non-terminals produced terminals, and one didn't. Let's think about the structure.\n\nLet's try to see what each terminal could come from. Looking at the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking up the right-hand sides of the non-terminals, some produce specific terminals:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT1 \u2192 't25'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', 't37', 't60', etc. (but in the given grammar, some produce t37 and others.)\n- NT3 \u2192 't30', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't91', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't65', 't34', 't8'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40', 't70'\n- NT8 \u2192 't52', 't37', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't75', 't60', etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it's \"t90 t90 t37\". So let's see:\n\n- The first 't90' could come from NT9 \u2192 't75' or 't60'? Wait, no, looking at the given grammar rules, the productions for NT9 are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, NT9 \u2192 't75', NT9 \u2192 't60', NT9 \u2192 't37'.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nThe NT9 productions are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n\nAnd some specific terminals:\n\nWait, let me look through the grammar provided:\n\nLooking for NT9 \u2192 ... terminals:\n\nYes, there's \"NT9 -> 't75'\", \"NT9 -> 't60'\", \"NT9 -> 't37'\", and \"NT9 -> 't90'\". Wait, looking again, yes:\n\nIn the given rules, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nNT9 -> 't60'\n\nNT9 -> 't37'\n\nAnd importantly, there's NT9 \u2192 't90'.\n\nWait, that's the first thing I noticed\u2014that NT9 can produce 't90'. So the first 't90' could come directly from NT9 \u2192 't90'.\n\nSimilarly, the second 't90' could also come from NT9 \u2192 't90', but then the third token is 't37'.\n\nWait, but let's try to see if we can form the string \"t90 t90 t37\" by breaking it down.\n\nSince each production is two symbols, perhaps the string is formed by a series of productions that include combining the terminals and non-terminals appropriately. Let me think about possible ways.\n\nLet's try to construct the string step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT3 NT2 (or NT3 NT9, but let's pick one for now; perhaps we'll need both).\n\nSuppose we take S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals needs to produce either terminals or non-terminals that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nSo, let's see NT3: looking through the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So NT3 is replaced by NT6 and NT2. So now our string is [NT6, NT2, NT2] (since S \u2192 NT3 NT2, and NT3 becomes NT6 NT2, so altogether we'd have NT6, NT2, NT2].\n\nWait, but this is three symbols now, but S's production is two, so how does this work? Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the way the string is built is through each production step appending or splitting, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of how the string can be split into two parts at each step.\n\nWait, but the string \"t90 t90 t37\" is three tokens, which is an odd number, so perhaps it's impossible because each production step in Chomsky Normal Form requires the number of symbols to be a power of two? No, that's not quite right. CNF allows for derivation trees where the number of terminal symbols can be variable, depending on how many non-terminals are expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, but let's think in terms of the structure. The string is three tokens, which means that the entire string must have been built through a series of productions that lead to three terminal symbols. But since each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two, the minimum number of terminal symbols you can get is one (if a non-terminal is expanded into two non-terminals, which themselves could be expanded, but in the end, you need an odd number? No, that's not necessarily correct because you can have multiple non-terminals at different levels that could produce terminals. For example, S \u2192 A B, where A \u2192 a, and B \u2192 b C, and C \u2192 c. Then you'd have a three-symbol string: a b c.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look for production rules that directly produce terminals because the string is made up of terminal symbols. The terminal symbols in the string are t30, t33, t40, and t52. Let me check the grammar to see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that several non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t30\n- NT0 \u2192 t13\n- NT9 \u2192 t75\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t52\n- NT6 \u2192 t34\n- NT2 \u2192 t33\n- NT4 \u2192 t88\n- NT1 \u2192 t40\n- NT5 \u2192 t91\n- NT6 \u2192 t8\n- NT9 \u2192 t75\n- NT2 \u2192 t33\n- NT3 \u2192 t30\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT8 \u2192 t41\n- NT4 \u2192 t42\n- NT9 \u2192 t22\n- NT5 \u2192 t37\n\nBut in the string, we have t30, t33, t40, t52. From the rules, I can note that:\n\n- t30 is produced by NT3\n- t33 is produced by NT2\n- t40 can be produced by NT7 or NT1\n- t52 is produced directly by NT8\n\nNow, the structure of the string is t30 t33 t40 t52. So the sequence is four terminals, each generated by a single non-terminal.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, so the left-hand side (LHS) of each production has only two non-terminals, except for the trivial cases where A \u2192 a. So any derivation starts from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n2. S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo both options start with NT3, followed by NT9 or NT2. Let's see what each of these could generate.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- NT3 \u2192 t30\n- So the first part becomes t30\n- Now, NT9: looking at the rules, NT9 can be several things. There's NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, which seems recursive. Let me check the options for NT9. Yes, one of the options is NT9 \u2192 t75, but that's when NT9 is directly a terminal? Wait, in the rules, NT9 is a non-terminal, but some rules have it on the left, others on the right. For example:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t75? Let me check. No, seems like NT9 has rules like NT9 \u2192 NT9 NT2 and NT9 \u2192 t60.

Let me check again.\n\nActually, I think perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me list all the rule endings for terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, the direct terminal productions are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t30\n\nNT8 \u2192 t52\n\nNT2 \u2192 t33\n\nNT7 \u2192 t40\n\nNT1 \u2192 t40\n\nOther non-terminals lead to other non-terminals, but some have terminal productions:\n\nWait, for example:\n\nNT9 has several rules, but none that produce 't30', 't33', etc. Let me check each line:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT9 has a rule: NT9 \u2192 t75? Or perhaps NT9 can go directly to a terminal?\n\nWait, in the provided rules, the line says NT9 \u2192 t75, but looking back through the entire rule list:\n\nWait, earlier in the provided rules, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nBut I'm not sure. Wait, actually, looking back correctly, perhaps one of the NT9 rules is NT9 -> t75, meaning NT9 can directly produce 't75'. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 t52.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the entire production list more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the productions, some have rules that end with a terminal:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t34 (if present)\n- NT9 \u2192 t75 (in the list towards the end)\n- NT8 \u2192 t52\n- NT6 \u2192 t8 (if any, but checking the rules, maybe not)\n- NT1 \u2192 t40\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n- NT0 \u2192 t13\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread before. Let me try again.\n\nThe last lines of the grammar:\n\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT0 -> 't01'\nBut no, looking back, I think I confused some parts.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to scan through the rules again more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nLooking for any lines where a non-terminal is assigned a terminal symbol. That is, any line where the LHS is a single non-terminal, and the RHS is just a terminal with an arrow.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT9 -> t75 (looking for lines where RHS is a terminal. Wait, the lines are:\n\nLooking at the end:\n\nNT7 -> 't65'\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all lines where the RHS is a terminal without parenthesis?\n\nNo, perhaps it's easier to note that in the initial problem statement, each production is written as S -> NT3 NT9, etc. So, for example, NT8 could produce t52 if such a production exists.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is t30 t33 t40 t52.\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from S using the grammar.\n\nThe terminals are t30, t33, t40, t52.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals produce these:\n\n- t30: NT3 \u2192 t30\n- t33: NT2 \u2192 t33\n- t40: NT7 \u2192 t40, NT1 \u2192 t40\n- t52: NT8 \u2192 t52\n\nSo, the string is four terminals. I'll need to see if S can be expanded step by step to these in four steps.\n\nBut first, S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then the first symbol is t30 (from NT3) and then the rest.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT3 NT2, then the first part is t30, and the second part is t33 (since NT2 \u2192 t33).\n\nSo let's suppose we take S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nThen NT3 \u2192 t30, NT2 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo the first two symbols are t30 t33. Now, we need to get t40 t52 after that.\n\nSo then the current expansion would be NT3 \u2192 t30 and NT2 \u2192 t33, and then we have two more parts to reach four symbols.\n\nWait, but in context-free grammars, each production rule replaces a single non-terminal with two or one symbols. So to reach four terminals, perhaps the structure is such that each step adds more terminals, and the total number is four by the end.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the entire string.\n\nWe have to build the string t30 t33 t40 t52.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nThen, NT3 \u2192 t30, and NT9 can produce t75, but that's not t40.\n\nAlternatively, if NT9 can produce NT1 NT5, which might get us into another part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me instead consider the entire string as a sequence of four parts, each corresponding to a non-terminal. Each part in the string must correspond to a non-terminal that can produce that terminal.\n\nSo t30 is from NT3, t33 from NT2, t40 can be from NT7 or NT1, t52 from NT8.\n\nNow, let's see if the non-terminals in the string can be combined in such a way that they can be part of the grammar's expansion.\n\nAnother approach is to see that the entire string is four terminals, so the derivation must produce them in sequence.\n\nWe can"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-54","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is \"t90 t13 t10 t12\", and the grammar consists of a bunch of production rules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules in the form of A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit CNF since all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or terminals. So that's a good start.\n\nNow, the string we need to check is \"t90 t13 t10 t12\". That's four terminals. In a CNF grammar, each step of derivation produces one terminal or two non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the maximum number of symbols in a string is 2^n, where n is the number of steps. Here, we have four symbols, so perhaps it's generated in two steps starting from S.\n\nLet me see what the start symbol S produces. Looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So S expands into two non-terminals. Let's break down each option.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So NT3 and NT9 are non-terminals that need to produce tokens. Looking at the production rules for NT3, I see NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So NT3 further splits into NT6 and NT2. Let's see what those produce.\n\nFor NT6: The rules are NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT4, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2, and so on. Oh wait, some of these have terminals. Like NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, but others might produce two non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to try to see if the string can be built step by step. The string is t90 t13 t10 t12. So four tokens, which could correspond to four non-terminals split into terminals.\n\nBut how does the string decompose into the production rules?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string from the top down, using the given production rules.\n\nStarting from S, we can go to either S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Let's try both possibilities.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then NT3 and NT9 must derive into their respective tokens. Let's see what NT3 and NT9 produce.\n\nLooking at NT3, it can be broken down into NT6 NT2. So NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Now, what about NT6 and NT2?\n\nLooking at NT6, possible rules are NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT4, etc. Hmm. Maybe NT6 could produce some terminals. Looking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2 and NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 as well. No direct terminals, unless I missed something. Or maybe from NT4.\n\nWait, looking at the rest, let's see: NT9 can produce certain terminals. Like in NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9', but I think NT9 also has a rule that directly produces 't75'. Yes, in the later rules, I see NT9 \u2192 't75', so that's a terminal production.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal rules from the grammar:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT6 \u2192 't34'\n- NT1 \u2192 't25'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT9 again is t75.\n- Wait, this is getting a bit confusing, maybe I should note all terminal productions:\n\nLet me go through each terminal possibility:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't75'\nNT8 \u2192 't52'\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\nNT6 \u2192 't34'\nNT1 \u2192 't25'\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\nNT5 \u2192 't91'\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\nNT2 \u2192 't33'\nHmm, are there any other terminals? Oh, the beginning rules have NT9 \u2192 't90'? Wait no, looking back: \n\nWait, the terminal productions are listed in the bottom of the grammar. Let me check each production rule where the right-hand side is a terminal:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't90' (I think I missed this earlier; looking at the latter rules, I see NT9 \u2192 't90' as one of the options? Let me check:\n\nWait, at the end of the list, there's a rule like NT9 \u2192 't90', yes. So NT9 can produce 't90', 't75', etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 't13', NT6 \u2192 't34', NT1 \u2192 't25', NT7 \u2192 't40', NT8 \u2192 't52', NT3 \u2192 't30', NT2 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSo each of these non-terminals can produce one specific terminal. That simplifies things because any non-terminal that can only produce one terminal will only contribute that token.\n\nSo, let's see. The string is t90 t13 t10 t12.\n\nLooking at these, t90 can come from NT9, t13 from NT0, t10 from NT10? Wait but NT10 isn't in the rules, because from the initial grammar, all the non-terminals are letters like NT3, NT8, etc. Hmm, wait no. Let me make sure. The grammar only has non-terminals like S, NT3, NT8, etc., so the terminal tokens are t's followed by numbers. So t90 is a terminal, t13 is another, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the given string, t10 is present. But looking at the terminal rules, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't10' because all terminals are like 't90', 't13', etc. So that makes me think that perhaps the string isn't generated by the grammar because t10 isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, looking more carefully, maybe I missed a terminal rule for 't10'. Let me go through the terminal production rules given:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't90'\nNT8 \u2192 't52'\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\nNT6 \u2192 't34'\nNT1 \u2192 't25'\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\nNT5 \u2192 't91'\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\nNT2 \u2192 't33'\n\nSo none of the non-terminals produce 't10'. Therefore, the string has 't10', which is a problem because it's not in the terminal set of the grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again if any non-terminals produce 't10'. For example, maybe NT10 \u2192 't10' or something like that, but in the provided grammar, I don't see such a rule. The rules have NT2 \u2192 't33', NT3 \u2192 't30', etc., but 't10' is not among the terminals.\n\nSo that suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because 't10' is not a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string contains a symbol not present in the terminal symbols of the grammar. Hence, it's impossible for the grammar to generate such a string.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I overlooked a rule. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nThe terminal rules are where a non-terminal is immediately replaced by a single symbol, not a pair.

{"custom_id":"request-73","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the string `t90 t42 t19 t10 t40` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in a textual form, which seems quite extensive. It contains a lot of productions, each starting with a left-hand side symbol and producing a sequence of right-hand side symbols. These right-hand side symbols are a mix of terminal and non-terminal symbols. The terminals are strings of 't' followed by numbers, like 't90', 't42', etc., and the non-terminals are other symbols like S, NT0, NT1, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t90 t42 t19 t10 t40`. This looks like a sequence of terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nMy goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let's break down the problem.\n\nI'll start by looking at the string and the grammar productions to see which symbols in the string correspond to which non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- The string starts with `t90`. I need to find a production that leads to t90. Looking through the productions, I see NT9 \u2192 t75 and NT9 \u2192 t60, but there's also NT9 \u2192 't90' as per the grammar. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n  Let me check the productions again. Scanning through, I find:\n\n  NT9 \u2192 't90' (yes, that exists). So, t90 can be directly derived from NT9.\n\n  Next, the second token is `t42`. Looking for a production that leads to t42. Scanning the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 't88', but no t42. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong productions. Alternatively, maybe it's another NT.\n\n  Let me see if there's any NT that can produce t42. Checking the grammar, under NT4, we have two productions: NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0 and NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT1. Also, looking for any NT that directly produces t42. Hmm, under NT8, there are productions ending with t37, t34, etc. Wait, I don't see a production for NT0 \u2192 t42 directly. Let me scan all non-terminals:\n\n  - NT0 has several productions, but I don't see any that map directly to t42. Hmm, maybe t42 comes from another NT. Wait, looking back, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT3 NT9.\n\n  So S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first symbol in the string comes from NT9 \u2192 t90, which is fine. The second symbol comes from NT3. So I need to see if NT3 can produce t42 as the second token.\n\n  Looking at NT3 productions:\n\n  NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n  NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n  NT3 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n  NT3 \u2192 't30'\n\n  None of these directly produce t42. However, I can have a chain: perhaps NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and then NT6 can produce something, NT2 can produce something else.\n\n  Let's check what NT6 can produce. Looking for NT6 productions:\n\n  NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n  NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n  NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n  NT6 \u2192 't34'\n  NT6 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n  NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n  NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n  NT6 \u2192 NT0 NT1\n  NT6 \u2192 't8'\n\n  So, NT6 can produce t34, t8, etc., but not directly t42. But maybe through more steps. So let's consider that the second token is t42, which has to come from some NT, perhaps NT2. Because S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and the second symbol comes from NT9's production, but perhaps the other symbols come from NT3, right? Wait, the string is `t90 t42 t19 t10 t40`, so the order is S's two symbols first, but wait, no. Wait, S produces two non-terminals, each of which can produce a sequence, so the entire string is the concatenation of their derived sequences.\n\n  Wait, perhaps the entire string is the result of S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which will be two parts: one from NT3 and one from NT9. So the string must be the concatenation of what NT3 produces and what NT9 produces.\n\n  Let's split the string into two parts: the first part from NT3 and the second from NT9.\n\n  The entire string is `t90 t42 t19 t10 t40`.\n\n  NT9 produces `t90` directly, so the latter part of the string after `t90` is `t42 t19 t10 t40`, which should be derived from NT3.\n\n  So, can NT3 derive the string `t42 t19 t10 t40`?\n\n  Let me model this. NT3 must produce that sequence. Let's see.\n\n  The string after `t90` is `t42 t19 t10 t40`, which is four symbols. So perhaps NT3 is broken down into a parse of these four symbols. Let's see.\n\n  First, NT3 is part of S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so NT3 will produce the first part of the string up to before `t90`, but in the given string, the order is `t90 t42 t19 t10 t40`, which suggests that `t90` is the first symbol, followed by the symbols from NT3, which is `t42 t19 t10 t40`.\n\n  So, can NT3 derive the string `t42 t19 t10 t40`?\n\n  Let me think step by step. The string after `t90` is `t42 t19 t10 t40`. So, the entire string is:\n\n  `t90 t42 t19 t10 t40`\n\n  So, the initial NT9 produces `t90`. Then, the NT3 part produces the rest: `t42 t19 t10 t40`.\n\n  Now, let's try to parse `t42 t19 t10 t40` via NT3.\n\n  Since NT3 is a non-terminal, let's see what productions it has and can apply.\n\n  NT3 can produce:\n\n  - NT6 NT2\n  - NT0 NT7\n  - NT1 NT5\n  - 't30'\n\n  We need to see if one of these can produce the required string.\n\n  Let's start with the first symbol in the substring, which is 't42'. To produce 't42', which non-terminal(s) can directly produce it? Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal have a production that starts with t42 as a terminal?\n\n  Scanning through the list of productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t42 except possibly one that I might have missed. Let me double-check the productions:\n\n  Looking at NT4, I see NT4 \u2192 't88' as one of its productions. But t88 is not our string here. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps t42 is not a direct terminal but comes via multiple productions.\n\n  Wait, maybe t42 comes from a longer chain. Let me think about the possible paths.\n\n  For example, maybe NT2 can produce t42, but looking at NT2's productions, I don't see any direct t42. Instead, NT2 has productions ending with t37, t33, t34, etc. So t42 might not be directly from NT2.\n\n  Alternatively, perhaps it's coming from some other NT that doesn't directly produce t42 but does produce a sequence that includes t42 in the process. This might get complex, so let me try to think of the overall structure.\n\n  The string `t42 t19 t10 t40` has four tokens. Let's consider the possible splits. Let's see if we can find an NT that can split this into a left and right part, and each can be further derived.\n\n  For instance, suppose the first production of NT3 is NT6 NT2. So NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Then, NT6 can produce part of the string and NT2 can produce the rest.\n\n  So, let's check if NT6 and NT2 can derive `t42 t19 t10 t40` in two parts.\n\n  NT6 could produce a sequence, say, ending with something, and NT2 could produce the remaining.\n\n  But I'm not sure."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-75","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t90 t70 t70 t75 t75`, and the grammar is quite complex with a lot of production rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have production rules of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the given grammar should adhere to this structure.\n\nBut I need to figure out if the target string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules. The approach I'll take is to work backward from the string, trying to split the string into parts that can conform to the rules, step by step.\n\nThe string is `t90 t70 t70 t75 t75`. Let's note that the terminals are specific tokens like 't90', 't75', etc., which correspond to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it starts with 't90'. From the grammar, I see that NT9 can produce 't90' via NT9 \u2192 't90'. Similarly, NT7 can produce 't70' via NT7 \u2192 't70'.\n\nSo, one possible split is 't90' as NT9 producing 't90', followed by three 't70's and two 't75's. Wait, actually, the string has five elements: t90, t70, t70, t75, t75.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about how the grammar builds up the string. Since CNF requires each step to expand a single non-terminal into two non-terminals (until the terminals are reached), the string's length corresponds to the number of non-terminals in the derivation plus one. The string has 5 terminals, so there must have been 4 expansions from non-terminals to terminals. \n\nLet me try to work backward. Since the terminals are 't90', 't70', etc., I can look for production rules that directly produce these.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't90' (so 't90' comes from NT9)\n- NT7 \u2192 't70' (so each 't70' comes from NT7)\n- NT8 \u2192 't75' (since NT8 \u2192 't75'?)\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar rules provided. Looking through, I see:\n\nYes, there's a rule NT6 \u2192 't8' which might not be relevant, but NT9 \u2192 't75' isn't in the initial list, but looking again, there's a NT9 \u2192 't75' at the end. Yes, lines at the end like NT9 -> 't75' are present.\n\nSo, 't75' comes from NT9, and 't70' comes from NT7.\n\nSo let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t90 t70 t70 t75 t75.\n\nPossible production steps:\n\n1. Start with NT9, which produces 't90' (since NT9 \u2192 't90'). So the first term is NT9.\n\n2. Then, the remaining string is t70 t70 t75 t75.\n\nLooking at the remaining part, we can consider if 't70 t70 t75 t75' can be split into two parts, each generated by a production rule.\n\nWait, since each expansion step can only expand one non-terminal into two non-terminals, but when terminals are involved, each step produces a terminal. So perhaps the string is built by expanding NT7 into t70 four times? That doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT9 is part of a larger production. Wait, looking at the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol S can be NT3 NT3 or other productions, but looking at the initial rules, I don't see S being directly connected to the given tokens. Wait, the initial S rules are:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nWait, or is it S -> NT3 NT3 or other combinations? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at lines:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3? Or maybe S is more complicated. Let me look:\n\nThe user provided the grammar as multiple lines, starting with S -> NT3 NT3? No, actually looking again, the first lines are:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nSo, S can produce NT3 NT9, which would expand to eventually produce the string.\n\nSo, starting with S, which can be NT3 NT9.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, the string starts with 't90' which is produced by NT9. Therefore, NT9 is one part. Then, we'd have to generate 't70 t70 t75 t75' from NT3.\n\nWait, but NT3 has production rules. Let me look up the NT3 rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 (line 18)\nNT3 \u2192 NT8 NT4 (line 19)\nNT3 \u2192 NT9 NT0 (line 20)\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7 (line 23)\nAnd another NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT3 (but that's another non-terminal production).\n\nWait, perhaps the start is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which would produce 't90' as the first term, leaving the rest as 't70 t70 t75 t75' to come from NT3.\n\nWait, no. S produces NT3 and NT9, so S can be seen as the combination of these two non-terminals. So the entire string would be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT3 and NT9.\n\nSince NT9 generates 't90', NT3 would need to generate 't70 t70 t75 t75'.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to whether NT3 can generate 't70 t70 t75 t75'.\n\nSo, let's model NT3:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 can be:\n\n- NT6 NT2 (20)\n- NT8 NT4 (19)\n- NT9 NT0 (20)\nWait, earlier I saw NT3 \u2192 NT9 NT0 and NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7.\n\nWait, let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the lines, NT3 appears to have these production rules:\n\nLine 18: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nLine 19: NT3 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n\nLine 20: NT3 \u2192 NT9 NT0\n\nLine 22: NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nSo four rules for NT3, each producing two non-terminals.\n\nSo, to generate four terminals (t70, t70, t75, t75), we need to expand each non-terminal in such a way that when terminals are produced, they match the desired sequence.\n\nLet me think recursively.\n\nFirst, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nThen, NT6 can produce:\n\nLooking at the lines, NT6 has:\n\nLine 24: NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n\nLine 25: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT5\n\nLine 26: NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n\nLine 27: NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n\nLine 28: NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nHmm.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 can produce:\n\nLooking at NT2's rules:\n\nLine 29: NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nLine 30: NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n\nLine 31: NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT0\n\nLine 32: NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n\nLine 33: NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n\nLine 34: NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nAnd others, but I think that's enough for now.\n\nBut it's getting complicated. Maybe a different approach would help. Perhaps let's consider the string and see if it can be split into parts that can be derived step by step.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to see if each term can be directly matched by some production. For example, 't70' is only matched by NT7 \u2192 t70, and 't75' by NT9 \u2192 t75, 't90' by NT9 \u2192 t90, etc.\n\nWait, but let's see.\n\nIf NT3 must produce 't70 t70 t75 t75', how?\n\nPerhaps the four tokens come from expanding NT3 into two non-terminals, each of which eventually become two tokens.\n\nWait, no. Because NT3 itself can only produce two non-terminals at a time.\n\nWait, perhaps it's built by multiple expansions. Let me try to model this step by step.\n\nFirst, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nSuppose NT6 can expand into 't70' somehow, but looking up NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't37'?

{"custom_id":"request-99","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string `t13 t70 t19 t30 t30 t65` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. But looking at the rules, it seems that all non-terminals are in the left-hand side, and the right-hand sides are combinations of other non-terminals. Some of the rules directly produce terminals, like `NT9 -> 't75'` or `NT0 -> 't13'`.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t13 t70 t19 t30 t30 t65`. Let me break this down into individual tokens: t13, t70, t19, t30, t30, t65.\n\nFirst, I should look for the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S, so I need to see if the start symbol can derive this string.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo the string must start with either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Wait, but the string starts with t13. Let me see which non-terminals produce t13.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT0 \u2192 't13'. So that's one token. Then, from S, if the first part is NT0, but S's productions are in terms of NT3, NT2, etc. Hmm, maybe my approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a sequence of terminals, so I should check if each step can replace each non-terminal correctly.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, S produces NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Then each NT needs to be expanded into the next part.\n\nLet me consider the production S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Because S \u2192 NT3 NT9 would produce t13 (from NT0 \u2192 t13?), but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should check which non-terminals expand into which tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to see what each part could be. The string is t13, t70, t19, t30, t30, t65.\n\nLooking at t13: NT0 \u2192 't13'. So that would come from the production NT0.\n\nLooking at t30: NT3 \u2192 't30'.\n\nt65: NT6 \u2192 't65'.\n\nt70: NT7 \u2192 't70'.\n\nt19: NT1 \u2192 't19'.\n\nt40: Wait, but in the string, it's t65, not t40. Hmm.\n\nSo let's try to see: Could the grammar derive this string?\n\nSince S can choose between NT3 NT9 and NT3 NT2, let's pick one that would help get the tokens.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nThen NT3 can produce 't30' (from NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, but NT0 \u2192 t13, NT7 \u2192 t70. Hmm, perhaps NT3 can break down into t30.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 could produce t19 and others.\n\nWait, but let's map this out.\n\nFirst token t13 comes from NT0 \u2192 t13, so perhaps NT3 must expand into NT0 NT7, then NT0 \u2192 t13 and NT7 \u2192 t70, giving t13 t70, which is the first two tokens.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT2 \u2192 (NT0 NT7)(NT2).\n\nWait, but that would make t13 t70 followed by what NT2 can produce.\n\nLet's see: NT2 can expand into various options. For example, looking at NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2, NT9 \u2192 't65'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT2 \u2192 t33, but that's a terminal. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT2 has several rules that lead to terminal and non-terminal combinations.\n\nWait, looking back, I think some of the rules for NT2 produce terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 't33', 't67', but I'm not sure. Actually, looking at the rules provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT1 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n\nHmm, some of these produce terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 't33' is one of them. Wait, no, looking back, I don't see any rule where NT2 directly becomes a terminal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT1 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n\nI don't see any direct terminal. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, no! Wait, the rule `NT2 -> t33` isn't in the list provided, so all rules for NT2 either produce non-terminals or are combinations. So perhaps NT2 must be expanded until terminals are produced.\n\nSo, in the string, after t13 t70 comes t19. Let's see how that can happen.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT3 NT2 \u2192 (NT0 NT7) (NT2). Then NT0 \u2192 t13 and NT7 \u2192 t70, so first two tokens are t13 t70.\n\nNow, NT2 can expand into various things. Let's see what leads to t19. Looking at NT2's rules:\n\nLooking for something like NT2 \u2192 something that leads to 't19'. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps looking at other non-terminals that can produce t19.\n\nLooking at NT1's rule: NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8. But t19 is from NT1 \u2192 't19', right? So if NT2 expands into a path that leads to NT1, then from NT1, we can get t19.\n\nWait, but how? Let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT3 NT2, then we have NT3 (which is t30) and NT2.\n\nNT2 needs to expand into something that can then lead to the remaining tokens.\n\nSo, after t13 t70, we have t19, t30, t30, t65.\n\nLet me consider that after t13 t70, we have three more tokens: t19, t30, t30, t65? Wait, no, the string is six tokens. Let me count: t13, t70, t19, t30, t30, t65.\n\nSo first two tokens come from NT3 \u2192 t30 and NT7 \u2192 t70. Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought NT3 \u2192 t30, but looking at the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. So NT3 expands into NT0 and NT7. Then, the first part would be NT3, which is NT0 NT7. So NT0 \u2192 t13 and NT7 \u2192 t70, giving t13 t70.\n\nThen, the next token comes from NT2, which would be followed by more non-terminals.\n\nSo after t13 t70, the next is t19. So the third part must involve NT2 expanding into something that leads to t19.\n\nWait, in the rules, how can NT2 lead to t19? There's no direct rule for NT2 \u2192 't19'. So perhaps the 't19' comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

{"custom_id":"request-95","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t90 t40 t37 t65 t37 t19`. \n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every step in the derivation only replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals until you reach terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's pretty extensive with many non-terminals and production rules. Some of the terminals include 't90', 't40', etc., which are likely the tokens that make up the string. \n\nI notice that the start symbol is S, which is initially defined as S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the derivation starts with S, which then becomes NT3 NT9. Both NT3 and NT9 are non-terminals, so I need to check the rules for these.\n\nNT3 has a production rule: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Let's see where that goes. NT6 can go to NT8 NT4 or NT0 NT7. NT8 has some production rules leading to terminals, for example, NT8 \u2192 't52'. Similarly, NT9 has a production to 't75' and others.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't90' which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I need to see if 't90' is an accessible terminal. Checking the terminal rules, I see NT9 \u2192 't75' and 't60', but I don't immediately see 't90' in the initial rules. However, looking further down, there's NT9 \u2192 't90', so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT4 has 't88' and other terminals. \n\nSo, the string starts with 't90', which must come from NT9. Let's see the rules for NT9. From the grammar, NT9 has several production rules, one of which is NT9 \u2192 't90'. So 't90' is directly derived from NT9.\n\nNow, I need to see how NT9 got there. Looking back, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so NT9 is part of S. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Now, I need to parse the rest of the string: t40 t37 t65 t37 t19.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's structure it step by step.\n\nThe string is t90 t40 t37 t65 t37 t19.\n\nGiven that S starts as S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which would produce a string starting with whatever NT3 and NT9 produce. Let's see.\n\nWait, no. The initial S is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so that's the first split. Then, each of NT3 and NT9 would have to be expanded until they turn into terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t90, which comes from NT9. So from S, we get NT3 NT9. Then, NT9 \u2192 t90. So the first token is t90.\n\nNow, the rest of the string is t40 t37 t65 t37 t19. So after t90, we have t40. Let's look at NT3.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So, NT3 must expand into something that produces t40, t37, etc.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT6 and NT2: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 or NT4 NT5, and so on. Wait, maybe this is getting too complex. Perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to model the grammar as a parser and see if the string can be parsed without any issues.\n\nAlternatively, looking for rules that directly match parts of the string. For example, 't90' is an NT9 \u2192 't90', so that's a direct match. So, after S splits into NT3 and NT9, the first token is t90.\n\nNow, the next token is t40. So the NT3 must expand into something that starts with t40. Looking at NT3's rules: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nSo, after getting t90, the NT3 part should produce t40. Let's track NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So, NT6 and NT2 must produce the rest of the string after t90.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 or other options. Let's say NT6 produces 't40' or something else.\n\nWait, no, 't40' comes later. Let's see if any of the NT6 or NT2 rules directly start with t40.\n\nLooking at NT6's rules, none start with t40 directly, but perhaps through expansion. Alternatively, looking at NT8, which has NT8 \u2192 't52' and other rules. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a chain that starts with 't90' followed by 't40' from NT3.\n\nWait, maybe NT3 can produce a sequence that starts with t40. Let's see. NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Suppose NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, and NT8 \u2192 't52' or 't41', but that's not matching 't40'.\n\nAlternatively, NT6 could expand to NT9 NT2, and NT9 \u2192 't90', but that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another route. Let's see NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 or NT4 NT5 or NT8 NT9, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should track the entire string. The string is t90 t40 t37 t65 t37 t19.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT3 NT9 \u2192 t90, the next part is NT3 which needs to produce t40 t37 t65 t37 t19.\n\nBut in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. So perhaps, after t90, the NT3 must start expanding into a sequence of non-terminals that together produce t40, etc.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the string starts with t90, so the S must produce t90, but S is NT3 NT9, so both must be non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. S is a starting symbol, and the entire string must be a result of expanding S completely into terminals. So the initial S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then both NT3 and NT9 must each expand into a string of terminals.\n\nSo the entire string is the concatenation of what NT3 expands to and what NT9 expands to. So the string should be NT3_expansion + NT9_expansion.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t90, so NT9 must produce t90 as the first symbol, and NT3 must produce the rest of the string.\n\nBut looking at the rules for NT9, one of them is NT9 \u2192 't90', which is a single terminal. So NT9 can terminate after 't90'. Thus, NT9's expansion is just 't90', which would mean that the string should be the expansion of NT3 followed by 't90'.\n\nSo the string after t90 is t40 t37 t65 t37 t19. Therefore, NT3 must expand into t40 t37 t65 t37 t19.\n\nNow, let's check if NT3 can expand into that sequence. From NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So, the expansion would be the concatenation of NT6 expansion and NT2 expansion.\n\nAssuming that, let's see. So, we need NT6 expansion to be t40 t37 t65 t37 t19, but that seems unlikely because NT6 is a non-terminal and would break down further into non-terminals until it becomes terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. No, in CNF, each non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals until all are replaced by terminals. So, the entire string t90 t40 t37 t65 t37 t19 is the result of expanding S into NT3 NT9, then each until they become terminals.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of symbols, with t90 as the first (from NT9), and the rest coming from NT3.\n\nSo, NT9 is 't90' directly, and NT3 must expand into t40 t37 t65 t37 t19.\n\nTherefore, the question is: Does NT3 have a production that eventually results in t40 t37 t65 t37 t19?\n\nBut NT3 only has production rules that split into two non-terminals: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nSo, for NT3 to produce a string of five terminals, it would need to go through multiple splits. Each split produces two non-terminals, which in turn split until they reach terminals.\n\nSo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It consists of several non-terminal symbols (like S, NT0, NT3, etc.) and production rules that expand these non-terminals into other symbols. Some of the rules produce terminal characters ('t' followed by numbers), which are the actual tokens that make up the string we're testing.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t30 t34 t37 t37 t10 t40 t12\". Since the grammar's start symbol is S, the string must be derived from expanding S through its productions, eventually resulting in terminal only symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Both of these start with NT3, so the string must begin with the symbols derived from NT3.\n\nNow, looking at NT3's productions, I see that NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 and NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. So, from NT3, we can go to either NT6 followed by NT2 or NT0 followed by NT7.\n\nLet's consider both possibilities:\n\n1. NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2: Then, the string starts with t30, which would have to come from NT6. Looking at the grammar, NT6 has rules like NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, and others. Checking the terminals, NT6 can produce 't34' via NT6 \u2192 't34' (wait, actually, looking more carefully, NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 't65' (t65 is a terminal?), wait, the grammar includes NT6 \u2192 't65'?\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, NT6 has some productions to terminals and some to non-terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 't34' is not present, but looking through, in the grammar provided:\n\nLooking at NT3, in the rules provided, I see NT3 has productions like NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and another rule: NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. So NT3 can go to either NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. \n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t30. So if NT3 produces t30, we need to see what NT3's production can yield t30. Looking at the grammar, none of NT3's direct productions produce t30. Let me check: \n\nIn NT0 \u2192 't13' is a terminal production, but that's a separate rule. Wait, in the grammar, for example, NT3 has a production to NT6 NT2, which might then produce terminals. Wait, perhaps I need to see how each part is being generated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step using the grammar. \n\nThe string is t30 t34 t37 t37 t10 t40 t12. Let's list them as positions 1 to 7.\n\nI think the first step is to look at S's productions. Since S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So the first part is NT3. So the first symbol in the string must come from NT3.\n\nBut looking at NT3's productions: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 and NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. Let's see:\n\n- If NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, then t30 must come from NT6. Looking at NT6's rules, I see NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, etc. So in the grammar, NT6 can produce nt6 \u2192 t37 (but wait, is that a terminal? Looking back, looking for NT6 \u2192 't37': No, I don't think NT6 has any terminal production except perhaps in one of the later rules.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't75', NT8 \u2192 't52', NT0 \u2192 't13', NT6 \u2192 't65', NT1 \u2192 't40', NT7 \u2192 't40', etc. So, for example, NT6 \u2192 't65' is a rule.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT6: \nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT8\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT6 \u2192 NT0 NT1\nWait, none of these are terminal. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking back: the grammar provided includes:\n\nFor example, \n\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\nNT8 \u2192 't52'\nNT2 \u2192 't33'\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\nNT8 \u2192 't37'\nNT9 \u2192 't75'\nNT7 \u2192 't70'\nNT1 \u2192 't40'\n\nWait, so some of these non-terminals can produce terminals:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT8 \u2192 't37'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT6 \u2192 't65'\u2014wait, no: I think I might have misread earlier.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar has:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\nYes, so NT3 has a production to 't30'. Similarly, NT6 \u2192 't65' is one of the rules, but I don't see it in the provided list. Wait, let me scan again:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, under NT6, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT8\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT6 \u2192 NT0 NT1\n\nWait, none of these are terminal. So perhaps NT6 does not directly produce t65. Let me check other NT symbols.\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\n- NT9 has production NT9 \u2192 't75', so that's a terminal.\n- NT8 has production NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT7 \u2192 't70'\n- NT1 \u2192 't40'\n- Others: NT2 \u2192 't33', NT4 \u2192 't42', etc.\n\nSo for the string, the first symbol is t30, which must come from NT3's rule NT3 \u2192 't30' as a production. So that would mean that NT3 is directly producing t30. Then, the next symbol must come from the second part of NT3's production, which would be either NT6 or NT0 or NT7, depending on the rule.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So the first symbol is t30 (from NT3 \u2192 t30), then the second part of NT3 would determine the next symbols.\n\nWait, no: in Chomsky Normal Form, each rule is a pair. So S \u2192 NT3 NT9 means S expands into two non-terminals, NT3 and NT9. Then, in parsing, each of these would produce sequences of symbols.\n\nSo, the string is t30 t34 t37 t37 t10 t40 t12. So, the first symbol t30 must come from NT3, which has a production to 't30'. So, after the first symbol comes the next symbols from NT3's expansion or from NT9's expansion, depending on the rule. Wait, no: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So S is the start, so the entire string must be generated by expanding either NT3 and NT9, or NT3 and NT2.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in the given grammar, S is the start, and the string must be generated by expanding S into NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Then, the entire string would consist of the symbols from expanding NT3 and NT9, or NT3 and NT2.\n\nSo, the given string is seven tokens, so each part (NT3 and NT9 or NT3 and NT2) must produce seven tokens. Wait, that's possible, because for example, if S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and both NT3 and NT9 can produce several symbols.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step.\n\nAssuming the production S \u2192 NT3 NT9:\n\n- The first symbol is t30 from NT3.\n\nThen the second symbol comes from NT3's expansion or from NT9's expansion.\n\nWait, no: in CFG, the string is generated by expanding all non-terminals. So starting from S, the string is a series of terminals derived from expanding non-terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-118","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t40 t37 t23 t40 t34 t91 t33`, and the grammar is quite extensive with a lot of production rules. \n\nFirst off, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So every step in the derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. My goal is to see if the string can be generated by following these production rules step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of tokens: t40, t37, t23, t40, t34, t91, t33. I need to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nStarting with the grammar, the start symbol S can produce several things: S -> NT3 NT9, S -> NT3 NT2. Each of these is two non-terminals, so the next step would involve expanding each of those.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that NT3, NT9, and others eventually produce terminals like t40, t37, etc. Each production of NT involves two non-terminals, so each step reduces the number of non-terminals but eventually needs to get to terminals.\n\nBut in the given string, it's a flat list of terminals. So I need to see if there's a derivation path that starts from S and through a series of steps, each replacing two non-terminals, leading to exactly this string of terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, let's count the number of tokens. There are 7 tokens. So if I trace the derivation, each step would potentially add tokens, but since it's a binary expansion each time, the number of steps would relate logarithmically to the number of tokens. But 7 is a prime number, and since each production adds exactly two, I'm a bit confused because the number of symbols would have to be powers of two, but that's probably not the case here.\n\nWait, actually, no. From the start symbol S, each production is two non-terminals, so the initial expansion of S gives two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can then be expanded into two more, or possibly into a terminal if the non-terminal rules include terminals. So, the number of tokens in the derived string should be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which for a binary grammar is 2^k, but perhaps that's when the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form and each rule is length two.\n\nBut in this case, the grammar not only includes two non-terminals but some non-terminals have a mix of terminals and non-terminals in their productions. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must be to two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So looking at the grammar rules provided, it seems that many non-terminals can produce two non-terminals, but others may produce a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, some rules like NT0 -> 't13' produce a single terminal. But in our case, all tokens in the string are terminals like 't40', 't37', etc.\n\nSo, I think in this grammar, some non-terminals produce single terminals. Therefore, the number of tokens in the derived string could be any number, as some steps are replacements into terminals, and others into non-terminals.\n\nBut let me think step by step. The string has 7 tokens, so perhaps the derivation has a certain number of steps. Let's consider that each expansion potentially can add one or two terminals. Hmm, not quite, because each production is two symbols. So maybe some non-terminals produce two non-terminals, and others produce a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at some of the grammar rules, for example:\n\nNT0 -> NT1 NT3,\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2,\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5,\n\nand so on. So each of these is two non-terminals. Then, some of these non-terminals, like NT8, can produce a terminal ('t37') or a combination.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I can see some rules where a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal, such as:\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nNT1 -> 't25'\n\nNT2 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't30'\n\nNT5 -> 't91'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nNT7 -> 't40'\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nAnd so on. So each of these non-terminals can be directly replaced with a terminal. Others produce two non-terminals.\n\nSo, the process would be to see if the string can be broken down into a series of such replacements.\n\nNow, the string is `t40 t37 t23 t40 t34 t91 t33`. So, let's try to parse it backward, perhaps.\n\nLooking at the last token, it's t33. So which non-terminal can produce t33? Looking at the rules, NT2 -> 't33'. So the last step would have been replacing NT2 with 't33'.\n\nSo, the last step was: ... -> ... NT2 -> ... t33.\n\nBefore that, the previous step must have been something that produced NT2 and something else, but considering that NT2 was the only thing leading to t33, perhaps the previous string would have been ... NT2.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to approach this more systematically.\n\nLet's try to build a parse tree step by step. Starting with the entire string and trying to find which non-terminals can decompose into it.\n\nBut with 7 tokens, it's a bit complex. Let me see if there's a pattern or some production that can give me a way to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the root production and see if it can generate this string through a series of expansions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So the first step is S -> NT3 NT9 or S -> NT3 NT2.\n\nLet's explore both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, the first step gives us NT3 and NT9. Each of these can be expanded further.\n\nNT3 leads to, say, NT6 NT2, or other options. Let's see what NT9 can produce. Looking at the rules, NT9 -> 't75' or other combinations. Wait, yes, NT9 is either 't75', or other combinations like NT9 -> NT7 NT9 or NT9 -> NT6 NT1.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t40. So, let's check if any of these can produce t40.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT9 -> 't75' and other combinations. Hmm, 't75' is a terminal, but the first token is t40, so perhaps NT3 leads to a t40.\n\nLooking at NT3, one of its productions is NT3 -> NT0 NT7. Then NT0 can produce t13 or other non-terminals. But in the string, the first token is t40. Maybe we need to find a path where NT3 leads to something that can produce t40.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules: NT0 -> NT1 NT3, or others. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the entire string. The first token is t40. Let's see what can produce t40.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nNT7 -> 't40'\n\nNT5 -> 't91'\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nNT1 -> 't25'\n\nNT2 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't30'\n\nNT5 -> 't91'\n\nNT4 -> 't88' (and other NT4 rules)\n\nNT7 -> 't40'\n\nSo, t40 is produced by NT7.\n\nNow, since we're at the start, which is S, and S can produce NT3 NT9.\n\nIf the first token is t40, which comes from NT7, perhaps the initial step is S -> NT7 NT7 or something else, but looking back, S only goes to NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. No direct NT7.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. S's first production is NT3 NT9, which is not NT7. So the initial step can't produce a t40 directly unless NT3 or NT9 can produce t40. But looking at the rules, I don't see NT3 or NT9 directly producing t40. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me check. Do any of the non-terminals NT3 or NT9 have a production that includes a t40? Looking through the rules:\n\nNT9 has a production that goes to 't75' or other non-terminals, not t40. Similarly, NT3 can go to non-terminals that might eventually produce t40 via some chain, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first token t40 is from a non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI think the best approach here is to use the CYK algorithm because it efficiently checks if a string belongs to the language of a CFG in CNF. The CYK algorithm takes the string length and the rules, then tries to fill a table to determine if all symbols can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the string length is 8 (counting each `t` as an element), the CYK table will be of size 8x8. Each cell (i,j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nBut manually applying the CYK algorithm might be time-consuming, so I need a smarter approach. Maybe I can identify each terminal in the string and see if there's a production rule in the grammar that leads to it, then backtrack to see if the entire string can be generated through these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several production rules where a non-terminal immediately produces a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT0 -> t13\n- NT6 -> t34\n- NT9 -> t75\n- NT8 -> t52\n- NT7 -> t40\n\nThese are all cases where a non-terminal directly produces a single terminal. So, if the string contains any of these terminals, I can find the corresponding non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLet's break down the string into terms: [t65, t8, t34, t23, t40, t70, t25, t14].\n\nI'll list each terminal and see if it's present as a terminal in the grammar:\n\n- t65: Looking through the productions, I see NT6 -> 't65' (probably from NT6: production rule ending with 't65')\n- t8: I don't see any production rule that produces 't8' directly. Wait, let me check. Hmm, in the grammar, I don't see NT6 being 't8', but wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT6: 't8' is from NT6->'t8' or is it? Wait, looking back at the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\nNT6 -> 't8' (I think). Let me check line by line. Yes, there's a line NT6 -> 't8' (looking again: NT2 -> 't8', but NT6 has NT6 -> 't8' as one of its productions? Wait, actually, looking through the grammar provided, in the later parts, I see lines like:\n\nNT6 -> 't8' (I think). Wait, looking more carefully: Yes, in the later part, I see NT6 -> 't8' is present. So yes, NT6 can directly produce 't8'.\n\nSimilarly:\n- t34 comes from NT0 -> 't13'? Wait, in the grammar, looking, I see NT0 -> 't13'. So 't34' is another terminal, which I need to find.\n\nWait, but wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, let me recheck the terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT0 -> 't13'\nNT9 -> 't75'\nNT8 -> 't52'\nNT7 -> 't40'\n\nBut there's no direct production for 't34' in the grammar. Wait, that's not right. Let me look again. Oh, in the grammar, I see NT0 -> 't13' and NT6 -> 't8', but I don't see 't34' being a terminal. Wait, but wait, perhaps the string is wrong, or I misread.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar provided by the user:\n\nLine 14: NT6 -> 't8'\n\nLine earlier: NT0 -> 't13', etc.\n\nBut looking through all the grammar productions, in the latter parts, I see lines like:\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nYes, but I don't see NT6 producing 't34'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn the grammar, under the productions, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nNT6 -> 't34' ? Or is it 't8' as I thought?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the grammar rules as given by the user.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the later parts are:\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nNT6 -> 't8' ?\n\nWait, no, I think I miscalculated. Let me list the grammar rules carefully.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar. Let me try again.\n\nIn the provided grammar, the user lists several production rules ending with various terminals. For example:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT8 -> 't37' (twice)\n- NT0 -> 't22' ?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake. The user hasn't provided all the grammar rules, but from what I can see, in the grammar, there's a production like:\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nAnd another one like:\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nBut in the grammar provided, I don't see a production that produces t34 directly. Wait, perhaps t34 is produced by NT3.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT3 -> 't30', but not t34. Wait, but maybe t34 comes from some other production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at each production ending with a terminal and note which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\nGo through each production rule that ends with a terminal and note:\n\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT8 -> 't37'\n- NT7 -> 't65' ? Wait, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Maybe I should look for each terminal in the string and see if any grammar production ends with it.\n\nGiven the string: t65, t8, t34, t23, t40, t70, t25, t14.\n\nSo for each token:\n\n- t65: We need a production that ends with 't65'. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for a production rule that ends with 't65' \u2013 I don't see any such production. Wait, unless perhaps NT6 or another non-terminal produces 't65'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Looking through the grammar rules:\n\nWait, the last entries in the grammar include:\n\n NT9 -> 't75'\n NT8 -> 't37'\n NT9 -> 't60'\n NT7 -> 't70'\n NT1 -> 't40'\n NT0 -> 't13'\n\nWait, that's not correct because in the problem statement, many production rules end with 't' followed by two single-digit numbers or more. So NT9 -> 't60' would produce 't60', perhaps. Wait, perhaps I'm not parsing the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, in the grammar, many production rules end with 't' followed by two digits, e.g., NT9 -> 't75'.\n\nSo, for the terminal 't65', does any production produce it?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't70'\n\nWait, no. Wait, does any non-terminal produce 't65'? Looking through the list:\n\nNT9 -> 't77'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the exact productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't65' is produced by NT9, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't65' is produced by NT9 as per the last lines:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the last lines include:\n\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT1 -> 't40'\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nSo, no, 't65' is not a terminal of any rule I can see.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-135","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. First, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. That's good because it simplifies the analysis, and I might be able to use a recursive descent approach or something like that.\n\nThe string to check is: `t13 t40 t34 t37 t10 t37 t40 t70`. So there are eight tokens here, all terminals since the grammar is in CNF and all rules are to terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nLet's start by looking at the top-level start symbol, which is S. The two possible productions for S are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Since S starts the string, it must expand into two non-terminals. Let me see the first token is t13, so I need to find which non-terminal can produce t13. Looking through the rules, NT0 \u2192 t13, and NT9 \u2192 t75. Also, NT3 \u2192 t30, which doesn't match. So the first part must be NT0 giving t13. But looking at the production, the start symbol S is followed by NT3 and NT9, but here the first token is t13, which would need to come from NT0. Wait, that's a problem because S's first production is NT3 followed by NT9, and if the string starts with t13, then the first step must be S \u2192 NT0? No, because S's productions don't have NT0. Wait, perhaps I got the structure wrong.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the productions. The grammar actually has S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Wait, no, looking back: the user provided a list of productions, and indeed, S can only produce two options. Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking through the productions, the user wrote:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nSo S can produce either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. But the string starts with t13, which is an end-of-terminal, so perhaps the NT3 or NT2 can derive t13.\n\nLooking at the NT3 productions, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and further down NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8, etc. So NT3 seems to break down into non-terminals, but I don't see any path that ends with t13. Wait, looking again, I see that NT0 \u2192 t13 is a terminal production. So perhaps NT0 can be part of NT3 or some other non-terminal. But wait, where does NT3 go?\n\nWait, looking through all the NT3 rules, I only see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n...\nAnd further down, another NT3 production to NT0 NT7. So wait, maybe I missed that. Let me go through the nt3 productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nWait, and near the bottom:\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\nYes, so NT3 can derive NT0 NT7. Since NT0 \u2192 t13, then this means if we have NT3, it can eventually produce t13 and NT7.\n\nBut wait, according to S's productions, S starts with NT3 or NT2. The string starts with t13, which comes from NT0, which is in the NT3 production. So let's suppose the first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first symbol is NT3, which can produce t13 and NT7.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\nSo we have NT3 and NT9 as the top-level. The first symbol is t13, which is the result of NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7 \u2192 t13 and NT7.\n\nThen, we move to NT9, which can produce t75, t22, t14, etc. But in our string, the second token is t40. Let's see what NT9 can derive. Looking through the NT9 rules, I see NT9 \u2192 t75, but also NT9 \u2192 't' followed by other numbers, like 't75', 't60', but in our string, the second token is t40, which isn't a terminal directly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconstruct the entire parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string: t13 t40 t34 t37 t10 t37 t40 t70.\n\nStep 1: The entire string is `t13 t40 t34 t37 t10 t37 t40 t70`.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Let's pick S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNow, we'll parse NT3 and NT9 separately.\n\nNT3: To start, the next token is t13.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT3, one of them is NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. Then NT0 \u2192 t13, and NT7 \u2192 t10 or other values.\n\nSo, NT3 can produce t13 (via NT0) and then NT7. So let's see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, which would produce t13 and NT7.\n\nSo, the first token is t13 (from NT0). Now, the next symbol is t40, which must come from NT7. Let's check what NT7 can produce.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT7, I see:\n- NT7 \u2192 NT6 NT5\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT8\n- NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT1\nAlso, NT7 \u2192 't' followed by some numbers, like 't40', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, in the string after t13 comes t40. So if NT7 can produce t40 directly, that's possible. Looking at the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 't40' is not directly a production because in the list, the productions for NT7 are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT6 NT5\nNT7 \u2192 NT0 NT8\nNT7 \u2192 NT1 NT1\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\n\nWait, yes, I think there is a production NT7 \u2192 't40'. Let me check the list again:\n\nLooking through the NT7 rules:\nNT7 \u2192 NT6 NT5\nNT7 \u2192 NT0 NT8\nNT7 \u2192 NT1 NT1\nNT7 \u2192 't40' (yes, this exists)\nSo, yes, NT7 can directly produce 't40'.\n\nSo, after NT3's t13 (from NT0) comes t40 (from NT7). So far, we have:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9 \u2192 t13 t40 ...\n\nNext, the third token is t34. Now, the part after NT9 needs to produce this. Let's see what NT9 can produce.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT9:\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9 (this is recursive, so it can produce 't75' or other terminals)\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\nWait, the specific tokens in the string are t34, t37, t10, etc.\n\nLooking through the NT9 rules, do any of them produce t34 or t37?\n\nWait, I don't see a direct NT9 \u2192 't34' or 't37' from the rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the NT9 rules, I see:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n- NT9 \u2192 't22'\n- Other t's like t91, etc., but not t34 or t37.\n\nHmm, so maybe NT9 is derived from another non-terminal that can produce t34 or t37.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the first split isn't S \u2192 NT3 NT9, but S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nLet me try this alternate path.\n\nAt the first step, S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let's try S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nThe first token is t13, which needs to come from NT3 or NT2.\n\nLooking at NT3, as before, NT3 can derive t13 via NT0 NT7. But let's check if the NT2 can produce t13. Looking for NT2 rules:\n\nNT2 rules include:\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT1 NT2\n- Others, but the direct productions don't send NT2 to t13. So likely, it's the NT3 that produces t13.\n\nSo back to S \u2192 NT3 NT2, the first token is t13 (from NT3).

CNF also has no chain productions or epsilon productions, so each production is two non-terminals transforming into two symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, so the goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nThe given string is: t41, t42, t90, t91, t40, t40, t99, t19, t37.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the start, looking for possible non-terminals that can produce these terminals.\n\nStarting with S, it can produce NT3 NT9. Let's see what NT3 and NT9 derive into.\n\nLooking for NT3 productions: from the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 and NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 can produce multiple things.

Similarly, t42 comes from NT4 \u2192 t42.\n\nBut wait, the top-level production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Let's check if the initial productions can break down into this.\n\nSo S is two non-terminals: NT3 and NT9.\n\nWe need to see if 't41 t42...' can be produced by NT3 and NT9.\n\nLet's take the first part: t41 and t42. If NT3 produces t41, perhaps through NT8, and then NT9 produces t42 somehow. But wait, NT9's production for t42 isn't present. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, in the NT9 productions, there's one where NT9 \u2192 't75', but also NT4 \u2192 't42'. Hmm, but t42 is a terminal, so it's only directly produced by the rule NT4 \u2192 't42'.\n\nBut if we're starting with NT3, which can produce t41 through NT8 \u2192 't41', right? So let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to derive the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t41 t42 t90 t91 t40 t40 t99 t19 t37. Let's note that this is a sequence of 9 terms.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So S can produce two parts, which should then each be terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nBut let's see: each production has exactly two symbols, so each step of derivation builds the string by consuming symbols two at a time. Wait, no: in the context of top-down parsing with CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So each step in the derivation consumes one non-terminal and replaces it with two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nBut since this is a top-down grammar, we can attempt to match the string from the top.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to check whether each terminal in the string can be produced by some non-terminal, and see if the structure fits.\n\nLooking at t41: it's produced by NT8 \u2192 't41'. So that's straightforward.\n\nt42 is produced by NT4 \u2192 't42'.\n\nThen t90: looking at NT9 \u2192 't90' is one of its productions. So t90 is from NT9.\n\nt91: NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, and NT1 \u2192 't40' or others. Alternatively, looking for t91 in the NT9 productions, I don't see a direct production for t91, but perhaps it's from another path. Wait, NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT8? No, looking at the rules, NT9 has productions like NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1, etc. So perhaps t91 is from some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list the possible sources for each token in the string.\n\nToken Sequence: t41 t42 t90 t91 t40 t40 t99 t19 t37.\n\nt41 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 't41'\n\nt42 \u2192 NT4 \u2192 't42'\n\nt90 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 't90'\n\nt91 \u2192 Hmm, I need to see if any non-terminal produces 't91'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any non-terminals have 't91'?\n\nLooking at the list, I see that NT9 can produce other non-terminals, but 't91' doesn't appear directly. Wait, let me check the productions for each non-terminal. Oh, perhaps I missed it. Or perhaps it's part of a chain.\n\nWait, let's look for 't91'. Checking the grammar, looking for 't91' as a terminal in any production.\n\nI don't see 't91' as a terminal in the given productions, which suggests that I might have made a mistake. Because if 't91' is in the string, it must come from a production that includes it as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me look back at the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nWait, but I don't see any production that directly produces t91. So perhaps the string contains a terminal that's not present in the grammar. If that's the case, then the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait no, looking again, 't91' is actually one of the symbols. So I need to check if any non-terminal's production includes 't91' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see 't91' as a terminal. Only t75, t40, etc. So perhaps 't91' isn't a terminal, meaning the string contains a terminal that's not in the grammar's terminal symbols.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce t75, t40, etc. So if the string includes 't91', it must be generated by a non-terminal that directly produces 't91' as a terminal, which I don't see in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, none of the non-terminals have a production that directly outputs 't91'. The productions only show t91 in the case of NT8 \u2192 't91'? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, actually, I don't see an NT8 \u2192 't91' production. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT9 \u2192 't91'? Or any other non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the production list:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't41', 't42', 't52', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking up, I see that some non-terminals produce t52, like NT8 \u2192 't52'. But t91 is not directly produced by any non-terminal. So perhaps 't91' is not a terminal, meaning the string contains a terminal that isn't allowed by the grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because the grammar's productions only include certain terminals. So if the string includes a terminal that isn't present, it's invalid.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, the only terminals are t40, t42, t52, t37, t75, etc. So 't91' is not one of those. Therefore, the string contains a terminal that's not present in the grammar, meaning the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be the case because the string ends with t37, and in the grammar, t37 is a terminal (one of the productions, like NT2 \u2192 't37').\n\nWait, I must have missed where 't91' is produced. Let me check all the terminal productions again.\n\nLooking back through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at each line where a non-terminal produces a terminal:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't41'\n- NT4 \u2192 't42'\n- NT1 \u2192 't40' (is that correct?

{"custom_id":"request-159","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string \"t90 t99 t99 t52 t25 t40 t30 t34 t23\" can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, context-free grammars are all about generating strings through a series of productions, and since this grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single symbol or two symbols. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. That might help because maybe the parse is easier since each non-terminal's expansion increases the depth evenly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are some production rules that map directly to terminals. For example, NT0 \u2192 't13', NT1 \u2192 't25', etc. So the string is made up of these terminal symbols, which probably come from different non-terminals.\n\nThe string given has nine tokens: t90, t99, t99, t52, t25, t40, t30, t34, t23. So the length of the string is 9, which is an odd number. Since each production in CNF either replaces a non-terminal into two symbols or a terminal, let's think about how the length of the string relates to the derivations.\n\nEach production either replaces a non-terminal into two symbols (increasing the length by 1) or into a terminal (no change). Starting from the start symbol S, which probably starts a tree that eventually leads to the string. Since the string has 9 symbols, the starting non-terminal must have a tree that can produce 9 symbols. \n\nIn Chomsky normal form, the length of the derived string relates to the number of steps. If a grammar is in CNF, then the number of symbols in the derived string is one more than the number of productions used for each non-terminal. For example, if a non-terminal starts with S, which may have two symbols, and each symbol can expand further. \n\nBut wait, the start symbol S is part of the initial productions as S -> NT3 NT9. So the first step is S => NT3 NT9. Then each NT3 and NT9 can expand further.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check each terminal in the string and see if they can be derived by the non-terminals.\n\nt90, t99, t25, t40, t30, t34, t23 are terminals. We need to see if any of the non-terminals produce these.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, there's NT9 \u2192 't75', but not t90. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't33', NT4 \u2192 't88', etc. Oh, wait, the string has t90, which might come from NT0\u2192t13 or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me see the rules again. For example:\n\nNT9 -> 't75', but also NT9 has other productions. So maybe NT9 can expand into t75, but that's not in the string. Hmm, but perhaps the string starts with NT9 producing something that then further expands to t90.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT9 has a production like NT9 \u2192 NT9 a, but in the given grammar, I see that some NT9 have rules like NT9 \u2192 NT9 't75'? Or maybe I should check each line.\n\nLooking through the list: \n\nNT9 has a rule NT9 \u2192 't75', and another NT9 \u2192 't22', and also NT9 has rules starting with NT9 NT... like NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9... Yes, so NT9 can either be a terminal or further expand into other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, t90 is a terminal, and I need to see which non-terminals produce t90. Looking through the rules, I see NT3 \u2192 't30', NT1 \u2192 't40', NT7 \u2192 't70', NT6 \u2192 't65', NT0\u2192t13, etc. So perhaps t90 is produced by a non-terminal. Let's check.\n\nIn the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t90 except maybe through a chain. Let me search for the rules involving 't90'.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT2 \u2192 't33', NT1 \u2192 't40', NT3 \u2192 't30', NT6 \u2192 't8', etc. Not t90 yet.\n\nWait, maybe through NT9. Because in the rules, there's a NT9 \u2192 NT9't75', but not directly to t90. Hmm, perhaps I need to traverse the grammar to see if any non-term can expand to t90.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the string has 9 tokens. Since each production can either add one or two symbols, starting from S which is two symbols (NT3 and NT9), each subsequent step can either keep the count the same or increase it. For a string length of 9, starting from 2, how many productions would that take? Let's think in terms of the derivation depth.\n\nIf each production that adds two symbols would cause the count to increase by 1, then to get from 2 to 9, we need 7 steps (since 2 + 7 =9). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the tree has a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed using the grammar, and each step should match a production.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nLet's list the tokens: t90, t99, t99, t52, t25, t40, t30, t34, t23.\n\nI'll try to go from left to right.\n\n1. The first token is t90. So I need a production that starts with t90. Looking at the rules, is there any production that has t90?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13', so no.\n- NT1 \u2192 't40', which is t40, not t90.\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', t34, etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't30', nt6 \u2192 't65', nt4 \u2192 't88', nt0 \u2192 't13', etc. Hmm, can't find a rule that produces t90.\n\nWait, that's a problem because if the first token is t90, but no non-terminal directly produces t90, then the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t90 is produced via a longer chain. Let me see if any non-terminal can generate t90 through a chain of productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't70' and 't65', not t90.\n- NT6 \u2192 't65', nt0\u2192't13', nt3\u2192't30', nt1\u2192't40', nt2\u2192't37', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look for any rule that can chain to produce t90.\n\nWait, perhaps t90 is produced by expanding some non-terminal multiple times. Let's look for any rules where a non-terminal can eventually produce t90.\n\nLooking at the initial productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nAssuming S is the start, the first step is NT3 and NT9. Let's see what NT9 can produce. Wait, NT9 rules include rules that start with NT9, meaning it's recursive.\n\nBut without a rule that eventually leads to t90, I might conclude that NT9 can't produce t90, so the string starts with t90, which can't be derived from any production, so the string is invalid.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking for any rule that starts with NT9 and eventually produces t90. Wait, looking at the rules for NT9:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT9:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT3 NT8 | NT6 NT1 | NT7 NT9 | NT8 NT3.\n\nWait, none of these seem to directly produce t90. However, maybe through a chain.\n\nLooking at NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1. So let's see NT6 and NT1.\n\nNT6 has rules: NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 | NT3 NT5 | NT4 NT5.\n\nWait, NT3 can produce t30, NT8 can produce 't37', etc. Not t90.\n\nAlternatively, NT1 has rules: NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8 | NT2 NT1.\n\nNT4 has rules: NT4\u2192NT7 NT0 | NT2 NT1.\n\nThis chain can go on, but I'm not seeing a direct way to produce t90 from any of these.\n\nHmm, that suggests that t90 cannot be generated, so the string is invalid.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT2: NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT6, NT7 NT7, etc. Not relevant.\n\nNT3: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 etc.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-173","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. It's a CFG in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol followed by two non-terminals. This form is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply certain algorithms like CYK.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. S has two options:\n1. NT3 NT9\n2. NT3 NT2\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with NT3 followed by either NT9 or NT2. Now, I'll look at the string provided: `t30 t19 t99 t23 t8 t8 t23 t10 t40 t40`.\n\nLet me split the string into tokens for clarity: [t30, t19, t99, t23, t8, t8, t23, t10, t40, t40]. Each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nSince the string starts with t30, I need to check if t30 can be derived from NT3. Looking at the productions for NT3, I see this rule:\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\nSo, t30 must come from NT3, which leads to NT0 and NT7. Let me check the options for NT0 and NT7.\n\nLooking at NT0: The productions are multiple, but let me see if any of them can lead to t30. For example, looking at NT0 -> NT1 NT3 and NT0 -> NT2 NT2, etc. Wait, but I'm focusing on the starting step which is t30, so it must come from NT3->NT0 NT7.\n\nSo, the first part is t30, which is the result of NT0 NT7. Now, I need to check if NT0 can be t30 or if NT7 can be t30, but in reality, both NT0 and NT7 are non-terminals that can produce t30. Wait, no, in the grammar, some non-terminals are terminal when fully expanded. Let's look at which symbols produce t30.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t30. Wait, let me check the end productions. The rules for NT0 include several that end up as terminals, like NT0 -> 't01' (wait, no, but in the problem statement, I see several rules where non-terminals expand into terminals, for example, NT6 -> 't8', which is a terminal. Wait, perhaps I misread the rules.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules in the grammar are:\n\nNT0 -> NT1 NT3\nNT0 -> NT2 NT2\nND0 -> NT4 NT0 (probably a typo, should be NT0)\nAnd also NT0 -> NT5 NT7\nWait, looking more carefully, in the full list, there are rules like NT0 -> NT1 NT3, NT0 -> NT2 NT2, NT0 -> NT5 NT7, NT0 -> NT4 NT0 (but that's a typo perhaps). Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that NT0 has the following rules:\nNT0 -> NT1 NT3\nNT0 -> NT5 NT7\nNT0 -> NT4 NT0 (this seems like a typo; maybe it's supposed to be NT0 or another terminal)\nWait, no, in the first part, the user input seems to have a lot of rules, maybe with typos. Let me parse them correctly.\n\nLooking through the list more carefully, I see some rules that are not CHNF. Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, each production is A -> BC or A -> a, where B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking specifically, for example, NT8 -> 't52' is a terminal, so that's a terminal production. Similarly, NT0 -> 't13' is a terminal production, so that's when the non-terminal NT0 is expanded to the terminal 't13'. So, if a non-terminal is in a production that ends with a terminal, then that non-terminal represents that single terminal.\n\nBut for t30, which is the first token, I need to see if it's produced by any non-terminal. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't30', except perhaps in some expansion of another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but perhaps the derivation is such that NT0 can be t30, but the production rules for NT0 include, for instance, NT0 -> 't13', but none directly to t30. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT3 rule leads to NT0 and NT7. So, t30 is generated by NT3 -> NT0 NT7. So, now, the first step is: S -> NT3 NT2, but in this case, the first token is t30, so S -> NT3 NT9 would lead to the first two symbols being produced by NT3 and NT9.\n\nWait, no, the string starts with t30, so S must have started with NT3. Let's think again.\n\nWait, S can be either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nThe string starts with t30, so the first symbol is t30, which must come from NT3's expansion, because both production starts with NT3.\n\nSo, S -> NT3 NT9: The first token is t30, so NT3 must produce t30 followed by NT9. But looking at NT3's rules, it's NT3 -> NT0 NT7. Therefore, to get t30, NT0 must produce t30.\n\nLooking through the grammar, it seems none of the non-terminals directly produce t30. Wait, but perhaps in an expansion, so when NT0 is expanded, it produces 't13' or other terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check the non-terminals that can produce t30.\n\nLooking at each rule, none except for terminal rules can directly produce t30. Therefore, perhaps t30 cannot be generated unless it's a terminal, but in the given grammar, none of the non-terminals produce t30 as a terminal.\n\nThis would imply that the string cannot be generated because t30 is not present as a terminal in any of the rules. So, the string starts with t30, which cannot be derived from any production, hence the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check if any rule allows for t30 as a terminal symbol. Scanning through all the production rules provided:\n\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT1 -> 't25'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\nWait, wait, looking at the rules in the user's message, under non-terminals, there is one where:\n\nNT3 -> 't30'\n\nWait, let me look again. The user provided rules include:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n\nSo, NT3 can produce the terminal 't30'. Therefore, the initial step S -> NT3 NT2, and then NT3 can be expanded to 't30', and then NT2 can be the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the string starts with t30, which would come from NT3, but if S's first option is NT3 NT9, then the first symbol is t30 (from NT3), and the second symbol is t19 (from NT9).

Hmm, this can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except for the terminals. That helps because I can apply the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm parses the string and determines if it can be derived from the start symbol of the grammar.\n\nLet me recall how the CYK algorithm works. It builds a table where each cell (i,j) represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring starting at position i and ending at position j. We initialize the table with the non-terminals that directly produce a single terminal symbol. Then, for each possible substring length, we compute cells based on previous cells, checking if combinations of non-terminals from adjacent cells can produce the next symbol.\n\nSo, the string we're dealing with is \"t90 t23 t8 t37 t25 t30 t65 t22 t52 t60\". Let's count the tokens. There's a total of 10 tokens, so the length n is 10. We'll create a table with rows and columns from 0 to 9, each cell (i,j) for i \u2264 j.\n\nFirst, I need to map each token to the non-terminals that produce them. Looking through the grammar rules, each terminal is generated by a specific non-terminal. Let's list them:\n\n- t90: NT9\n- t23: NT8\n- t8: NT8\n- t37: NT8\n- t25: NT1\n- t30: NT3\n- t65: NT0\n- t22: NT9\n- t52: NT8\n- t60: NT7\n\nWait, let's verify each one:\n\n- t90: Looking at the grammar, NT1 -> 't40', but that's not it. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, looking at the rules, for example, NT9 -> 't75', but in the string, we have t90, t23, etc. Let me check the production rules for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to go through each token and see which non-terminal can produce it. Since the grammar is given, I can look at each production and see where the terminals appear on the right-hand side. Alternatively, whenever a non-terminal's production includes a terminal, that terminal can be derived from that non-terminal.\n\nLooking through each grammar production:\n\n- S -> NT3 NT9\n- S -> NT3 NT2\n- NT8 -> NT0 NT2\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT4 -> NT7 NT0\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT1 -> NT4 NT8\n- NT7 -> NT5 NT4\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT7 -> NT0 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT1 NT3\n- NT5 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT2\n- NT1 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT6\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT8\n- NT5 -> NT7 NT5\n- NT2 -> NT3 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT2 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT8\n- NT5 -> NT0 NT1\n- NT7 -> NT6 NT5\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT7 -> NT6 NT5\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT0 NT1\n- NT6 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT2 -> NT1 NT2\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT0\n- NT9 -> 't40'  -- Wait, no, the last lines of the production rules show that some NT's produce a single terminal. Looking back: Yes, several production rules have a terminal as their RHS, e.g., NT9 -> 't40', etc.\n\nWait, no. Let me go line by line:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the last few lines:\n\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n- NT7 -> 't19'\n- NT7 -> 't12'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n- NT3 -> 't90'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT7 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't42'\n- NT9 -> 't22'\n- NT9 -> 't14'\n- NT4 -> 't99'\n- NT8 -> 't23'\n- NT5 -> 't37'\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let me parse this correctly. Each line ends with a production rule. So, the lines towards the end are the rules for NT2, NT3, etc., which produce specific terminals. For example:\n\nNT9 -> 't75' (but wait, in the string we have t75? Let me check the string again. The string is t90 t23 t8 t37 t25 t30 t65 t22 t52 t60. So t25 is in the string, but I don't see t75. Hmm, but maybe I got this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should restate: Each production rule where a non-terminal produces a single terminal is as follows:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules:\n\nNT9 -> 't75' (line before last)\nNT2 -> 't33' (before that)\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT1 -> 't40'\nNT7 -> 't10'\nNT7 -> 't19'\nNT7 -> 't12'\nNT4 -> 't88'\nNT2 -> 't37'\nNT3 -> 't90'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT8 -> 't41'\nNT4 -> 't42'\nNT9 -> 't22'\nNT9 -> 't14'\nNT4 -> 't99'\nNT8 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't37'\n\nWait, but in the string provided, t90, t23, t8, t37, t25, t30, t65, t22, t52, t60. So each of these is a terminal, but I need to check if each of them is produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the above list:\n\n- t90: yes, NT3 produces t90.\n- t23: NT8 produces t23.\n- t8: NT0 produces t8? Wait, looking back: NT6 -> 't8' is a single terminal production. So 't8' is produced by NT6.\n- t37: NT2 produces t37.\n- t25: looking in the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't25'? I don't see any. Hmm, that's a problem. The string contains t25, but if none of the non-terminals produce t25, then the string can't be generated. But wait, looking back, I need to check the full grammar.\n\nWait, looking through all production rules, I see:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t25:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that produce 't25' directly. So that's a red flag. If that's the case, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar because one of its elements, t25, isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me check the grammar again more carefully.

{"custom_id":"request-193","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t90 t19 t65 t41 t37 t40 t70 t8 t33 t41 t25`. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals. The terminals are on the right-hand side, and it's usually either a single terminal or two non-terminals. However, in some cases, I also remember CNF allowing terminals, but I need to check the definitions. Oh, right, in this problem, the provided grammar seems to have some rules where the non-terminals on the right-hand side are only terminals or non-terminals. Let me see the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, most of them are of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, which fits CNF. But some have two terminals, like NT9 -> 't90', but that's a rule where a non-terminal produces a single terminal. Wait, no, that would be a bit more general, but actually, in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So having a production with a single terminal is allowed and is part of the broader context-free grammar but doesn't strictly fit CNF. Hmm, perhaps I need to verify if this grammar is indeed in CNF. \n\nWait, the given grammar has rules like S -> NT3 NT9, which is two non-terminals, so that's fine. But then there are rules like NT9 -> 't90', which is a terminal. So I think this grammar is actually not in strictly Chomsky normal form because some productions produce more than two symbols\u2014they produce either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. Or wait, maybe not. Actually, no, because in CNF, the right-hand side can be a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the presence of rules that produce terminals directly is okay, as long as they only produce one terminal. So maybe this is acceptable.\n\nBut regardless, I need to parse the given string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is `t90 t19 t65 t41 t37 t40 t70 t8 t33 t41 t25`. Each word in the string is a terminal symbol, so I should see if the sequence can be formed by the grammar.\n\nTo parse this, I'll consider it as a leftmost derivation. Starting from S, which produces NT3 NT9. So the initial step would involve NT3 and NT9. \n\nLooking at NT9, in the grammar, there's a production NT9 -> 't90'. So if NT9 can directly produce 't90', that's a good start. Let me note that down: the first token is t90, so the rightmost symbol in the current NT9 must be 't90'. So NT9 is t90.\n\nNow, what does NT3 produce? Looking at the rules for NT3: \nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nand there's another rule NT3 -> 't30' as well. Hmm, but the second token in the string is t19, which isn't t30 or any apparent terminal here. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. No, because NT3 is being split into NT6 and NT2.\n\nSo after S produces NT3 NT9, and NT9 is t90, now we need to process NT3 into more components. Let's look at NT3's productions:\n- NT3 can produce NT6 NT2 or 't30'. So for the second token to be 't19', maybe NT3 must produce something else, but 't19' doesn't match 't30' or the other productions. So perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I should consider a different strategy, like building the parse tree from the string upwards to see if it can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to split the string into parts that fit the possible rule productions. Let me try to split the string into parts and see if they fit the rules.\n\nStarting with the entire string: `t90 t19 t65 t41 t37 t40 t70 t8 t33 t41 t25`\n\nMaybe the string starts with NT9 -> 't90', so that would consume the first token. Then, the remaining string is `t19 t65 t41 t37 t40 t70 t8 t33 t41 t25`. Now, the next symbol after 't90' is 't19'. So, what rule produces 't19'? Looking through the rules, I don't see 't19' on the right-hand side of any non-terminal. Wait, that can't be right because the grammar might have a rule that produces 't19' somehow. Or perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, I see: \nNT1 -> NT2 NT8\nand more, but I don't see any production that produces 't19' directly. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first NT9 is 't90', and then NT3 needs to produce the next part, which is 't19'. But looking at NT3's options: either NT6 NT2 or 't30'. Since 't19' isn't 't30' or a combination of other non-terminals, this path isn't working. Maybe I should check if I misread any rule.\n\nWait, let's check the rules again for NT3:\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n\nNo other options. So 't19' cannot be derived from NT3, meaning this path is invalid. Maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps S produces another option, but S only has two rules: NT3 NT9. So that's fixed.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake. NT3 could be NT6 NT2, and then the next part would be handled by those non-terminals. Let's try:\n\nAfter the first 't90' from NT9, the next part is t19, which is from NT3. But NT3 is NT6 NT2, so let's break those down.\n\nSo, the string becomes after t90: t19 t65 t41 t37 t40 t70 t8 t33 t41 t25.\n\nNT6 -> options:\n- NT8 NT4\n- NT1 NT3\n- NT9 NT2\n- etc. Let's pick one. Let's say NT6 -> NT8 NT4. Then the next part would be NT8 and NT4.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently, trying to find a reduction path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into tokens that correspond to the productions. Let's list the tokens in order:\n\n1. t90\n2. t19\n3. t65\n4. t41\n5. t37\n6. t40\n7. t70\n8. t8\n9. t33\n10. t41\n11. t25\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first part is NT3, and the second is NT9.\n\nNT9 \u2192 't90', so token 1 is consumed.\n\nNow, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So after 't90', we have NT6 and NT2.\n\nLet's process NT6: NT6 can produce several options. Let's choose one.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT6:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT3\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- etc. Let's see which could lead us to 't65' and other tokens.\n\nThe next token after 't90' is 't19', which is token 2, but NT6 splits into two parts, so it's part of the subtree under NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's try to break the entire string into possible splits that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't90', which comes from NT9 \u2192 't90'. So that's the first part.\n\nThe next part is 't19', which must come from NT3. Looking at NT3, the only possible production that would result in a terminal 't19' is if one of its productions produces a terminal directly. But as per the rules, NT3 only can produce NT6 NT2 or 't30'. So unless there's a production that allows NT3 to produce 't19', this path is invalid. But since there's no such production, this string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This helps in parsing and makes it easier for algorithms like CYK to process, but I'm not using a parser here, just trying to work through the string manually.\n\nLet me write down the grammar rules for clarity (not all are shown, but the ones relevant to the string):\n\nLooking at the string, I see several terminals: t65, t75, t90, t8, t23, etc. So I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me jot down the relevant rules:\n\n- NT6 -> 't65'\n- NT9 -> 't75' (twice)\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT8 -> 't8' (appears multiple times in rules)\n- NT23 is a terminal, but I don't see it directly in the rules, unless it's derived from a production. Wait, looking through the rules, I only see NT7 -> 't70', so maybe t23 is a terminal. Alternatively, maybe NT8 -> 't8' is correct, but I don't see t23 being a terminal. Wait, perhaps it's derived via another rule. Hmm, but looking through all the rules, I don't see a production for NT23. So perhaps I've missed something.\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar thoroughly. Scanning through:\n\n- NT0 has several productions, but none directly to t23. NT2 has a production NT2 -> NT8 NT9, which would be t8 t90, but I don't see a production that leads to t23. Wait, but perhaps in the left-hand side, there's something else. Looking back, for example, NT0 has NT0 -> NT2 NT2, but without a t23 in the rules, maybe I'm on the wrong track.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has t23, which might come from a production. Let me check if any rule ends with t23. Looking through the rules, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, looking carefully at the production NT2: I see NT2 -> NT6 NT8, which would be t65 t8, but that's not t23. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe there's an NT23 somewhere, but it's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a derived terminal. Or perhaps the grammar includes a rule NT2 -> NT8 NT9, which is t8 t90, but I'm not seeing t23 anywhere. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, the string includes several t23. Let me look again: in the string it's t8 t23 t75 t37 t40 t13 t23 t60. So how can we get t23? Maybe it's not a terminal but a derived symbol. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible that the grammar includes a rule where t23 is a terminal, but in the rules provided, t23 doesn't appear. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see any rule that produces t23. Therefore, perhaps t23 is part of a non-terminal that produces it. Alternatively, maybe it's a terminal and there's a rule that produces t23, but I didn't list it above. Maybe I got it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed copying all the rules correctly. Let me go back and make sure. The rules listed are:\n\nLooking at the first set:\n- S -> NT3 NT9\n- S -> NT3 NT2\n- NT8 -> NT0 NT2\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT4 -> NT7 NT0\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT7 -> NT5 NT4\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT7 -> NT0 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT1 NT3\n- NT5 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT2\n- NT1 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT6\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT8\n- NT5 -> NT7 NT5\n- NT2 -> NT3 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT2 -> NT8 NT9\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT8 -> NT2 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT0 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT8\n- NT5 -> NT0 NT1\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT5 -> NT2 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT7 -> NT6 NT5\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT0 NT1\n- NT6 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT2 -> NT1 NT2\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT0\n- NT9 -> 't40'\n- NT8 -> 't52' (this is a terminal)\n- NT0 -> 't13' (terminal)\n- NT6 -> 't34' (terminal)\n- NT1 -> 't25' (terminal)\n- NT7 -> 't40' (terminal)\n- NT5 -> 't91' (terminal)\n- NT6 -> 't65' (terminal)\n- NT3 -> 't30' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't37' (terminal)\n- NT9 -> 't75' (terminal)\n- NT2 -> 't33' (terminal)\n- NT6 -> 't8' (terminal)\n- NT1 -> 't40' (terminal)\n- NT7 -> 't10' (terminal)\n- NT1 -> 't19' (terminal)\n- NT1 -> 't12' (terminal)\n- NT4 -> 't88' (terminal)\n- NT2 -> 't37' (terminal)\n- NT3 -> 't90' (terminal)\n- NT9 -> 't60' (terminal)\n- NT7 -> 't70' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't41' (terminal)\n- NT4 -> 't42' (terminal)\n- NT9 -> 't22' (terminal)\n- NT9 -> 't14' (terminal)\n- NT4 -> 't99' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't23' (terminal)\n- NT2 -> 't37' (terminal)\n\nWait, I think I missed some. For example, earlier I thought NT8 -> 't23' is not present, but looking at the rules, I see NT8 has several productions, including NT8 -> 't23'. Wait, looking at the last parts:\n\nLooking again, among the rules towards the end:\n\n- NT8 -> 't23' is one of the productions for NT8. So that means 't23' is a terminal. So in the string, when I see t23, it's just a single terminal. That simplifies things because each occurrence must be matched by exactly that production.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each terminal must be the result of a single production.\n\nThe string to check is: t65 t75 t90 t8 t23 t75 t37 t40 t13 t23 t60.\n\nLet's break down each step.\n\n1.

So NT3 can be broken down further.\n\nNT6 -> 't65' (terminal), so when we derive from S, the first symbol is t65.\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is t65, which matches NT6's production. Therefore, the S can produce t65.\n\nBut wait, S's other productions are NT3 NT9. Wait, but in S's rules, it's either S-> NT3 NT9 or S-> NT3 NT2.

The string is `t34 t37 t30 t12 t14 t37 t99 t13 t25 t99 t90 t10`. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left or a terminal. \n\nI should start by breaking down the grammar. The start symbol is S, which has productions to NT3 NT9 and NT3 NT2. So S starts with either NT3 followed by NT9 or NT3 followed by NT2.\n\nThe string starts with t34. Looking at the grammar, t34 is derived from NT0: NT0 \u2192 't13', but wait, no, t34 is directly from NT6: NT6 \u2192 't8', but wait, no, I see that NT6 is actually NT6 -> 't34', right? Or is it? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT3 -> 't65' (wait, no, looking again, I spot that some have 't' followed by a number. For example, NT3 -> 't30', NT6 -> 't34', NT9 -> 't75', etc. So, each time a non-terminal is applied to a terminal, it's replaced by that 't' string. So t30 comes from NT3, t34 from NT6, etc.\n\nSo, the string starts with t34, which is the terminal symbol from NT6. So, looking at the grammar, NT6's productions include NT6-> NT4 NT5 and NT6-> NT3 NT6. Also, direct production is NT6 -> 't34'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t34. This must come from NT6. So the first part is NT6.\n\nThe string structure after NT6 would be the rest: t37 t30 t12 t14 t37 t99 t13 t25 t99 t90 t10. So now, the remaining string after the first NT6 is: t37 t30 t12 t14 t37 t99 t13 t25 t99 t90 t10.\n\nWait, but NT6 is one of the non-terminals, so it must be replaced by its productions. So, NT6 can produce NT4 NT5 or NT3 NT6. Let's see:\n\nIf NT6 produces NT4 NT5, then the next symbols would be the terminals derived from NT4 and NT5. So, what is NT4?\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: NT4-> NT7 NT0, NT4-> NT2 NT1, etc. It seems that NT4 doesn't produce a terminal directly. So, if NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, then NT4 must derive to terminals, but that doesn't happen because NT4's productions are non-terminals. So this seems problematic because NT4 would have to keep expanding until terminals are reached. Alternatively, perhaps NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6, which would require NT3 to produce terminals, but from earlier, NT3 can produce NT6 NT2.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t34, which is from NT6. So, the first part is:\n\nNT6 \u2192 something that produces t34.\n\nBut NT6's direct production is only 't34'. So, if NT6 is replaced directly by t34, then the rest of the string must be generated by the remaining symbols after t34. Let's check: the string after t34 is t37 t30 t12 t14 t37 t99 t13 t25 t99 t90 t10.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the entire string is t34 t37 t30 ... So the first symbol is t34, which comes from NT6. Then the next symbol is t37, which must come from another NT. Let me map out the possible non-terminals and their terminal productions.\n\nLet me list all the NTs and their direct terminals:\n\n- NT0: 't13', 't40', 't57', 't6', 't8', 't10', 't14', 't19', 't22', 't25', 't27', 't33', 't34', 't37', 't38', 't40' etc. Wait, actually, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NTs are converted into terminals as follows. For example:\n\n- NT3 -> 't30' comes from one production and possibly others.

Let me check the productions:\n\nScanning through all non-terminals to see if any produce 't12':\n\nLooking at NT2's productions, I see NT2 \u2192 't37' is one of them. But 't12' isn't an immediately produced terminal. Hmm, so 't12' must be derived from some non-terminal that can chain to it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Maybe 't12' comes from NT2: Looking at NT2's productions, one of them is NT2\u2192 NT3 NT1. So, perhaps 't12' is reached through some expansion.\n\nWait, but let me proceed step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\n1. t34 \u2192 from NT6\n2. t37 \u2192 from NT2\n3. t30 \u2192 from NT3\n4. t12 \u2192 needs to be from some NT\n5. t14 \u2192 NT6's production includes 't14'\n6. t37 \u2192 NT2\n7. t99 \u2192 Does any NT produce 't99'? Looking at the productions, I see NT1 produces 't25', NT3 't30', NT5 't91', NT2 't37', NT4 't88', NT6 't34', NT7 't40', 't10', 't19', NT8 't52', 't41', 't42', etc. 't99' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So 't99' is not directly produced, so perhaps it must be an intermediate that can be expanded into something else, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any 't99' production.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the parsing. Let me re-examine the string:\n\nt34 t37 t30 t12 t14 t37 t99 t13 t25 t99 t90 t10.\n\nLooking at 't99' twice. So, first occurrence is after five symbols, then again after seven, and then again later.\n\nWait, but if 't99' is not directly produced, perhaps it's derived, but checking the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to 't99'.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So perhaps the string isn't valid because 't99' isn't present in any production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-215","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to evaluate. I need to determine if the string is generated by this grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky normal form means. It has two main characteristics: all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, and there are no productions with zero length on the right-hand side. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit this form since all non-terminals on the left are producing two non-terminals or terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is: `t37 t70 t41 t22 t37 t52 t25 t19 t40 t90 t8 t40`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Let's list all the productions again to make sure I have them correctly.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The grammar has several productions for S, NT0, NT1, etc., leading to terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t37 and ends with t40. I should figure out which productions can generate these terminal symbols.\n\nFirstly, I'll note that some non-terminals produce specific terminals directly. For example, NT8 \u2192 't52' and NT9 \u2192 't75', etc. So, looking at the string, t52 appears once. That would have to come from NT8, which is one of the non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string has t52, which must come from a production of NT8. Let's check the productions for NT8:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8\nNT8 \u2192 NT2 NT2\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT1\nNT8 \u2192 NT0 NT8\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT6\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT8 \u2192 NT2 NT8\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I might have miscounted. Let me check the exact productions. Wait, in the provided grammar, the NT8 productions are:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT8\nNT8 -> NT2 NT2\nNT8 -> NT6 NT1\nNT8 -> NT0 NT8\nNT8 -> NT6 NT6\nNT8 -> NT2 NT8\nWait, no, looking back, the user might have listed multiple lines for NT8. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nIn the user's grammar, the NT8 productions are:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT8\nNT8 -> NT2 NT2\nNT8 -> NT6 NT1\nNT8 -> NT0 NT8\nNT8 -> NT6 NT6\nNT8 -> NT6 NT2\nNT8 -> NT2 NT8\nWait, but in the user's list, they wrote:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT8\n\nNT8 -> NT2 NT2\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT1\n\nNT8 -> NT0 NT8\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT6\n\nNT8 -> NT2 NT8\n\nWait, perhaps there might be a duplication, but moving on.\n\nSo t52 comes from NT8's production to 't52', so that's a direct production. So the substring t52 must correspond to NT8 \u2192 't52' in the derivation.\n\nNow, looking at the entire string, I need to parse it into a sequence of terminals, and see if there's a way to split it into productions that fit the grammar.\n\nBut parsing can be a bit tricky without a specific parsing algorithm. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into the non-terminals as per the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the string as a series of t tokens. Since each production in Chomsky normal form results in two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of symbols in the string must be a power of 2 in terms of the splits. But the string here has 12 tokens. Let me see: 12 is not a power of 2, which might complicate things. Wait, but sometimes, it's possible to have a mix of direct terminals and left-recursive or other productions. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct the parse tree manually.\n\nBut this could get very complicated. Let me instead look at the entire string and see if t52 is first, which comes from NT8.\n\nSo the first symbol is t37. Wait, but the string starts with t37, which would have to come from a production leading to t37. Looking at the grammar, is there any NT that produces t37 directly? Let's check the productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't52'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't37'?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT8 has some productions leading to t37:\n\nLooking back:\n\nWait, under NT8, do you have any productions to 't37'?\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, I see:\n\nLooking for 't37' productions, I see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Looking back through the grammar, after NT8's productions:\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, I think I might have missed that NT8 does produce 't37'. Looking back, let me scan the provided grammar:\n\nYes, looking at the grammar, under NT8, there's a line: NT8 -> 't52', another line is NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8, then another line is NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT2, then NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT1, then NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT8, then NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT6, then NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT8, and I think I might have missed one, but perhaps that's all. Alternatively, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, the user listed the NT8 productions as:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT8\n\nNT8 -> NT2 NT2\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT1\n\nNT8 -> NT0 NT8\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT6\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT2\n\nNT8 -> NT2 NT8\n\nWait, but that's seven lines, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the original grammar list:\n\nAfter NT7, it has NT8 multiple times, which seems like the user made a mistake. Let me check the user's input.\n\nWait, here's the user's grammar list as given:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n...\nNT6 -> NT8 NT4\nNT0 -> NT2 NT2\nNT1 -> NT8 NT4\nNT2 -> NT6 NT8\nNT6 -> NT9 NT2\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\nNT1 -> NT9 NT8\nNT5 -> NT7 NT5\nNT2 -> NT3 NT1\nNT4 -> NT2 NT8\nNT0 -> NT4 NT0\nNT2 -> NT5 NT0\nNT9 -> 't75'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT8 -> 't52'\nNT5 -> 't91'\nNT6 -> 't65'\nNT3 -> 't30'\nNT8 -> 't37'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT1 -> 't40'\nNT8 -> 't41'\nNT4 -> 't88'\nNT2 -> 't37'\nNT3 -> 't90'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT1 -> 't19'\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT4 -> 't88'\nNT2 -> 't37'\nNT3 -> 't90'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT8 -> 't41'\nNT4 -> 't42'\nNT9 -> 't22'\nNT9 -> 't14'\nNT4 -> 't99'\nNT8 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't37'\n\nSo, under NT8, we have:\n\nNT8 -> 't52'\n\nNT8 -> 't37'\n\nWait, yes, I see now. So NT8 can produce 't37' as well as other things. So the first symbol is t37, so that must come from NT8 \u2192 't37'.\n\nSo the string starts with t37, which comes from NT8.\n\nThen the string is t37 t70 t41 t22 t37 t52 t25 t19 t40 t90 t8 t40.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nAfter t37, we have t70, then t41, etc.\n\nSo the substring after the first t37 is t70 t41 t22 t37 t52 t25 t19 t40 t90 t8 t40.\n\nNow, the first symbol after t37 is t70, which is produced by NT7 \u2192 't70'. So t70 must come from NT7.\n\nSo now, the string is being split into t37 (NT8) followed by t70 (NT7).\n\nSo the parse would begin as NT8 t37 (from NT8 \u2192 't37"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-233","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is: `t34 t12 t30 t8 t23 t60 t41 t37 t90 t90 t34 t91 t75`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are defined by the way their non-terminals produce strings of terminals. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that some of the rules are in CNF, for example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which fits the A \u2192 BC form, and some rules like S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and others like NT8 \u2192 't52' are terminals. Wait, no, actually, it looks like some of the right-hand sides are non-terminals, others are terminals. Hmm, but in CNF, each production must be exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal for the leaves.\n\nWait, but the grammar seems a bit mixed. Some rules have more than two non-terminals, like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8 NT9? No, wait, in the given grammar, it's a list of rules, each with two parts separated by '->', so for each production, the right-hand side is a sequence. But in CNF, each production either has one terminal or two non-terminals. If any production has more than two non-terminals, that might complicate things, so I need to check.\n\nBut looking more carefully, all the rules seem to have exactly two parts on the right-hand side, except for some where it's a single terminal. For example, NT9 \u2192 't75' is a terminal, but others like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT9 are two non-terminals or a terminal? Wait, NT6 and NT9 are non-terminals, but in CNF, each production is supposed to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each production should only generate two symbols, which are either two non-terminals (then they can produce terminals in their own steps) or a single terminal.\n\nBut wait, in this case, looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT9 \u2192 't75', which is a terminal. That makes sense because some terminals are leaves in the derivation. However, other rules like S \u2192 NT3 NT9 are terminals (t34, t12, etc.) or non-terminals?\n\nWait, the question states that the string is a series of 't's followed by numbers, like t34. So each symbol in the string is a terminal. Each symbol in the string is of the form 'tX', where X is a number, so each is a distinct terminal.\n\nSo each symbol in the string is a terminal, and the non-terminals are the NTs. So for the string to be generated, every terminal in the string must be generated directly by some production rule without non-terminals in between, except for non-terminals that are expanded further.\n\nWait, no, because in a CFG, you can have non-terminals that expand into other non-terminals until you reach terminals. So each non-terminal can generate one or more terminal symbols through a series of productions.\n\nBut in the given string, each element is a single terminal, so for the string to match, each such terminal must be terminal in the grammar, or generated by a non-terminal that can derive that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some terminals are explicitly given, like NT9 \u2192 't75', NT8 \u2192 't52', NT0 \u2192 't13', etc. So these non-terminals generate those specific terminals. \n\nSo the first step is to check which terminals in the string correspond to non-terminals in the grammar that can derive them. For example, in the string, I have 't34', 't12', 't30', and so on.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT6 has a production rule \u2192 't34', so NT6 can generate 't34'. Similarly, NT0 has a rule \u2192 't13', so NT0 can generate 't13'. \n\nBut not all terminals in the string might be directly generated by a non-terminal in the grammar. For example, 't12'\u2014does any non-terminal produce 't12'? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't12'. So that's a red flag because 't12' wouldn't be generated unless it's part of some non-terminal production that can derive it through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but if none of the non-terminals produce 't12', then the string cannot be generated because 't12' is not present in any of the grammar's terminals. Let me check the grammar's terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are listed as 't34', 't52', 't13', 't90', 't8', 't23', 't60', 't41', 't37', 't75', 't10', 't19', 't42', 't22', 't33', 't70', 't88', 't23' again, 't41' again, 't99', 't29' (no, looking again, I think I'm misremembering). Wait, I need to list all the terminal productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminal rules are:\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT6 \u2192 't34'\n- NT1 \u2192 't25'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT5 \u2192 't37'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8' (Wait, wait, in the grammar, NT6 has two rules: NT6 \u2192 't34' (from the first part) and NT6 \u2192 't8' (from another part, but no, looking more carefully: NT6 has two rules: NT6 \u2192 't34' and NT6 \u2192 't8'? Or is it that in another rule, NT6 is part of a larger production that leads to 't8'? Let me check.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see:\nNT6 \u2192 't34' (probably from the beginning)\nAlso, NT6 \u2192 't8' is one of the production rules because elsewhere, NT6 is part of a production like S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which may lead to more non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-235","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string to check is `t90 t8 t70 t12 t40 t10 t37 t40 t13 t40 t65 t25 t19`.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. CNF is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since this is a manual check, I'll approach it differently.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example, NT9 \u2192 't75', and other NTs produce terminals like 't40', 't52', etc. These are terminal symbols, and the rest are non-terminals that expand into other symbols.\n\nThe string starts with 't90', which is a terminal. So I need to find which non-terminal can produce 't90'. Scanning the rules, I see that NT9 \u2192 't75' and also NT9 \u2192 't90' (looking at the rules, yes, rule NT9 -> 't75', another rule for NT9 -> 't90' exists). So, NT9 can produce 't90'.\n\nNext, the string continues with 't8'. I look for non-terminals that produce 't8'. From the rules, NT6 -> 't8' is one such production. So after 't90', the next symbol is 't8', which can come from NT6.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's 't90 t8'. So after 't90' we have 't8'. So the initial part is 't90' produced by NT9, and then 't8' from NT6. So the first two symbols are handled: t90 from NT9, t8 from NT6.\n\nNow, moving on to the next symbol: 't70'. Let's find a production for 't70'. Checking the rules, NT7 \u2192 't70' exists, so that's straightforward.\n\nSo after 't8' (NT6), the third symbol is 't70' from NT7. Now, let me check if NT7 is derived from any non-terminal. Looking back, NT7 can be derived from NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4, which are non-terminals, but then we need to see how NT5 and NT4 can produce the required symbols.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to track the entire string as a sequence of productions. Let me write down the string step by step, trying to expand each symbol.\n\nThe string is: [t90, t8, t70, t12, t40, t10, t37, t40, t13, t40, t65, t25, t19]\n\nBreaking it into individual tokens: t90, t8, t70, t12, t40, t10, t37, t40, t13, t40, t65, t25, t19.\n\nWe start with the leftmost symbol 't90', which must come from NT9 \u2192 't90' (rule 47 and 49 in the given grammar). So the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Wait, actually, the start symbol is S, which can only produce NT3 NT9 directly. So S -> NT3 NT9 at the top level.\n\nSo expanding S gives NT3 and NT9. The first symbol is 't90', which is from the NT9 part. So we need to expand NT9 to 't90' directly. So after expanding S, we have NT3 generating the first part of the string, and NT9 generating 't90'.\n\nNow, the remaining part of the string is t8, t70, t12, t40, t10, t37, t40, t13, t40, t65, t25, t19.\n\nWe just used NT9 to get 't90', so now we need to handle the remaining symbols. Let's look at the next symbols after 't90' as a whole.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it as a leftmost derivation.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT9 (from rule 1: S->NT3 NT9).\n\nWe expand NT9 first since it's a terminal. NT9 \u2192 't90'. Now, the current string we have is 't90', and we need to process the rest.\n\nSo next, the next symbol is 't8'. So we have NT3 and NT9, with NT9 done as 't90'. Now, the next part is NT3, which should generate 't8' and the next part.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions: Rule 7: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So we can expand NT3 to NT6 and NT2.\n\nSo now, the string being built is 't90' (from NT9) followed by whatever NT3 expands into. Since we chose to expand NT3 first, we now need to process NT6 and NT2.\n\nWait, no. The entire expansion is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. We first process NT3 and NT9 simultaneously. Since NT9 produces 't90', and NT3 needs to produce the next symbols.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify step by step.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9 (using rule S->NT3 NT9).\n\nNow, NT9 is directly 't90', so we have part of the string 't90'.\n\nNow, the next symbol is 't8', so we need to figure out how NT3 and NT9 can generate 't8' and the rest.\n\nSince NT9 is 't90', the next non-terminal to consider is NT3. So let's see how NT3 can expand to include 't8'.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules, the first production is NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So we can expand NT3 into NT6 and NT2. So now, S expands to NT6, NT2, 't90'.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the production S \u2192 NT3 NT9 means both NT3 and NT9 are on the stack or queue to be expanded. However, since NT9 is a terminal, we can immediately get 't90' from it. Then, we need to expand NT3 to produce the remaining symbols starting from 't8'.\n\nWait, no. The entire string is 't90 t8 ...', which suggests that after 't90' comes 't8', so we need to have NT9 \u2192 't90' and then NT3 expanding into 't8' and the rest.\n\nBut NT3 can't produce 't8' directly because in the rules, NT3's productions are all to other non-terminals. So NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So to get 't8', we must have NT2 \u2192 't8' because in production NT2 \u2192 't37' (rule?), wait no. Wait, looking at NT2's rules:\n\nLooking back, Nt2's rules include NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7, which might produce other symbols. Or other rules like NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9 which could produce 't8's and 't9's. Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT2 can produce 't37' (rule NT2 \u2192 't33')? Wait, checking the list:\n\nLooking through NT2 rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT7 (multiple times)\n- Among terminals, looking at NT9 rules, there's NT9 \u2192 't91'?

{"custom_id":"request-257","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the given grammar seems to fit that structure, as all the rules on the left side are single non-terminals and the right sides are either two non-terminals or terminal symbols.\n\nThe string provided is: t37 t34 t30 t60 t37 t10 t99 t19 t99 t37 t13 t23 t10 t22.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Each of these gives two non-terminals to expand. So the first step is to see how the string breaks down into these parts.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that each token is a terminal symbol, so I need to see if these can be derived. Let's split the string into pairs since each rule in the grammar (except S's initial rules) produces two non-terminals or terminals. Starting from S, the string would need to start with either NT3 and NT9 or NT3 and NT2. Let's see the string:\n\nt37 t34 t30 t60 t37 t10 ... etc.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens, t37 and t34. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, there's NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and NT2 has several rules, like NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9, which could lead to t37 and t34. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be broken down into the components generated by each rule. Let's start by looking at the entire string as a possible expansion of S. Since S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2, first, let's pick the second rule because if the string starts with NT3, which is represented by t37 possibly.\n\nWait, the string starts with t37. Looking at the grammar, NT3 has the production NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So the first two tokens in the string must derive from NT6 and NT2.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two are t37 and t34. So t37 could be NT6, which has production NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, and so on. I'm getting a bit confused, maybe I should make a list of all the NTs and their possible terminal expansions.\n\nWait, the grammar has a lot of non-terminals and terminals. Each terminal is represented as t followed by a number. So t37 is a terminal, and it's a result of a non-terminal having a rule that produces t37. Let's list all the non-terminals and their possible terminal expansions.\n\nLooking at NT9: In the grammar, NT9 can produce 't75', 't60', 't37', 't22', 't99', 't37', etc. Similarly, NT8 can produce various t's. Wait, I see that some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal. So for the string, each token must be the result of some production rule that ends in that terminal.\n\nLet me approach this by trying to assign each token in the string to a non-terminal and see if their productions match.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. t37: Check which non-terminals produce t37. Looking at the rules, NT8 \u2192 t37 twice, like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8 and sometimes producing t37. Also, NT3 has NT6 and NT2, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, NT8 NT4, etc. Maybe NT6 can produce t8.\nWait, let's look up each NT's possible terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t33 (NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8, and NT6 \u2192 t8 when a production rule is reached. Wait, looking at the rules, NT6 has NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 again (looks like duplicate), etc. Hmm, I might be mixing up the rules.\n\nWait, the user input is a bit messy, with some duplicates. Let me try to list each NT's possible terminal outputs accurately.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t8? Not directly. Wait, I see NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, and further down NT8 can produce various t's, but I don't see a direct rule for NT6 \u2192 t8. Hmm, maybe not. So perhaps NT6 can only produce non-terminals, except for NT6 \u2192 t65, which is another rule? Or wait, looking back, I think I might have misread. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of rules. Let me go through them systematically.\n\nStarting from NT0:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT8\n\nAnd some of their productions lead to terminals:\n\n- Looking for NT0 \u2192 't13': Yes, in the rules: NT0 \u2192 't13'\n\nSimilarly, NT1 produces t25: NT1 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT2: Look for any rules producing t's directly. Yes: NT2 \u2192 't33', NT2 \u2192 't37', NT2 \u2192 't60', etc.\n\nWait, from the rules listed, NT2 has NT2 \u2192 't33' (from line NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8, leading to more rules? Or wait, the production NT2 \u2192 't37' is in the rules? Let me check: there's NT2 \u2192 t37, yes.\n\nSo, for example, NT0 can produce t13 directly.\n\nOkay, now let's go back to the string:\n\nt37 t34 t30 t60 t37 t10 t99 t19 t99 t37 t13 t23 t10 t22\n\nI'll process each token step by step, trying to see if it fits a production.\n\nStarting with the first token, t37. So the first non-terminal must produce t37. Looking at the grammar, NT2 produces t37, as well as NT6 \u2192 t8? Wait, no, looking at the rules carefully:\n\nLooking for any rule that directly produces t37.\n\nIn the rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t37 (twice, from lines NT2 \u2192 t37)\n- NT8 \u2192 t37 (from lines NT8 \u2192 t37)\n- NT3 \u2192 t30 (from line NT3 \u2192 t30)\n- NT6 \u2192 t65 (line NT6 \u2192 t65)\n- Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the rules provided, there's:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t8? Or wait, let's check:\n\nNo, looking through, I don't see any direct rules for NT6 \u2192 t8. Let me list all the direct terminal productions:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t13\n- NT1 \u2192 t25\n- NT2 \u2192 t33, t37, t60, t22, t99, t14, t88, t8, t99 (multiple times)\n- NT3 \u2192 t30, t7, t38 (not sure, but looking at the rules, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and then from NT6 and NT2, perhaps)\nWait, actually, focusing on the direct rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t13\n- NT1 \u2192 t25\n- NT2 \u2192 t33, t37, t60, t22, t99 (several times)\n- NT6 \u2192 t65, t8 (from NT6 \u2192 t65 and looking for others)\nWait, I think I might need to create a list of production rules that map each non-terminal to its possible terminal(s).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the entire string and see if it can be built by the grammar.\n\nLet me try a different approach: the string starts with t37 t34. Wait, no: the string is t37 t34 t30 t60 t37 t10..., so the first two tokens are t37 and t34.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t37?

{"custom_id":"request-250","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided CFG. Let me start by understanding the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I can see that all the productions are either two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right, except for some which seem to have a non-terminal in the right-hand side beyond two. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are to two non-terminals except for terminals. So perhaps the given grammar is in a slightly modified form, but overall, it fits CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t37 t33 t91 t65 t37 t90 t30 t8 t90 t13 t42 t12 t40`.\n\nFirst, I should note that the terminals in the string are numerical, so each token is a terminal, and I have to check if there's a way the grammar can generate this sequence.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string starting from the initial symbol S and see if we can derive the entire string using the given productions. Alternatively, I can try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet's first look at the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So the initial production of S will result in two non-terminals being pushed to the stack. However, since the string starts with t37, let's see which non-terminals can produce t37.\n\nLooking through the productions, terminals are listed under the non-terminals. For example, NT8 -> 't52', so NT8 can produce 't52'. Similarly, NT3 -> 't30', so NT3 can produce 't30'. Wait, but the string starts with 't37', which isn't a terminal in any of the productions I see. Wait, let me check the productions again. Wait, in the grammar, under NT2, there's NT2 -> 't33'. Also, NT3 -> 't30', and NT8 -> 't37' maybe? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't30' (as per the user's provided grammar)\nNT9 -> 't75' \nAnd looking for 't37', perhaps NT8 can produce 't37'? Let's check: under NT8, there are productions leading to various non-terminals, but I don't see 't37' listed directly as a terminal from NT8. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see under NT8 several rules like NT8 -> NT6 NT8, and so on, and also some like NT8 -> 't37'. Let me check: yes, looking at the productions, under NT8, there is a rule NT8 -> 't37' which I had missed earlier.\n\nSo NT8 can produce 't37'. Similarly, NT6 can produce 't65' (look at NT6's productions, I see NT6 -> 't8'), wait no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, for NT6: \n- NT6 -> 't8' (I see this: `NT6 -> 't8'`) and also `NT6 -> NT3 NT6` and `NT6 -> NT4 NT5`. So NT6 can produce 't8' as a terminal, but not sure about 't65'. Wait, 't65' is a terminal that NT6 can produce? Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through all the NT6 productions: the only terminal is 't8' in `NT6 -> 't8'`. So unless another production leads directly to 't65', which isn't listed, perhaps NT6 cannot produce 't65' directly. Hmm, but in the string, after 't37' comes 't33', which is NT2's terminal. Let me think.\n\nThe string is: t37 t33 t91 t65 t37 t90 t30 t8 t90 t13 t42 t12 t40.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the productions for NT8. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT8 has several rules, including `NT8 -> NT6 NT8` and others, but also `NT8 -> 't52'` and `NT8 -> 't37'`. So NT8 can directly produce 't52' and 't37' as terminals. Therefore, 't37' is the terminal for NT8, yes.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't37', so the first step is S -> NT3 NT9 or S -> NT3 NT2. Wait, let me clarify: the grammar starts with S -> NT3 NT3? Wait, no: looking at the user's grammar, the first line is:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3\n\nWait, no: user's grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3\n\nWait, original grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3\n\nWait, no, original grammar:\n\nFirst line:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3\n\nWait no, the user wrote:\n\nFirst line:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3\n\nWait, no, in the first line:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nGrammars: S -> NT3 NT3?\n\nWait no, actually I double check the user's grammar:\n\nNo, no.

So S can produce two non-terminals, either NT3 NT3 or NT3 NT2. But wait, that could make the start produce three symbols, which might complicate things. Maybe it's a typo?\n\nWait, no, wait, perhaps it's S -> NT3 NT3, meaning S produces NT3 and NT3, not NT3 multiplied by three. Similarly for S -> NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, but that would mean the first step would produce two symbols, so the string would have to be a sequence of two symbols from S, but the string provided has 13 symbols. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Maybe I misread.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar's first lines. Let me check again:\n\nThe user wrote the grammar lines as:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3\nS -> NT3 NT2\nNT8 -> NT0 NT2\nNT8 -> NT4 NT2\nNT6 -> NT3 NT6\nNT4 -> NT7 NT0\n...\nWait, that doesn't seem right because that would mean S directly produces two symbols, meaning that any derivation would have an even number of symbols, but the string has 13 symbols, which is odd. Therefore, perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the first production is S -> NT3 NT3 NT3, making three symbols. That would explain an odd number of symbols, as each production either adds one terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, but the productions may vary.\n\nWait, actually, I'm getting confused here. Let me think: In CNF, each production is A -> BC or A -> a. Therefore, from S, we can produce either two non-terminals (if S has a rule like S->NT3 NT2) or a single terminal. But that would mean that S could produce either one terminal (if S had a production to a terminal) or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, the first lines are:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nSo S can either produce NT3 and NT3 or NT3 and NT2. So that would mean S can expand into two symbols; thus, each expansion would make the string length increase by two.

{"custom_id":"request-273","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t30 t30 t41 t88 t25 t34 t40 t14 t37 t33 t40 t33 t30 t40 t13`. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, but it looks like most of them are converting non-terminals into terminals, with some still having non-terminals on the right side. \n\nWait, actually, looking closer, the grammar is already in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But some of these rules still have two non-terminals on the right, like S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So maybe that's still CNF. \n\nMy first thought is to parse the string using this grammar. Parsing with CFG can be done using methods like recursive descent or the CYK algorithm. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each token corresponds to a production step. \n\nLet me start by listing all the terminals in the string: t30, t30, t41, t88, t25, t34, t40, t14, t37, t33, t40, t33, t30, t40, t13. So 15 terminals in total. \n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, which initially expands to NT3 NT9. So the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Each of these non-terminals will need to produce the corresponding terminals in the string.\n\nLet me look at NT3. From the given rules, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So after expanding S, we have NT6 and NT2. \n\nNow, each of these needs to be expanded further. NT6 has multiple rules: for example, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2, NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, etc. Let me pick one that can produce t30 or something else.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions, one of them is NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6. Not helpful. Another is NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4. Hmm, but then I need to check if NT8 or NT4 can produce t30.\n\nWait, NT8 can produce t37? Because looking at the rules, NT8 \u2192 't52' or other non-terminals. Wait, no, in the given rules, some are like NT8 \u2192 't52', which is a terminal. So NT8 can directly give t52. But in the string, we have t30 first. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by mapping each token to a production. Let me try to go step by step.\n\n1. S expands to NT3 NT9.\n   - NT3 needs to produce the first 't30' or the second?\n\nWait, no, the order is fixed because S uses the NT3 and NT9 in order. So the entire string must be generated by NT3 NT9, so NT3 will generate the first part, and NT9 the second.\n\nSo, the first token in the string is 't30'. Let's see what NT3 can produce. Looking at the rules, NT3 has production NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So NT3 must expand to NT6 and NT2.\n\nNow, NT6 can produce various things. Looking for rules that have 't30'. Wait, the terminals are all single tokens. So NT6 must produce a string of terminals, but each step requires a non-terminal. So perhaps NT6 needs to break down into a path that eventually leads to 't30'.\n\nWait, looking for all rules where NT9 leads to 't30', but in the given rules, NT9 \u2192 't75' or 't30'? Let's check:\n\nLooking back at the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 't75', but not 't30'. Wait, no, actually, in the earlier list, NT9 has rules like NT9 \u2192 't75' and others. Hmm, but in the string, the first token is t30, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, it's generated by NT3 which expands to NT6 NT2.\n\nSo, I'm trying to see how NT6 can produce 't30'. Looking at the rules for NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT1\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT1\nNT6 \u2192 NT1 NT2\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nWait, do any of these produce 't30'? Hmm, the rules list shows NT6 has several options but none of them directly produce 't30'. But looking further, one rule for NT3 \u2192 't60' or 't30'? Wait, in the rules, NT3 \u2192 't60' or 't30'?\n\nLooking at the provided rules: yes, NT3 has a rule NT3 \u2192 't60' and another NT3 \u2192 't30'. \n\nSo, if NT3 can produce 't30', then maybe that's how we get the first t30.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT9\nNT3 \u2192 't30' \u2192 't30'\nThen NT9 must produce the rest starting with the second t30. Wait, wait, the string starts with 't30 t30...', so maybe NT9 needs to start with 't30' as well. But looking at NT9's productions, do any of them start with t30?\n\nNT9 has rules like NT9 \u2192 't75', 't60', or perhaps other paths. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules for NT9: NT9 \u2192 't90', 't60', etc. I don't see NT9 producing 't30' directly because in the rules provided, it only has options for certain terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine NT3. If NT3 can produce 't30', then the first t30 comes from NT3, and then NT9 must handle the rest.\n\nBut looking at NT9, does it have any rule leading to 't30'? Not directly. So perhaps NT3's production is 't30', and then NT9 needs to produce the remaining tokens starting with 't30' or not. Hmm, but the next token after the first two 't30's is 't41', which is the third token.\n\nWait, let me get clearer. The string is 15 tokens: t30, t30, t41, t88, t25, t34, t40, t14, t37, t33, t40, t33, t30, t40, t13.\n\nSo, NT3 produces 't30' (token 1). Then NT9 must produce the remaining 14 tokens. Let's see how NT9 can start.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT9: I don't see it producing 't30' directly. The closest is maybe a production that leads to 't75', 't60', etc. So perhaps my initial thought is wrong. Maybe NT3 doesn't produce 't30' in this case.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if S can be broken down differently. But S must expand to NT3 NT9. There's no other option. So the string must be generated by NT3 NT9.\n\nThus, the first token 't30' must come from NT3, and the rest from NT9.\n\nBut looking at NT9's rules, it can't directly produce 't30' unless there's a path. Let's look back at the rules for NT9.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me check the rules again. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't75', 't60', 't91', 't22', etc. Not 't30'. So I'll conclude that NT9 can't directly produce 't30', meaning that the first t30 must come from NT3, and then NT9 must produce the rest starting with another token.\n\nBut the next token after the first t30 is t30 again, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the breakdown.\n\nWait, perhaps the start symbol S expands to NT3 NT9, and each of these non-terminals must be expanded into their productions in a way that the entire string is built. So let's try to model this as a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try the CYK algorithm approach. The string has 15 tokens, so let's assign indices from 0 to 14.\n\nBut before that, perhaps think about the individual symbols. The grammar seems to generate certain terminals, but since the string uses all of them, maybe it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps some symbols are not present, meaning the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, do all the terminals in the string have corresponding production rules?\n\nThe string has t30, t30, t41, t88, t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t41 t19 t91 t99 t10 t91 t40 t12 t34 t37 t12 t40 t70 t34 t23`. \n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals. The terminals in the string are each `tX` where X is a number. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals.

The string has t37 which is possible.)\n- NT9 \u2192 t75\n- NT2 \u2192 t33\n- NT7 \u2192 t10\n- NT4 \u2192 t88\n- NT5 \u2192 t37\n- NT3 \u2192 t30\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT7 \u2192 t70\n- NT8 \u2192 t41\n- NT4 \u2192 t42\n- NT9 \u2192 t22\n- NT9 \u2192 t14\n- NT4 \u2192 t99\n\nSo each of these `tX` are direct productions. \n\nNow, the string is a sequence of these tX terms. The problem is, in CNF, each production step adds exactly two non-terminals except when a non-terminal is a terminal. So for a string of length n, the derivation starts from S and at each step inserts a non-terminal between each pair of symbols, eventually expanding into all terminal symbols. So the string length should be 2^k for some k, but let's check the string length here.\n\nThe string has 15 symbols, which is not a power of 2, so that's a red flag. Because in CNF, the number of steps required to derive a string is such that the length is a power of 2 from the start symbol. So a string of length 15 isn't possible, since the start symbol S would generate, say, 2, then 4, 8, 16... So 15 is not a power of two. That suggests the answer is No. But I'm not sure, maybe the string can be generated if some non-terminals produce multiple terminals in one production? Wait, no, because in CNF each production step can only add two symbols. So the initial S's length would be powers of two, each step doubling the number.\n\nWait, but in the given string, we have 15 symbols, which is not a power of two. So that immediately tells me that even if some non-terminals produce terminals in a single step, the entire string's length is 15, which can't be derived from S via CNF derivations because the number of symbols must double each time. Hence, the length of the string cannot be achieved.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided string has 15 symbols, which is not a power of two, making it impossible to generate under the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, where each production step doubles the length.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-294","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, the grammar looks a bit complex with a bunch of production rules. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string to evaluate is `t90 t88 t91 t37 t88 t70 t70 t23 t25 t37 t8 t37 t65 t91 t13 t25`.\n\nI remember from my studies that the CYK algorithm is commonly used for parsing strings in Chomsky normal form. But since I'm not entirely comfortable with writing a full CYK table, maybe I can approach this in a more straightforward manner.\n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals and terminals from the grammar:\n\nNon-terminals: S, NT8, NT6, NT4, NT7, NT0, NT5, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT9.\n\nTerminals: t90, t88, t91, t37, t23, t8, t70, t65, t37, t25 (wait, some duplicates here).\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it has several 't's with numbers. I need to see which production rules can generate these terminals.\n\nI think the first step is to identify which terminals appear in the right-hand sides of the non-terminals. For example, looking at the grammar, some production rules directly produce terminals:\n\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 't90'\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT6 \u2192 't34'\n- NT1 \u2192 't25'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT4 \u2192 't88'\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n- NT1 \u2192 't40'\n- And so on. Wait, actually, looking again, some of the right-hand sides produce terminals, like NT9 \u2192 't90', etc.\n\nWait, let me make a better list of which terminals each non-terminal produces:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t90, t75, t22, t14, t99, t23, t37 (seems like multiple terminals, but I think for each rule, it produces a single terminal or a pair. Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So maybe I got confused earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, looking back, each production is either A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (a single terminal). So, for example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9 is a production where S is replaced by NT3 and NT9, both non-terminals. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't90' is a terminal production.\n\nSo to parse the string, each terminal in the string must be generated by a production rule, and the entire string must be built by the left-derivations of the grammar starting from S, using the productions.\n\nI think the string has 17 terminals, which is a lot. Let me list them:\n\nt90, t88, t91, t37, t88, t70, t70, t23, t25, t37, t8, t37, t65, t91, t13, t25.\n\nSo, 17 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string should correspond to the number of steps. In CNF, each step generates two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal?), wait, no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So for a string of length n, the parse tree has height log n, with each production expanding a non-terminal into two symbols.\n\nTherefore, the number of symbols in the string must be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which for CNF grammars is 2^k for some k, but the string here is 17 symbols, which is not a power of two, so that might already indicate a problem. Wait, that's a crucial point.\n\nWait, 17 is not a power of two. Let's see: 2^4=16, 2^5=32. So the string's length is 17, which is between 16 and 32. For CNF, the derivation length (the height of the parse tree) is logarithmic in the length of the string. But the actual number of symbols is 2^h, but our string isn't a power of two. Hmm, but the number of terminals doesn't have to be exactly 2^h because the start symbol might derive into multiple non-terminals that expand further, but each terminal is a single token.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to correct myself. In CNF, each step in leftmost derivation replaces a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. So for a string of length n, the number of production steps is n-1, because each step adds one symbol (for terminals) or keeps it at two (non-terminals). Wait, no, each production step can replace a single non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal). Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each time a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols. So, the number of symbols in the string is equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree. Therefore, the number of symbols should be 2^k, but in this case, it's 17, which isn't a power of two. That might make it impossible. But wait, maybe the derivation is such that some non-terminals expand into terminals while others keep expanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long for a CNF grammar that only produces a specific structure. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for individual terminals in the string and see if each can be generated by some production rule. For instance, the string starts with 't90', which I think NT9 can produce 't90' as per the rule NT9 \u2192 't90'. Similarly, other terminals might be produced by their respective non-terminals.\n\nBut since the entire string needs to be generated, it's not just about the individual terminals but also the order in which they appear. The grammar's structure will determine how symbols can be arranged. Without looking at the full parsing tree, it's hard, but given that 17 isn't a power of two, I'm starting to suspect that it's not possible to generate a string of length 17 with a CNF grammar, which typically generates strings of length 2^k.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again. In CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So starting from S, which is a non-terminal, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (either non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal). If we look at the number of symbols generated, the initial S is one symbol. After one step, it becomes two symbols. After two steps, each of those can become two, leading to four symbols, and so on. So, the total number of symbols after k steps is 2^k. Therefore, the total number of terminals would be 2^k, which is a power of two.\n\nBut the string provided has 17 symbols, which is not a power of two. So, that would mean it's impossible to generate this string with the given CNF grammar because the number of terminals isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because some non-terminals might produce terminals alongside other non-terminals. Wait, no, each production either is a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, for example, in one step, S expands to NT3 and NT9. Suppose NT3 expands further, say to NT6 and NT8, and NT8 is a terminal 't52' or another non-terminal. But each time a non-terminal is expanded, the total number of symbols increases by the number of non-terminals in the production.\n\nI think my initial thought is correct: in a CNF grammar, the number of terminals in any string generated must be a power of two because each step doubles the count. For example, starting with S: level 0: 1, level 1: 2, level 2: 4, etc. So, any string generated will have 2^k symbols. Since 17 isn't a power of two, the string cannot be generated, so the answer would be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe number of symbols in the string is 17, which is not a power of two. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production replaces a non-terminal with either two"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-291","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the given string `t34 t40 t41 t10 t8 t37 t75 t34 t25 t37 t23 t37 t33 t23 t65 t23` is in the language defined by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal. But looking at the grammar provided, it seems a bit unconventional because many rules still involve terminals on certain sides. Wait, maybe it's actually in a different form because I see that some non-terminals derive into terminals and non-terminals mix.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to treat this as a context-free grammar and use a parsing approach. So, the idea is to parse the string from the start symbol S and see if it can be derived step by step.\n\nThe given string has 17 tokens, all starting with 't' and then numbers. Each token is between quotes, like `t34`. So, I need to map each of these tokens to the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many non-terminals derive into sequences of terminals and non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is `S -> NT3 NT9` or `S -> NT3 NT2`. So, to produce the string, when we expand S, we should get either NT3 followed by NT9 or NT3 followed by NT2.\n\nBut the first token of the string is `t34`. Let me see what terminal `t34` maps to in the grammar. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT0 -> 't13', NT1 -> 't25', NT2 -> 't33', NT3 -> 't30', NT6 -> 't34', NT8 -> 't37', NT9 -> 't75', etc. \n\nSo, in the string, the first token is `t34` which comes from NT6. So, to get `t34` as the first symbol, the first rule we must apply is either S -> NT3 NT2 or S -> NT3 NT9. Wait, but NT3 is mapped to 't30', which would be the second token if we choose S->NT3 NT9. So, in the string, the second token is `t40`. Let's check NT3's productions: NT3 can produce NT6 NT2, etc., but does it produce `t40`? Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT3 directly mapping to `t40`. Only NT1 andNT7 and others have 't40'. So maybe S->NT3 NT9 isn't the right path because NT3 wouldn't produce `t34`.\n\nAlternatively, if the first part of S is NT6, which starts with `t34`, maybe S used another rule. Wait, in the given grammar, S is defined as NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So, S starts as NT3, not NT6. So, the first part of the string must come from NT3.\n\nLooking at the possible derivations of NT3, the only production starting NT3 is NT3 -> NT6 NT2. So, that's the only way NT3 can be expanded. So, NT3 becomes NT6 NT2.\n\nNow, the first token is NT6 -> 't34'. So, let's see how NT6 is derived. NT6 has a production NT6 -> NT8 NT5. Hmm, so that's the first step.\n\nWait, but the string starts with `t34`, which is NT6 -> t34, so the initial step is to expand NT6 to t34 followed by NT5. But looking at NT5's productions, NT5 -> 't91' or NT5 -> 't37' or other combinations, but also NT5 has rules like NT5 -> NT7 NT5, which allows for multiple expansions.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex. Let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT3 NT9. The first step is to expand NT3 as NT6 NT2.\n\nSo, after expanding S, we have NT6 NT2 followed by NT9.\n\nNow, the first token is `t34`, which is from NT6. So, let's consider expanding NT6 as per the grammar: NT6 -> NT8 NT5. So now, after S, it becomes NT8 NT5 NT2 followed by NT9.\n\nThe next token is `t40`. Looking at NT8, it has a production NT8 -> 't52' or other combinations. Wait, `t40` is derived from NT1 or NT7 since both have that terminal. So, NT8 needs to produce `t40` perhaps via NT1 or NT7.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT8 -> NT1 NT5 or other combinations. So, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me note down all the possible expansions step by step.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe using CYK algorithm or parsing the string step by step.\n\nBut the string is quite long with 17 tokens, so it might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps seeing if each token can be matched to a non-terminal and if the entire string can be reduced to S.\n\nWait, another idea is to map each token in the string to a non-terminal in the grammar and see if we can derive the entire string.\n\nThe string is: t34, t40, t41, t10, t8, t37, t75, t34, t25, t37, t23, t37, t33, t23, t65, t23.\n\nEach token is 't' followed by a number, which probably corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar. Let me list what each token corresponds to:\n\nt34: NT6\nt40: Not directly a non-terminal, but in the grammar, NT1 and NT7 produce t40. So, t40 must come from NT1 or NT7.\nt41: Looking for a non-terminal. Maybe NT2 since NT2 has a rule NT2->t37? Wait no, t41 is a token here, so perhaps NT2->t41 or another rule. Checking the grammar: I don't see NT2 directly mapping to t41, but maybe through a production. Let's check the grammar rules for NT2. \n\nLooking through the rules, NT2->t37 is from one production: NT2 -> 't37', another NT2 -> 't33', etc. So t37 and t33 are direct terminals from NT2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have t41 as the third token. So that must come from some NT. Let me scan the grammar for any NT that has 't41' as a terminal. From the given rules: I don't see any NT directly mapped to t41, but maybe indirectly. Maybe a rule like NT7 -> 't40' but that's for NT7. Alternatively, perhaps a longer derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe S can derive into NT3 NT2 instead of NT3 NT9. So, S is NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let me try that.\n\nLet me try S as NT3 NT2. Then, NT3 -> NT6 NT2. So S becomes NT6 NT2 NT2.\n\nWait, but the first token is t34, so that's NT6. So NT6 -> t34 followed by NT5.\n\nBut earlier, I thought NT6 -> NT8 NT5, but in the given grammar, does NT6 have other productions? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, NT6 appears as NT6 -> NT8 NT5 and others like NT9, but I don't see another production for NT6 beyond that. Wait, no\u2014if I look at the given grammar, it's a mix. It might have other rules. Maybe I overlooked some.\n\nWait, perhaps a better idea is to note that each token in the string corresponds to a non-terminal, and the question is if a series of productions can generate that sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see if each token is present in the grammar as some non-terminal's terminal. For example, t34 is NT6, t40 is NT1 or NT7, t41 is not immediately present as a terminal, but perhaps can be generated through a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not in the language because one of the tokens doesn't match any non-terminal's produceable terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to see how many symbols we have and the number of productions needed. But that might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is with t41. Let's see. Is there any production in the grammar that produces 't41'?\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT9 -> 't37' in some cases.\n- NT5 -> 't91' and 't37'.\n- NT6 -> 't34' and 't8' in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-313","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is `t90 t40 t70 t14 t33 t91 t37 t34 t22 t52 t10 t70 t37 t8 t14 t65 t42`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar given seems to be in CNF because all the rules on the left side are single non-terminals, and the right sides consist of two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first step is to see how the string can be derived starting from S. Since S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the derived string should start with a symbol derived from NT3 and followed by one derived from NT9. \n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t90, which must come from NT3, and the next symbol is t40, which comes from NT9. So, the first part t90 t40 must correspond to NT3 \u2192 t90 and NT9 \u2192 t40. \n\nNow, I need to check each production rule for NT3 and NT9. In the grammar, NT9 has a production rule where NT9 \u2192 t75, but t75 isn't the first symbol. Wait, no, there's another production for NT9: NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Looking back, the grammar for NT9 has several rules, such as NT9 \u2192 t75 and some involving other non-terminals. \n\nWait, I think I might be getting confused. Let me parse this more carefully. The string starts with t90, which we've determined comes from NT3. So, looking at NT3's production rules, I see that NT3 \u2192 t30 is a terminal production (from the grammar), but does that make sense? Wait, no, t30 isn't in the string. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT3 has several rules: for example, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, and NT3 \u2192 t30. Similarly, there's NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT6 later? Wait, no, looking again, after the initial list, there are more rules for NT3. So, NT3 \u2192 t30 is a direct production. But in the string, the second symbol is t40, not t30. So maybe my initial assumption that t90 comes from NT3 and t40 comes from NT9 is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to trace the entire derivation. This might take some time. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the string must be derived from NT3 and NT9.\n\n2. Looking at the string, the first symbol is t90, which should be from NT3. Now, NT3 could either be a terminal or derived further. Checking the rules for NT3, the terminals are only t30 according to some of the rules. But t30 isn't the start of the string. Hmm, that might mean I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the NT3 is generating t90, but that's from another rule. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see an NT3 \u2192 t90 production. Let me check again. Scanning through the rules, NT9 has a production to t75, but that's different. NT3 has a production to t30. So perhaps t90 isn't directly a terminal of NT3, which complicates things. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t90, which comes from a non-terminal other than NT3. That can't be, because S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so S starts with NT3. So, unless NT3 can produce t90, which I don't see in the rules. So that suggests that either I'm missing something, or the string isn't derived correctly.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. Looking through all the NT3 rules: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, NT0 NT7, and t30. So no, there's no direct production for NT3 \u2192 t90. Therefore, the first token t90 might not be possible unless it's part of a longer derivation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the tokens to NT3 and NT9.\n\nAnother approach: sometimes, when generating strings, non-terminals can derive into terminals through multiple steps. So, maybe t90 is the result of a longer derivation from NT3, and t40 is from NT9 via some steps.\n\nWait, but S's production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the first two symbols must come from NT3 and NT9. Therefore, t90 must be from NT3, and t40 from NT9. So looking at NT3's possible productions, are any of them capable of generating t90?\n\nLooking at NT3's rules: NT3 \u2192 t30. That's a terminal, but t30 isn't in the string. The earlier tokens are t90, so that doesn't fit. Therefore, maybe NT3 can't produce t90, which contradicts the assumption.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because the first token t90 isn't a possible terminal from NT3.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the grammar. Let me check again. In the grammar, under NT3, looking through all rules, is there any production that results in t90? It seems not. So, that would mean the first symbol t90 isn't from NT3, which violates the grammar because S starts with NT3 and NT9, so the first token must come from NT3.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the given string isn't generated by this grammar because the first token isn't possible from NT3.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking through, most productions are of the form NTX \u2192 NOTerm NTAnotherTerm, and a few have a terminal at the end, like NT9 \u2192 't75'. So it seems to fit CNF.\n\nNext, the approach to determine if the string is generated is likely to use a parser, maybe a recursive descent parser or an LR parser, since CNF grammars can be handled efficiently. Alternatively, I could use the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for CNF and can parse the string without building the entire parse table.\n\nLet me list out the string components for clarity: t8, t40, t37, t37, t42, t37, t30, t41, t91, t37, t40, t70, t40, t33, t25, t19, t34.\n\nThe string has 17 tokens. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the string must start with t3 (from NT3) followed by a terminal that's the result of NT9. Looking at NT9's productions, one of them is NT9 \u2192 't75'. So the first token should be t3, and the second t75. But wait, the string starts with t8, not t3. That doesn't match. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I should check what NT9 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT9 has several productions, including NT9 \u2192 't75', but also NT9 \u2192 't60' and others. Oh, no, actually in the provided grammar, there are a few NT9 productions:\n\nLooking back: Yes, NT9 can produce 't75', but does it also produce 't37'? Wait, no. From the list, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT9 -> 't22'\nNT9 -> 't14'\nNT9 -> 't12'\nWait, no, looking more carefully, I don't see 't37' as an option for NT9. Instead, there's NT8 \u2192 't52' and NT9 \u2192 't75', etc. So the string starts with t8, which suggests that one of the productions starts with NT8.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the entire string must be generated by starting with NT3 and NT9. So the first part is NT3, which we can check.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nAnd others with terminals, but looking again, in the given grammar, NT3 has these productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8\nNT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n... and others. Wait, I might have misread earlier. Let me recheck the grammar provided:\n\nLooking at NT3: it has\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nAnd some more that include terminals: like 't30', 't37', etc. So, for NT3, it can produce either a non-terminal pair or a terminal.\n\nSo, starting with NT3, the first token could be t30, from NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, but looking at the string, the first token is t8, which comes from somewhere else.\n\nWait, no. The start symbol S is NT3 NT9, so the string must start with a terminal from NT3 and a terminal from NT9. But in the string, the first token is t8, which would come from NT3 if NT3 produces 't8' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nAnd also NT3 \u2192 't37', 't30', etc. So, if S starts with NT3, which can produce a terminal. If the string starts with t8, then NT3 must be producing 't8' as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, in the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't30'\nAnd other NT3 productions have terminals like 't37', etc. So, is there a production for NT3 \u2192 't8'? Let me check the provided grammar.\n\nYes, here's one: NT6 \u2192 't8' (among others?) Wait, no. Looking through, there's NT6 \u2192 't8' as a production, but for NT3, do any of its productions result in 't8'?\n\nLooking again, I don't see NT3 \u2192 't8' as a production. The only terminals I see for NT3 are 't30', 't37', etc. So that complicates things because the string starts with t8, which may not be generated by NT3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial analysis, and the string doesn't start with NT3. Wait, no. Because S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the entire string must start with NT3 followed by NT9. So each component of the string must come from these two.\n\nThus, the first token should be from NT3, and the second from NT9. However, the first token in the string is t8, which would have to be generated by NT3, but looking through, I don't see NT3 producing t8 as a terminal. The closest is NT6 \u2192 't8', but NT3 may not have that.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in listing. Let me look again at the NTX productions to see if any NT3 has a terminal option of t8. Hmm, scanning through, I don't see NT3 \u2192 't8'. It has 't30', 't37', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT3 -> other combinations, including terminals like 't30', 't37', etc.\n\nBut no 't8' from NT3. So that suggests that the string cannot start with t8 because NT3 cannot produce 't8' as a terminal. Therefore, the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I've overlooked something. Let me double-check. Did I miss a production for NT3 \u2192 't8'? Looking carefully through the list:\n\nLooking for any line that starts with NT3 and ends with a terminal 't8'. Scanning through:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- ...\nNo, I don't see any production for NT3 \u2192 't8'. Therefore, the very first symbol in the string t8 cannot be produced by NT3, which means the entire string is invalid according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Maybe the S production leads to something else. Wait, no, S starts with NT3 NT9, so the very first element must come from NT3, and the next from NT9. So the string starts with t8, which can't be generated by NT3, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should help me parse the string since each production step either breaks down a non-terminal into two others or into a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit extensive. I see that the start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So the string starts with t99, t19, etc., but I need to see how these correspond to the grammar's terminals.\n\nLet me think about how the string is broken down. The string has 19 elements, all t followed by numbers. The grammar defines these numbers as terminals. I notice that some of these terminals are defined in the grammar, like t70, t41, t91, etc., and some are defined with more complex productions, which might mean they can be further broken down into more t's with different numbers.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I can try to parse it using the grammar. Let's start by breaking down the initial part of the string.\n\nBut first, perhaps it's easier to check if the string can be reduced by the grammar. Let's list all the terminals present in the string and see if they are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the string, all the terminals are t followed by numbers, and from the grammar, I see that t99, t19, t70, etc., are all terminals, as are t8, t25, t91, etc. So none of the symbols in the string are non-terminals; they are all terminals. That suggests that the string should be derived directly from the start symbol S through a series of productions that replace non-terminals with terminals.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case because some terminals are defined through productions. For example, in the grammar, NT2 can produce t33 or other NT combinations. Maybe t33 is a terminal, but wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nThe productions for NT2 are:\nNT2 -> NT7 NT7\nNT2 -> NT6 NT1\nNT2 -> NT5 NT6\nNT2 -> NT7 NT8\nNT2 -> NT5 NT7\nNT2 -> NT9 NT9\n\nHmm, none of these are a terminal. So t33 is a terminal, meaning that the production NT2 -> t33 is in the grammar? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, t33 is defined as a terminal because I remember the end of the grammar: NT6 -> t8, NT2 -> t33, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, each production that ends with -> tXXX is a terminal. So for example, the production NT8 -> 't52' means that 't52' is a terminal. Similarly, NT0 -> 't13' is a terminal, and so on.\n\nSo t33 is a terminal because it's defined as NT2 -> t33.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I need to check if t33 is in the production list as an terminal. Let me scan the grammar:\n\nYes, there's NT2 -> 't33' and similar entries. So t33 is a terminal, meaning that NT2 can produce a terminal 't33'.\n\nBut wait, in the string, t33 appears multiple times. So the parser would need to break down a non-terminal that can produce 't33'.\n\nSo first, the string starts with t99, t19, t70, t41, then t99 t99 t33, etc.\n\nLet me see what production could produce 't99', 't19', 't70', etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT1 has a production NT1 -> NT8 NT9. Not sure. Let's list all the productions and see which terminals are present in the string.\n\nWait, maybe I can create a mapping of the terminals to their production rules. Let's go through the grammar and collect all production rules that end with a terminal.\n\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT5 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't37', 't60', 't75', 't71', 't14', 't12', 't42', 't70', 't10', etc.\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT8 -> 't52', 't41', 't23', etc.\n- NT1 -> 't40' (appears multiple times)\n- NT7 -> 't40', 't19\u2019\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT4 -> 't88', 't8', etc.\n- NT9 has multiple productions, so t91, t75, etc., are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's too long to map all, but for the given string, all the elements are t followed by some numbers, which are defined as terminals in the grammar.\n\nSo the entire string is a sequence of terminals. The start symbol S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So S sends out two non-terminals, and each can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut the string has 19 elements, meaning that the parse tree would break down these non-terminals into terminals. Let's see if each symbol in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step, trying to build the parse tree.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\nt99 t19 t70 t41 t99 t99 t33 t40 t33 t37 t91 t99 t91 t8 t99 t37 t25 t42\n\nLet me count the elements:\n\n1: t99\n2: t19\n3: t70\n4: t41\n5: t99\n6: t99\n7: t33\n8: t40\n9: t33\n10: t37\n11: t91\n12: t99\n13: t91\n14: t8\n15: t99\n16: t37\n17: t25\n18: t42\n\nLet me see which of these are terminals. From the grammar, t13, t25, t33, t37, t40, t41, t52, t54, etc., are terminals. So each element here is a terminal, so the entire string must be derived by S breaking down into a sequence of non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nBut to check this, perhaps I should see if each terminal in the string is present in the grammar as a terminal. Since the grammar does have these terminals, then it's possible that the string can be derived.\n\nWait, but even if all the terminals are present, it doesn't guarantee that the sequence can be produced, because the productions might not allow for the order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to consider that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and assuming it's a context-free grammar, the problem reduces to checking if the string is generated through a series of productions.\n\nBut perhaps using the parsing approach is better. Let me try to parse the string from left to right.\n\nBut considering time constraints, perhaps looking for the presence of the start symbol S which produces NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nLet me see what NT3 and NT9 produce in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 has productions:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\nNT3 -> NT1 NT5\nNT3 has other productions, but the first two seem relevant.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 has several productions:\n\nNT9 -> NT7 NT9\nNT9 -> NT6 NT1\nNT9 -> NT3 NT7\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT9 -> 't75' (and others)\nWait, but if a production for NT9 includes a terminal, that would end the derivation for that path.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be a systematic way, but that's a bit involved.\n\nWait, but considering that the string has 18 elements, maybe the CYK approach is too time-consuming manually. Another approach: check if the string can be grouped into smaller phrases that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, checking if the string's elements can be grouped into sequences that fit the non-terminal productions.\n\nFor example, looking for 't99' in the grammar, I see in the grammar that NT1 -> NT8 NT9, but does that produce 't99'?

{"custom_id":"request-336","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar does seem to follow this structure since all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or terminals. So that's a good start.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t30 t10 t91 t8 t13 t99 t34 t52 t33 t12 t25 t37 t40 t42 t23 t8 t41 t13`. That's a sequence of tokens, so each of these is a symbol in the string. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that it has multiple production rules for the same non-terminals. For example, NT8 has several options: NT0 NT2, NT4 NT2, NT8 NT1, etc. So I need to figure out how each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol through a series of substitutions.\n\nI also see that some of the non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols. For example, NT9 is directly 't75', NT3 is 't30', NT8 is 't8', etc. But the way these are connected, I might need to trace the sequence back through the production tree.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first token, 't30'. From the grammar, NT3 produces 't30' directly. So S needs to derive to something that includes NT3 somewhere. However, looking at the grammar's S productions, S is initially either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. But wait, no, looking again, S's initial productions are S -> NT3 NT3 NT9? Wait, no, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, no, the grammar starts with S -> NT3 NT9 or S -> NT3 NT2. So S seems to be the start symbol, and it's producing two non-terminals. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, actually, looking back, for the grammar, S has two productions:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3 NT9? No, wait, the initial lines are:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3 NT9\n\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nWait, no. Looking at the user's input, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3 NT9\n\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking again at the initial grammar provided:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nGrammar: \n\nS -> NT3 NT3 NT9 \n\nS -> NT3 NT2 \n\nWait, is that correct? It's a bit confusing. But perhaps not, because in CNF each production is B \u2192 something. So perhaps S has two productions, each being two non-terminals. Wait, no, looking at the initial grammar provided, the user wrote:\n\nThe user provided multiple lines for the grammar. Let me parse the initial part correctly.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nGrammar: \n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT3 NT9 \n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT2 \n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Because in CNF, each production is from one non-terminal to two others, possibly including terminals. So the first S production should be S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and another S production, maybe S \u2192 NT3 NT2? Wait, looking at the initial code block, it seems the user may have written some lines incorrectly because of line breaks. Let me try to parse it correctly.\n\nLooking more carefully, perhaps the user's grammar has S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and another S \u2192 NT3 NT2 as the initial productions. So, first, S can produce either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Then each of these NT symbols can produce other NT or terminal symbols. So for the string, if 't30' is the first token, which comes from NT3, then perhaps the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9. But then the NT9 must produce 't13', but wait, looking at the grammar, NT0 is the only one that directly becomes 't13' (since NT0 \u2192 't13'). Wait, but NT9 might derive to something else.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. From the user-provided rules, NT9 has several productions:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT9 -> NT7 NT9\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nSo NT9 can produce 't75' directly. Similarly, looking at the string, the first token is 't30', so that's from NT3, so one part is NT3. Then the last part of the string is 't13', which is from NT0. So to get 't13', we must have NT0 \u2192 't13'. So that means that for the S production to result in the given string, perhaps the two parts NT3 and NT9 (from S \u2192 NT3 NT9) would have to derive to the beginning and the end parts.\n\nBut let's see: 't30' is 't30', which is from NT3. So NT3 must derive to 't30', which happens directly. Then the NT9 must derive to the rest of the string, which starts with 't10 t91 t8 t13 t99 t34 t52 t33 t12 t25 t37 t40 t42 t23 t8 t41 t13'. Wait, but actually, the full string is 't30 t10 t91 t8 t13 t99 t34 t52 t33 t12 t25 t37 t40 t42 t23 t8 t41 t13'.\n\nWait, but if S starts as NT3 NT9, then the string should be the concatenation of NT3's derived string and NT9's derived string. So the first token comes from NT3, which is 't30', and the rest comes from NT9.\n\nWait, but looking again at the initial S productions, maybe I got it wrong. The user wrote:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3 NT9\n\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would make S produce three non-terminals in one production, which isn't allowed in CNF. So perhaps the user made a formatting error, and the correct S productions are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. That would make more sense because each production must be of the form A \u2192 BC.\n\nWait, but in that case, when S is the start, it can produce either two non-terminals. So the string starts with 't30 t10 ... t13'. Let me see, if the first token is 't30', which comes from NT3's production, and then the next token is 't10', which comes from another NT. So maybe NT3 produces 't30' and some non-terminals, and NT9 produces more tokens leading up to 't13'.\n\nWait, but it's getting a bit complicated. Let's try to see each token and see if they can be matched to the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt30, t10, t91, t8, t13, t99, t34, t52, t33, t12, t25, t37, t40, t42, t23, t8, t41, t13.\n\nEach of these tokens must come from some production path. Let me start from the beginning:\n\n1. t30: This is from NT3 \u2192 t30 directly. So in the derivation, at some point NT3 must produce t30.\n\n2. t10: Looking into the grammar, where can t10 come from? Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT (non-terminal) that directly produces t10. Wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me check again. The user's grammar includes some NT \u2192 a (terminals), like NT7 \u2192 't40', etc. Wait, let's go through all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar:\n\nNT2 -> 't33'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nNT1 -> 't40'\n\nNT7 -> 't40'\n\nNT1 -> 't19'\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT4 -> 't88'\n\nNT2 -> 't37'\n\nNT3 -> 't30'\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nNT7 -> 't70'\n\nNT8 -> 't41'\n\nNT4 -> 't42'\n\nNT9 -> 't22'\n\nSo, these are the nt \u2192 terminal productions.\n\nSo, t30 comes from NT3, t33 from NT2, t8 from NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side consists of up to two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLet me start by understanding the grammar structure. It looks like all the non-terminals are defined before they appear in terminal productions. The terminals are all \"t\" followed by a number, like t41, t88, etc., and some others like 't40', 't52', etc. Wait, no, looking closer, most of the non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals, so this seems like a CFG that generates strings of these t followed by numbers.\n\nThe given string is: `t41 t88 t90 t60 t13 t65 t12 t19 t37 t34 t25 t99 t10 t90 t65 t12 t99 t65 t23`\n\nI need to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which according to the grammar can produce either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Since the string starts with t41, which is a terminal, I need to see which production allows T3 or T2 to produce t41.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3 and NT2:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 can also produce NT0 NT7 and others, but let's see what directly produces t41.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT9 -> 't41', so NT9 is a production that directly gives t41. So, to get t41, the previous step must have been NT9, which is part of the production chain.\n\nSo maybe the string starts with NT9, and the next symbols need to fit accordingly. Wait, but the overall structure is S -> NT3 NT9, which would mean the string would be something like [NT3] [NT9]. Since the string starts with t41 (from NT9), that's good, but NT3 would come before that.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t41, so that could be the result of NT9. Let's see:\n\nIf S -> NT3 NT9, then the derivation could be S => NT3 NT9. So, NT3 and NT9 each might produce sequences of terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is t41, which is part of NT9's production. So perhaps NT9 produces t41, and NT3 produces the rest.\n\nBut wait, let's check the grammar. NT9 has several productions:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT9 -> NT6 NT1\nNT9 -> NT3 NT7\nNT9 -> NT1 NT9\nNT9 -> NT6 NT8\nNT9 -> NT3 NT8\nNT9 -> NT7 NT9\nNT9 -> NT9 NT7\nNT9 -> NT7 NT5\nNT9 -> NT6 NT1\nWait, no, the last few productions have more terminals:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, the last part lists NT9 -> 't75', etc. Wait, I need to parse the entire grammar properly.\n\nWait, the user provided a lot of productions, but in a condensed format.

{"custom_id":"request-358","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's see, the string is: t13 t25 t22 t52 t30 t19 t37 t22 t10 t40 t23 t90 t40 t40 t37 t42 t41 t65 t52. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). In CNF, every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I can check that indeed all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So that's good.\n\nNext, I should look at the start symbol, which seems to be S, but in the given grammar, S is rewritten into two NT3 and NT9 branches. So S -> NT3 NT9, and each of these NTs has their own productions.\n\nI also notice that there are several symbols that map directly to terminals, like NT9 -> t75, NT8 -> t52, etc. Some symbols even have cycles, like NT0 has a production to NT0 NT1, which is a left recursion. But since the string consists of all terminal symbols, the parser must eliminate all non-terminals by the time it reaches the string.\n\nMy approach should be to parse the string step by step according to the grammar. Since it's a long string, I'll break it down into parts and see if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me start from the beginning:\n\n1. t13: Looking at the grammar, NT0 -> t13. So t13 is produced by NT0.\n\n2. t25: NT1 -> t25.\n\n3. t22: NT9 -> t22.\n\n4. t52: NT8 -> t52.\n\nSo after these steps, the first four tokens correspond to NT0 -> t13, NT1 -> t25, NT9 -> t22, NT8 -> t52. Wait, but looking back, I see that the structure is S -> NT3 NT9, so after S, there are two non-terminals. But the first token here is t13, which is NT0, but S doesn't directly produce NT0. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, in the rules, I see NT9 -> t75, but t22 is produced by NT9. So perhaps the first part is S -> NT9, producing t22, but wait, S is NT3 and NT9, so maybe I need to check more.\n\nWait, I might be confusing the non-terminals with the terminals. Let me list all the rules to see if any NT connects to these terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT9 -> t75, t22\n- NT3 -> t30, t65\n- NT8 -> t52, t68? Wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, the rules are many. Let me scan through the list. Here are some key rules:\n\n- NT9 is defined with several productions, including nt9-> t75, nt9-> t22, etc.\n- NT8 -> t52, t37, etc.\n- NT3 -> t30, t65\n\nWait, but the first token is t13, which is produced by NT0: NT0 -> t13. So how does that happen? Because in the grammar, S -> NT3 NT9, so S starts with NT3. How do I get to NT0?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be broken down into the steps of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by trying to apply the grammar to the string step by step.\n\nLet me write down the string: t13 t25 t22 t52 t30 t19 t37 t22 t10 t40 t23 t90 t40 t40 t37 t42 t41 t65 t52.\n\nNow, the string consists of 20 tokens, which must all be terminals. So I need to find an S derivation that breaks down into exactly this sequence.\n\nLet's see, the start symbol is S, which has the productions:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\n\nSo, the first step is S -> NT3 NT9. So the string starts with NT3 expanded as per its rules.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\n\nNT3 -> NT4 NT8\n\nSo NT3 can be split into two non-terminals, then further expanded.\n\nWait, let me step through this:\n\n- S expands to NT3 NT9\n- The string starts with t13, which is from NT0, but S doesn't produce NT0 directly. Wait, perhaps NT3 expands to NT6 and NT2, and then each of those need to be expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that S can only generate two non-terminals, but the string starts with a terminal. So perhaps the initial step is wrong. That is, maybe S is NT3 NT9, but the first token is a terminal, which would only be possible if the first NT (either NT3 or NT9) directly produces that terminal.\n\nLooking at the NT9's productions, I see nt9->t75, t22, etc. So NT9 can produce t22, which is in the string. So perhaps the first expansion is S -> NT9, which would produce t22, but the rest of the tokens would need to come from NT3.\n\nWait, maybe the order is S->NT3 NT9, but perhaps in the derivation, NT9 is used first.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled. Maybe I should consider that S expands into two non-terminals, and each of them needs to generate their respective parts of the string.\n\nLet me break the string into chunks that might correspond to the non-terminals in S's expansion.\n\nThe initial NT after S could be NT3 and NT9. So perhaps the string starts with NT3 generating some tokens and followed by NT9 generating others.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t13, which is from NT0. But S doesn't directly produce NT0. So perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, perhaps I should try to see if t13 can be produced by some non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since the string only contains terminals, the entire derivation must consist of only terminal productions, and all non-terminals must be expanded into terminals before the string is matched.\n\nSo each step in the derivation must consume more symbols of the string. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t13. The only non-terminal that directly produces t13 is NT0. So perhaps there's a path where one of the non-terminals expands into NT0, which then expands to t13.\n\nWait, but in the start symbol S, the two non-terminals are NT3 and NT9. So NT3 and NT9 each must expand into a sequence of terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string:\n\nt13 t25 t22 t52 t30 t19 t37 t22 t10 t40 t23 t90 t40 t40 t37 t42 t41 t65 t52\n\nThat's 20 tokens.\n\nLet me try to see if I can group these tokens into two parts, each derived from NT3 and NT9 respectively.\n\nPerhaps NT3 expands into the first part and NT9 into the second part. Let's see:\n\nSuppose S->NT3 NT9.\n\nThen, NT3 might expand into a subset of the string, and NT9 the other subset.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are:\n\nt13 t25 t22 t52 t30 t19 t37 t22 t10 t40 t23 t90 t40 t40 t37 t42 t41 t65 t52\n\nI need to split these into two sequences that could be generated by NT3 and NT9 respectively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of NT3 and NT9 can be represented as a parse tree that generates parts of the string.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting with S -> NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the string starts with NT3's expansion, followed by NT9's expansion.\n\nNow, looking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 can be NT6 NT2 or NT4 NT8.\n\nLet's say NT3 expands into the first few tokens. Let's try NT3 -> NT6 NT2.\n\nNow, NT6 can produce various things. Looking at the rules, NT6 -> NT8 NT4 or other terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-377","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string belongs to the language defined by a context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it's structured in a way that each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I look at the grammar. It seems to consist of several non-terminals (like S, NT3, NT8, etc.) and terminals, which are all the 't' followed by numbers, like t37, t65, etc. The start symbol is S, and from the productions, I can see that S branches into combinations of NT3 and other non-terminals. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t37 t65 t37 t90 t40 t30 t19 t30 t12 t19 t41 t90 t90 t8 t42 t90 t41 t65 t91 t75`.\n\nOkay, my goal is to check if this string can be derived by the grammar. I'll start by looking for terminals that are the start symbols or can lead to S through the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t37. Let me see which non-terminals can produce t37.\n\nFrom the grammar rules:\n\n- NT8 -> t37\n- NT6 -> t8, but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo, NT8 can produce t37. So, t37 would come from NT8.\n\nNext, the next token after t37 is t65. So, the second token is t65. Let's check which non-terminals produce t65.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT6 -> t65\n\nSo, the second token t65 comes from NT6.\n\nNow, putting it together, the first two tokens t37 t65 would correspond to NT8 -> t37 and NT6 -> t65. So, the first part of the string is derived from NT8 NT6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has productions like S -> NT3 NT9 or S -> NT3 NT2, etc. So, the initial step from S would need to reach NT8 and NT6. Let's check S's productions:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2\nS -> NT8 NT2\nS -> NT8 NT4\nS -> NT6 NT3\nS -> NT6 NT2\nWait, none of S's initial productions directly produce NT8 and NT6. Hmm, but maybe that's through other productions.\n\nWait, maybe I need to backtrack. Let me think differently. The string starts with t37 t65, which are from NT8 and NT6. So, does any production of S lead to NT8 and NT6?\n\nLooking at S's productions, the relevant one might be S -> NT8 NT2. Let's see: if S -> NT8 NT2, and then NT2 can produce NT6. Is that possible?\n\nLooking at NT2's productions:\n\nNT2 -> NT7 NT7\nNT2 -> NT6 NT8\nNT2 -> NT5 NT6\nNT2 -> NT7 NT8\nNT2 -> NT5 NT7\nNT2 -> NT9 NT8\nNT2 -> NT6 NT2\nNT2 -> NT8 NT9\nNT2 -> NT3 NT1\n...\n\nHmm, so NT2 can produce NT6 via NT2 -> NT6 NT8, but then NT8 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps S -> NT8 NT2, and then NT8 and NT2 can produce further.\n\nBut maybe it's better to work through the string step by step, checking each step.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT8 and NT2 (S -> NT8 NT2). Then NT8 produces t37, and NT2 needs to produce t65. Wait, but looking at the NT2 productions, can it produce t65?\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT2's productions don't have t65 directly. The terminals from NT2 are t34, t8, etc., but no t65. Wait, hold on, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the NT2 productions again.\n\nWait, the grammar rules for NT2 are:\n\nNT2 -> NT7 NT7\nNT2 -> NT6 NT8\nNT2 -> NT5 NT6\nNT2 -> NT7 NT8\nNT2 -> NT5 NT7\nNT2 -> NT9 NT8\nNT2 -> NT6 NT2\nNT2 -> NT8 NT9\nNT2 -> NT3 NT1\n...\n\nSo, all these productions go to non-terminals, except:\n\n- Looking for NT2 -> t65. I don't see any production of NT2 that directly produces t65. Hmm, but wait, in the string, the second token is t65, which I thought came from NT6. But is there a way for NT2 to produce t65? It seems not, based on the rules. So maybe my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps t65 comes from NT6, which is produced by NT6 -> t65. So, in the string, the first two tokens are t37 (NT8) and t65 (NT6), which would require S to produce NT8 and NT6. But looking at S's productions, none directly produce NT8 and NT6. So maybe my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nLet me look at S's productions again. Oh, wait, I see S can also produce NT8 and NT2, but that's S -> NT8 NT2. So if S produces NT8 and NT2, then the first token t37 is from NT8, and the second token is from NT2, which is supposed to produce t65. But looking at NT2's productions, none generate t65. So that would be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, another initial production from S: S -> NT6 NT3. If that's the case, then t65 would come from NT6, and the first token might come from NT3. But then, I have t37 t65 t37, which would require NT3 producing t37. Let's check NT3's productions.\n\nLooking at NT3:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\nNT3 -> NT1 NT5\nNT3 -> NT8 NT4\n...\n\nNone of these directly produce t37. Wait, no, looking back, I see that in the terminals, NT3 is also assigned to t30, t37, etc.\n\nWait, let me see. In the grammar, each non-terminal can be replaced by a terminal or combination.\n\nWait, earlier in the rules, for example:\n\nNT3 -> t30\nNT8 -> t37\nNT6 -> t65\nSo, NT3 can produce t30, NT8 can produce t37, NT6 can produce t65, etc. That's helpful.\n\nSo, when I see a terminal, I can check which non-terminals produce that terminal.\n\nSo, first token is t37: this can only come from NT8, since NT8 -> t37.\n\nSecond token is t65: can come from NT6, since NT6 -> t65.\n\nSo, the first two tokens come from NT8 and NT6.\n\nSo, S must produce NT8 and NT6 through one of its productions. Looking at S's productions:\n\nS -> NT8 NT2\n\nYes, that's one of the productions.\n\nSo, S can produce NT8 and NT2. Then, the next step is to check if NT8 and NT2 can produce the rest of the string.\n\nBut wait, the initial step would be: S => NT8 NT2.\n\nThe first symbol is t37 (from NT8), and the second is t65. Now, we need to see what NT2 can produce.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that NT2 can't produce t65 because looking at NT2's productions, none go directly to t65. But wait, perhaps through a chain.\n\nBut looking back, the string after t37 t65 is t37 again. So, the third token is t37, which would again have to come from NT8.\n\nSo, maybe this is building a string like NT8 NT6 NT8 ... and so on.\n\nWait, but let's outline the steps more clearly.\n\nThe given string is: t37 t65 t37 t90 t40 t30 t19 t30 t12 t19 t41 t90 t90 t8 t42 t90 t41 t65 t91 t75.\n\nLet me list the tokens:\n\n1. t37\n2. t65\n3. t37\n4. t90\n5. t40\n6. t30\n7. t19\n8. t30\n9. t12\n10. t19\n11. t41\n12. t90\n13. t90\n14. t8\n15. t42\n16. t90\n17. t41\n18. t65\n1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-376","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that context-free grammars (CFGs) are defined in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to be in that form for the non-terminals, as each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t60 t52 t52 t10 t91 t33 t88 t37 t37 t40 t65 t40 t91 t12 t8 t10 t37 t19 t30 t25`. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the string is `t60 t52 t10 t91 t33 t88 t37 t37 t40 t65 t40 t40 t91 t12 t8 t10 t37 t19 t30 t25`. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check: the string given is `t60 t52 t10 t91 t33 t88 t37 t37 t40 t65 t40 t40 t91 t12 t8 t10 t37 t19 t30 t25`. Okay, that's 20 tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several production rules that expand into terminals. The goal is to see if the string can be derived by starting from S and applying these rules.\n\nLet me first list the terminals in the string:\n\nt60, t52, t10, t91, t33, t88, t37, t37, t40, t65, t40, t40, t91, t12, t8, t10, t37, t19, t30, t25.\n\nI notice that some of these terminals are on the right-hand side of production rules. For example, t60 is a terminal (NT6 -> 't30')? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think terminals are when NTx has a production to a single terminal, like in the grammar, NT9 -> 't75', etc. So each terminal is a specific string.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar sections, I see lines like NT9 -> 't75', which is a terminal. So the grammar is a set of production rules, some for non-terminals, and when a non-terminal has a rule that ends with 'a', it's a terminal. So I need to figure out which parts of the string are terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string using the top-down approach, starting from S. Alternatively, since the grammar is given, maybe building a parse tree would be possible.\n\nBut manually doing that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can check if each part of the string can be matched by the productions.\n\nAnother way is to model this as a parsing process, but it's a bit complex. Alternatively, I can check for each symbol in the string (excluding the spaces) if it can be a terminal that's defined in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, many non-terminals expand into two non-terminals, except for a few, which expand into a single terminal.\n\nFor example, S -> NT3 NT9. So the string would start with t60 being generated by NT3, or NT9?\n\nSimilarly, let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to find the sequence of non-terminals and terminals that would fit the string.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t60 t52 t10 t91 t33 t88 t37 t37 t40 t65 t40 t40 t91 t12 t8 t10 t37 t19 t30 t25.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I think that each rule is as follows (since it's in Chomsky normal form):\n\nFor example:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2\netc.\n\nEach NT has rules, like NT8 -> NT6 NT1, etc.\n\nI need to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of these productions.\n\nLet me try to start from the beginning.\n\nFirst symbol: t60.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, which NTs produce t60? Looking through the rules, I don't see a direct NTx -> 't60'. Wait, actually, in the grammar, some NTs are linked to terminals. I need to check each production.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT6 -> 't34' (line nt6)\n- NT1 -> 't25' (line nt1)\n- NT7 -> 't40' (line nt7)\n- NT5 -> 't91' (line nt5)\n- NT8 -> 't37' (line nt8)\n- NT0 -> 't13' (line nt0)\n- NT9 -> 't75' (line nt9)\n- NT2 -> 't33' (line nt2)\n- NT3 -> 't30' (line nt3)\n- NT4 -> 't88' (line nt4)\n- NT6 -> 't8' (line nt6)\n- NT1 -> 't40' (line nt1)\n- NT7 -> 't10' (line nt7)\n- NT1 -> 't19' (line nt1)\n- NT1 -> 't12' (line nt1)\n- NT4 -> 't88' (line nt4)\n- NT9 -> 't60' (line nt9)\n- etc.?\n\nWait, looking carefully:\n\nIn the grammar, I see that:\n\n- NT9 -> 't75' (line nt9: last line)\nWait, no, looking back, wait, no, actually, in the given grammar, at the end, there are several lines like:\n\nNT9 -> 't75', etc. Wait, but I see in the grammar provided, for example, line `NT9 -> 't75'` is probably at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps 't60' is not a terminal in this grammar because I don't see any production ending with 't60' as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again through all the rules:\n\nFrom the grammar list, I see production rules for non-terminals like NT9 -> 't75', but nowhere do any non-terminals produce 't60' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t60.

Looking through the grammar rules, 't30' is produced by NT3, because one of the rules is NT3 -> NT6 NT2, and then NT6 and NT2 might produce 't30' and 't2'.\n\nWait, let me check all the rules. Oh, looking at the rules, I see NT9 -> 't91', and several rules leading into NT9. Also, NT0 has multiple rules, but I don't see NT0 -> 't30'\u2014wait, I see NT3 -> 't30' directly. Yes, that's correct. So NT3 can produce 't30'.\n\nSo the first part, 't30' comes from NT3. That means in the derivation, somewhere we have NT3 being expanded. Now, the first production for S is S -> NT3 NT9. So the entire start is NT3 NT9. So the first part would be NT3 -> 't30', and then NT9. So that gives us 't30' from NT3, then we have to see what NT9 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, I see NT9 can go to 't52', 't65', 't37', 't91', etc. Let's see:\n\nIn the grammar, the main productions for NT9 are:\n- NT9 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT9 -> 't75' (that's t75, which isn't in our string)\n- NT6 -> 't34'? Wait no, let's check NT9's rules: Oh, looking through, I see NT9 -> 't91', 't60', but I don't see 't52' in NT9's rules. Wait, looking through, NT9 can be NT9 -> NT6 NT1, which might produce 't52'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm is efficient.\n\nFirst, I'll note that CYK involves building a table where each cell represents possible non-terminals that can derive a substring. The string has 21 tokens. I'll list them as positions 0 to 20.\n\nBut before that, let me make sure I understand the grammar.\n\nLooking at S, it can be NT3 NT9. So the first part of the string must come from NT3, and the second from NT9.\n\nStarting with the first token 't30': as we saw, NT3 can produce 't30' via the rule NT3 -> 't30', which is directly under the first production (since in the rules, NT3 -> NT6 NT2, but there's a direct rule for NT3 -> 't30').\n\nSo, the first part of the string starts with NT3 expanding to 't30'.\n\nNext, after 't30', the next token is 't8'. Now, we need to see how this comes from NT3's expansion: NT3 -> NT6 NT2. So 't30' comes from NT3 -> 't30' (since NT6 can produce other things, but since it's a direct terminal here). Wait no: the rule NT3 -> NT6 NT2 might derive to 't30' if either NT6 or NT2 can produce 't30'. Wait no, actually, let me correct: in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal directly expands to a terminal. So, if NT3 has a rule NT3 -> 't30', then that's a production that directly results in 't30'. So when building the string, the first token is 't30' from NT3.\n\nBut wait, in the S production, S -> NT3 NT9. So the entire string starts with NT3 expanding to either 't30' or possibly other things. Let me see: in the rules, NT3 has a rule NT3 -> 't30', so that's a direct production. So the first token is 't30' from NT3, and then the next token(s) come from NT9.\n\nWait, but after 't30', the next token is 't8'. So the first token is 't30', which comes from NT3 -> 't30'. Then, after that, how do we get 't8'? Hmm, maybe the breakdown is that the entire string is the concatenation of T1 T2...T21, and each Ti is a terminal generated by a non-terminal.\n\nSo, let's try to parse the entire string step by step.\n\nThe entire string is:\n\nt30 t8 t40 t65 t34 t90 t88 t52 t13 t37 t42 t90 t12 t30 t8 t41 t37 t91 t41 t41 t52\n\nSo, 21 tokens. Let's index them from 0 to 20.\n\n0: t30\n\n1: t8\n\n2: t40\n\n3: t65\n\n4: t34\n\n5: t90\n\n6: t88\n\n7: t52\n\n8: t13\n\n9: t37\n\n10: t42\n\n11: t90\n\n12: t12\n\n13: t30\n\n14: t8\n\n15: t41\n\n16: t37\n\n17: t91\n\n18: t41\n\n19: t41\n\n20: t52\n\nSo, the start symbol S generates NT3 NT9 (S->NT3 NT9). So, the string must be derivable from NT3 and NT9. So each non-terminal in the production must generate a substring, and their concatenation must form the entire string.\n\nSo, the string can be viewed as the concatenation of u v, where u is derived from NT3 and v from NT9.\n\nFirst, let's look at NT3's derivations. NT3 can produce 't30' via NT3 -> 't30'. So the first token is 't30' from NT3.\n\nThen, the remaining tokens must be derived from NT9. So let's take the rest of the string starting from t8 at position 1.\n\nSo from position 1 to 20, the string is 't8 t40 t65 t34 t90 t88 t52 t13 t37 t42 t90 t12 t30 t8 t41 t37 t91 t41 t41 t52'.\n\nSo, the NT9 part must generate this entire substring.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, possible rules are:\n\n- NT9 -> 't52' (if that's a rule)\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT9, I think the following are present:\n\n- NT9 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT9 -> 't65'\nWait, looking through all the entries, I think I see that NT9 can have a production leading to 't52' via NT6 -> t34 and NT2 -> t8, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, looking through all the NT9 rules:\n\nWait, in the rules, is there an NT9 -> 't52'? Or is that via another production.\n\nWait, looking back: from the given grammar, does NT9 have a rule leading to 't52'? Let's see:\n\nLooking for 't52' in NT9's rules or in any productions.\n\nNo, I don't see 't52' directly. Hmm, perhaps via a chain.\n\nWait, in NT9, let's see the rules:\n\nNT9 -> 't91'\n\nNT9 -> 't60'\n\nBut I think we might need to find a chain from NT9 to 't52'.

{"custom_id":"request-394","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the terminals. The grammar provided seems to consist of various non-terminal symbols like S, NT3, NT9, etc., and some terminals like 't34', 't37', and so on. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal tokens: `t34 t37 t99 t90 t65 t41 t88 t41 t30 t37 t37 t37 t14 t10 t52 t37 t33 t88 t23 t23 t22`.\n\nMy task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nAlright, let me start by breaking down the problem. Maybe I should construct a parse tree for the string and see if all the terminals in the string can be matched by the production rules.\n\nLet me list out the production rules first to have a clear picture. The grammar has a number of rules like S -> NT3 NT9, NT8 -> NT0 NT2, and so on, with each rule having two non-terminals on the RHS. Then, there are rules where non-terminals are replaced by terminal symbols, like NT9 -> 't75', NT6 -> 't8', etc. Also, there are rules that recursively define non-terminals, such as S -> NT3 NT9, NT6 -> NT3 NT6, NT4 -> NT2 NT8, and so on.\n\nHmm, the first thing I notice is that the start symbol S is replaced by NT3 NT9. So the string should start with the terminals from NT3 and NT9. According to the rules, NT3 can be expanded into NT6 NT2, and NT9 can be broken down into 't75' in one of the rules. Wait, no, looking again, some of the NT9 rules are to terminals, so I need to check which path NT3 and NT9 take.\n\nLet me look at NT3. From the rules, NT3-> NT6 NT2. Then, NT6 has some rules: NT6 -> NT4 NT5, NT6 -> NT3 NT6, and others. Hmm, so NT6 can be expanded recursively.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 has several rules, including NT9 -> 't75'. Wait, no, looking more closely, some of the NT9 rules are terminal, like NT9 -> 't90', but others are more complex. Wait, no, the rules listed for NT9 include NT9-> 't75', NT9-> 't60', etc. So perhaps some paths of NT9 lead to terminals, others don't.\n\nWait, the string I'm checking starts with 't34', which must be from some terminal symbol in the grammar. Looking at the rules, the non-terminals that directly expand into terminals include:\n\n- NT0 -> 't13' (among others)\n- NT6 -> 't34' (I see a rule NT6-> 't34')\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT1 -> 't25'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT5 -> 't91'\n- NT2 also has a rule NT2-> 't37', among others.\n\nWait, no, actually, the rules as written are a bit confusing because of the indentation. Let me try to parse them correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first part is:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\n\nS is the start symbol. So the first step is to split S into NT3 and NT9, so the string must begin with the terminals expanding from NT3 and NT9.\n\nNow, looking at NT3: from the rules, NT3 can go to NT6 NT2. So let's see what NT6 and NT2 can produce.\n\nNT6 has several rules, like NT6-> NT4 NT5, NT6-> NT3 NT6, etc. Hmm, so NT6 can branch out.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 can be broken down into various non-terminals, some of which are terminals. For example, looking at the rules:\n\nNT9 -> 't75' (I think that's one of the options). Similarly, other NT9 rules might lead to terminals. Alternatively, some of the rules for NT9 are into non-terminals like NT1, etc.\n\nBut the initial step is that S-> NT3 NT9, so the string must start with NT3's expansion followed by NT9's. Let's break those down.\n\nNT3 can be NT6 NT2. Let's look at NT6's possible expansions.\n\nLooking up, NT6 has rules like:\n- NT6-> NT4 NT5\n- NT6-> NT3 NT6\n- NT6-> NT8 NT4\n\nAnd also NT6 can go to NT4 NT5, etc. So, for example, if NT6 becomes 't34', as per one of the rules (NT6-> 't34'), which is helpful because the string starts with 't34'.\n\nSimilarly, for NT9, I need to see if it can expand into 't90', 't75', etc. For example, one of the NT9 rules is NT9-> 't75', another is NT9-> 't60', and others. But the string starts with 't34', so perhaps I need to find NT3's production that leads to 't34'.\n\nWait, but NT3's first expansion is NT6 NT2, which are two non-terminals. So the initial part of the string 't34' must come from either NT6 or NT2 in the NT3 production.\n\nWait, no. NT6 is a non-terminal; when expanded, it could lead to terms, but NT3 is a sequence of NT6 NT2, so the entire NT3 would generate a string that's the concatenation of what NT6 generates and what NT2 generates.\n\nSo, if NT6 is replaced by 't34', then NT2 must also be replaced by a terminal, in order for the entire NT3 to be 't34' followed by something else. But the string after 't34' is 't37', so maybe that's the next part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT2 can expand into a string that starts with 't37', but looking at the rules, NT2's rules include NT2-> 't33' and others, but 't33' is a terminal, so if NT2 is expanded into 't33', then the next term after 't34' in the string would have to be 't33'. Looking at the string, after 't34' is 't37', so that doesn't fit. So maybe NT6 is 't34' followed by NT2 which is 't37' via some other expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me start building the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is: t34, t37, t99, t90, t65, t41, t88, t41, t30, t37, t37, t37, t14, t10, t52, t37, t33, t88, t23, t23, t22.\n\nStarting with S, which goes to NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the first two symbols should come from NT3 and NT9.\n\nLet's see what NT3 and NT9 can expand into.\n\nLooking at NT3: its rules are primarily NT6 NT2. So NT3 expands to NT6 NT2. Therefore, the first part is NT6, and the second part is NT2.\n\nSo, the first symbol t34 must come from either NT6 or NT2. Let's check NT6:\n\nLooking at NT6's rules, there's a rule NT6-> 't34'. So if NT6 is t34, then the second symbol would come from NT2. Looking at the string, the second symbol is 't37'. So, NT2 would need to generate 't37'.\n\nLooking at NT2's rules, I see that NT2 has a rule NT2-> 't33'. Hmm, that's a terminal. Also, a rule NT2-> 't37' is one of the non-terminal rules. Wait, looking back, the rules do include NT2-> 't37' as a non-terminal? Or is it a terminal?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I think I may have confused terminals with non-terminals. Wait no, in the grammar, terminals are the exact strings, so for example, if NT2 has a rule that eventually leads to 't37', then perhaps NT2 can expand into that.\n\nWait, but the NT2's rules include NT2-> 't37' as a production.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for terminal symbols. Each production has two non-terminals or one non-terminal and a terminal. Since CNF requires productions to have exactly two non-terminals or one non-terminal, any production with a terminal needs to be handled carefully. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the only productions where a terminal appears are when the non-terminals eventually derive into a single terminal. For example, NT6 \u2192 't34' is a production, meaning NT6 directly generates the terminal 't34' after some steps. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't75', etc.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals. To check if the string can be derived, I'll need to see if there's a way to break the string into parts that correspond to the productions, starting with the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT9. So, the first part of the string should correspond to NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is 't37', which I need to see if it's generated by NT3 or NT9.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT3 has production NT8 and NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. NT6 can go to 't34', and NT2 goes to 't37'.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, the first part is NT3 and the second is NT9.\n\nNT9's production leads to terminals like 't75', 't60', 't22', etc. Looking at the string, the second token is 't37', which is also an NT9 production? Wait, no, NT9's productions end in specific terminals. Wait, the string starts with 't37', so NT3 needs to produce 't37', or wait, maybe the first part is NT3 which produces a sequence ending in 't37' and NT9 which produces another sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to derive the string from the grammar, step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser could be used, but I'm not familiar with writing a parser, so perhaps I can try to find a sequence of productions that matches the string.\n\nLooking at the string, let's break it down: t37 t70 t37 t30 t30 t90 t52 t40 t37 t30 t8 t8 t40 t40 t8 t70 t34 t40 t25 t30 t91 t42.\n\nWait, that's 21 tokens. The string seems quite long, but perhaps it can be split into parts based on the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, the string should be split into two parts: part from NT3 and part from NT9.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions: NT9 can produce 't75', 't60', 't22', 't14', 't99', 't23', 't57', 't37', etc. Wait, the string starts with 't37', which is a terminal derived from NT9. Specifically, looking at the grammar, I see a rule NT9 \u2192 't75', NT9 \u2192 't60', etc., including 't37'. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT3 has a production where it can lead to 't37' via NT4 \u2192 't88' and then other steps, but more accurately, I should check the NT3 and NT9 productions to see how they can generate parts of the string.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is 't37'. Let's see what NT3 produces. According to the grammar, NT3 can be replaced by NT8 NT2. So, if I choose NT3 \u2192 NT8 NT2, then the first part of the string would be generated by NT8 and NT2.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions: There's NT8 \u2192 't52', which is a direct terminal. So, if NT8 is 't52', but the first token is 't37', so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, wait: perhaps the start symbol S produces NT3 NT9, and each of these non-terminals produces sequences of terminals. So, the first token in the string must be generated by either NT3 or NT9, but the first token is 't37', which I need to see if it's a possible derivation from NT3 or NT9.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT9 has a production \u2192 't37' (since in the given grammar, NT9 \u2192 't37' is present). So, if the first token is 't37', that would come from NT9. Wait, but according to the string, the first few tokens are 't37', 't70', 't37', etc., but the start symbol is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So, if the first part is NT3, it must generate a sequence, and then NT9 generates another. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the order.\n\nWait, maybe I should structure it differently. Let me think: The string is a sequence of terminals, so from the grammar, each non-terminal production must eventually lead to a sequence of these terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, see if it fits.\n\nThe string is: t37 t70 t37 t30 t30 t90 t52 t40 t37 t30 t8 t8 t40 t40 t8 t70 t34 t40 t25 t30 t91 t42.\n\nWait, that's 21 tokens. Let me see if this is a long string derived from multiple non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if the string can be split into parts that align with the grammar rules.\n\nLet me consider that S starts with NT3 and NT9. So, the first part of the string is generated by NT3, and the second by NT9.\n\nIf we focus on the first part (before 't37'... not sure).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Another approach is to note that in CNF grammars, each production reduces to exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or one terminal). So, parsing from the left, I can try to build the string by recursively applying the productions.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to check if all the terminals in the string are covered by the grammar. So, the grammar produces certain terminals like 't30', 't34', 't37', etc. Let me check each token against the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, several terminals are present:\n\n- 't30': Yes\n- 't34': Yes\n- 't37': Yes\n- 't40': Yes\n- 't52': Yes (NT8 \u2192 't52')\n- 't40' again, yes\n- Then, 't8' perhaps via NT2 \u2192 't33' and others, but checking the grammar, NT2 can end up as 't33', but that's not in the string. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't8'? Let me check: indeed, in the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 't65' and another production that's NT6 \u2192 't8', yes.\n\nWait, so the grammar does produce these terminals, so that's a good sign.\n\nBut that's just the individual tokens. The challenge is to see how they fit into the productions.\n\nBut maybe the string comes from multiple applications of the productions. Let me think of possible starting points.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So, the first part is NT3, the second is NT9.\n\nSo, the string will be the concatenation of the sequence generated by NT3 and the sequence generated by NT9.\n\nIn the string, after the first 't37', which if it comes from NT9, then the next terms would be from NT9's production. But wait, no, if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then NT3 is first, generating the first part, and NT9 generates the second part.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is 't37', which I think comes from NT9. So, perhaps NT3 generates the first few tokens.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that each non-terminal can generate a substring of the entire string.\n\nLet me think: from S, we split the string into two parts, one generated by NT3 and the other by"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-414","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, this might take a while, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That helps because it means the parse trees are binary, and each production step can derive two symbols at a time.\n\nThe string to check is: `t30 t34 t42 t90 t99 t12 t33 t65 t12 t52 t8 t90 t75 t30 t40 t30 t8 t52 t30 t13 t99 t37`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nLet me first look at the start symbol S. From the grammar, S can produce two NT3 and NT9 (S \u2192 NT3 NT9) or two NT3 and NT2 (S \u2192 NT3 NT2). So, S starts the string, but the string starts with t30, which I assume corresponds to a terminal derived from a certain non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3, NT8, etc., but let's see what each non-terminal expands into in terms of terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to identify the terminals that each non-terminal can produce. Let me list some of the terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, many of them end up converting to 't' followed by a number, like t30, t34, etc. So each non-terminal could potentially produce one of these terminals. So, each production for a non-terminal, like NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, but eventually, each of these NTs must reduce to a single 't' symbol when deriving a string.\n\nSince the string only consists of terminals, each production during derivation must be a terminal production (A \u2192 a) or a binary production that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nWait, but to get a terminal string, every non-terminal must eventually derive into a sequence of terminals, which in this case, each non-terminal seems to be directly mapped to a terminal because in the list, there are rules like NT3 \u2192 't30', NT6 \u2192 't34', etc. So, each non-terminal directly corresponds to a specific terminal.\n\nLet me verify that. For example:\n\n- NT3 can produce 't30'\n- NT8 can produce 't37'\n- NT9 can produce 't75'\n- NT0 can produce 't13'\n- NT1 can produce 't40'\n- NT2 can produce 't33'\n- NT4 can produce 't88'\n- NT5 can produce 't37'\n- NT6 can produce 't65'\n- NT7 can produce 't40'\n- NT9 can produce 't90' or others, but each terminal is unique per NT.\n\nWait, but that might not entirely be correct because some NTS may have multiple productions, some leading to terminals and others to non-terminals. But looking at the given productions, each NT seems to have at least one production that directly maps to a terminal. For example, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 't30', so that's direct.\n\nSo, given that, perhaps each step in the derivation of the string must match a sequence of T-terms where each T is generated by a NT's production.\n\nBut wait, the grammar in CNF allows each production to be either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So when deriving a string, each step combines two symbols, either two terminals, a terminal and a non-terminal, a non-terminal and a terminal, or two non-terminals.\n\nBut since all the terminal symbols are unique per NT, the string is a concatenation of terminals, each corresponding to a particular NT.\n\nSo, the string is: t30 t34 t42 t90 t99 t12 t33 t65 t12 t52 t8 t90 t75 t30 t40 t30 t8 t52 t30 t13 t99 t37.\n\nWait, but looking at the list, NT9 has a production NT9 \u2192 't75' and also others. Similarly, NT8 can produce 't52' as well as other combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently.\n\nSince each production is either A\u2192a (terminal) or A\u2192BC with B and C being NTS, the entire string must be a sequence of terminals derived from a series of such productions, starting from S.\n\nEach non-terminal must produce exactly one terminal in this case, because otherwise, the string would require multiple symbols each time, which it doesn't\u2014the string is a flat list of terminals, so each step must produce exactly one terminal symbol at a time, which only happens when the non-terminal being used has a production to a terminal.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, the only way to produce a single terminal at a time is to have a production that directly produces that terminal. Otherwise, each merge of two NTS could only produce two symbols.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string is a sequence of one symbol at a time, so each step in the derivation must be direct productions of NTs to terminals.\n\nLet me check the NTs in the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 't30', so directly gives t30\n- NT8 \u2192 't37', 't52', etc.\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT1 \u2192 't40'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', 't37' (wait, no, looking back: NT2 \u2192 't33', also other rules like NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9, which are non-terminals, so perhaps NT2 can have a direct terminal in some other production), but looking back, I think I might have misread it earlier.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the production rules, the terminals are:\n\nt30, t34, t42, t90, t99, t12, t52, t8, t75, t37, t65, t40, t13, t99, t37.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some because the grammar is extensive.\n\nLooking at specific rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT6 \u2192 't34'\n- NT8 \u2192 't37' (multiple rules)\n- NT9 \u2192 't75', 't60' (I see some others, like NT9 \u2192 't22', but likely each has at least one terminal production)\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT1 \u2192 't40'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', 't37' (but also other non-terminal productions)\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT has at least one direct terminal production. For example:\n\nLooking at NT3: 't30'\n\nNT8: production rules like NT8 \u2192 't52', 't65', etc.\n\nNT9: produces 't75', 't60', 't37', etc.\n\nNT0: 't13' (among others)\n\nNT1: 't40'\n\nNT2: 't33', 't37'\n\nNT4: 't88'\n\nNT5: 't37'\n\nNT6: 't34'\n\nSo, each of these NTs has at least one direct production to a terminal.\n\nTherefore, each production in the string must be a single NT that produces a terminal.\n\nSo, the entire string must be a sequence of such NTs, each mapping to a terminal, in the order such that the NTs are connected via the start rule.\n\nLet's analyze the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t30 t34 t42 t90 t99 t12 t33 t65 t12 t52 t8 t90 t75 t30 t40 t30 t8 t52 t30 t13 t99 t37.\n\nWait, that's 21 tokens.

It looks like the grammar consists of a set of production rules that define a context-free language. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, and from the given rules, S can derive NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So the string must start with either of these NT sequences. Each NT is a non-terminal that breaks down further.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t13`, `t70`, `t91`. From the grammar rules, I can see that NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7 and NT7 \u2192 NT6 NT5, but let me see:\n\nWait, the string starts with `t13 t70 t91...`. So S \u2192 NT3 NT9? Because S \u2192 NT3 NT2 would lead to `t13` maybe. Wait, no, NT3 leads to `t30`, right? Because looking at the rule, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and NT6 \u2192 t8, NT2 \u2192 t37, so that leads to t8 t37, which is t88. So NT6 \u2192 t8, NT2 \u2192 t37. So NT3 \u2192 t8 t37 = t88, which is one of the terminals. But in the string, the first term is t13.\n\nWait, maybe S \u2192 NT9... because NT9 can lead to some terminals. Let me check the production S \u2192 NT3 NT9. If NT9 leads to t19 t70, perhaps?\n\nLooking at NT9, from the given rules, there are several productions. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5. NT1 \u2192 NT0 NT4, NT0 \u2192 t13. NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6, which would be t88 t8. So that leads to t13, t88, t8? Or maybe NT1 \u2192 t25 via NT1 \u2192 't25' directly, as given, because in the right-hand sides, some have 't' terms. So, the first term is t13, which could come from NT0 \u2192 t13 directly. Wait, does NT0 have a production to 't13'? Yes, looking at the rules: NT0 \u2192 't13' is one of the productions. So maybe NT0 starts a part that leads to t13.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT3 NT2, as a possible initial step, leading to NT3 which might produce something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT9..., as the first NT could produce t13. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I should try to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use a top-down approach, trying to match the string starting with the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t13 t70 t91 t99 t91 t19 t40 t70 t19 t99 t37 t91 t88 t42 t13 t41 t42 t19 t8 t12 t19 t12 t40.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me start by seeing if the first term t13 can be matched by any production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 \u2192 't13', which is a terminal. So t13 could be produced by NT0. But how does that fit into the overall structure?\n\nLooking at S, the productions are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So after S, we have two non-terminals. Also, there are other productions for S, but let me check:\n\nFrom the given rules, S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2, but I don't see S \u2192 NT2 anywhere else, but looking more closely, I see S -> NT3 NT9 and S -> NT3 NT2, so these are the only two options for S. Wait, in the provided rules, S can produce NT3 NT9 and NT2. Wait, maybe I missed some. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has multiple S rules, but it seems the first line shows: S \u2192 NT3 NT3 NT9, which I think was a mistake. Wait, looking at the rules, the first line is S -> NT3 NT3 NT9, which I don't think is correct. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo or mistake in the initial problem statement. Wait, let me parse the grammar rules correctly.\n\nWait, the first line is S -> NT3 NT3 NT9? Or is it S -> NT3 NT9?

Let me proceed carefully.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar rules, S's first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT3 NT9. That seems to have three NTs. But usually, in Chomsky normal form, productions are binary. So perhaps the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2, as other productions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake and the first production should be S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and the second S \u2192 NT2.\n\nWait, but I should perhaps focus on the given data.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is a standard form that has trinomials (A \u2192 BCD) and possibly a start symbol producing nothing. But looking at the grammar, most productions are of the form S \u2192 NT X, where NT and X are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the grammar works. The grammar has several non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) that eventually expand into terminals (like t10, t12, etc.). The string we need to evaluate consists of a series of these terminals.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I should check if there's a derivation path from the start symbol S to the given string. However, with the complexity of the grammar and the length of the string, this seems daunting. Maybe there's a smarter way by looking for possible patterns or structures in the grammar that match the string.\n\nLet me write down the key productions that involve the terminals found in the string:\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, several produce terminals:\n\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT1 -> 't25'\n- NT2 -> 't33', 't37'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT4 -> 't88', 't42', 't99', 't8'\n- NT5 -> 't91', 't37'\n- NT6 -> 't65', 't8', 't34'\n- NT7 -> 't40', 't10', 't70', 't10'\n- NT8 -> 't52', 't60', 't23', 't37'\n- NT9 -> 't90', 't75', 't60'\n- NT9 -> 't37' (multiple times)\n\nNow, the string starts with t90, which is produced by NT9: `t90` is a terminal, so NT9 must directly produce it. So the first token 't90' comes from NT9 producing 't90'. So the start symbol S must expand into something that eventually leads to NT9.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So S can produce NT3 followed by NT9. Therefore, for the string to be generated, after some expansion, it must end with NT9, and before that, NT3, and leading up to S.\n\nBut our string starts with t90, which is NT9's terminal. So that suggests that the last part of the derivation is NT9 \u2192 't90'. So the string must be such that the last part is t90, but looking at the string, the last token is 't37', which is also a terminal. Wait, that's a problem. Because the string ends with t37, which is a terminal. So perhaps the last part of the string is t37, which must come from NT8 or NT2 or other non-terminals that produce 't37'.\n\nBut wait, according to the grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So S directly derives into NT3 NT9. Then, for the string to be generated, the entire string must be a concatenation of the terminals produced by these non-terminals. So the entire string must be a sequence of terminals resulting from the expansion of NT3 followed by NT9.\n\nWait, but NT9 can produce 't90' directly, which is the first token in the string, but the string ends with 't37', which is not 't90'. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the string isn't directly derived from S but has more steps.\n\nLet me check the grammar again. S can only go to NT3 NT9. So any string generated must be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT3 and NT9. So the string must be something like (NT3 expansion)(NT9 expansion).\n\nLooking at the string: it's a list of terminals, so let me split them into two parts where NT3's production ends and NT9's begins. But looking at the string, it starts with t90, which is NT9's terminal. So if NT9's production only gives 't90', then the entire string after that would have to be NT3's production. But the string ends with 't37', which is a terminal, so perhaps NT3's expansion ends with 't37', and NT9 \u2192 't90'.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't fit because NT3 can expand into other non-terminals as well. So perhaps the first part of the string (up to some point) is generated by NT3, and the rest by NT9. Let me see: the string is t90 t65 t12 t40 t99 t25 t91 t8 t42 t10 t88 t40 t60 t33 t37 t25 t8 t22 t34 t42 t10 t52 t37.\n\nWait, the string starts with t90, which is NT9, so that would mean that the entire string must be a production of NT9, but S must produce NT3 followed by NT9. Therefore, the entire string is (NT3's expansion)(NT9's expansion). Since the first symbol is t90, which is NT9's production, that suggests that the first part of the string (up to some point) is generated by NT3 and the rest by NT9.\n\nBut if NT9's production only gives 't90', then the rest of the string (like t65 t12...) must come from NT3. But the string ends with t37, which is also a terminal. So let me check where the production for NT3 can end.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nSo let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nNow, NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 or other terminals, but more on that later.\n\nNT2 has several productions: NT2 \u2192 t33, t37, t68 (wait, looking back, NT2's productions are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t37, t68, t77, etc.? Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, let's list all NT2 productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT2 \u2192 't37'\n- NT2 \u2192 't52'\n- NT2 \u2192 't68' (checking the full list)\nWait, I'm not sure. Let me list all possible productions for NT2:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT2 -> t33\nNT2 -> t37\nNT2 -> t52\nNT2 -> t68\nNT2 -> t77\nWait, no, checking again:\n\nLooking at all NT2 productions in the grammar:\n\n- NT2 -> t33\n- NT2 -> t37\n- NT2 -> t52\n- NT2 -> t68\n- NT2 -> t77\n- NT2 -> t8 (from NT6 \u2192 ...? No, wait, that's NT6)\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recheck the full grammar:\n\nLooking at NT2 entries:\n\nNT2 -> 't33'\nNT2 -> 't37'\nNT2 -> 't52'\nNT2 -> 't68'\nNT2 -> 't77'\nBut I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me list all NT2 productions:\n\nLooking up the grammar, the relevant ones are:\n\nFrom the given productions:\n\nNT2 -> t33\n\nNT2 -> t37\n\nNT2 -> t52\n\nNT2 -> t68\n\nNT2 -> t77\n\nPlus, looking for other NT2 productions:\n\nFrom the given list:\n\nNT2 -> NT6 NT7\n\nWait, no, wait. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n\n- NT2 -> 't52'\n\n- NT2 -> 't68'\n\n- NT2 -> 't77'\n\n- NT2 -> NT6 NT7\n\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT8\n\nWait, no, I think I'm misreading.

{"custom_id":"request-450","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific rules: every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit this structure as most of the rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t37 t23 t99 t19 t70 t30 t42 t23 t40 t33 t12 t10 t91 t37 t19 t52 t70 t52 t25 t37 t60 t88 t37 t75.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Let me consider how to approach this.\n\nOne method is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse strings in CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm works by checking, for each position in the string, which non-terminals can derive the substring starting and ending at that position.\n\nBut since applying the full CYK algorithm here seems time-consuming, maybe I can instead try to trace backward from the string to see if S can generate it step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. Let's see what S can produce. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So, the string must start with NT3 and followed by NT9.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t37, which is a terminal. Let's check if t37 can be derived from NT3 or NT9.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT9 has a production that includes t99, but more importantly, NT9 has a rule NT9 \u2192 't75'. Wait, no\u2014looking again, some NT9 rules go to terminals, like NT9 \u2192 't75'. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't60' and other terminals. Also, NT9 can produce 't37', which is a terminal. So, t37 can come from NT9 via that production.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 has a production that goes to 't30', another terminal. So, t30 would come from NT3.\n\nWait, let me parse the string correctly. The first token is t37, so if the string is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then the first part should be NT3 generating t37 and the second part NT9 generating t19 or something?\n\nWait, wait. Let me structure the string as a list of tokens:\n\nt37, t23, t99, t19, t70, t30, t42, t23, t40, t33, t12, t10, t91, t37, t19, t52, t70, t52, t25, t37, t60, t88, t37, t75.\n\nThat's 23 tokens. Hmm, that's quite a lot. Parsing such a long string manually might not be feasible. Maybe I can look for the smallest possible substrings first, like single terminals and pairs, and see if they match any production.\n\nLet's start by looking for 't37' and 't23' because they are the first few tokens. I need to check if these terminals can be derived from some non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for any production where the right-hand side is a sequence of these terminals. For example, looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce multiple terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I can find rules where a non-terminal A produces a pair of terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 't52', but that's a single terminal. Wait, no, some rules produce more than one terminal? Wait, no, all the rules either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, in the given grammar, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Therefore, any production that results in two terminals in a single step is possible if, say, A produces B followed by C, each B and C producing a terminal.\n\nBut in this case, let me check if 't37 t23' can be derived from a single non-terminal. Scanning the grammar, is there a non-terminal A where A can produce 't37 t23'?\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't75' is a single terminal, so that's just 't75'.\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't30' as one of its rules.\n\n- NT2 has several productions, including NT2 \u2192 't33', 't12', etc.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to check if any production can directly produce two consecutive terminals. For example, NT9 has a production NT9 \u2192 't70', and others like 't52', 't40', etc. Similarly, NT7 can produce 't40' or 't10', etc.\n\nLooking for the first two terminals: t37 and t23. Do any of the non-terminals produce a sequence that can derive these?\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 't34', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT8 has a production to 't52', and others to 't37', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see if some non-terminals can produce these pairs. For example, looking for any rule A \u2192 a b, but in the given grammar, all rules are either to two non-terminals or one terminal. So, perhaps I need to check if a non-terminal can produce a string that starts with 't37 t23' through a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to outline the process:\n\n1. The entire string must be generated by S, which starts as NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, the string must be a concatenation of the substring derived by NT3 and the substring derived by NT9.\n\nThe input string starts with 't37 t23 t99 t19 ...', so after S \u2192 NT3 NT9, we have NT3 generating the substring starting with 't37' and NT9 generating the rest of the string. Wait, no, because S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the entire string must be NT3 followed by NT9. Therefore, the first part of the string is 't37', which is generated by NT3, and then the next part is a concatenation of NT9's derivation.\n\nWait, no, the first token is t37, which must come from NT3, which has a production to 't30'. That doesn't match because 't30' is different from 't37'. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial productions.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 't30' but also others. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that NT3 has a production that says NT3 \u2192 't30', but also other rules.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a way for NT3 to derive 't37' as the first token. Let me check all productions of NT3.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I think I might have miswritten the grammar earlier. Let me list the productions for NT3.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n\nAdditionally, other rules? Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nWait, am I missing any production for NT3 that leads to a single terminal? Or perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, the lines are as follows:\n\nLooking for NT3 as a non-terminal.\n\nYes, I see here:\n\n\"NT3 -> NT6 NT2\"\n\"NT3 -> NT4 NT8\"\n\nSo, no, NT3 doesn't have a production that directly produces a terminal like 't30' necessarily.

The string is: `t30 t12 t52 t30 t40 t37 t34 t99 t37 t37 t70 t37 t40 t14 t8 t41 t33 t8 t88 t70 t91 t41 t91 t40`.\n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal. That makes parsing, specifically with a CYK algorithm, feasible. But manually doing this for a long string might be time-consuming, so I should look for a smarter approach.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces NT3 NT9. So the string must start with whatever NT3 and NT9 produce. Additionally, each non-terminal leads to certain terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT9 can produce 't75' and 't37', among others. But the string starts with 't30', so let's see what NT3 produces.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules:\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT3 -> NT9 (from the given rules)\n\nSo NT3 can eventually lead to terminals through these paths. Let me check the possible terminals from NT3.\n\nFrom NT3 -> NT6 NT2:\n- NT6 can produce 't8', 't65', 't34', 't90', 't5' (I'll need to check the rules).\nWait, in the provided rules, NT6 has:\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT5\n- NT6 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT6 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT8\nWait, actually, looking at the provided rules, NT6 has:\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT5\n- NT6 -> NT8 NT4 (multiple times, maybe a typo)\n- NT6 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT6 doesn't directly go to a terminal except maybe from other rules.\n\nWait, the terminal productions for NT6 aren't directly listed because most of NT6's rules lead to other non-terminals. So I might have to follow the chain until I find a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on the start symbol S.\n\nSince S produces NT3 NT9, let's see what NT3 can produce:\n\n- NT3 can produce NT6 NT2, which goes to NT9 (from NT3 -> NT6 NT2 and NT9's productions). But the string starts with t30, which is from NT3 -> NT9.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it too much. Let me check each part step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t30, t12, t52, t30. Let's see what can produce t30.\n\nLooking at the terminals:\n\n- NT3 can produce t30 directly from NT3 -> NT9, because in the rules, NT9 can produce t30 (from NT9: \u2192't30').\n\nSo the first part of the string is t30, which must come from NT3 -> NT9.\n\nNow, the next part is t12, t52. Let's see if t12 comes from NT9. Looking at NT9's rules, it can produce 't91', 't75', 't37', 't60', 't70', 't41', 't91' again, 't37' again, 't14', 't88', 't14', 't99', and others.\n\nBut 't12' is not directly listed as a terminal from NT9. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 't12' comes from another non-terminal through NT9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 't12' is produced by another rule. Looking at the NT0 rules, for example, NT0 can produce t12 via NT0 -> NT4 NT8, where NT4 has a production for t88 and others. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the parts of the string and see if they can fit into the grammar. Let's break the string into segments and see where they might come from.\n\nThe first word is 't30'. As I mentioned, this can come from NT3 -> NT9, where NT9 produces 't30'.\n\nThe second word is 't12'. Let's see if 't12' can come from any non-terminal. Looking at the rules, I don't see NT9 producing 't12'. Similarly, NT0 produces 't12' via NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT8, where NT4 \u2192 t88, but also wait, looking at the rules, I'm seeing that NT4 might produce 't88', 't25', or other terminals. But I don't see an 't12' directly.\n\nWait, let me check the entire set of terminal productions to see if any non-terminal produces 't12'.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT8 can produce 't52' (from NT8 \u2192 't52')\n- NT0 can produce 't13' (from NT0 \u2192 't13')\n- NT6 can produce 't34' (from NT6 \u2192 't34')\n- NT1 can produce 't25' and 't40' and others, I think.\n\nWait, looking again, I see:\n\nIn the rules, some non-terminals directly produce certain terminals.\n\nFor example:\n- NT9: 't75', 't37', 't60', 't70', 't41', 't91', 't37' (twice?), etc.\n- NT8: 't52', 't37', 't6', 't8', etc.\nWait, looking specifically for 't12':\n\nIs there any non-terminal that directly produces 't12'? Looking at the rules, I don't see any. So 't12' must come from a longer path.\n\nWait, perhaps it's part of the production of another non-terminal. For example, maybe NT0 produces 't12' via NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT8, where NT4 \u2192 something and NT8 \u2192 something that eventually yields 't12' as a combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't12' comes from NT2, which can produce 't37' via NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6 and then NT5 and NT6 might lead to t12. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider using the CYK algorithm. However, doing that manually for 23 tokens would take a lot of time. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or see if the string can be broken down into parts that fit into the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be generated step by step, starting from S and applying the productions.\n\nWait, let's consider S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the first symbol is generated by NT3, and the next by NT9.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n- First symbol: 't30' \u2192 must come from NT3 \u2192 NT9 (since NT3 can go to NT9, which is a terminal).\n\nSo the first part is 't30' from S's NT3.\n\nNext is 't12'. So 't12' must come from NT9's production.\n\nBut checking the rules for NT9, I don't see 't12' as a direct production. Wait, NT9 can produce via other paths. For example, NT9 can produce 't30' directly, but 't12' isn't directly an option.\n\nSo perhaps 't12' comes from a different path. Maybe NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT8, where NT4 could produce 't40' and NT8 produces 't12', but I don't see NT8 producing 't12'.\n\nWait, let's see if any other non-terminals can produce 't12'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't12'. So 't12' must be produced by a non-terminal, say X, such that X can expand into a sequence that includes 't12'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't12' can be part of a production involving another non-terminal. For example, if NT0 produces 't12' via a chain, but I can't see it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 't12' can come from NT2 or NT5, etc.\n\nLooking at NT2's rules: NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6 and others. Maybe through NT2, but I'm not sure how that would lead to 't12'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't12' can come from NT4, but in the rules, I don't see NT4 producing 't12' directly either.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at other parts. For example, the string after 't12'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-475","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The string is: `t30 t33 t23 t23 t70 t65 t37 t19 t75 t37 t37 t33 t60 t10 t65 t25 t42 t13 t10 t42 t52 t13 t12 t8 t23`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to analyze the structure.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals (all the 't' terms with numbers), so the task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The goal is to see if S can generate this string through a series of substitutions.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So, each S production has two parts, which are connected by a space in the string. That suggests the string should have pairs of words that come from the two parts of the productions.\n\nLet me break down the string:\n\nIt's 25 terms long (let me count: t30, t33, t23, t23, t70, t65, t37, t19, t75, t37, t37, t33, t60, t10, t65, t25, t42, t13, t10, t42, t52, t13, t12, t8, t23). 25 is an odd number, but each production from S introduces two parts, so if S produces something, it's either NT3 and NT9 or NT3 and NT2. Then each of those non-terminals will produce further sequences. So, the total number of terms should be a product of each production's output, which are all terminals. So each step of production increases the count by 1? Or perhaps it's the product of the branching factors. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal. So, when a non-terminal is expanded, it could lead to more terms.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use a parse tree and see if the entire string matches.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the string seems quite long, maybe it's better to look for a pattern or to see if each part can be matched by the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, a lot of non-terminals have productions that eventually resolve to terminals like 't30', 't33', etc. So each non-terminal can be mapped to a single terminal.\n\nWait, that might not be the case. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many rules have non-terminals on the right side. For example:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT8\nNT0 -> NT1 NT3\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, for example, NT8 can produce NT6 and NT8, leading to potentially recursive steps until a terminal is reached.\n\nBut perhaps it's possible that each non-terminal eventually expands to exactly one terminal. So, if that's the case, each production from S would produce two terminals, but in this case, the string is longer than four terms, so maybe it's built up through multiple expansions.\n\nBut to get a better handle, let me see if the terminals in the string correspond to any non-terminals in the grammar. For example, 't30' is present. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't30' in the right-hand sides. From the rules, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT6 -> NT9 NT2\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\nAnd others.\n\nBut none of the productions directly end with 't30' except in the leaf nodes. For example, NT6 can produce 't8' or other things, but 't30' is only in NT3's productions, which go to NT6 and NT2, which go deeper.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar rules, some non-terminals directly resolve to terminals. For example:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nSo, some non-terminals are terminals. So, non-terminals can expand to terminals or other non-terminals. Therefore, the string is made up of terminals, but each terminal is a single 'txxx' thing, so in this case, each 't30' is a separate terminal.\n\nSo, each time a non-terminal resolves to a terminal, that terminal becomes part of the string.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some non-terminals directly have terminal rules, like NT9 -> 't75', which is a single terminal. So, perhaps each terminal in the string corresponds to one of these productions where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal.\n\nBut to check if the string is generated, we can try to parse it step by step.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to see if the string can be constructed by tracing back from the start symbol, but given that the string is quite long, this might be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the string. Let's see:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt30 t33 t23 t23 t70 t65 t37 t19 t75 t37 t37 t33 t60 t10 t65 t25 t42 t13 t10 t42 t52 t13 t12 t8 t23.\n\nLooking at the sequence, I can group these into possible leftmost derivations.\n\nStarting from S -> NT3 NT2.\n\nSo, S would split into NT3 and NT2. Then each of those produce some sequences.\n\nBut given the string is quite long, perhaps we can check if the entire string can be reconstructed by substituting each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be generated by the grammar by checking the productions of each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to model the string as a sequence of non-terminals that derive into the terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for each terminal in the string and see if it's present as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that many non-terminals resolve to specific terminals. For example:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nNT6 -> 't34'\n\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nNT8 -> 't52'\n\nNT5 -> 't91'\n\nNT4 -> 't88'\n\nNT3 -> 't30'\n\nNT7 -> 't40'\n\nNT6 -> 't34'\n\nNT2 -> 't33'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nWait, that can't be because NT6 can't resolve to both 't34' and 't8'? Or is each NT6 a specific one?\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT6 has multiple productions, but the right-hand sides include terminals and non-terminals. So, for example:\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT2\n\nNT6 -> NT3 NT6\n\nBut also:\n\nLooking further down, I see NT6 -> 't34' as a rule. So NT6 can be 't34' or other things. So it's possible that NT6 can be resolved to a terminal or further expanded.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking for NT6 rules:\n\nI see:\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT2\n\nNT6 -> NT3 NT6\n\nNT6 -> 't34'\n\nSo, yes, NT6 can directly produce 't34' as a terminal, in addition to other productions.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT0:\n\nNT0 can produce 't13' and also other non-terminals. So in the string, a 't13' would be derived from NT0.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 has a production to 't88'.\n\nSo, in the string, whenever a terminal appears, it's either because a non-terminal directly resolves to that terminal, or it's the result of substituting a non-terminal until we reach a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to check is to see if every terminal in the string can be traced back to a production in the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to create a parsing tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, to make this manageable, perhaps I can model the string as a sequence of terminals, and for each position, check which non-terminals can produce that terminal, and see if the entire sequence can be built.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, let's try to group it into parts.\n\nFirst, starting from S, which is NT3 NT2.\n\nSo, S can be written as NT3 NT2. So, replacing NT3 and NT2 with their respective productions.\n\nLooking at NT3, from the grammar:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\n\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\n\nSimilarly, NT2 -> NT7 NT7\n\nNT2 -> NT5 NT6\n\nNT2 -> NT3 NT1\n\nNT2 -> NT6 NT8\n\nSo, each of these can be expanded further.\n\nLet me try"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, S->NT3 NT9 is two non-terminals, and then another production like NT9 -> 't75' is a terminal. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nTo determine if a string can be generated by this grammar, I need to perform a parsing process. Essentially, I should check if the string can be broken down using the productions, ensuring that each part of the string corresponds to the symbols generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string provided is a series of tokens (t30, t40, t88, etc.). The approach here is to model the parsing using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI'm going to try to parse the string step by step, starting from the left, and see if I can apply the productions correctly. \n\nFirst, let's split the string into individual tokens:\n[\"t30\", \"t40\", \"t88\", \"t19\", \"t12\", \"t10\", \"t8\", \"t37\", \"t40\", \"t33\", \"t14\", \"t25\", \"t23\", \"t22\", \"t30\", \"t25\", \"t40\", \"t60\", \"t37\", \"t40\", \"t34\", \"t30\", \"t65\", \"t70\", \"t88\"]\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has the production S -> NT3 NT9. So the first two tokens should match NT3 and NT9.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, S -> NT3 NT9 is correct. So the first two tokens should be 't30' (NT3) and 't40' (NT9). Check the string: first token is 't30', then 't40' \u2013 so that's correct. \n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT9, consuming the first two tokens.\n\nNow, moving on to the next part. Let's look at how NT3 can produce further tokens. From the grammar, NT3 has a production NT3 -> NT6 NT2 and NT3 -> 't30'. Wait, wait. Looking back, the NT3 productions are:\n\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n\nWait, in the original grammar, under 'NT3' there are three productions. One of them is NT3 -> 't30'. So after the initial S-> NT3 NT9, the next part would be to parse NT3 and NT9 separately.\n\nBut wait, after NT3 is 't30', which is token 1. Then, the next parse is NT9, which is 't40'. So each of NT3 and NT9 need to be parsed into their respective terminal tokens.\n\nLet me proceed step by step:\n\nParsing the first two symbols: NT3 and NT9, giving t30 and t40.\n\nNow, after that, the next symbol is t88. Since NT9 can produce 't75' or maybe other things, but wait, in the production list for NT9, I see:\n\nNT9 has productions like -> 't75', etc. So perhaps we're starting to parse beyond the initial S.\n\nWait, I might be getting confused. Let me try to think differently. Since the string has 25 tokens, and the grammar's start is S, which splits into NT3 and NT9.\n\nEach of these non-terminals must generate sequences that lead to the tokens.\n\nSo, the first step is NT3 producing t30, and NT9 producing t40. Then, perhaps the remaining tokens are a result of the interactions between NT3 and NT9?\n\nWait, no. The string is a linear sequence, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me clarify:\n\nThe string is a sequence of symbols, each corresponding to a terminal production from some non-terminal.\n\nEach production in the grammar either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, in parsing, each step would involve resolving a non-terminal into either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThus, the parsing process would proceed by looking for non-terminals in the current context and replacing them with their productions, thereby expanding the string step by step.\n\nBut given that the entire string is being provided, maybe the approach is to represent the string as a tree, where each node is a non-terminal and each leaf is a terminal. We need to check if this can be built from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a linear sequence of terminals, we can check if there's a derivation that generates it by starting from S and replacing non-terminals with their productions until only terminals are left, matching the given string.\n\nThis might get complicated, but perhaps we can proceed step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with S.\n2. Replace S with NT3 NT9.\n3. Now, we have two parts: NT3 and NT9. Each of these needs to be replaced.\n\nLooking at the initial string, the first token is t30, which is the production for NT3, so perhaps NT3 \u2192 t30. Similarly, the next token is t40, which is the production for NT9, so NT9 \u2192 t40.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT3 and NT9 have other productions. It's possible that there's a chain. Let me check:\n\nFor NT3, possible productions are:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n\nSince the first token after S is t30, that suggests that NT3 is replaced directly by t30. So the remaining part after NT3 would be NT9, which is replaced by t40.\n\nBut then after processing S, we would have t30 t40, which are the first two tokens. The rest of the string must be generated from the parts resulting from NT3 and NT9. Wait, but in this case, NT3 and NT9 are both terminals, so after replacing, we'd only get t30 and t40, but the rest of the string is much longer. So that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, perhaps NT3 and NT9 must each be replaced by sequences of productions involving non-terminals, leading to the rest of the string.\n\nWait, that suggests that S can't directly produce t30 t40 because the subsequent parts of the string are more complex. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is the result of replacing S with a series of productions, each of which may introduce new non-terminals, until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe it's better to model this as a context-free grammar and check the string by trying to find a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be checked by attempting to split it into parts that correspond to leftmost derivations.\n\nBut this might take a while. Since I'm allowed to think for a while, let me try to outline a step-by-step process.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the string starts with NT3 followed by NT9.\n\nWe can match the first few symbols as t30 t40, which correspond to NT3 and NT9 respectively if:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t30 and NT9 \u2192 t40.\n\nBut if we do that, then the remaining string is \"t88 t19 t12 t10 t8 t37 t40...\" etc., which isn't matching anything yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT3 and NT9 have other productions that generate more non-terminals that can then be matched by the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 can produce:\n\n- NT6 NT2\n- NT0 NT7\n- t30\n\nSimilarly, NT9 can produce:\n\n- t75 (among others, but for now, let's focus on t40 being terminal).\n\nSo, after S \u2192 NT3 NT9, we can consider each of NT3 and NT9 to be replaced by other non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that after replacing S, the first NT3 is replaced by some non-terminals, and NT9 is also replaced by some non-terminals, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps I should model this as a recursive descent parser, tracking the current position in the string and seeing if it can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a parsing table approach, but that might be tedious for a manual process.\n\nBut since"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That might help in parsing the string or generating it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it has a bunch of non-terminals and replacement rules. The start symbol is S, which immediately splits into NT3 NT9 based on the first rule: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the string must start with NT3 followed by NT9.\n\nWait, but in the input string, the first two tokens are t91 and t65. So I need to check if NT3 can derive t91 or if NT9 can derive t65. Let me look into the production rules for NT3 and NT9.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT9 has some rules including NT9 \u2192 't91', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT3 has NT3 \u2192 't30'. But in the input string, the first two tokens are t91 and t65. Hmm, so let me check if NT3 can derive t91. Wait, no. NT3's rule is NT3 \u2192 't30'. So NT3 can only produce t30. That's a problem because the first token is t91, which must come from NT9.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is invalid because the initial symbols from S are NT3 and NT9. Since S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and the first token is t91, which comes from NT9, perhaps there's someone who can generate t91. Let me check NT9's rules.\n\nLooking at NT9: NT9 \u2192 't91' directly. That's a production, so NT9 can generate t91. So the first symbol of the string, t91, is generated by NT9. But the first rule says S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which starts with NT3, which should generate t30, but the string starts with t91.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me parse the production rules again.\n\nActually, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the leftmost symbol is NT3, which must generate the first part, and then NT9 must generate the rest. So the first token must be NT3, but the first token in the string is t91, which is a terminal, generated by NT9. That's a contradiction because NT3 can't generate t91; it can only generate t30.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rules. When we derive, the non-terminals expand into symbols. So starting from S, the first step might be to split into NT3 and NT9. Now, NT3 expands into symbols, and NT9 expands into symbols. So for the string to start with t91, that would have to come from NT9, since NT3 only produces t30. So the first symbol is generated by NT9, but the production rule for S requires that it starts with NT3. That's a problem because NT3 can't produce the first symbol t91. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar is ambiguous, and there's a way the NT9 can somehow generate more non-terminals that can lead to the initial t91. Let me see NT9's rules. NT9 can produce strings that eventually lead to t91 or other terminals. Wait, but in the first step, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So even if NT9 can derive t91 along with some other symbols, the whole expansion would have to start with NT3, which can't generate t91. \n\nWait, no, because when you expand, it's leftmost derivation. So starting from S, you replace S with NT3 NT9. Then, you replace the leftmost non-terminal, which could be NT3 or NT9, but the first symbol starts with NT3, which can only generate t30 or other non-terminals downstream. But if I start by replacing NT3, it might produce more symbols. For example, if NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT2 or other non-terminals. \n\nWait, let's look at NT3's production rules. NT3 has several rules, but none directly show NT3 generating t91. It seems NT3 can produce other non-terminals like NT6, NT0, etc., but not terminals. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules for NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nWait, are there any other rules? Let me scan.\n\nWait, no. So NT3 can only produce other non-terminals, not terminals. So when we have NT3 in the expansion, it must produce one of those non-terminals. So in the leftmost derivation, starting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the leftmost non-terminal is NT3, which can replace into NT6 NT2. Now, the leftmost symbol becomes NT6, then we process NT6, which can produce NT8 NT4 or other non-terminals. \n\nThis seems to be getting complicated. Maybe there's an easier way. Let's see, if the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and NT3 can only produce non-terminals, then the first symbol of the string must come from NT3 somewhere down the line. But the string starts with t91, which is a terminal, so that can only come from NT9, but initially, the production starts with NT3. \n\nAh, but maybe NT3 can eventually lead to NT9 through some expansions. Let's see. Let me try to see if NT3 can derive something that leads to NT9 or directly to t91.\n\nLooking at NT3's production rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nSo let's see what NT6 and NT0 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n\nSo if NT6 is present, it can derive either NT9 NT2 or NT4 NT5.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 has rules like:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT7\nAnd others.\n\nBut let's try to find a path from NT3 to t91. Let's say starting from NT3:\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNow, replace NT3 with NT6 NT2. So we have NT6 NT2 NT9.\n\nStep 2: Replace NT6 with NT9 NT2, leading to NT9 NT2 NT2 NT9.\n\nBut this seems to be getting into a loop. Alternatively, perhaps NT3 can produce a combination that eventually outputs NT9, which then can produce t91.\n\nWait, let's consider this. Suppose we have NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Then NT6 can \u2192 NT9 NT2. So now, we have NT9 NT2 NT2. Now, replace the leftmost NT9 with 't91' directly, since NT9 \u2192 't91'. So the string would start with 't91 t2 t2 ...'.\n\nWait, the given string starts with 't91 t65 t41 t34 t40 t52 t91 ...' So the first symbol is 't91', which would come from NT9, but the first rule for S starts with NT3. How can that be?\n\nWait, unless there's a way to have NT3 expand into some symbols, and then those non-terminals eventually expand into t65, then NT9, etc. But NT3 can't directly produce terminals except through NT9. So perhaps the only way is if NT3 somehow expands into NT9, which immediately emits a 't91'.\n\nBut looking at the production rules, NT3 does not directly produce NT9. Let's see: NT3's rules are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nSo unless NT6 or NT0 can produce NT9, which might be possible.\n\nLooking at NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nSo if NT6 can produce NT9, then yes. So the path would be:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nThen, replace NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNow, we have NT9 NT2, and the next symbol is 't65'. Wait, but 't65' is the second token, which would have to come from NT2? Or perhaps another non-terminal.\n\nWait, the string's tokens are: t91 (first), which we've established comes from NT9. But the initial S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the first token should come from NT3. But NT3 can't produce a terminal. Hmm, unless NT3 can derive a string that starts with something that can produce 't65' as the first symbol, but that seems impossible.\n\nWait, let me re-examine."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-497","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I have a context-free grammar (CFG) given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and a string that I need to check whether it can be generated by this grammar. The string to check is: `t90 t40 t90 t13 t40 t40 t30 t19 t40 t42 t90 t12 t10 t13 t25 t30 t40 t42 t33 t14 t23 t37 t8 t33 t65 t37`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. The grammar is a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side (LHS) is replaced by two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS), except for the terminals, which are the actual strings in the string we're checking. Since it's in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, the approach is to parse the given string from left to right using the productions. Since it's in CNF, each production can only yield two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals. However, in our case, the terminals are the tokens, and the non-terminals are the heads of the productions.\n\nMy first thought is to represent the given string as a sequence of symbols: t90, t40, t90, t13, t40, t40, t30, t19, t40, t42, t90, t12, t10, t13, t25, t30, t40, t42, t33, t14, t23, t37, t8, t33, t65, t37.\n\nNow, let's look at the start symbol, which is S from the given grammar rules. The initial expansion from S should produce a sequence starting with the two productions of S, which are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So, S can expand into any sequence that starts with these combinations.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So, S \u2192 NT3 NT9 is one option, and S \u2192 NT3 NT2 is another. Therefore, any string derived from S must consist of a combination of symbols starting with NT3, followed by either NT9 or NT2, then expanding the remaining symbols recursively.\n\nSo the string must start with whatever NT3 expands into, followed by either whatever NT9 expands into or NT2, but all in sequence.\n\nNext, I should note that each production is in CNF, so each step only allows the replacement of a non-terminal with exactly two symbols (either both non-terminals or a mix). However, terminals can only be produced by themselves, so we have to see how the non-terminals expand into the terminals.\n\nBut the string given is all terminals. That means that in the derivation, every production must eventually produce a string of terminals without any non-terminals left. Therefore, each step must produce a terminal when possible.\n\nWait, but no, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC. So, each step produces two symbols, but when those two are terminals, then the derivation ends. Because you can't replace a terminal anymore.\n\nBut in our case, the string given is all terminals, so the derivation must expand all the way without any non-terminals left if the string is in the language. That means that the entire string must be produced by a series of productions that replace non-terminals with other non-terminals until all are replaced by terminal symbols.\n\nTherefore, we can approach this as a parsing problem where we try to split the string into a sequence that can be explained by the productions, step by step.\n\nBut manually trying to parse such a long string is going to be time-consuming. Instead, perhaps I can look for patterns or see if certain terminals can be grouped together based on the grammar rules.\n\nLet me look at the strings and see if any of them can directly correspond to a production. For example, some of the tokens have two digits, like t30, t40, etc. So maybe certain combinations of these can be considered as if they are derived from a single production.\n\nBut wait, each production only replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So, each step would split a non-terminal into two symbols. Therefore, the entire string is built by starting from S and splitting into two, then splitting those into two each, and so on, until all are terminals.\n\nTherefore, the length of the string should be 2^n where n is the number of splits. However, our string has 26 tokens, which is not a power of two, since 2^4 is 16 and 2^5 is 32. So, 26 is between 2^4 and 2^5, but it's not a power of two, so that would suggest that it's impossible to derive the string because each split should double the number of symbols, starting from 1 (S) and then 2, 4, 8, etc.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe the parse tree can have branches with different depths, meaning the string could be a left- or right-heavy parse tree, so the total number of terminals can be between 2^(depth-1) and 2^depth. Hmm, but 26 is not a power of two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be a sentential form of the grammar. So maybe it can be broken down into production rules in such a way that it's possible.\n\nWait, but for the string to be a left derivation, the number of symbols must be 2^n. So, if the string has 26 symbols, which is not 2^n, then it's impossible. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's count the number of symbols: 26. 2^4 = 16, 2^5=32. 26 is between them, but not equal to either. So, it's not possible. Therefore, the string cannot be derived from S because the length of the string is not a power of two.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again: each non-terminal expansion adds two symbols. So starting from S, which can produce either two non-terminals or a mix, the number of symbols in the string must be a sum of such steps. But for a proper parse tree, the number of leaves (terminals) is 2^n, where n is the height of the parse tree. Because each node in the parse tree splits into two, so the height determines the number of leaves as 2^(height).\n\nWait, so the height of the parse tree would be such that the number of leaves is 2^n. Therefore, if the string has 26 symbols, which is not 2^n, then it's not possible. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the string is a mix of different non-terminals, and some of the splits are on the ground level, meaning that the number of symbols could be more flexible. Wait, no, I think the total number of symbols is determined by the number of splits. Each step doubles the number of non-terminals, but once a non-terminal is replaced by terminals, it stops. So, the total number of symbols should be equal to the number of non-terminals replaced, which is the number of splits during the derivation.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the derivation as a process starting from S, and each production increases the number of symbols by 1 more than before.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think of it more clearly. Suppose at each step, each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. If a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, it contributes 1 symbol. If it's replaced by two non-terminals, then each of those could contribute more.\n\nBut the key point is that the total number of symbols in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of times S has been split. But in our case, the number of symbols is 26, which is not a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be derived by the given CFG.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check the grammar rules again. The start symbol S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Then, each of those NT3 and NT9 or NT3 and NT2 can produce other non-terminals. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, so each step doubles the number of non-terminals.\n\nWait, but if a production produces a terminal, then that non-terminal only contributes 1 symbol. So, let's take an example. Starting from S:\n\n1. S expands to NT3 NT9, which has 2 symbols.\n2. Then, NT3 could expand into NT6 NT3, and NT9 into NT3 NT7. So, NT6 NT2 NT1 NT1 NT3 NT7. That's 6 symbols.\n3. Each of those could further expand into more symbols, so each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-510","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, context-free grammars are defined by having the left-hand side of the production rules as a single non-terminal symbol, which can be replaced by a sequence of other symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. \n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of production rules, each starting with a left-hand side (e.g., S -> NT3 NT9) and then expanding into symbols. Each production seems to consist of two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, no, looking again, actually, some of the rules have one side as two non-terminals, like NT8 -> NT6 NT8, but there are also some that have a non-terminal and a terminal, like NT9 -> 't40'. Oh wait, no, in CNF, each production has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal? Wait, no, wait: in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. Or is it allowed for B or C to be terminals? I think in standard CNF, all productions have two non-terminals on the right. But in this case, I see some rules where the right-hand side is a single symbol, which might be terminals. For example, NT9 -> 't40' is a terminal. So that complicates things because in standard CNF, all productions have two non-terminals. So maybe this grammar is slightly extended, not strictly CNF, or perhaps it's being used with some ambiguity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Looking again, each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal? Or maybe some are two symbols. Like S -> NT3 NT9, which is two non-terminals, so that's fine. Other rules like NT8 -> 't52' is a terminal. Wait, but how does that fit into the standard Chomsky Normal Form? I think in standard CNF, the productions are all of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So any production that produces a terminal would take the grammar out of CNF. So perhaps this grammar isn't in CNF because some rules produce terminals. That might complicate things, but maybe it's okay because it's still a CFG.\n\nBut wait, the fact that some rules produce terminals could make it a Type 3 grammar, but I'm not sure. Hmm, regardless, I need to figure out if the given string can be generated by this grammar.\n\nThe string provided is: `t90 t70 t42 t40 t40 t65 t91 t37 t34 t99 t8 t8 t30 t65 t40 t33 t23 t60 t40 t33 t40 t88 t99 t13 t19 t40 t70`\n\nI notice that each symbol is separated by a space, so it's a sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nThe problem is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions: S -> NT3 NT9 and S -> NT3 NT2.\n\nEach of these is two non-terminals. So, to get to a string of terminals, each non-terminal must eventually derive into some terminal symbol or chain of productions that end in terminals.\n\nI should probably list all the terminal symbols present in the string. Let's see: t90, t70, t42, t40, t65, t91, t37, t34, t99, t8, t8, t30, t65, t40, t33, t23, t60, t40, t33, t40, t88, t99, t13, t19, t40, t70.\n\nSo all these are terminals, meaning that they must correspond to some production rules in the grammar where the non-terminals eventually produce them.\n\nOne approach is to model this as a parsing problem, trying to see if the given string can be parsed by the grammar using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string's length should be 2^n for some n, but the given string has 29 symbols, which is not a power of two, so that might immediately suggest it's a \"No\", but wait, no\u2014that's only the case if all derivations are exactly doubling each step. But in CFGs, you can have derivations where some steps produce more than others, so the length isn't necessarily a power of two. However, in CNF, each production produces exactly two symbols, so the number of symbols generated at each step is 2^k, where k is the number of steps beyond the initial. So a string of length m can only be derived in a grammar in CNF if m is a sum of different 2^k terms? Or perhaps it's better to check the structure.\n\nWait, the string length might not be a problem because CNF allows for any number of symbols as long as during each step, each non-terminal expands into two symbols. But that's not necessarily true because some non-terminals may expand into terminals, while others expand into non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the matter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the grammar's possible terminals. Let's look at all the terminal symbols in the string. Each should correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar's terminal productions: I see that many non-terminals like NT2, NT3, NT4, etc., eventually produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT2 -> 't33', 't8', 't23', etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, many of the non-terminals like NT2, NT3, etc., seem to produce both terminals and non-terminals. So for example, NT9 -> 't40' is a terminal, but others like NT8 -> 't52' or NT0 -> 't13', etc., are also terminals. So perhaps the key is that some non-terminals can produce terminals directly, while others require expanding further.\n\nTo get started, perhaps I can try to see if each symbol in the string can be derived through the grammar.\n\nBut this seems like a lot. Maybe a better approach is to see if all symbols in the string are present in the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are given whenever a non-terminal expands into a single terminal symbol. For example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT6 -> 't65'\n- NT1 -> 't25'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT5 -> 't37'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't30' (Wait, no, looking back: NT3 -> 't30', right. So NT3 is a non-terminal that can derive 't30'.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 -> 't37', etc. So all the symbols in the string seem to be present as direct terminals in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, some terminals appear multiple times. For example, t40 appears several times, and t40 is produced by NT1 in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, the main issue is that the string may require a specific derivation. So to confirm, we need to ensure that a full derivation exists.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each production in CNF can produce exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So to produce a string of 29 symbols, the total number should be a sum of 2^k terms, or perhaps not. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about how a CFG in CNF can produce any number of symbols, as the process of production can include terminal and non-terminal expansions.\n\nBut how do we check if a particular string is in the language?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a parser or a derivation tree.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, the string starts with t90. Let's see where t90 comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 -> 't30', but also NT3 appears in other productions, such as NT3 -> NT6 NT2, and so on. But how do we get t90? Wait, looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any non-terminals that produce t90. For example, I see NT9 -> 't75', but not t90. Similarly, nt3 can produce 't30' or more non-terminals. Wait, but perhaps t90 comes from NT9, but in the grammar provided, NT9 -> 't75', and also NT1 -> 't25', etc. So where does t90 come from? Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, looking through all the terminal rules in the grammar:\n\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

To get t37, we need to see if any rule directly produces t37 or if non-terminals can produce t37 directly. Looking, NT6: does it have 't37'? Let me check: NT6: the rules include NT6->t8, so 't8' is a terminal. So NT6 can only produce t8 directly. So how do we get t37 via NT6? Well, if a non-terminal can produce a combination that includes t37, but in the grammar, perhaps NT8 can produce t37 via NT8 -> NT3 NT6. Let me check: NT8 -> NT3 NT6. Now, NT3 can be resolved to 't30' (so t30 is a terminal) and NT6 is t8. So that would result in t30 t8, not t37.

{"custom_id":"request-535","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t37 t88 t33 t37 t70 t91 t40 t33 t22 t14 t12 t30 t91 t65 t90 t40 t37 t99 t91 t40 t37 t99 t13 t40 t23 t65 t90 t19`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure properly. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. That helps because the grammar should be parsed in a way that each step reduces the string by one token, and the total number of tokens should be 2^n - 1 where n is the number of non-terminals, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's heavily nested with non-terminals on both sides. My first thought is to see if any of the production rules for non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols. Let me scan the rules:\n\n- NT9 -> 't75' and others like NT8 -> 't52', NT0 -> 't13', etc. So these are the base cases where a non-terminal directly converts into a single 't' followed by a number.\n\nThis suggests that terminal symbols in the string map directly to these non-terminals. For example, 't88' must come from a production like NT4 -> 't88'? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't88'. Let me check: in the rules, NT4 indeed has at least one production rule where NT4 -> 't88'.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if each token in the string corresponds to a terminal derived from a non-terminal. The string starts with 't37', so I need to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't37'. Looking through the rules, I don't see an NT rule that directly produces 't37'. Hmm, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me go through the grammar more carefully. Scanning each NT and its productions:\n\nLooking through each NT production:\n\n- NT9 has two 't75' and other 't's.\n- NT8 has 't52', and other 't's.\n- NT6 has 't34' and others.\n- NT3 has 't30', others for 't62' (maybe not in the given list).\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar, I don't see NT3 having a terminal beyond 't30'. So 't37' is not directly produced by any NT. That's a problem because the string has 't37' as the second token.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't37' is a terminal, but in the grammar, perhaps a production leads to 't37' indirectly. Let's think: 't37' could be a terminal derived from an NT that can produce it through a chain. But looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly (through productions) produces 't37'. For example, NT8 has 't52', NT0 has 't13', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all NT productions for 't37':\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 has NT2 -> 't33', 't37', 't65', 't90', etc. Yes, 't37' is directly produced by NT2.\n\nAh, okay, that's something. So 't37' is directly produced by NT2. That's good. So the string starts with 't37', which must come from NT2. So the first symbol is 't37' which we've mapped to NT2.\n\nNext token is 't88'. So 't88' must be produced by an NT. Looking through the rules, I see NT4 -> 't88' which is a direct production. So 't88' comes from NT4.\n\nSo the first two tokens are 't37' and 't88', which correspond to NT2 and NT4.\n\nSo the string is structured as production S -> NT3 NT9, then each of those must eventually produce their respective parts.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the grammar: S has rules like S -> NT3 NT9, S -> NT3 NT2, etc. So the first token is from NT2, which I'm assuming comes from the production S -> NT2 in some form. But I'm not sure yet. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should start by breaking down the string into possible segments that correspond to the productions. Since the string is quite long, I'll need to break it down.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt37 t88 t33 t37 t70 t91 t40 t33 t22 t14 t12 t30 t91 t65 t90 t40 t37 t99 t91 t40 t37 t99 t13 t40 t23 t65 t90 t19\n\nLet me try to group the tokens into possible NT productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is at most two non-terminals, so each step would break the string into two parts. So parsing the string recursively might work.\n\nStarting with 't37': as established, it's from NT2.\n\nSo the first part is: NT2 (t37) -> NT2 (looking through the productions again, NT2 can produce several things, like nt25, etc.)\n\nWait, the first token is t37, which is from NT2, so NT2 must be generating t37 at the first step. So NT2 can produce t37, so that's possible.\n\nThen the next token is t88, which is from NT4. So perhaps NT2 produces a t88? Wait, looking back at NT2, does it produce t88? Let me check: No, looking through NT2's rules:\n\nNT2 has productions like NT2 -> NT6 NT7, NT2 -> NT5 NT7, etc., but does it produce t88? I think t88 is only produced by NT4 in the given grammar.\n\nWait, but t37 is from NT2, and t88 is from NT4, so perhaps S starts with NT2 and NT4? Because S can be NT2 NT4.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has a production rule S -> NT3 NT9, but also others. So maybe the start symbol S can be NT2 followed by NT4. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nWait, the starting symbol S can derive to NT3 NT9, which would be S -> NT3 NT9, but that might not directly help here. Alternatively, S can derive into other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is generated by S via some chain of productions. Since the string starts with NT2 producing t37 and the second token is NT4 producing t88, maybe the starting production is S -> NT2 NT4. So S would split into NT2 and NT4.\n\nSo the first two tokens would be the two parts from NT2 and NT4.\n\nBut wait, how would that work? Let me think about it. If S -> NT2 NT4, then the string would be NT2 t37, followed by NT4 t88. Wait, but the string has t37 and then t88, so that would fit if the first part is t37 and the second is t88. But S can produce NT2 NT4 directly, as per the rules:\n\nYes, S has a production rule S -> NT2 NT4.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar: line 2 is \"S -> NT3 NT9\", but are there other S rules? Let's look:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nYes, S has several rules:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\n\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nS -> NT6 NT2 (line 6 of the grammar)\n\nWait, it's hard to read all the lines, but looking for \"S -> NT2 something\":\n\nLooking for S's rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nLine 2: S -> NT3 NT9\n\nLine 3: S -> NT3 NT2\n\nLine 4: S -> NT6 NT2\n\nSo perhaps S can be NT2 with something else. Wait, for example, S -> NT3 NT2, but that doesn't directly split into NT2 and something else. Alternatively, does S have a production rule like S -> NT2 NT4?\n\nWait, no. Looking at line 2 of the grammar, S is only mentioned in several rules:\n\nYes, for example:\n\nLine 2: S -> NT3 NT9\n\nOther lines don't have S directly, so to parse S, I must find where it splits into two non-terminals. So the initial split would be like S -> NT3 NT9, or S -> NT3 NT2, etc.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-538","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given grammar generates the provided string. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two terminals or non-terminals on the right. That simplifies things a bit because I can parse the string by breaking it down into parts that match these rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t70 t99 t13 t40 t25 t88 t13 t41 t40 t52 t52 t88 t52 t75 t40 t37 t8 t37 t37 t70 t33 t12 t12 t8 t91 t41 t14`.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the tokens to see the sequence better. Each token is separated by spaces, so I have a list of 31 tokens. Now, I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many of them are two non-terminals on the left, like S -> NT3 NT9. So the string is a sequence of 14 such chunks (since S expands to two non-terminals each time, each level doubles the parts). Wait, no\u2014actually, since each rule produces two symbols, the string is made up of pairs. But actually, the string could be a series of symbols, but I think in this case, the grammar only has S and non-terminals expanding into terminal strings. Let's see.\n\nWait, the grammar has non-terminals like NT3, NT8, etc., and each production rule (like S -> NT3 NT9) produces a pair of non-terminals. The string consists of terminal symbols like t8, t70, etc. So each production chain will lead to a combination of these terminals.\n\nI think the strategy is to parse the string from the end, trying to match the rules backward. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or something similar. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll look for possible matches in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t8 t70 t99 t13 t40 t25 t88 t13 t41 t40 t52 t52 t88 t52 t75 t40 t37 t8 t37 t37 t70 t33 t12 t12 t8 t91 t41 t14.\n\nI'll start from the beginning and try to match possible grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the first token, t8. I'll look for a rule where a non-terminal immediately produces t8. Looking through the rules, I see that NT8 has rules producing t52, t37, t8, etc. For example, NT8 -> 't8' is a rule. So the first symbol t8 could be the result of NT8. So the string starts with NT8, and we need to parse the next symbol, which is t70.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each rule produces two symbols, so perhaps the string is built from applying rules step by step. Let me think differently. Each production in the grammar is a two-symbol production. So each application of a rule replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. Therefore, the string is a concatenation of symbols resulting from these productions.\n\nGiven that, the entire string should be a series of symbols from the grammar's terminals, and each original non-terminal in S would have to produce a sequence of terminals. So to parse the string, I can attempt to see if it can be split into chunks that correspond to the non-terminals.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S, which produces NT3 and NT9. So the string should start with a symbol that comes from NT3 and another from NT9. Let me check NT3's productions.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\nNT3 -> NT1 NT5\nNT3 -> NT9 NT8\nNT3 -> NT6 NT8\n... etc.\n\nHmm, let's see. The first token is t8. Does any rule for NT3 produce t8 as one of the symbols? Looking at the rules, yes: NT3 has a rule NT3->NT9 NT8, which would mean that NT3 could produce NT9 and NT8. But to have t8, the symbol after NT3 would be t8, but in the string, the first token is t8. So maybe NT3 is producing something leading to t8, but perhaps more likely, the first non-terminal is NT8, which directly produces t8.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. The start symbol is S, which expands into two non-terminals: NT3 and NT9. So the first part of the production would be NT3 producing some terminal symbols, followed by NT9 producing some terminal symbols.\n\nSo the entire string is a concatenation of the symbols from NT3's expansion followed by NT9's expansion.\n\nSo let's try to parse the string as (NT3 expansion) followed by (NT9 expansion).\n\nFirst, from S, we have S -> NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the string is of the form: (NT3 symbols) (NT9 symbols).\n\nSo let's separate the string into two parts: NT3 part and NT9 part.\n\nThe entire string has 31 tokens, so perhaps the NT3 part is 15 tokens and NT9 part is 16, but that might not be necessary. Instead, maybe each non-terminal (NT3 and NT9) can produce a certain number of symbols.\n\nBut without knowing the exact lengths, perhaps it's better to parse from the beginning.\n\nFirst symbol is t8. Let's see what NT3 can produce as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules:\n\n1. NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n2. NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n3. NT3 -> NT1 NT5\n4. NT3 -> NT9 NT8\n5. NT3 -> NT6 NT8\n6. NT3 -> NT3 NT1\n7. NT3 -> NT2 NT2\n8. NT3 -> NT2 NT7\n9. NT3 -> NT7 NT9\n10. NT3 ... (and more)\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll start by seeing if any of these rules can start with t8. Looking at the rules, I see that NT8 has a production -> 't8'. So perhaps NT3 could eventually be reduced to NT8, which then is 't8'.\n\nWait, no. NT3 produces NT8 as part of some chain? Let me check: does NT3 have a production that includes NT8 as the first symbol? Looking at the rules, I don't see an NT3 production that starts with NT8. So maybe that approach won't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT3 generates a sequence that starts with NT6, which might lead to t8.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each NT and their possible terminals.\n\nLooking more carefully, NT3 can directly produce NT8 as part of some expansion, but not as the first symbol. Let me see the possible symbols generated by NT3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at the end of the string first, as that might be easier because some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: ... t14. Let's see which NT could produce t14.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produce t14. Wait, let me check again. The rules for NT1 have several productions, such as NT1 -> 't25', 't40', 't91', etc. So NT1 can produce t25, but not t14. Wait, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the terminal symbols in the string and see which NTs can produce them directly.\n\nLooking through each terminal:\n\nt8: appears multiple times. For example, NT8 has rules producing t8, t70, t37, etc.\n\nt70: appears in the string. NT70? Wait, no, the NTs are things like NT8, NT9, etc. I'm getting confused. Wait, the non-terminals in the grammar are combinations of numbers and N, like NT3, NT8, etc. The terminals are the 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo each terminal is like 't8', 't70', etc.\n\nLooking at NT70: is 't70' a terminal that any NT can produce directly? Let me check the grammar. I don't see any NT that directly produces 't70' as a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps through expansion. But without knowing the production rules, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the end. The last part is t14. Let's see, which NT could produce t14. Looking at the grammar rules, I don't see any NT with a direct production of t14, so perhaps it's produced by a chain.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to find a possible derivation that matches the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be split into parts that match the production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each application of a rule adds exactly one symbol to each side.

So the grammar productions are all starting from a single non-terminal and ending with two non-terminals except the last one which might be a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the productions are in the form of NT followed by two other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which represents S being expanded into two non-terminals NT3 and NT9, each of which might be further expanded. \n\nMy approach should be to parse the string from left to right, breaking it down using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step should involve replacing two symbols (non-terminals or terminals) with a single non-terminal that expands into them. \n\nWait, but actually, since the string consists of terminals (all the 't' tokens), the parsing process will involve finding a way to decompose the string into the structure defined by the grammar. Each step in the parse would correspond to a production rule, potentially reducing two symbols into the next one in the derivation.\n\nSince the grammar is given, and it's in CNF, the first thing I should do is list all the production rules. However, that's a lot, so maybe I can look for patterns or see if each token in the string can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach this by checking if each token in the string can be directly produced by a non-terminal or if they can be broken down further according to the rules.\n\nLet me list each token in the string and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string has the following tokens:\nt30, t65, t88, t33, t60, t65, t37, t42, t40, t10, t42, t19, t23, t99, t37, t13, t19, t41, t75, t70, t30, t40, t70, t42, t13, t40, t23, t40, t33.\n\nI notice that some of these tokens have direct productions. For example, looking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 t75, so t75 is directly produced by NT9. Similarly, NT6 \u2192 t65, NT5 \u2192 t37, and so on. \n\nBut wait, some of these are more complex. For instance, t30 is produced by NT3, and NT3 could expand further. Let me look at the production rules involving these:\n\nLooking at NT3:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 (from the grammar)\nSo, t30 is produced by NT3, which is NT6 followed by NT2.\n\nNow, I need to check if the sequences can be decomposed further. Let's consider that each non-terminal might split the string into parts, and each part needs to be checked again.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if each token in the string is present in the production of some non-terminal, and that the entire string can be covered by the leftmost derivations according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from the start symbol S, using the given string and the rules. But given the string's complexity, that might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check if all the terminal tokens in the string are covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking through each token:\n\nt30: NT3 \u2192 t30, so yes.\nt65: NT6 \u2192 t65, yes.\nt88: NT8 \u2192 t88, yes.\nt33: NT33? Wait, wait, looking back at the grammar rules. NT2 \u2192 t33. So t33 is part of NT2. Hmm, but wait, NT2 has a production for t33. So in the string, when we meet t33, it must be produced by NT2. \n\nWait, but then how does the parse proceed? Let me think step by step.\n\nMaybe I can try breaking the string into segments that match the non-terminals.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nThe first token is t30. According to the grammar, NT3 can derive t30. So NT3 must expand into something. From the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So, NT3 is replaced by NT6 and NT2. Now, the string is t30, followed by (t65, t88, t33, t60, t65, t37, t42, t40, t10, t42, t19, t23, t99, t37, t13, t19, t41, t75, t70, t30, t40, t70, t42, t13, t40, t23, t40, t33). So replacing NT3 with NT6 and NT2 would mean the first part is NT6, then NT2. So the first two non-t30 are t65 (which is NT6) and t33 (which is NT2). \n\nNow, let's check the next steps. The first three tokens after t30 are t65, t88, t33. But according to the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, so the next tokens should be NT6 followed by NT2, each of which can be further expanded.\n\nSo, after t30, NT6 (t65) is followed by NT2 (t33), then the rest of the string. So let's see: t65 is NT6 \u2192 t65, and t33 is NT2 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo the next step is to see if after NT6 and NT2, the rest of the string can be parsed. \n\nBut wait, in the string, after t30 is t65, t88, t33, etc. So t65 is NT6, which is then t33. Wait, but NT6 is followed by something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the string after t30 is t65, t88, t33. So:\n\n- t30: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- Now we have: t65, t88, t33, and the rest.\n\nSo after replacing NT3 with NT6 and NT2, the string starts with t65, t88, t33...\n\nBut wait, the original string is: t30 t65 t88 t33 t60 t65 t37 t42 t40 t10 t42 t19 t23 t99 t37 t13 t19 t41 t75 t70 t30 t40 t70 t42 t13 t40 t23 t40 t33. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree, with each node having two children. But since it's a context-free grammar, the parsing process can proceed by matching the leftmost non-terminal and splitting the string into two parts: A B, which are the two symbols derived from the non-terminal.\n\nEach application of a rule reduces the string by one symbol (since it combines two symbols into one). So, starting with the entire string, each step reduces the number of symbols by one.\n\nBut actually, no, each step in the parse would involve replacing a non-terminal with two symbols, but since the string is a concatenation of terminals, each rule application would split the string into parts that correspond to the left and right symbols of the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a recursive descent parser. Starting with the start symbol S, which in the grammar is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the entire string must start with NT3 followed by NT9. So the first step is to check if the string starts with NT3 and then NT9.\n\nBut looking at the string, after t30 (which is NT3), the next token is t65 (NT6), but according to the grammar, S is NT3 NT9, so the next should be NT9. So the string starts with t30, but the next token should be NT9, which is t65. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the string, after the first t30"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-559","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if this string is generated by the given grammar. The string is: `t65 t30 t52 t88 t37 t13 t37 t41 t40 t30 t88 t41 t14 t33 t22 t37 t12 t30 t19 t37 t8 t12 t99 t37 t52 t37 t22 t70 t14`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context-free grammar (CFG) provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 terminal. Also, start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has productions:\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\nS \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nBut wait, looking more closely, the production S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2\u2014so in the starting point, S can generate either NT3 followed by NT9 or NT3 followed by NT2. So the string starts with either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nLet me parse the string: the first token is t65. Let's check where t65 comes from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, t65 is a terminal, as per the productions:\n\nThe grammar has NT6 \u2192 t65, for example. Wait, looking through the productions, I see:\nNT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9\nNT0 \u2192 t13\nNT6 \u2192 t65\nSo, NT6 produces t65.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals are:\n\nt30: from NT3\nt37: from NT7 and some others\nt37 is also a result of NT7, NT3, etc.\n\nSo the string starts with t65, which comes from NT6, so the first part is NT6.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions, in the grammar, NT6 can be:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT6 \u2192 NT5 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nIt can also produce t65.\n\nIn the string, the first part is t65, which is terminal, so the first production for NT6 is the one that produces t65. That's NT6 \u2192 t65. So the first token is t65 (from NT6).\n\nNow, since NT6 \u2192 t65, we are left with the rest of the string after t65.\n\nSo the remaining string is: t30 t52 t88 t37 t13 t37 t41 t40 t30 t88 t41 t14 t33 t22 t37 t12 t30 t19 t37 t8 t12 t99 t37 t52 t37 t22 t70 t14.\n\nWait, but NT6 is followed by what? Let me check the productions of NT6. One of the productions is NT6 \u2192 t65, others are combinations of non-terminals.\n\nBut the first production for NT6 after t65 is the next symbol in the string, which is t30. So after NT6 (which produces t65), the next symbol is t30.\n\nSo, that would mean that after NT6, we have another non-terminal production that produces t30. But looking at NT6's productions, after t65, can NT6 produce t30? No, because the only production that directly yields t30 is NT3 \u2192 t30. So that suggests that perhaps after NT6 (t65), we have a chain where the non-terminal is NT3, which produces t30, but let's see.\n\nWait, actually, wait\u2014when you have a leftmost derivation, each step starts from the leftmost non-terminal. So when we have S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and then in NT9, it may produce terminals, but let me try to parse step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should build the parse tree or see if we can break down the string.\n\nLet me start again:\n\nThe string is a series of tokens: t65, t30, t52, t88, t37, t13, t37, t41, t40, t30, t88, t41, t14, t33, t22, t37, t12, t30, t19, t37, t8, t12, t99, t37, t52, t37, t22, t70, t14.\n\nWait, that's quite a long string. I'm a bit overwhelmed, maybe I should take it step by step, parsing each part.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t65. From the grammar, t65 is produced by NT6 \u2192 t65.\n\nSo, the first token t65 is from NT6. Now, after NT6, in the production, we have another non-terminal. Looking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6 | NT4 NT5 | NT5 NT7 | NT9 NT2.\n\nSo after t65 (NT6), the next non-terminal is... Hmm, the next symbol is t30, which is a terminal, but NT6's productions start with NT3, NT4, etc. So, I think perhaps we have NT6 followed by NT3.\n\nWait, that can't be because NT6 \u2192 t65, which is a terminal, so after t65, the next part should be a non-terminal. But in the string, after t65 is t30, which is a terminal. So, maybe after NT6 (which is t65), the next part is an NT3 that produces t30.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the derivation works. So, starting from S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then, NT3 could generate t65, as per NT3 \u2192 t30. Wait, but I'm getting confused because S is supposed to produce NT3 followed by NT9 or NT3 followed by NT2.\n\nWait, no\u2014S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So the string starts with NT3, but in the string, the first token is t65, which is NT6, which comes from NT6 \u2192 t65. So that suggests that NT6 is generated from S. But S can't directly generate NT6 because S's first productions are NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, so perhaps S \u2192 NT3 NT6. But looking at the initial S productions, no\u2014it's S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nSo perhaps I've made an error. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to process the string step by step, using the grammar to see if it's possible to derive the entire string.\n\nSo, starting with the string: `t65 t30 t52 t88 t37 t13 t37 t41 t40 t30 t88 t41 t14 t33 t22 t37 t12 t30 t19 t37 t8 t12 t99 t37 t52 t37 t22 t70 t14`\n\nFirst token is t65. From the grammar, N6 is the non-terminal that produces t65 (NT6 \u2192 t65). So the first token t65 is NT6.\n\nNow, after NT6, the next symbol is t30. So, after NT6 (which is t65), we have t30. But looking at NT6's productions, after t65, NT6 can only go to non-terminals. So, perhaps there's a production chain. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about this as the parser trying to match each token, so it would consume the leftmost symbol, and then try to find a production that starts with that symbol.\n\nSo, the first step is: starting with NT6 \u2192 t65, which consumes t65, leaving t30, t52, etc.\n\nThen, the next non-terminal would be the next symbol, which is t30. But t30 is a terminal. So, perhaps the next part is NT3 \u2192 t30.\n\nWait, so after NT6 (t65), the next symbol is t30, which could be derived from NT3 \u2192 t30. So that would be NT3.\n\nNow, the production for NT3: looking back at the grammar, among the productions is NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nSo, after NT3 (t30), you have NT6 NT2.\n\nSo, the next tokens should be the result of NT6 followed by NT2.\n\nBut wait, the next token after t30 is t52. Hmm. Let me check.\n\nWait, the string after the first two tokens is t30, t52, t88, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the structure is:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nBut"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Yes, according to the rules, NT3 \u2192 t37.\n\nSo after NT3 is t37.\n\nNext is t65, which is NT6.\n\nSo after NT3, we have NT6.\n\nThen t22, which is NT2.\n\nSo after NT6, NT2.\n\nNext is t8, which is NT6.\n\nSo after NT2, NT6.\n\nNext, t23, which we're stuck on. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce t23.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any rule that directly outputs t23. Let me check all NT rules again:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any that produce t23 directly. Wait, maybe t23 is produced by a longer derivation sequence. Let me check if any non-terminal can produce t23 through a series of rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar has a rule that via a chain of productions leads to t23. For example, maybe NT2 \u2192 t33, and then something else, but I don't see t23 in any of these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me go step by step again.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt33, t70, t37, t65, t22, t8, t23, t40, t40, t90, t19, t30, t40, t88, t13, t40, t34, t25, t33, t40, t13, t10, t91, t13, t12, t70, t52, t88, t65, t52.\n\nSo the sequence after t37 is t65.\n\nt65 is produced by NT6 \u2192 t65. So after NT3 (which gives t37), the next non-terminal is NT6, which gives t65.\n\nAfter t65 (NT6), the next token is t22, which is NT2 \u2192 t22.\n\nThen t8 is NT6 \u2192 t8.\n\nSo after NT6, which gives t8, the next token is t23.\n\nNow, t23 is problematic. Since none of the non-terminals directly produce t23, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe it's part of a longer production from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the non-terminals leading up to t23. Let me think: after t8 (NT6), the next token is t23. So the production after NT6 must lead to t23, but NT6's productions seem to be:\n\nLooking back, the rules for NT6 are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6 | NT4 NT5.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me re-express the rules:\n\nWait, looking at the provided rules, for NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n\nSo NT6 can only produce a sequence of NT3 followed by another NT6, or NT4 followed by NT5. So each production for NT6 starts with NT3 or NT4.\n\nSo when you have NT6 expanding, the next token after its expansion would be the first part of this sequence. Let me model this.\n\nSo NT6 can produce:\n\n- NT3 followed by NT6 (which could produce more NT3s or others)\n- NT4 followed by NT5\n\nLooking at the earlier steps, after NT6 (t65), it's followed by t22, which is NT2. So how do we get to NT2 from NT6? Unless NT6 can produce NT2 somehow, but from the rules, it seems NT6 starts with NT3 or NT4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the earlier steps. Let's double-check.\n\nAfter NT3 (generating t37), comes NT6 (generating t65). Then after t65 comes t22, which is NT2. So how can NT6 lead to NT2? Looking at NT6's productions, perhaps NT6 can expand to produce NT2 as the next non-terminal.\n\nWait, for example, NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6. That would mean NT6 becomes NT3 followed by some expansion, which would be NT6 again. So the initial NT6 would expand into a tree starting with NT3 NT6, which would go on recursively. But none of these seem to lead directly to NT2.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way for NT6 to produce NT2 as a child? Let's look at all the non-terminals and see if any production from another non-terminal leads to NT2.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT2's productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t33\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nOther NT2 rules? Wait, reviewing, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t33\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nAlso, looking at the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-577","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether a particular string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF has specific rules, right? Each production rule on the left side has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the start symbol which can go directly to a terminal. Oh wait, actually, no, in CNF every production is either a single non-terminal, or two non-terminals. So for example, S -> NT3 NT9 would be in CNF because both are non-terminals, right? And terminals are also allowed as single symbols on the right?\n\nSo the grammar given is a big one with a lot of non-terminals, but the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols. The goal is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. The string is: t90 t37 t99 t40 t14 t12 t33 t90 t34 t40 t19 t25 t33 t70 t25 t34 t37 t40 t52 t99 t37 t70 t30 t34 t10 t30 t34 t23 t42 t70.\n\nFirst, let me see how long this string is. Counting them up: 30 tokens, so the string is 30 elements long.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, I can model the parsing process as moving from the start symbol S through a series of productions, each time replacing a non-terminal with two symbols until all are terminals. So maybe I can use something like the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars, to parse the string.\n\nWait, CYK is usually used for Chomsky Normal Form, and it's efficient for this purpose. But since this grammar is quite large and the string is 30 tokens, doing CYK manually would be time-consuming, but perhaps I can look for patterns or key points to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a way to trace back from the string to see if the production rules can generate it. Let me see: the string starts with t90, so I need to see which production rules produce t90. Looking through the given grammar, I see that some of the non-terminals have t90 as a terminal. Specifically, looking at NT9 and NT7: NT9 -> 't90', NT7 -> 't70', etc. Hmm, so perhaps t90 comes from a production that starts with NT9?\n\nWait, looking more carefully, in the grammar, NT9 is defined as NT3 NT7, but also has some productions like NT9 -> 't75', etc. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nNT9's productions include some that are terminals and others that break it down into non-terminals. For example, NT9 -> 't90' (so t90 is generated directly from NT9). Similarly, NT7 -> 't70', etc. So t90 appears as a terminal in both NT9 and possibly another non-terminal, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, I can try to split it into pairs of symbols, but wait, no, because in a leftmost derivation, each step replaces one non-terminal into two, so the expansion could create a tree where each node has two children. Hmmm, maybe another approach is to model the string as a sequence of terminals and see if they can be grouped using the productions.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to start from the end and see if there's a way to reverse-engineer the production. Let's see.\n\nThe last part of the string ends with ... t34 t10 t30 t34 t23 t42 t70. Wait, t70. Looking at the grammar, NT7 produces t70 directly (NT7 -> 't70'), so that could be a starting point.\n\nIf the string ends with ... t70, maybe the last production is NT7 -> 't70', so the last symbol is from NT7. Then the previous part would have come from the NT7 production. Let me think step by step:\n\nThe last symbol is t70, so before that, the string would have a production that produces t70, but since t70 is a terminal, the production before that would have been a non-terminal which produces t70 as a terminal. That would mean that the last step of the string is just t70, so the previous step in parsing would be applying a production that directly generates t70, like NT7.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to break down the string into parts and see if I can find a possible derivation.\n\nLet me try to see if I can split the string into segments where each segment is a production of some non-terminal, leading to another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo S is split into NT3 and NT9. Each of these must produce the respective parts of the string.\n\nNow, looking at the string, perhaps the first two symbols will be generated by NT3 and then NT9.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t90. So if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then the first symbol t90 must be part of NT3, and the next symbols, up to where NT9 starts, would be generated by NT9.\n\nLet me think: The entire string is 30 symbols, so if NT3 generates the first few symbols and NT9 generates the last few, they must sum up to 30.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT3 and NT9 each generate a part of the string. Let me check the grammar to see what NT3 can generate.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 is defined as:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 ... etc., but looking at these, they break down into more non-terminals. So, maybe NT3 can be further expanded. For example, NT3 could be NT0 NT7, then NT0 could break further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT3 has a production that leads directly to a terminal, but in the given productions, I don't see NT3 being a terminal directly; it only seems to break into other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the given rules, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and others. So this seems to be a deeper structure.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 is defined as NT9 \u2192 't90' (so it can directly produce t90) or other non-termlinal combinations.\n\nWait, the string starts with t90, so if NT9 can directly produce t90, then perhaps the first part of the string is generated by NT9.\n\nLooking back, the first symbol is t90. So perhaps NT9 is producing t90 as the first symbol, and the remaining symbols are generated by S's other part, which would be NT3, or perhaps NT9 can produce more, but no, since t90 is a terminal, it can't produce any more after that.\n\nWait, but S is production 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo that would imply that the string is generated as NT3 followed by NT9. So, for example, if NT3 generates some tokens and then NT9 generates others.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t90, which is the start of NT9. So that suggests that NT9 is producing t90, so the other part, NT3, must produce the rest of the string after t90.\n\nBut the string is t90 followed by t37, t99, etc., which are 29 more symbols. But S \u2192 NT3 NT9 would require that NT3 and NT9 produce a combined total of 30 symbols (since each step of production adds one symbol, but in this case, it depends on how the productions expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the case that the string's structure allows NT9 to produce t90, followed by NT3 producing the rest.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t90, so that would be the end of NT9's production as a terminal. So that leaves the other symbols to be generated by NT3.\n\nBut wait, if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and NT9 produces t90, then the rest of the string is generated by NT3.\n\nBut the rest of the string, starting from the second symbol, is 29 symbols. Let me count them: the string is t90 followed by 29 symbols (from t37 to t70). So the total length is 30 symbols. So the entire string is generated by S \u2192 NT3 NT9, where NT9 produces t90 directly (so it's one symbol), and NT3 produces the remaining 29 symbols.\n\nSo S would be S \u2192 NT3 NT9 => [NT3's string] + [t90], where [NT3's string] is of length 29.\n\nSo I need to see if there's a way for NT3 to produce a string of 29 symbols starting with t37, then t99, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT3, what are the productions? It looks like NT3 can be:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's see, maybe NT10 (but I don't see NT10 in the grammar; perhaps I misread). Wait, looking again, maybe I confused NT8 and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each terminal and see how they are produced. The terminals present in the string are t65, t37, t10, t91, t70, t52, t33, t25, t12, t10, t91, t99, t10, t40, t22, t99, t37, t19, t40, t52, t52, t37, t14, t52, t12, t13, t42, t40, t42, t19.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see if any of these terminals can be produced by the non-terminals.\n\nTerminals in the grammar:\n\n- NT9 -> 't52' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nIn the provided grammar, for example, NT9 -> 't75', NT8 -> 't52', etc. Wait, in the detailed grammar, some lines indicate that NT5 produces 't91', NT8 produces 't52', NT0 produces 't13', etc.\n\nWait, the end productions (where a non-terminal directly becomes a terminal) include:\n\nNT9 -> t75\nNT8 -> t52\nNT0 -> t13\nNT6 -> t8\nNT1 -> t25\nNT7 -> t40\nNT5 -> t91\nNT2 -> t33\nNT6 -> t8\nNT0 -> t22\nNT1 -> t40\nNT7 -> t70\nNT5 -> t27 (Wait, no, looking through, I see NT5 -> t91, NT2 -> t33, etc.\n\nSo, t65 is present in the string, but looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce t65. So that seems problematic. Unless t65 is derived from a sequence of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list all terminals:\n\nt65, t37, t10, t91, t70, t52, t33, t25, t12, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT0 -> 't13', NT1 -> 't25', NT2 -> 't33', NT5 -> 't91', NT6 -> 't8', NT7 -> 't40', NT8 -> 't52', NT9 -> 't75'.\n\nWait, t65 is not directly produced by any non-terminal except perhaps through intermediate steps. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check the grammar again more carefully.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT0 -> 't13'\nNT1 -> 't25'\nNT2 -> 't33'\nNT5 -> 't91'\nNT8 -> 't52'\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nSo where does t65 come from? It doesn't seem present as a terminal. So the first token is t65, which is not directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. That would mean the string cannot be generated, right?\n\nBut that can't be correct, because perhaps t65 is produced through other non-terminals. Wait, maybe there is a typo, or perhaps I'm missing a production. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT3, there's NT3->NT6 NT2, and NT3->NT0 NT7.\n\nIf NT6 -> 't8', and NT2 -> t33, then NT3 would produce NT6 NT2 which would be t8 t33. But that's not t65. Alternatively, NT3 could produce NT0 t13, then NT0 produces t13, but t65 is not among the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar. Let me check each line.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nIn the grammar, there's:\n\nNT8 -> 't37'\n\nSo NT8 produces 't37'. Also, NT6 -> 't8', NT2 -> 't33', etc.\n\nWait, but t65 is the first token. Since none of the non-terminals directly produce 't65', it's impossible for the parser to generate 't65' as the first symbol because all productions start with non-terminals. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be the case because in the initial productions, S starts with NT3, which might produce non-terminals that can then produce these tokens.\n\nWait, unless there's a non-terminal that I didn't notice which can produce 't65'. Let me scan all the non-terminals and their terminals:\n\nNT3: does it have t65 in any production?\n\nLooking at NT3:\n\n1. NT3 -> NT6 NT2\n2. NT3 -> NT0 NT7\n\nFrom these, NT6 and NT0 are non-terminals, so t65 can't come from here unless one of them produces 't65' in a later step, which they don't. Therefore, the first token 't65' can't be produced, making the entire string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me double-check if there's any non-terminal that produces 't65'. Looking through all the lines, except for the ones where a NT is directly mapped to a terminal, I don't see any production where a non-terminal becomes 't65'.

So no, 't65' isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 't65' is a production from NT3, but I don't see that.

{"custom_id":"request-594","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me start by understanding what each part of the problem entails. \n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) is a set of production rules that generate all possible strings in a specific formal language. Chomsky normal form is a specific way of structuring these production rules, where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. That should make parsing easier, but I'm not sure how it directly helps here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t30 t40 t41 t40 t70 t37 t70 t37 t10 t37 t88 t41 t10 t37 t37 t33 t40 t90 t40 t65 t41 t40 t40 t99 t40 t22 t23 t33 t33 t25 t37`. Each word in the string is a terminal symbol, which matches a production rule ending with a single terminal. So, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, and I need to check if there's a way to apply the production rules to derive this exact string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive. I see that there are a lot of non-terminal symbols (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) and many production rules between them. Some non-terminals produce terminal symbols directly, which are the actual words in the string.\n\nMy plan is to break down the string into segments that can be matched by the non-terminals in the grammar. Since each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal, I can look for sequences in the string that correspond to each production.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals and their direct productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT2, NT4 NT2\n- NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0, NT2 NT1\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4, NT0 NT8, NT0 NT8, NT7 \u2192 ...\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, NT7 NT9, NT6 NT1, etc.\n- Also, various NT0 to NT9 have productions ending with 't' terms, like NT6 \u2192 't34', etc.\n\nWait, a lot of the NT symbols have terminals as direct production. So, for each of these, I can attempt to check if the string contains these terminals in the right order.\n\nAlso, the main S rule is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first two symbols should come from NT3 and NT9. Let me check the first two tokens: t30 and t40. Looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't30', and NT9 \u2192 't75', wait, no, I need to check if NT9 has 't40'.\n\nWait, looking at the NT9 productions: NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, NT7 NT9, NT6 NT1, etc. But nowhere in the grammar does NT9 directly produce 't40'. Oh, wait, in the initial code, for NT9, one of the productions is NT9 \u2192 't75' and another is NT9 \u2192 't60', etc. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar entries are long, so I may have misread. Wait, in the original grammar, under NT9, there are entries like NT9 \u2192 't30', 't40' etc. Wait, looking at the initial grammar, the grammar has in one line:\n\nNT9 -> 't30'\n\nAnother line: NT9 -> 't75' etc. Wait, but more importantly, S starts with NT3 and NT9. So the first token in the string must be 't30' and the second must be 't40'. Looking at the string, the first token is 't30', which matches NT3. The second token is 't40', so checking if NT9 produces 't40'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 't60', 't40', 't75', etc. Wait, yes, in the third line:\n\nNT9 -> 't40'\n\nSo, the second token 't40' in the string corresponds to S's production S \u2192 NT3 NT9, where NT3 is 't30' and NT9 is 't40'. That seems to fit so far.\n\nNow, after NT3 and NT9, the string continues as 't41', 't40', 't70', etc. So now, after the initial S \u2192 NT3 NT9, we have to process the productions of NT3 and NT9 further.\n\nBut wait, NT3 and NT9 may themselves be complex, like NT3 may produce a sequence involving other non-terminals, which in turn produce more terminals or non-terminals. So, I think the approach is to process the string step by step, checking each possible production and seeing if the tokens can be matched sequentially.\n\nHowever, this could get complex because each non-terminal might have several production options, leading to a branching of possibilities. But maybe since the string is quite long, I can look for patterns in the grammar that might help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string from the top down using the CFG. Let's try that.\n\nThe top-levelproduction is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So, the first two tokens must be the results of NT3 and NT9.\n\nWe have 't30' for NT3 and 't40' for NT9. So the initial part is matched: 't30 t40'.\n\nNow, the remaining string is: t41 t40 t70 t37 t70 t37 t10 t37 t88 t41 t10 t37 t37 t33 t40 t90 t40 t65 t41 t40 t40 t99 t40 t22 t23 t33 t33 t25 t37.\n\nSo, after S \u2192 NT3 NT9, we have to determine how the remaining string is produced by NT3 and NT9.\n\nWait, but NT3 and NT9 might generate sequences of symbols, possibly multiple steps. However, since S is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the entire string is just the concatenation of NT3's derivation and NT9's derivation.\n\nTherefore, after the initial 't30 t40', the rest should be a concatenation of the expansions of NT3 and NT9.\n\nBut wait, that may not be correct because NT3 and NT9 can have multiple steps and may generate more non-terminals that expand further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the entire string is derived from NT3 followed by NT9.\n\nSo, the string after the initial 't30 t40' must be the expansion of NT3 followed by NT9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider NT3 and NT9 individually.\n\nFirst, let's look at NT3 \u2192 't30' (a direct production). So, NT3 produces 't30' directly. Therefore, after S \u2192 NT3 NT9, we have 't30' coming first, then whatever NT9 produces.\n\nSo, NT9 is supposed to produce the substring starting from the third token: t41 t40 t70 t37 t70 t37 t10 t37 t88 t41 t10 t37 t37 t33 t40 t90 t40 t65 t41 t40 t40 t99 t40 t22 t23 t33 t33 t25 t37.\n\nBut wait, let's see: S is NT3 followed by NT9. NT3 is 't30', so that's the first token. NT9 needs to produce the rest of the string: t41 t40 t70 t70 t37 t70 t37 t10 t37 t88 t41 t10 t37 t37 t33 t40 t90 t40 t65 t41 t40 t40 t99 t40 t22 t23 t33 t33 t25 t37.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent because NT3 is 't30', but NT9 is supposed to produce the rest. So, let me re-examine the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial split S \u2192 NT3 NT9 is 't30' (from NT3) and then NT9 producing the remaining string: 't41 t40 t70 t37 t70 t37 t10 t37 t88 t41 t10 t37 t37 t33 t40 t90 t40 t65 t41 t40 t40 t99 t40 t22 t23 t33 t33 t25 t3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-613","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember is a form where each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol. This should make parsing a bit easier since all rules are left-recursive.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a big one with many production rules for various symbols like NT0, NT1, up to NT9. Each of these symbols seems to have productions that break down into other non-terminals or terminals. For example, S starts with NT3 and NT9, which are non-terminals. Then, each of these non-terminals has their own production rules, mixing other non-terminals and sometimes terminals like t52, t34, etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a series of terminal symbols. It's like a list: t90, t41, t88, t65, t10, t88, t23, t34, t91, t37, t52, t12, t8, t23, t30, t70, t91, t40, t22, t65, t25, t14, t37, t42, t13, t42, t37, t52, t40, t88, t23, t37. It's a long string of terminals, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nI think the best approach here is to try to parse the string step by step according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step will either consume one terminal or split into two non-terminals. So, each terminal in the string should correspond to the right-hand side of some rule.\n\nI'll start by looking at the first few tokens and see if I can find a matching production rule. The first symbol is t90. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT9 has a production where it can become 't90', as seen in this rule: NT9 -> NT3 NT6 etc., but there's also a rule NT9 -> 't60' and another NT9 -> 't75'. Wait, is there a rule that says NT9 -> 't90'? Let me check.\n\nWait, I see in the grammar: NT9 -> 't90' directly, so yes, that's a production rule. So the first symbol t90 could be produced by NT9. That means, to produce t90, NT9 is the right-hand side. So that's a match.\n\nMoving on, the next symbol is t41. Let's see if there's a production rule where NT9 produces t41. Wait, NT9 can produce 't60' and 't75', but no direct rule for 't41'. Hmm, that might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe t41 comes from another non-terminal. Let me see what other rules could lead to t41.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT8 has a production NT8 -> 't52', NT6 -> 't65', NT3 -> 't30', etc. Wait, but the symbol is t41. I don't see a direct rule for t41 in the grammar. That might mean that I'm trying to find the wrong production. Maybe the first t90 isn't the start, or perhaps I need to backtrack.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT9. So, according to S's production, the string must start with the concatenation of two non-terminals, which then derive into terminals. But the string starts with a terminal, so that would require that the first production from S branches into non-terminals that immediately produce terminals. So, for example, if NT3 can produce a terminal, then the string starts with t followed by another production.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules: NT3 -> NT6 NT2, NT3 -> NT9 NT1, etc. Wait, I don't immediately see a production for NT3 that ends with a terminal. It always seems to split into other non-terminals. So perhaps NT3 can produce a terminal in some way. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT3 has several rules, but looking through, I don't see anything that ends with a terminal except those that further split into others. So NT3 requires more steps. Similarly for NT9, where t90 is a terminal, but t90 is just one possibility, not the only one.\n\nWait, maybe the first symbol t90 comes from NT9's production. NT9 -> 't90'. So then the next symbol should be the next part of NT9's right-hand side. But NT9 only has one symbol, so the next symbol must come from another production. Let me think again.\n\nThe string starts with t90, so the first symbol is t90, which must come from some production. Looking at the grammar, NT9 can produce 't90' directly. So NT9 is the first symbol. Since NT9's production only has 't90' and no other symbols, that implies that the rest of the string should come from other parts of the grammar. But wait, in the context of S's production, S is NT3 NT9, so the derivation must first produce NT3 then NT9. So, perhaps the first symbol t90 comes from NT9, and the rest of the string from NT3.\n\nWait, that might not be right because the start symbol S is NT3 NT9, so the string would be a sequence where first comes the symbols from NT3, then the symbols from NT9. So, the first symbol must come from NT3. But according to the grammar, NT3 produces other non-terminals. So, this might be an issue because t90 is a terminal that comes from NT9, but NT9 can't be the first symbol if the start is NT3 NT9.\n\nMaybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again: the string starts with t90, which is from NT9's production. But S is NT3 NT9, so the first production would have to derive t followed by something. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing the order. Alternatively, perhaps the string is part of the derivation where NT9 is expanded first, and then the whole string is built from that. But that seems odd because S is supposed to be the start.\n\nWait, perhaps the string begins with t90, which is from NT9, and the NT9 must have been produced by a rule that starts with a terminal. Let me check all the NT9 rules. Yes, there are NT9 -> 't90', NT9 -> 't60', and NT9 -> 't75'. So, t90 is one of the possible terminals. So, the first symbol is t90, which is generated by NT9. Then, according to S's production, S is NT3 NT9, so after the initial t90 (from NT9), the NT3 must generate the rest. Wait, no. S produces NT3 and NT9, so the generated string would be all the symbols from NT3 in order, followed by all symbols from NT9 in order. So, the first symbol is t90 from NT9, the rest comes from NT3?\n\nBut that can't be right because S is NT3 NT9, so the order is NT3 first, then NT9. So, the first symbols must come from NT3, not the last ones.\n\nThis suggests that the string starts with t90, which can't happen if it's supposed to come from NT3. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again. The start symbol is S, which becomes NT3 NT9. So the entire string must be the concatenation of whatever NT3 produces and whatever NT9 produces. So, the string must be split into two parts: the first part from NT3, the second from NT9.\n\nTherefore, the given string should start with NT3-generated symbols, then transition to NT9-generated symbols at some point. But in the given string, it starts with t90, which can only be from NT9, not from NT3. So this suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with t90, which can't come from NT3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Could there be a longer production where NT3 generates multiple symbols, including t90 as one of them?\n\nLooking at NT3's rules: NT3 -> NT6 NT2, NT3 -> NT9 NT1, etc. But these rules don't produce t90. So NT3 can only produce non-terminals, so the string must start with symbols from NT3 until it's fully expanded, then transition into NT9.\n\nBut since the string starts with t90, which must come from NT9, and the next symbol after t90 is t41, which can't come from NT3 (as NT3's rules don't produce t41), this would mean that the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong in assuming the structure. Perhaps the string starts with a production that branches"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-619","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a series of tokens: t65, t30, t99, t37, and so on. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the starting symbol. The grammar starts with S, which first expands to NT3 NT9. Wait, but looking at the grammar, S isn't directly producing N Ts\u2014it's expanding through NT3 and NT9. So S must derive into a sequence of NT terms leading to terminal tokens.\n\nLet me start by writing down the start symbol production: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. That means the leftmost expansion will start with NT3 and then NT9. So the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNow, I need to see how NT3 and NT9 expand. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT9 \u2192 't75'\n\nWait, so NT9 directly becomes 't75', a terminal. That's good. So NT9 can be replaced with 't75'. Now, what about NT3? It expands into NT6 and NT2. So the string starts with NT6 NT2.\n\nNow, NT6 can be expanded. Looking at the rules for NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0\nNT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5\n\nHmm, that's a bit more complicated. Let me map this out. Starting with NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT4 is NT7 NT0 and NT0 is NT1 NT3 or other options. NT5 is NT7 NT5.\n\nWait, this is recursive. Let's see: NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5 means that NT5 can produce sequences starting with NT7 and followed by any number of NT5. So NT5 could be NT7, NT7 NT7, etc., effectively an infinite loop unless it's broken elsewhere.\n\nBut let me look at NT4 and NT0. NT4 is NT7 NT0, and NT0 can be several things:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2\nNT0 \u2192 NT4 NT0\nNT0 \u2192 NT7 NT8\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n\nThat's a lot of possibilities. Let's see if we can find a path that could lead to the given string.\n\nThe initial parts of the string are t65, t30, etc. So perhaps the expansion through NT3 will eventually reach t65 and t30.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5. Then NT4 is NT7 NT0.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT9, which we now know NT9 is 't75'. So NT7 \u2192 NT2 't75' (but wait, checking the rules, NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT9, which is NT2 't75' because NT9 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the current context, we have:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT9, and NT9 \u2192 't75'. So NT7 can produce NT2 followed by 't75'.\n\nSo, stepping through:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT0 NT5.\n\nHmm, now NT7 \u2192 NT2 't75', so that part becomes NT2 't75'.\n\nThen NT0: Let's see, suppose NT0 expands to NT2 NT2. Let's see if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled in too many possibilities. Maybe I should look for the starting symbols and see if the string can be broken into the correct sequence.\n\nLooking at the string: t65 t30 t99 t37 t12 t88 t37 t70 t10 t52 t42 t37 t10 t10 t30 t8 t65 t88 t37 t34 t41 t25 t42 t13 t12 t52 t30 t40 t52 t99 t30 t37.\n\nSince the grammar starts with NT3 NT9, and NT9 is 't75', which isn't in the string. Wait a minute, the second token is 't30', not 't75'. So either there's a mistake, or maybe I misread something.\n\nWait, let me check: the grammar's production rules. The first rule for NT9 is 't75', right? So if the initial expansion is NT3 NT9, which becomes NT3 't75', but the string starts with t65.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the string starts with t65, not t75. So that suggests that NT9's expansion is 't65' instead of 't75', which is conflicting with the grammar. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no\u2014the grammar has NT9 producing 't75', which is specific. So if the initial expansion leads to NT9, then that part must be 't75'. But the string starts with 't65', so that's conflicting. Hmm. That suggests that perhaps the initial expansion doesn't produce NT9 and something else.\n\nWait, hold on. Looking back, the initial production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So S first becomes NT3 NT9, which then leads to t65 't75' if NT3 expands to 't65' and NT9 to 't75'. But the string starts with t65, then t30, so after t65 comes t30, but the grammar would have t75 after t65. That would not match, so maybe that path is not the right one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial step doesn't take S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Wait, no, that's in the grammar. So that can't be. So perhaps the string is not generated by this grammar because the initial step after S would be t65 followed by t75, but the string has t65 followed by t30. Is there a rule that would allow NT9 to generate t30? No, according to the grammar, NT9 only expands to 't75'.\n\nWait, that might be a problem. So does that mean that the grammar cannot produce the given string because the first two tokens would be t65 and t75, but the string has t65 and t30?\n\nLooking more carefully, the string is:\n\nt65 t30 t99 t37 t12 t88 t37 t70 t10 t52 t42 t37 t10 t10 t30 t8 t65 t88 t37 t34 t41 t25 t42 t13 t12 t52 t30 t40 t52 t99 t30 t37.\n\nSo it starts with t65, which could come from NT6, perhaps. Because looking at NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, which could expand further. Let me see.\n\nAnother approach: Since the string starts with t65, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can expand directly to t65?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal production that includes t65.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't65'?\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't65' (I see a rule: NT8 \u2192 't65').\n- NT0 \u2192 't65' (another rule: NT0 \u2192 't65').\n\nOther terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are other terminals like t30, t99, etc. So if a non-terminal can produce t65, then it could start the string.\n\nSo, for the first token, if it's t65, the only way is if the starting symbol (S) directly expands to it. But looking at S's rules, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. But according to the given grammar, there is no production where S directly produces t65. The possible S productions are NT3 NT9 and NT3 NT2, leading S to be a sequence of NTs.\n\nSo the initial step of S expansion must be via S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Since the first token is t65, which can only come from NT8 or NT0 (as t65 is a terminal produced by those non-terminals), but NT3 and NT9 don't directly produce t65. Wait, but NT6 can produce t65.\n\nWait, let's see the production for NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5. And NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0. NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3 or others.\n\nWait, perhaps we're going down the wrong path. Maybe I should list all the non-terminals and their possible expansions to see if any of them can produce the first token.\n\nLooking again, the first token is t65, which is produced by NT8 and NT0.\n\nSo, perhaps in the initial expansion, one of the NTs (either NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar and see what terminals it can produce. The rules end with some terminals like 't40', 't52', 't13', etc. So, the grammar can only generate strings consisting of these terminals. So, if the input string contains any other terminal symbols not present in these, it's automatically 'No'.\n\nLooking at the string, let me list out all the terminals: t70, t8, t37, t25, t42, t40, t33, t14, t23, t90, t99, t25, t90, t8, t23, t10, t10, t42, t30, t34, t88, t12, t40, t25, t70, t52, t70, t70, t10, t14.\n\nI'll check if these terminals are all present in the grammar. Let me go through them one by one.\n\n- `t70`: Yes, it's one of the terminals listed at the end of the grammar. \n- `t8`: Yes.\n- `t37`: Yes.\n- `t25`: Yes.\n- `t42`: Yes.\n- `t40`: Yes.\n- `t33`: Yes, because looking at the rules, NT3 can produce NT6 NT2, and eventually NT2 can produce 't33' through its production rules. So t33 is a terminal.\n- `t14`: Hmm, looking through the rules, I see NT2 produces 't33' but do any of the rules directly produce 't14'? I see that NT2 can produce 't33' through a chain, but there's no direct production for t14 except through some rule like NT7-> NT6 NT1, where both NT6 and NT1 might break down to produce t14. But I'm not entirely sure if t14 is a terminal or if it's derived from other symbols. Let's check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> NT4 NT8\n- NT7 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT8\n- And others.\n\nSo, t14 isn't directly a terminal, unless it's derived from some non-terminal. Let me see if any non-terminals produce t14.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production that directly produces t14. So perhaps t14 is a derived symbol, meaning it might not be a terminal. Therefore, it might not be allowed.\n\nWait, but in the given string, it's present as 't14', but if t14 isn't a terminal, then the string has a symbol that's not generated by the grammar. So that would mean the string isn't generated.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Sometimes, through productions, a non-terminal can lead to a terminal. For example, NT9 produces 't75' directly. But is t14 a terminal? From the rules, it seems that no production directly leads to t14. So, perhaps t14 is not a terminal and therefore the string includes a symbol that's not allowed.\n\nBut wait, let me look through all the production rules to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- S and other NTs break down into combinations of NTs and terminals. I don't see any direct production that ends with t14 except possibly through some chain, but I think t14 is a non-terminal that isn't directly producing a terminal. So, the presence of 't14' in the string suggests that it's acceptable if it's produced by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 't14' is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the ending of the production rules:\n\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't90'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT5 -> 't91'\n- NT6 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT8 -> 't37'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n- NT1 -> 't19'\n- NT1 -> 't12'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n- NT3 -> 't90'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT7 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't42'\n- NT9 -> 't22'\n- NT9 -> 't14'\n\nWait, looking closely, I see that NT9 has two productions: NT9-> 't75' and NT9-> 't60' and 't22' and 't14'. Wait, no, looking again: \n\nWait, the production rules for NT9: looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nNT9 -> 't60'\n\nNT9 -> 't22'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again at the rules, the ending ones:\n\nHere's the last part:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nNT2 -> 't33'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nNT1 -> 't40'\n\nNT7 -> 't10'\n\nNT1 -> 't19'\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT4 -> 't88'\n\nNT2 -> 't37'\n\nNT3 -> 't90'\n\nNT9 -> 't60'\n\nNT7 -> 't70'\n\nNT8 -> 't41'\n\nNT4 -> 't42'\n\nNT9 -> 't22'\n\nNT9 -> 't14'\n\nWait, so NT9 has multiple productions:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\n\nNT9 -> 't60'\n\nNT9 -> 't22'\n\nNT9 -> 't14'\n\nSo yes, NT9 can produce 't14' directly. So 't14' is a terminal that's allowed.\n\nSo, the string includes 't14', which is a terminal, but it's produced by NT9. So that's okay.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check all the terminals in the string again.\n\nLooking through each symbol:\n\nt70: yes.\n\nt8: yes.\n\nt37: yes.\n\nt25: yes.\n\nt42: yes.\n\nt40: yes.\n\nt33: yes, because NT3 can produce 't30' or through another chain, but in the rules, I see NT3 has production NT3-> NT6 NT2, which eventually leads to t30, but t33 is a terminal from NT2->'t33'.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT2 has multiple productions, including 't33', but also others. So t33 is a terminal.\n\nt14: yes, because NT9 can produce it.\n\nSo all the terminals in the string are present as terminals in the grammar.\n\nNow, I need to check if the structure of the string matches the grammar. Since it's a CNF grammar, each production is binary. So, the overall structure would be a series of non-terminals and terminals in a specific order.\n\nBut parsing the entire string would be time-consuming. I can try to see if each symbol can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to look for the structure. The string starts with t70, which is produced by NT9. So S can produce NT9 NT9, but no, S is S-> NT3 NT9. Wait, no, S is at the top, S-> NT3 NT9. So the entire string would have to start with NT3 NT9 derived into the symbols.\n\nWait, the start symbol S can be expanded as NT3 NT9. So the first token should come from NT3 and the second from NT9. But the string starts with t70, which is from NT9.

{"custom_id":"request-636","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production rule has at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It starts with the start symbol S, which is defined as several production rules. The right-hand side of each rule is either two non-terminals, and sometimes I see terminal symbols (t-something). Wait, but in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A -> BC or A -> a, but here it seems like some rules are A -> B C, and others have terminals. Hmm, maybe the grammar includes both terminals and non-terminals, so that's okay.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. So the string is `t34 t23 t99 t13 t65 t37 t40 t34 t23 t88 t8 t37 t42 t37 t70 t22 t52 t10 t70 t52 t60 t37 t52 t99 t41 t19 t13 t99 t8 t40 t40 t37 t65`.\n\nI see that all the elements in the string are terminals because they start with 't'. That means each of these must be derived from a terminal production. In the grammar, some rules have terminal symbols, so that's a clue. My job is to see if there's a derivation starting from S that leads to this string through the given productions.\n\nThe grammar has several NT (non-terminal) productions leading to different combinations of other non-terminals and terminals. However, it's a bit dense. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, it's a binary tree structure, so the string's length should be a power of two, considering the way the grammar splits. Let me check the length of the string.\n\nThe string has 37 components, so 37 is an odd number. In a typical Chomsky normal form grammar with productions expanding into two symbols, the length of the string would be 2^k + 1 or something, but 37 isn't a power of two plus one. Wait, that might not necessarily be an issue because some rules might involve non-terminals that produce terminals directly, so it's possible to have varying lengths. But wait, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each step in the derivation can either increase the count by one (if a non-terminal is replaced by one terminal and the rest are maintained) or maybe not.\n\nWait, actually, each rule is either two non-terminals (which would split the sequence but not change the count if they eventually produce terminals) or a single terminal, which would add one more element. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the process as building the string from left to right, replacing symbols step by step.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I notice that each non-terminal has several production rules. Some produce terminals like 't34', 't23', etc. So, the goal is to see if the given string can be formed by successively replacing non-terminals with their productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut this might take a while. Maybe I should look for the structure of the string. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t34 t23 t99, etc. Looking at the grammar, I should see which non-terminals can produce 't34', 't23', etc. For example, rule S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Wait, but those are non-terminals, so they need to be expanded.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t34, so that must be produced by some rule. Looking in the grammar, I see that NT0 -> 't13', NT6 -> 't34', NT8 -> 't52', etc. So for the first token, t34, that could come from NT6.\n\nSo perhaps the derivation starts with S -> NT3 NT9, but S could also be NT3 NT2 or similar. Wait, but looking at the string, the first few tokens are t34, t23, t99. Let me see if these can come from NT3, NT2, etc.\n\nWait, let me check if NT3 can produce t34. From the grammar, NT6 -> NT3 NT6, and NT6 can also be 't34' if it has a production for that. But more importantly, perhaps NT3 can produce t30, which is one of its productions. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for all terminal symbols in the grammar and their sources.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT6 can produce 't34' directly because there's a rule NT6 -> 't8', wait, no, wait: looking again, it says NT6 -> 't34' as one of the rules. Or wait, let me check: in the grammar list, I see a rule like NT6 -> 't8', but no, wait: checking the grammar, I see lines like NT6 -> 't8' (Yes, the line is 'NT6 -> 't8'). But wait, there's also a production rule NT6 -> 't34'; looking at the grammar list: yes, the 60th rule is NT6 -> 't8'; then there's another rule NT6 -> 't34'? Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar list:\n\n- NT6 -> 't34' is present? Let me scan through the grammar lines.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines provided, I see:\n\nLine 3: NT8 -> 't37'\n\nLine 23: NT6 -> 't8'\n\nLine 30: NT0 -> NT1 NT3\n\nLine 31: NT5 -> NT3 NT6\n\nLine 35: NT6 -> 't34'\n\nSo, NT6 has two terminal productions: 't8' and 't34'. So, when NT6 is used, it can produce either t8 or t34.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs have terminal productions. So, in the string, the presence of t34, t8, etc., must come from NTs that have these terminals in their productions.\n\nNow, given that, let's try to reconstruct the string.\n\nThe string is: t34 t23 t99 t13 t65 t37 t40 t34 t23 t88 t8 t37 t42 t37 t70 t22 t52 t10 t70 t52 t60 t37 t52 t99 t41 t19 t13 t99 t8 t40 t40 t37 t65.\n\nThat's quite a lot of tokens. Let's see if I can group them or look for patterns.\n\nLooking at the start, t34 could come from NT6. Then t23: which NT produces t23? Looking through the rules:\n\n- Find NT that has 't23' in production. Checking the grammar: NT2 has two 't23' productions (lines 62 and 16), so NT2 can produce t23.\n\nSo after NT6, then NT2. Then t99: which NT can produce t99? Looking through, I see rules for NT2, NT9, etc. Wait, NT9 has NT9 -> 't22' in line 94, but that's t22. Looking through other NTs:\n\nLooking for 't99', I see NT7 -> 't99' or NT9 -> 't99' in the grammar. Let me check: Line 99: NT9 -> 't99'. So yes, NT9 can produce t99.\n\nWait, but wait: looking at the grammar lines, at line 99, it's \"NT9 -> 't99'\".\n\nSo, so far, after NT6, maybe NT2, then NT9.\n\nBut let me think as a parser: starting from S, which can produce multiple NTs, but the string starts with t34, t23, t99, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the first part is NT6 -> t34, then NT2 -> t23, then NT9 -> t99.\n\nThat's possible. So S could be part of a production that leads to this sequence.\n\nBut let's try to piece it together.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look for longer substrings that might form larger phrases.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the string as a tree, perhaps each symbol must be expandable from the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to try to see if each word in the string can be generated by some non-terminal, and then see if the sequence can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for contradictions. For example, if the string requires a non-terminal that doesn't have any terminal production, or if a word in the string can't be generated by any rule"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-657","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that CNF has specific characteristics, like every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. Let me check the productions. Oh right, each production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a single terminal. That fits the definition of CNF. So that's good; it's in the right form.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is \"t65 t33 t37 t88 t91 t10 t14 t37 t99 t40 t10 t42 t40 t42 t25 t30 t12 t37 t41 t42 t37 t33 t41 t33 t19 t91 t88 t25 t30 t8 t23 t65 t33 t10\". It's a sequence of t-structures, so I'm guessing they're terminals. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think I should start by breaking down the problem. Maybe I can construct a parse tree for the string or use some method like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsing. But since the grammar is large and the string is long, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can find substitutions for non-terminals that lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT2. Since the string starts with \"t65 t33 t37 t88 t91...\", I'll need to see which production of S can produce such a string.\n\nWait, S can go to NT3 NT9 or NT2. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, if S \u2192 NT2, then the string starts with NT2. Looking at the productions for NT2: It has several options, like NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7, NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT3, etc. Hmm, the first token is t65. Let me check NT6 to see if any of its productions result in t65. Wait, in the grammar, there's a rule NT6 \u2192 't65' directly. So NT6 can produce t65. \n\nNow, how can NT2 lead to a sequence that includes t65? Let me trace back. Looking at the production NT2 \u2192 NT6 something, but looking for how it's built.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to see the initial production and how the string can be formed step by step. Starting with S \u2192 NT2, then NT2 can be expanded into various combinations. For the string to start with t65, there must be a way for NT2 to derive t65 followed by other terms.\n\nWait, but looking at NT2's productions: NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7, which would produce two t's. Oh wait, NT7 has production to 't40', so that would give t40 t40, which doesn't match the first token t65. Alternatively, NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT8. Maybe that could lead to something.\n\nBut I think the first term is t65, which comes from NT6 \u2192 't65'. So perhaps the production NT2 must include an NT6 somewhere. Let me look at NT2's productions: I see NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8. So if that's the case, then the initial part could be NT6, which is t65, followed by NT8.\n\nSo let me try that substitution: S \u2192 NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8. The first two terms could be t65 t33 (since NT8's production is 't33'). Wait, no, NT8's production could vary. Looking at NT8, I see some rules: NT8 \u2192 't37'? Let me check. Wait, the provided grammar has a rule NT8 \u2192 't37'? Yes, one of the rules is NT8 \u2192 't37'.\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking at NT8, yes, there's a production NT8 \u2192 't37'. So if NT8 is directly 't37', then after NT6 (t65) comes NT8 (t37), making the first two terms t65 t37. But the string's first token is t65, then t33. Hmm, so maybe this path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, but then the string starts with t65. Let me see. NT3's productions: I see NT3 \u2192 't30', but also NT3 can be broken down. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So if that's the case, then NT3 would produce the first term t30, which doesn't match t65. So perhaps the other path is better.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine S's productions:\n\nThe user provided the grammar as a list of rules, so I should list all S's rules. From the list:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nS \u2192 NT2\n\nSo yes, two options. Since the string starts with t65, which is a terminal. How do I get t65 from S? Because S can only produce two non-terminals. Since t65 is a terminal, S can't produce it directly because S's productions result in two non-terminals.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because S is the start symbol, and from S you can only get two non-terminals. But the string is a sequence of terminals. That implies that each of those non-terminals must expand into one or more terminals.\n\nBut for the string to start with t65, which is a terminal, that suggests that one of the non-terminals in the first expansion of S must directly produce t65.\n\nLooking at S, the only way to start with t65 is if one of the productions of S leads to a non-terminal that can produce t65.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nIf I can get t65 from either NT3 or NT9.\n\nLooking at NT9: There's a production NT9 \u2192 't75', but also other options, like NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7, etc. So one way to get a terminal from NT9 is if it's directly a terminal, which would be 't75', but that's not t65.\n\nLooking at NT3: There's NT3 \u2192 't30' directly, but also NT3 can produce other options. But to get t65, perhaps when NT6 is expanded, which is a non-terminal that can produce 't65' directly.\n\nWait, but in S's production, if I take S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then NT3 and NT9 would each be expanded into some non-terminals, but we need the first symbol to be t65. Hmm, this suggests that either NT3 or NT9 must produce t65 via production.\n\nLooking at NT3: I see NT3 can be 't30' or another option: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. If NT6 \u2192 't65', and NT2 could produce 't33', then perhaps the expansion would produce t65 followed by something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other non-terminals:\n\nLooking at NT3: does it lead to 't65'? Well, the production NT3 can take the form NT6 NT2, which could lead to t65 and other terms. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if I take the production S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then perhaps:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nNT6 \u2192 't65'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't33' (from one of its rules, NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT8, and then NT7 \u2192 't40', but that seems not matching t33). Wait, perhaps another path.\n\nWait, looking at NT2's production, there's one that says NT8 \u2192 't37' and another that leads to other combinations. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe starting with S \u2192 NT2, and then expanding that, since the first token is t65.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT2, which can be broken down into NT6 NT8. So NT6 is 't65', and NT8 would be 't37' (since one of its rules is directly to 't37'). So that would make the string start with t65 t37. But the string starts with t65 t33, so that doesn't match. Hence, that path is not working.\n\nAlternatively, after NT6 t65, maybe NT8 can produce a sequence that starts with t33.\n\nWait, but NT8 can have multiple productions, perhaps some leading to 't33'.\n\nLooking through NT8's productions, I see NT8 \u2192 't37' and others that might involve more non-terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 't37' is one, and others like NT8 \u2192 NT8 NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-658","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t90 t8 t91 t42 t42 t10 t37 t8 t33 t42 t30 t34 t40 t40 t88 t37 t40 t37 t52 t37 t40 t99 t88 t91 t13 t37 t30 t42 t37 t40 t40 t91 t34 t10`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see a bunch of rules with non-terminals on the left and other non-terminals or terminals on the right.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I might need to parse the string using this grammar. Parsing can be done with a method like the CYK algorithm, or I could try to build a parse tree step by step, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach could be to trace the possible derivations from the start symbol S. Since S starts as S -> NT3 NT9, that would produce the string starting with t90 and ending with t40. Let me see the string starts with t90 and ends with t10. Wait, no\u2014the last term is t10, which isn't the same as t40 from S -> NT9 -> t40.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Let me check the rules for NT9. In the grammar, NT9 seems to have two productions: NT9 -> NT1 NT5 and NT9 -> 't75'. So, the last non-terminal in the start symbol is NT9. That should derive to a terminal symbol, so it might be 't75', but the string ends with t10. So that might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my initial assumption.\n\nWait, let me think again. The start symbol is S, which splits into NT3 and NT9. NT3 has a rule like NT3 -> NT6 NT2, and so on. Ultimately, each non-terminal should produce a fixed string of terminals. From the grammar, the S production leads to NT3 NT9, so the string should start with the expansion of NT3 and end with NT9's expansion.\n\nLooking at the initial part of the string: 't90 t8 t91 t42 t42 t10'. The first part is t90, which is produced by NT9 -> 't90'. Then, the next part\u2014looking at NT9's production, it's NT1 NT5, which then needs to produce t8 and t40, respectively. But wait, in the first step, S -> NT3 NT9, so the first part of the string should come from NT3.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me map S to NT3 and NT9. So, the string starts with t90, which comes from NT9. So first, let's see how NT9 can derive t8 and t40?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 has two rules: NT9 -> NT1 NT5 and NT9 -> 't75'. But the first few characters are t90 t8 t91..., which suggests that t90 comes from NT9 via 't90', but the string starts with t90, then t8, which might not align unless t8 is from another symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to break down the entire string step by step. Let's consider the string as a sequence of tokens: ['t90', 't8', 't91', 't42', 't42', 't10', 't37', 't8', 't33', 't42', 't30', 't34', 't40', 't40', 't88', 't37', 't40', 't37', 't52', 't37', 't40', 't99', 't88', 't91', 't13', 't37', 't30', 't42', 't37', 't40', 't40', 't91', 't34', 't10'].\n\nSince S starts as NT3 and NT9, let's see what each contributes. NT3 is involved in the start, so the first part is from NT3 and the second from NT9.\n\nLooking at NT3, the rule is NT3 -> NT6 NT2. So, NT3's production starts with NT6 and NT2.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t90. That would come from NT9 -> 't90'. Wait, but S splits into NT3 and NT9. So the string should start with NT3's production and then NT9's. So the initial part of the string from S's NT3 should be the expansion of NT3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up how the non-terminals split. Let me clarify: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So, the string generated by S is the combination of the expansion of NT3 and the expansion of NT9.\n\nSo, the first part from NT3 should generate some sequence, and then the second part from NT9 generates some sequence. So the string should be the concatenation of NT3's expansion and NT9's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't90 t8 t91 t42 t42 t10'. Let's see: t90 comes from NT9 -> 't90'. But that should be part of S's NT9 part. Wait, no\u2014S is NT3 and NT9, so the NT3 part comes first, then the NT9 part. So the first part of the string should come from NT3, and the rest from NT9.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that. Since S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the entire string is the combination of NT3's expansion followed by NT9's expansion. So, the string should be split into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT3, and the second part is the expansion of NT9.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't90 t8 t91 t42 t42 t10', and then continues. But if the first part is from NT3, and the second is from NT9, then t90 is part of NT3's expansion, but NT9's first symbol should be 't75' based on the rules.\n\nWait, this is getting tangled. Let's try to parse step by step.\n\n1. S splits into NT3 and NT9. So, the string will be NT3_part + NT9_part.\n\n2. Let's look at the grammar to find how NT3 can be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nSo, expanding NT3 would start with NT6 and NT2.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nThen NT4 can be NT2 NT8 or others. Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nWait, NT4 has two rules:\nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for strings that directly correspond to the terminals generated by each non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals produce fixed sequences. For example, NT9 can produce 't75' or NT1 NT5, which can produce t8 and t40.\n\nWait, let me look at the string. The string starts with t90, which is from NT9's 't90' rule. But in S, the NT9 part should be after NT3. So if S is NT3 and NT9, the string starts with NT3's expansion followed by NT9's.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is 't90 t8 t91...', but that would imply that NT3's expansion is t90..., which doesn't align with NT3's rules because NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nAh, that can't be right. So, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe S produces NT3 followed by NT9, so the first part is from NT3 and the second from NT9.\n\nBut the string starts with t90, which comes from NT9. Therefore, maybe I have to reconsider how the string is split.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake in the initial split. S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the first part is NT3's expansion, the second is NT9's. So, the entire string is split into two parts: NT3_part and NT9_part.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are 't90 t8 t91...'. Let's see if t90 is part of NT3's expansion, but from the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, so the first symbol of NT3 expansion would be whatever NT6 generates.

{"custom_id":"request-673","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got a grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's in the language. The grammar is quite large with many productions, so I'll need to find a systematic way to approach this. Let me start by looking at the grammar structure and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is presented in CNF, which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a. The non-terminals are S, NT0 to NT9, and the terminals are various 't' strings plus 't40', 't52', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t30 t34 t8 t37 t30 t12 t37 t37 t99 t33 t42 t37 t99 t88 t91 t99 t13 t25 t19 t40 t37 t42 t13 t37 t40 t65 t40 t33 t42 t37 t19 t40 t30 t22 t37.\n\nI should start by breaking down the string into tokens and see if I can find a derivation path from S to this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S produces either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So the first step is to see which path the string might take. The string starts with t30, which is a terminal. Let me check which non-terminals produce t30.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT3 can produce t30 via NT3 -> t30.\nSo, if the first production is NT3, that's a match.\n\nSo S -> NT3 NT9. The first token is t30, which matches NT3, leaving NT9 to generate the rest of the string.\n\nNow, the next tokens are t34, t8, t37, etc. The second part of S's first production is NT9. So NT9 must produce the remaining tokens: t34 t37 t37 t99 t33 t42 t37 t99 t88 t91 t99 t13 t25 t19 t40 t37 t42 t13 t37 t40 t65 t40 t33 t42 t37 t19 t40 t30 t22 t37.\n\nWait, that's a long string. Let me see if there's a way to split it. Alternatively, maybe the NT3 is generating t30, and then NT9 is generating the rest.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, I see:\n\nNT9 -> NT7 NT9\nNT9 -> NT6 NT1\nNT9 -> NT3 NT7\nNT9 -> NT2 NT2 (Hmm, but t34 and t8 are terminals, but looking at t34, it's a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, some symbols are terminals, but I need to check which are which.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT9 -> t75, which is a terminal.\nWait, no, in the grammar, the rules are:\nNT2 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't30'\nNT6 -> 't34'\nNT8 -> 't52'\nNT0 -> 't13'\nNT1 -> 't25'\nNT7 -> 't40'\nNT5 -> 't91'\nNT4 -> 't88'\nNT2 -> 't37'\nWait, actually, the non-terminals that directly produce terminals are:\n\nNT0: t13\nNT1: t25\nNT2: t33\nNT3: t30\nNT4: t88\nNT5: t91\nNT6: t34\nNT7: t40\nNT8: t52\nNT9: t75\nWait, wait, the user provided a long list of grammar rules, but only some are shown. From the initial user input, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2\nNT8 -> ... and so on, with many rules. But the important point is that certain non-terminals directly produce terminals like t30, t34, etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT3 -> t30, NT6 -> t34, NT2 -> t33, etc.\n\nSo now, since the second part of S's production is NT9, we need to see if NT9 can generate a string that starts with t34 followed by t8, etc.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT1: produces t34 followed by whatever NT6 and NT1 can produce.\n\nWait, if NT9 -> NT6 NT1, then the first token after NT9 would be whatever NT6 produces. Looking at NT6:\n\nNT6 can produce, for example, NT4 NT5, which are non-terminals, or some terminals.\n\nWait, let me check NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 has several rules, including NT6 -> 't8', which is a terminal. So if NT6 -> 't8', that would produce t8 as a token.\n\nBut in the string, after t34, the next is t8. So if NT6 produces t8, then the next part would start with t8.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t34 comes t8. So maybe the first step after NT9 is to produce NT6 which produces t8. Let me try that.\n\nSo NT9 -> NT6 NT1.\n\nNT6 -> t8 (terminal), so that produces t8. Then NT1 can produce? Let's see what NT1 produces:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT1 has several productions, including NT1 -> NT4 NT8, which are non-terminals, and some that produce terminals like t25 and t40.\n\nWait, in the initial list, NT1 -> 't25', 't40', etc. Let's confirm that.\n\nLooking again, the initial grammar list includes NT1 -> t40 and NT1 -> t19 and others. Wait, perhaps in the detailed rules, NT1 can produce t25 or t40.\n\nFrom the initial list, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> 't40' (perhaps), but in the user's initial grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT1 -> NT0 NT4\nNT1 -> NT8 NT4\nNT1 -> NT1 NT1\nNT1 -> 't40'\nNT1 -> 't25'\nWait, yes, there are at least two terminals being produced by NT1: t25 and t40.\n\nSo, for NT1, possible productions are to NT4 NT8 and to terminals t25, t40.\n\nBut in our case, after NT9 -> NT6 NT1, the next token after t34 (from NT6 -> t8) is t8. Wait, the string starts with t34, t8, then t37, etc. So after t34, t8 is the next token, right? So after t34, the next is t8. Then t37.\n\nWait, let me think again. The string is:\n\nt30 t34 t8 t37 t30 t12 t37 t37 t99 t33 t42 t37 t99 t88 t91 t99 t13 t25 t19 t40 t37 t42 t13 t37 t40 t65 t40 t33 t42 t37 t19 t40 t30 t22 t37.\n\nSo the tokens after t34 are t8, then t37, etc.\n\nWait, but if NT9 is producing NT6 NT1, and NT6 -> t8, then NT1 can produce t25 or t40. So the next token after t8 would be t25 or t40, but in the string, it's t37 after t8. That doesn't match. So maybe that path is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT9 can produce another combination. Let me check other productions of NT9.\n\nAnother production is NT9 -> NT3 NT7.\n\nIf NT9 -> NT3 NT7, then the next tokens would be t30 (from NT3), then anything from NT7.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 can produce 't40', 't54', 't70', etc. Wait, in the grammar, NT7 has:\n\nNT7 -> NT5 NT4\nNT7 -> NT2 NT9\nNT7 -> NT6 NT5\nNT7 -> NT0 NT8\nNT7 -> 't40'\n\nWait, so if NT9 -> NT3 NT7, then after t34, we would have NT3 -> t30, and then NT7 would produce 't40', which would be the next token.\n\nBut in the string, after t34 is t8, not t40. So that doesn't match either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT9 has another production. Let me check:\n\nNT9 has NT9 -> NT2 NT2.

Looking at the rules, for example, NT2 -> 't33', NT8 -> 't52', etc. So, each rule either has two non-terminals or eventually ends in a terminal.\n\nThe given string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t42 t91 t37 t70 t70 t70 t42 t88 t41 t33 t90 t34 t40 t40 t42 t37 t8 t40 t8 t40 t33 t8 t37 t14 t33 t91 t13 t25 t40 t41 t37 t40 t12 t37 t33`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's equivalent to a pushdown automaton, which means it's deterministic. So, maybe I can parse the string step by step using a parsing strategy like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent. Given the small string, CYK could work, but it might get a bit complicated. Alternatively, a recursive approach could be more manageable.\n\nWait, let me first list all the production rules to see how the non-terminals can be expanded into terminals. It's a bit long, but maybe I can find some patterns or key points.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT2 can go to 't33' or other non-terminals.\n- NT8 can go directly to 't52' or expand into other non-terminals.\n- NT7 can expand into 't40' or other terms.\n- Looking for the start symbol S: it's derived from either NT3 and NT9 or NT3 and NT2. So the first two symbols in the string must come from S's first production.\n\nWait, let me see. The string starts with 't42 t91 t37 t70 t70 t70...'. So the first symbol is t42, which must come from a non-terminal. Let's check the productions for non-terminals that can produce t42.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT9: can produce 't75', 't60', etc.\n- NT7: sometimes t40, sometimes t10, t19, etc.\n- NT8: has 't52' and some other t's.\n- NT6: t34, t8, etc.\n- NT3: t30, t90, etc.\n- NT4: t88, t42, etc.\n- NT2: t33, etc.\n- NT0: t13, etc.\n- NT1: t25, etc.\n\nAh, I see NT4 has a rule that goes directly to 't88', and another that goes to other NTs. Looking further, I notice that S's first rule is NT3 NT9. So the first two symbols in the string must be derived from NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't42'. Let's check which non-terminals can produce t42.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT4 -> t88, t42, etc.\nYes, so NT4 can produce t42. So, if S is NT3 NT9, the first expansion would be NT3 and NT9. But wait, S's other production is NT3 NT2. Hmm, but the first symbol is 't42', which is in NT4's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the possible ways.\n\nThe string starts with t42, which is a terminal. So, we must have a derivation where a non-terminal produces t42. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t42.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT4 has a production NT4 -> NT2 NT8, and elsewhere NT4 has NT7 NT0 and NT2 NT1, etc. But wait, I don't see a direct production for NT4 -> 't42' except in the rules: Let me check.\n\nWait, the rules include NT4 -> 't88', NT4 -> 't42', yes, because I see one rule is NT4 -> 't88' and another is NT4 -> 't42'. So NT4 can produce 't42' directly.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't42', the initial non-terminal must be NT4. But wait, the grammar starts with S, which branches into NT3 and NT9, or NT3 and NT2. So that initial 't42' would have to come from a rule that starts with NT4. But how would NT3 and NT9 get into producing t42 as the first symbol?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with S, but in the parsing, we can have shifts and reductions. Wait, maybe this approach is getting too tangled. Perhaps a better way is to model the parsing process.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if each substring of length 2 (since each rule is two non-terminals) can be matched to a production. But given the string's length, that might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, maybe a bottom-up approach could work. Let's think about how the string can be split into two symbols, checking if any pair matches a production.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence, can I find pairs in the string that correspond to any production rules?\n\nBut wait, the string is a concatenation of terminals, so each part of it must come from a non-terminal's production step. It's a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of two non-terminals. So in order to derive the string, it's built from these steps, possibly with leftmost or rightmost derivations.\n\nWait, let me think about the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first two symbols in the string must be derived from NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: 't42 t91'. So, can NT3 produce 't42' and NT9 produce 't91'?\n\nLooking at NT3's production rules. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT3: I see NT3 can go to NT6 NT2 (NT6 -> something, NT2 -> 't33'), or NT3 can go to NT0 NT7, or NT9 NT0, or NT3 can go to NT8 NT4, or maybe other combinations. Wait, let me look carefully.\n\nWait, the NT3 rules are:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT3 \u2192 NT9 NT0\n- (Looking at the list) I don't see direct NT3 productions to terminals except through expansions that eventually reach terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first list all the rules for NT3, which are:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT9 NT0\nNT3 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nWait, no, looking back: the rule is \"NT3 -> NT6 NT2\" is one, \"NT3 -> NT0 NT7\" is another, \"NT8 -> NT3 NT9\" is for NT8? Wait, no, wait, the rule NT3's productions are listed as:\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT3 \u2192 NT9 NT0\n- NT3 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- Also, there's NT9 -> NT3 NT7 later on, but that's for NT9.\n\nSo, looking at NT3's rules: each of them are combinations of non-terminals. So NT3 can expand into other non-terminals, not directly into terminals.\n\nSo, for the string to start with 't42 t91', S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first non-terminal is NT3 and the second is NT9. So the first symbol in the string must come from NT3's expansion, and the second from NT9's.\n\nBut since NT3's production doesn't include any terminals directly, that would imply that NT3 must derive 't42' through some steps, but wait, in a leftmost derivation, you expand the leftmost non-terminal first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to step through the possible derivations.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach. Let's look for known patterns or use the fact that the grammar is in CNF to simulate a pushdown automaton.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the possible ways 't42' can appear in the string.\n\nWait, let me check all the non-terminals that can directly"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-694","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of non-terminals and terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces two parts: NT3 NT9. Both NT3 and NT9 produce other non-terminals that eventually lead to terminals, which are strings of 't's followed by numbers. \n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of these 't'+'number' terms. The string is: `t30 t40 t52 t37 t30 t65 t52 t41 t88 t30 t19 t65 t65 t37 t99 t14 t60 t33 t52 t34 t37 t70 t30 t41 t99 t91 t33 t33 t30 t25 t25 t42 t37 t99 t37 t88`.\n\nI think the approach should be to try to parse the string according to the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nI'll start by looking at the possible derivations from S. S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So, the string must start with something that NT3 can generate, followed by something that NT9 can generate. Similarly, each non-terminal will eventually produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI'll try to break down the string step by step, checking each part against the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look at NT3 and NT9. From the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nSo, NT3 expands into NT6 and NT2. Looking at NT6:\n\nNT6 has several productions, but one is NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5. NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5 (wait, that can't be right\u2014it's a left recursion, so it might be problematic. But since it's in CNF, I think the left recursion isn't allowed, so perhaps the productions for NT5 are NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5, which might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back, the productions for NT5 are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5 (left recursion)\nNT5 \u2192 NT2 NT7\nNT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5 (same as above)\nNT5 \u2192 NT2 NT7\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, NT5 has:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5\nNT5 \u2192 NT2 NT7\nSo, it has left recursion on NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5. Left recursion is generally not allowed in CNF because it makes the grammar ambiguous and harder to parse. I think the parser might have to handle that.\n\nBut maybe for this problem, I can ignore that for now and proceed, keeping in mind that NT5 has a left recursive production.\n\nNow, the string starts with t30, which is produced by NT3 \u2192 t30 (since in the grammar, NT3 \u2192 t30 via production NT3 \u2192 t30, I think. Wait, let me check the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several lines like NT3 \u2192 t30, NT8 \u2192 t52, etc. So yes, NT3 can directly produce t30.\n\nSo, starting with NT3, which produces t30. So, the first element is t30, that's correct.\n\nThen, after t30, the next part should come from NT9, which starts with NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5. So, after NT9, the next production would be NT1 and NT5.\n\nBut the second element is t40. Looking at the grammar, NT1 can produce t40, which is when NT1 \u2192 t40. For example, in the grammar, NT1 \u2192 NT0 NT4, and in some cases, NT1 \u2192 t40. Wait, looking through the grammar:\n\nNT1 has production NT1 \u2192 t40, right? Because in the provided rules, there's NT1 \u2192 t40.\n\nWait, no, let me check. Looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t25 (not the right one),\nNT1 \u2192 t40 (yes), so NT1 can directly produce t40.\n\nSo after NT9 produces t30, the NT9 starts with NT1, which should produce t40. So the second element is t40, which matches.\n\nSo far, t30 t40.\n\nNow, after that, the next element is t52. Let's see where t52 comes from. Looking at the grammar, NT0 \u2192 t13, and NT8 \u2192 t52.\n\nWait, but when we have NT9, which is NT1 NT5, so after t40, the NT1 would be followed by NT5.\n\nWait no, NT9 is NT1, and then after NT9, we have NT1 producing t40, but after that, we would move on to the next symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nThe overall string is a series of terminals, each step in the derivation will involve expanding a non-terminal into a pair of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nThe string starts with t30, which is the expansion of NT3. So first, NT3 \u2192 t30.\n\nNow, after t30, the next part is the result of NT9's expansion. NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5.\n\nSo the next symbol in the string should come from NT9's first part, which is NT1. Let's see what NT1 produces.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT1 can be NT0 NT4 or other combinations, but also directly produce t40.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, yes, NT1 has a production NT1 \u2192 t40. So the second symbol after t30 is t40, which matches.\n\nNow, after t40 (from NT1), the NT5 from NT9's expansion comes next. So after t40, the next symbol should be the expansion of NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, after t30, t40, the next is t52. So let's check if t52 can be the expansion of NT5.\n\nNT5 can produce t70 (e.g., NT5 \u2192 t70), t60 (I think), but looking at the grammar, NT5 can be:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5 (left recursion) or NT5 \u2192 NT2 NT7.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, NT5 has:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5\nNT5 \u2192 NT2 NT7\nNT5 \u2192 t91\n\nSo, direct production is NT5 \u2192 t91, but also indirect via left recursion.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky normal form, left recursion isn't allowed, so perhaps the parser uses the left-recursive-free form. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is already in a form that allows left recursion, but for now, I'm focusing on the production NT5 \u2192 t91.\n\nSo, after NT1's t40, if NT5 directly produces t91, then the next symbol would be t91. But in the string, the next is t52, which doesn't match. Therefore, perhaps the expansion goes deeper through NT5's productions involving other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, if NT5 uses left recursion, it could generate a sequence of NT7's and so on. So perhaps after NT1's t40, the NT5 produces a series of NT7's, each of which produces more terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT5 is part of a longer derivation. Let me think about the steps:\n\nAfter NT1 \u2192 t40, the NT5 from NT9's split needs to produce the next part of the string, which is t52.\n\nSo, NT5 could be part of a chain leading to t52.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see how NT5 can get to t52. NT5 can produce NT2 NT7. So, NT5 \u2192 NT2 NT7.\n\nSo, after NT1 (t40), NT5 would produce NT2 and NT7. Then, each of those can split further.\n\nSo, NT2 \u2192 t37 (from NT2 \u2192 t37 in the grammar) or via other productions. Let's see: NT2's productions include:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t33\nNT2 \u2192 t37\nNT2 \u2192 t52 (as NT9 \u2192 t52)\nNT2 \u2192 t65 (via NT2 \u2192 t65)\nWait, actually, looking back, the grammar has various NT2 productions, but t37 and t52 are options.\n\nIn this context, after t40, the next symbols are t52, t37, t30, t65, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps after NT5 \u2192 NT2 NT7, the NT2 can produce t52 directly. So, the next symbol after t40 would be t52.\n\nWait, but in the string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-698","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol. Since all productions are in CNF, each step of derivation will replace a single non-terminal with two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t88 t19 t19 t34 t37 t8 t91 t37 t12 t34 t40 t40 t91 t88 t37 t33 t34 t37 t37 t19 t19 t12 t70 t34 t88 t10 t33 t52 t88 t91 t34 t23 t37 t23 t41 t37`.\n\nI notice that the string consists entirely of terminals, meaning that all symbols are terminal symbols (they are specific identifiers like 't88', 't19', etc.) with no non-terminals. So, the derivation path must eventually produce all terminals without leaving any non-terminals at the end.\n\nGiven the grammar, I can start by looking at the production rules and see which non-terminals can expand into the terminal symbols present in the string. However, since the string is quite long, manually tracing each step would be impractical. Instead, I should look for patterns or shorter substrings that might indicate where certain non-terminals might expand.\n\nLet me check if any production rules directly expand to some of the terminals present, such as 't88', 't37', etc. Looking through the rules, I see that several non-terminals like NT4, NT5, NT6, etc., expand to specific terminals. For example:\n\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't70'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n- NT8 -> 't52'\n- NT0 -> 't13'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT5 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't88'\n- NT1 -> 't40'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n- NT3 -> 't30'\n- NT8 -> 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't88'\n\nFrom this, I can see that some non-terminals, like NT2, NT4, NT5, etc., directly produce terminal symbols or known sequences. Since the string has 't88' appearing multiple times, I should check if NT6 and NT4 can produce 't88'.\n\nLooking at NT6, the production is:\nNT6 -> NT8 NT4\nBut NT8 can be 't52' directly, and NT4 is 't88'. However, NT6 also has another production:\nNT6 -> NT3 NT6\nWait, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, looking at NT6's other rules:\nNT6 -> NT4 NT5\nBut NT5 -> 't91', so that might not help. Also, NT6 -> NT8 NT4, which is 't52' 't88' which is 't52 t88', but in the string, we have 't88 t19 t19 ...'. So, that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.

{"custom_id":"request-719","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long, so I need to find a systematic way to approach this. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left and is followed by exactly two non-terminal symbols or terminals on the right. This makes parsing relatively straightforward, usually using something like the CYK algorithm. But since the string is large, maybe I can look for patterns or use another method.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT3 -> t30, NT8 -> t52, etc. So, any occurrence of these terminals in the string must match a corresponding production rule in the grammar. My first thought is that each terminal in the string must match one of these productions, and the structure of the string should reflect the leftmost derivations.\n\nLet's list out all the terminals in the string: t30, t8, t40, t37, t70, t30, t52, t10, t70, t70, t25, t70, t37, t40, t91, t12, t42, t40, t90, t52, t40, t25, t37, t8, t30, t10, t41, t41, t19, t65, t37, t25, t99, t33, t37, t88, t37.\n\nEach of these must correspond to a production that directly results in that terminal. So, for instance, t30 is produced by NT3, t8 by NT8, t40 by NT0, etc. My approach is to parse the string into segments that match these terminals and check if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the string length should be 2^n -1, but that's more for the parsing process. The given string has 40 tokens. 2^n -1 for n=5 is 31, n=6 is 63, so 40 is in between. That doesn't immediately help, but maybe the structure is correct.\n\nAnother way is to think of the grammar as a series of transformations based on the non-terminals. Maybe building a parse tree would help, but with 40 tokens, that's impractical manually. Instead, perhaps I can use the fact that the grammar is in CNF and apply the emptiness or some other property.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm instead. Since the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm is efficient. The CYK algorithm works by filling a table where each cell (i, j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nBut writing out a 40-token CYK table is tedious. Maybe I can look for the leftmost derivation instead. Starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can derive each token in sequence.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The first production of S is S -> NT3 NT9. So the first symbol in the string should match the first part of S's production. Let's check if the first two symbols can be derived from NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: t30 and t8. Do these match any production from NT3 and NT9?\n\nLooking at production rules: NT3 -> t30. So the first part is matched by NT3. Now, NT9: what do we have?\n\nLooking up NT9 rules, I see several that result in terminals: t75, t60, t52, etc. Hmm, I see NT9 -> t75, but not t8. So does any production for NT9 include t8? Let me check.\n\nNT9 has production NT9 -> t75, but no, t8 isn't in there. Wait, looking again: NT9's productions include NT9 -> t30 NT1, but that's a production involving non-terminals. But initially, the production of NT9 seems to be either a terminal or a combination with other non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps NT9 can be directly derived only to terminals, but looking at the rules, NT9 can produce:\n\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT1\n- NT9 -> 't75'\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT6\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT5\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT8\n- NT9 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT1\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT3\n- NT9 -> NT8 NT3\n- NT9 -> NT2 NT2\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT8\n- NT9 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT3 NT9\n- NT9 -> NT8 NT9\n\nHmm, none of these directly produce t8 except perhaps in the initial step. So perhaps NT9 can only directly produce t75 or other terminals that are not t8. So in the first two tokens, we have t30 and t8.\n\nSince the first production of S is S -> NT3 NT9, which would produce t30 (since NT3 -> t30) followed by NT9. But can NT9 directly produce t8? Looking at the productions for NT9, I don't see any direct production that results in t8. The only direct terminals from NT9 are t75, t60, t52, etc., not t8.\n\nSo, the first two tokens being t30 and t8 can't be derived from S's first production, because NT3 gives t30, but NT9 can't directly give t8. Therefore, the string cannot be derived from this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again: NT9's productions are as listed. None of them directly produce t8. The only way to get t8 is through a production that includes t8 in the right-hand side. Let's check all the productions that produce t8.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> 't8'\n- NT9 -> 't88' (but 't88' is a different token, so not matching 't8')\n- NT2 -> 't8'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n\nWait, no. Let me look again: The question's string is `t30 t8 t40 t37 t70 ...`, so the second token is 't8' which needs to be produced by a rule leading directly to 't8'.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> t8 (multiple rules)\n- NT0 -> t8 (multiple rules)\n\nWait, wait, let me check the grammar rules again. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me list the rules again more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules for each non-terminal:\n\n- NT8 has several rules, but none of them produce 't8' directly except:\n\nWait, checking again. Let's list all rules with single terminals:\n\nNT0 -> 't13', 't52', 't37', 't8' (multiple entries)\nNT6 -> 't34', 't8'\nNT1 -> 't25', 't40', 't70'\nNT2 -> 't33', 't65', 't8'\nNT3 -> 't30'\nNT4 -> 't88', etc.\nNT5 -> 't91', etc.\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT7 -> 't40' etc.\nNT8 -> 't52', etc.\nNT9 -> 't75', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT2 has a production rule NT2 -> 't8', so NT2 can produce 't8'. Similarly, NT0 has NT0 -> 't8', so NT0 can also produce 't8'.\n\nTherefore, in the string, the first symbol is 't30', which is produced by NT3. Then the second symbol is 't8', which can be produced by either NT0 or NT2. So let's explore both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT3 NT9, and NT9 -> NT2 something, with NT2 producing 't8'.\n\nBut let's see if the entire string can be generated this way. Alternatively, maybe another production of S exists, but looking back, the grammar is S -> NT3 NT9 or S -> NT2 NT9. Wait, no, the initial productions are:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\n\nWait, looking back at the initial grammar, S has two rules: S -> NT3 NT9 and S -> NT2 NT9.\n\nWait, wait, no: the initial grammar starts with S -> NT3 NT9, then S -> NT2 NT0? Or wait, looking again, the initial grammar is:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\nS -> NT3 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because it simplifies certain parsing techniques, but manually checking the string might still be manageable.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the grammar. All the productions are left-hand sides of single non-terminals, each expanding into two non-terminals except for some cases where terminals appear, like 't30', 't8', etc. I should note that some NT symbols are eventually rewritten into terminals. For example, NT0 goes to 't13' and 't40', among others.\n\nNow, the string provided is a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nLet me write down the string: t30 t8 t34 t19 t30 t99 t42 t65 t37 t60 t52 t90 t70 t42 t30 t34 t37 t65 t33 t14 t52 t13 t91 t33 t23 t10 t12 t91 t65 t91 t8 t40 t40 t88 t12 t25 t12.\n\nThat's quite long. Let me see if I can break it down. Since the grammar starts with S, which becomes NT3 NT9. So the string must start with the combination of symbols derived from NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is t30. I need to see what NT3 and NT9 can produce. Let me look at the productions for NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So starting with NT3, I can derive t6 and t2? Or wait, no. Wait, the productions for NT3 are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nSo, to get t30, NT3 can be NT0 NT7. Let's see the productions for NT0: NT0 can go to several different non-terminals, including some that result in t13, t34, t40, etc. Similarly, NT7 has productions that can produce t40 or other sequences.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nSo the string must start with whatever NT3 and NT9 can produce.\n\nBut looking at the first element in the string, t30.

NT0 can go to NT1 NT3, NT2 NT2, etc. Some of these non-terminals can produce terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I notice that some NT symbols directly have productions to terminals like 't30', 't8', etc. So perhaps we can find a way to derive t30 from NT3.\n\nLooking at NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. So to get t30, perhaps NT0 can produce t30. But looking at NT0's productions, I don't see a direct production to t30. Let me check the grammar. Oh, NT3 has a production to NT6 NT2, which in turn can lead to t30. Wait, let me trace this.\n\nWait, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Then NT6 and NT2. Let me see if these can produce t30.\n\nLooking at NT6: productions include NT8 NT4, NT0 NT5, NT2 NT6, NT3 NT1, etc. Wait, I'm looking for something that can produce t30.\n\nWait, NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT1. So if NT3 produces t30, then NT1 needs to produce something. But wait, I might need to think differently. Let's try to see if t30 can come from NT6. So, NT6 can go to NT3 NT1, but that might not lead directly to t30. Alternatively, looking for NT6 that can produce some terminals. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT6 directly producing t30, but perhaps via other steps.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a possible derivation path for the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can start at the end and use reverse engineering, seeing which productions lead to the end terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into chunks that correspond to the productions. Since each non-terminal production contributes exactly two symbols, the total number of symbols in the string must be even, as each production contributes two symbols. Let's check: the string has 47 symbols. 47 is odd, which is impossible because S starts with two symbols, and each step adds two symbols. So if the initial string has an odd number of symbols, it can't be derived from S, which should always produce an even number of symbols.\n\nWait, that's a good point.

Since each production step adds exactly two symbols, starting from S, which is two symbols, the total number of symbols should always be even (2n, where n is the number of production steps). Since 47 is odd, it's impossible. So the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string provided has an odd number of symbols (47), which is impossible because the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and every production step adds exactly two symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-730","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string can be generated by the provided grammar. First, I see that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. The start symbol is S, and the goal is to derive the string step by step, making sure each part of the string corresponds to a production.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t52 t33 t70 t25 t65 t30 t65 t91 t30 t99 t37 t37 t99 t90 t25 t40 t19 t70 t52 t37 t14 t34 t37 t60 t37 t37 t42 t70 t88 t52 t40 t12 t88 t91 t34 t52 t40 t40\"\n\nI notice that the string is a series of 't' tokens with numbers. Each 't' might correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. The first step is to map these tokens to the grammar rules. \n\nStarting with the first 't52', I look through the productions to find where 't52' appears as a terminal. Scanning the grammar, I see that NT8 can produce 't52'. So, the first step is to use the production S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Wait, no, the grammar's first rule is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. That would produce two non-terminals at first, but the string starts with t52, which is a terminal. So, the first production can't be S \u2192 NT3 NT9 because that would lead to two NTs, which we can't directly produce terminals from yet. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the start symbol S is a non-terminal, and the string starts with t52, which is a terminal, so the derivation must start by expanding S into two non-terminals that eventually produce the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string backward because some of the terminals might correspond to unit productions. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to split the string into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list the productions and the terminals they produce:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT9 \u2192 't90', 't14', 't19', 't22', 't23', 't34', 't40', 't52', 't60', 't65', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is 't52', which is NT8. So, the initial step must have S \u2192 NT8 NT9. Because that would produce t52 and then something else.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT8 NT9. Now, let's look at the string: 't52 ...'. Then, the next part after 't52' is 't33'. Looking at the grammar, which NT produces 't33'? Looking through the productions, I see NT3 \u2192 t30 and other 't's from different NTs. Wait, perhaps the next part is 't33', which might come from NT2 \u2192 't33'? Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find NT2 \u2192 't33' (production: NT2 \u2192 t33). So, 't33' would come from NT2. So, after S \u2192 NT8 NT9, the first production could be NT9 \u2192 't52' and somehow split into NT9 producing 't33'? Wait, no, NT9 might need to be split into multiple steps. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, but that would need to produce more steps. Hmm, maybe I should think about parsing the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the entire string in terms of the grammar's productions. Let's consider that the string is a series of terminals, so each 't' is a terminal step. Since the grammar is unambiguous, and each production is two non-terminals or a single terminal, perhaps we can parse the string greedily.\n\nStarting with 't52', we know that it comes from NT8. So the string starts with NT8. So, NT8 must be expanded into 't52' eventually. Now, looking at the grammar, NT8 can produce 't52' directly (from NT8 \u2192 t52). But looking back, the grammar's NT8 \u2192 t52 is one of the rules. So, maybe 't52' is the first part. But earlier, the first rule of S is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. But 't52' is not compatible with that unless NT3 or NT9 can produce 't52'. Wait, no, because NT3 can produce some terminals but not necessarily 't52'. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT3, do any of its productions produce 't52'? Checking the grammar, I don't see NT3 \u2192 't52'. Similarly, NT9's productions include 't52' (from NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, but then NT1 and NT5 might produce 't52' later.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT8 NT9, but the first production of NT8 is 't52'. So, S \u2192 NT8 NT9 would produce 't52' followed by whatever NT9 produces. But NT9 can produce other terminals as well. So, after 't52', the next tokens would come from NT9.\n\nLooking at the string after 't52' is 't33'. So, the next part is 't33', which comes from NT2. So, perhaps NT9 produces 't33', but looking at NT9's productions, I don't see 't33' directly. Wait, maybe NT9 can be split further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider the entire string as a series of steps. Let me try to split the string into parts that fit the grammar.\n\nFirst, 't52' is from NT8. Then, 't33' is from NT2. So, let's consider that the initial split is S \u2192 NT8 NT9, where NT8 produces 't52' and NT9 produces something that includes 't33'. Now, looking at NT9's productions, I see NT9 can be NT1 NT5, and so on. Maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string has to be parsed into a structure compatible with the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: The string has t52 at the beginning. So, NT8 can produce t52. Then, after that, the rest should come from NT9. Looking at NT9, it can produce 't52', 't34', etc. But in the string, after t52 comes t33, which is not directly available from NT9. So, perhaps after t52, NT9 must produce t33, but looking at NT9's productions, it seems that most of the terminals are 't's with numbers, but let's see which NT can produce t33.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I missed an NT that can produce 't33'. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, perhaps I overlooked that NT2 \u2192 t33 is a production. So, the second token t33 comes from NT2. So, maybe the production path is S \u2192 NT8 NT9, then NT8 produces t52, and NT9 somehow leads to producing t33 as part of its expansion.\n\nBut how? Because NT9 is a non-terminal and all its productions are other non-terminals or 't's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the entire string can be represented by the grammar. Let me count the number of non-terminals and terminals. Each production in the grammar either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the entire string is a series of terminals, which must be the leaves of the parse tree. Each internal node must be a non-terminal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can construct a parse tree for the string, ensuring each step follows the grammar's rules.\n\nStarting with the first token t52, which is from NT8. So, we have:\n\nroot: NT8 \u2192 t52\n\nBut the root is S, so S must be NT8, but the initial grammar has S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Wait, so if S is expanded as NT3 NT9, which can't directly produce t52. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. If S is S \u2192 NT8 NT9, then the first token could be t52 from NT8, but the initial rule for S is either NT3 NT9 or NT8 NT2. Wait, looking back, the first rule of S is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and another is S \u2192 NT8 NT2. Wait, no, initial grammar shows:\n\nS -> NT3 NT9\n\nS -> NT3 NT2\n\nWait, no, wait: The initial grammar in the input has S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So, S can produce either of these combinations.\n\nBut the string starts with t52"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-734","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is a series of tokens: `t90 t25 t99 t13 t8 t91 t99 t13 t10 t12 t33 t42 t25 t75 t10 t70 t91 t10 t8 t41 t52 t37 t10 t70 t40 t37 t65 t65 t23 t10 t37 t8 t37 t13 t40 t52 t10 t19`.\n\nOkay, first, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any rule except maybe the initial one, which is usually followed by some terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that all the production rules on the left side are non-terminals, and on the right side, they either have two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which fits the CNF rule because the right side has two non-terminals. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't75', which is a terminal symbol, also fits because it's a single terminal.\n\nSo, the grammar is indeed in Chomsky Normal Form. Now, I need to check if the given string can be derived from this grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is quite extensive\u2014over 100 production rules\u2014manually tracing the derivation of the string would be quite time-consuming. So, maybe a better approach is to look for a way to parse the string top-down or bottom-up using the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing context-free grammars and can determine if a string is in the language. But since the grammar is given in CNF, the CYK algorithm would be straightforward to apply.\n\nWait, but let me think step by step. The CYK algorithm works by constructing a table where each cell represents whether a certain non-terminal can derive a substring of the input. Given that the input string is a series of terminals separated by spaces, each token like 't90', 't25', etc., is a terminal symbol. So each of these corresponds to a single production rule that replaces a non-terminal into the terminal.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, every terminal in the string must correspond to a production rule of the form X \u2192 a, where a is the terminal. So, the first thing I should do is check if each token in the string is present as a production rule for some non-terminal. That is, for every 'tX' in the string, there should be a rule NT -> 'tX' for some NT.\n\nLooking through the production rules, let me list the terminals available:\n\nLooking through the rules, I can collect all the terminal tokens. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT2\n- NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT2\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT2\n- NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT8\n- NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- NT1 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n- NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT8\n- NT5 \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT5 \u2192 NT2 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\n- NT7 \u2192 NT6 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT8\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT1 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT0\n- NT9 \u2192 't90'\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT6 \u2192 't34'\n- NT1 \u2192 't25'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n- NT6 \u2192 't65'\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT8 \u2192 't37'\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n- NT1 \u2192 't40'\n- NT7 \u2192 't10'\n- NT1 \u2192 't12'\n- NT4 \u2192 't88'\n- NT2 \u2192 't37'\n- NT3 \u2192 't90'\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n- NT7 \u2192 't70'\n- NT8 \u2192 't41'\n- NT4 \u2192 't42'\n- NT9 \u2192 't22'\n- NT9 \u2192 't14'\n- NT4 \u2192 't99'\n- NT8 \u2192 't23'\n- NT5 \u2192 't37'\n\nWait, so the terminals available are: t90, t52, t13, t34, t25, t40, t91, t65, t30, t37, t75, t8, t40, t10, t12, t88, t90, t75, t33, t8, t40, t88, etc. But each of these is present in the production rules for some non-terminal.\n\nSo each token in the input string must be a terminal that is the result of a production rule. In this case, all tokens in the string are indeed present as terminal productions.\n\nNow, given that, the next step is to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, maybe the approach is to see if the string can be broken down into parts where each part corresponds to a production that is a combination of non-terminals leading to the terminals.\n\nBut, given the length of the string and the complexity of the grammar, it might be challenging to parse manually. However, perhaps I can spot a pattern or find a way to split the string into sub-strings that are generated by some production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each terminal corresponds to a single production, and we can apply reduction rules step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as an NP parser, but with the grammar in CNF, it's efficient to use the CYK algorithm.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence and see if it can be divided into segments that correspond to the productions.\n\nGiven that the string is:\n\nt90 t25 t99 t13 t8 t91 t99 t13 t10 t12 t33 t42 t25 t75 t10 t70 t91 t10 t8 t41 t52 t37 t10 t70 t40 t37 t65 t65 t23 t10 t37 t8 t37 t13 t40 t52 t10 t19\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nFirst token: t90. Looking at the production rules, t90 is NT3 \u2192 t90, right? So that's the production NT3 \u2192 t90. So NT3 must be on the left side of a production that produces t90.\n\nSo the first part would be NT3, which produces t90. But since it's in CNF, NT3 must be the combination of two non-terminals. So, looking for a production where NT3 is on the left. From the rules, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7, and so on.

{"custom_id":"request-759","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar starts with S and has a bunch of non-terminals (NT0, NT1, etc.) and terminals (like 't30', 't52', etc.). Since the string provided consists of a sequence of terminals, I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t30 t90 t88 t25 t90 t25 t30 t40 t52 t99 t37 t12 t33 t90 t37 t75 t23 t42 t30 t90 t65 t65 t37 t91 t37 t60 t70 t13 t40 t12 t10 t37 t37 t52 t22 t42 t19 t40 t70`.\n\nI notice that the string is quite long, so it might be a combination of many smaller substrings. Let's see if these terminals appear in the grammar. \n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that several rules produce terminals and non-terminals. For example, NT0 -> 't13', so wherever NT0 appears, it can be replaced with t13. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 't30', NT9 \u2192 't75', etc.\n\nThe string starts with t30, so let's see if there's a production for a non-terminal that can produce t30. Looking up, NT3 \u2192 't30', so perhaps we have NT3 at the beginning.\n\nIn CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the string must be a sequence of terminals that can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step. The first symbol is t30, so that would come from NT3. So, the first part is NT3.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t90. Let's look at NT3's productions. From the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nWait, but we have t90, so maybe one of NT6 or NT0 produces t90. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0, etc. Hmm, not directly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find which non-terminal can derive into t30 t90. Let me think about the structure of the grammar.\n\nThe initial step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So, S can produce NT3 followed by NT9. Let's check what NT3 and NT9 can produce.\n\nNT3 has two options: NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7.\n\nIf we take NT3 as NT3 \u2192 t30, then the next part is NT9, which can produce t90? Looking at NT9's productions: NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1, which might not directly produce t90.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's try constructing the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t30 t90. If S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then the first symbol t30 must come from NT3, and the second symbol t90 must come from NT9.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5 (among others). Let's see if any of these can produce t90. Or NT9 can go to 't90'? Wait, checking the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT9 \u2192 't90'. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, under NT3: NT3 \u2192 't30' is present. So, perhaps NT3 can directly produce t30. Similarly, let's check NT9:\n\nLooking through, NT9 \u2192 't90' is indeed present. Under NT9's productions, indeed, one rule is NT9 \u2192 't90' t75, but wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT6, it's NT6 \u2192 't65'; under NT3: NT3 \u2192 't30'; under NT9: NT9 \u2192 't90'. Wait, is that present? Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, under NT9: \n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n- Other rules go to terminals or non-terminals, but no rule directly says NT9 \u2192 't90'.\n\nWait, no, here's the detailed part where NT9 is defined:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nNT9 -> NT7 NT9\nNT9 -> 't75'\nNT8 -> 't37'\n... (other rules)\nSo, I don't see NT9 \u2192 't90' in the grammar. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nSo, the second symbol in the string is t90. If our grammar doesn't have NT9 \u2192 't90', how can we get that? Unless it's derived from a longer chain, but since the string is directly t30 t90, perhaps that's only possible if the first part is t30 and the second part is t90.\n\nWait, but that can't be unless the production directly allows that. Alternatively, maybe one of the non-terminals can derive into t90.\n\nLet me check all the non-terminals that can directly go to 'tX':\n\nLooking through, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13'\n- NT1 \u2192 't25', 't40', etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 't33', 't37', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT4 \u2192 't88', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't91', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't65', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't70', etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 't52', 't42', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't75'\n\nAh, so only NT9 directly produces t75. So, the second symbol is t90, but our grammar doesn't have any production where NT9 \u2192 't90'. Therefore, how can the string start with t30 t90? Because either the grammar doesn't allow it, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way for NT9 to derive into t90 through some other productions. For example, perhaps NT9 can expand into a series of non-terminals that eventually resolve to t90. But looking at NT9's productions, all of them either produce another NT (like NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9) or terminate with a terminal, which are t75, etc.\n\nIs there any rule that can produce 't90' via more than one step? Let's see.\n\nIf any of NT9's productions can lead to multiple terminals, perhaps t90 can be part of that. For example, if NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9, and then NT7 might produce another symbol, but ultimately, without a rule that allows NT7 to produce 't90', it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second 't90' is part of a larger substring, but since the string is a sequence of individual terminals, each must come directly from a production.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t30 comes t90. So, the first part is NT3 \u2192 t30, and then NT9 \u2192 t90, but as per the grammar, there is no production where NT9 \u2192 t90 directly. So, the string as a whole might not be derivable from the grammar.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's a chain of productions that can lead to t90. Let me think: Can any of the non-terminals that NT9 can produce lead to t90?\n\nLooking at NT9's rules:\n\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT1 -> t25, etc. Let me see:\n\nNT1 can produce 't25', 't40', 't75', etc. Wait, if NT1 can go to t25 and the next production is NT5. What does NT5 produce? Looking back:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t91, etc. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nAnother path: Perhaps NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9.\n\nNT7 can produce 't70', etc. NT7 \u2192 t70, or NT5. Wait, NT7 \u2192 t70, which is a terminal. So, if we have NT7 \u2192 't70', then NT7 NT9 would be t70 followed by whatever NT9 can produce.\n\nBut since NT9 is being used again, it can lead to a chain. So, for the symbols t30 t90, we have:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t30 (since NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-750","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF has a specific structure, right? Each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar. Wait, looking at the grammar, all the productions seem to be either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, where S is the start symbol, and NT3 and NT9 are non-terminals. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT2, again two non-terminals. There are some terminals like 't40' and others, but in the start, the productions seem to be in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t30 t99 t40 t30 t34 t30 t8 t88 t75 t23 t34 t37 t37 t14 t91 t42 t40 t8 t65 t52 t91 t88 t19 t30 t88 t30 t34 t60 t91 t99 t37 t22 t23 t41 t99 t65 t90 t12 t12`.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens, but each seems to correspond to a terminal in the grammar. So each token in the string must be derived from a terminal production.\n\nWait, first I should check if all the tokens in the string are present as terminals in the grammar. Let's look at the productions. The terminals are things like 't30', 't99', 't40', etc. Let me scan through the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that the terminals include 't8', 't88', 't75', 't23', 't34', 't37', 't14', 't91', 't42', 't40', 't65', 't52', 't91' again, 't99', 't22', 't23' again, 't41', 't99', 't65', 't90', 't12', etc. So the given string has all these terminals, so that's good.\n\nNext, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. That means for the string to be generated, every time we expand a non-terminal, it must split into exactly two symbols, which could be either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in CNF, it's exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. Therefore, the derivation from the start symbol S will result in a sequence where each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, leading to a parse tree where each node has exactly two children.\n\nGiven that, the string should have a length that is 2^n, where n is the number of steps in the derivation. Starting from S, each step doubles the number of symbols (since each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols). But in our case, the string is just a linear sequence, not a tree, so we need to think about how the symbols can be derived.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use the CYK algorithm or some parsing method to check if the string is in the language. But since the grammar is in CNF, maybe a recursive descent parser or a simple top-down approach would suffice.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to try to build the parse tree step by step and see if it matches the given string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the given string and see if I can break it down using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t30 t99 t40 t30 t34 t30 t8 t88 t75 t23 t34 t37 t37 t14 t91 t42 t40 t8 t65 t52 t91 t88 t19 t30 t88 t30 t34 t60 t91 t99 t37 t22 t23 t41 t99 t65 t90 t12 t12.\n\nThat's 38 tokens. Since each production splits a non-terminal into two, the number of symbols must be a product of 2's starting from the initial step. But 38 is not a power of 2, so perhaps that's a red flag. Wait, let me think: In CNF, each step doubles the length minus some, but starting from 1, each step could lead to 2, 4, 8, etc., but the actual string length would be 2^n. So 38 is not a power of two: 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So 38 is in between and isn't a power of two. Hmm, that might mean that the string is not in the language, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the string isn't a direct result of the tree depth. The actual string would be the result of a parse where each step uses the rules, so perhaps the total number of symbols can be more flexible, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the derivation is possible through the expansion, regardless of the length, as long as the sequence of symbols matches the rules.\n\nSo maybe the length isn't the issue. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo the first two symbols should be NT3 and NT9. Let's check the string: the first token is t30. Now, I need to find which non-terminal produces t30.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n\nAnd so on. Wait, but I don't see a production for NT3 \u2192 a terminal. Only non-terminals. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, the start symbol S can be a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, in this case, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which are non-terminals, and each non-terminal can be further split. But all terminal symbols in the string must be generated by some production rule.\n\nWait, but looking through the production rules, I don't see any terminal symbols except 't's, but they are on the right-hand side of some rules. For example:\n\nLooking through all production rules, the right-hand sides are all combinations of non-terminals except for:\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me scan through the rules again.

{"custom_id":"request-770","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in CNF. I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for terminals, which can only appear on the right-hand side as single symbols. Also, all terminal strings are non-empty. That should help because I can parse the string by breaking it down into allowable parts.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: `t30 t8 t8 t65 t52 t37 t52 t99 t33 t70 t23 t34 t65 t52 t90 t13 t37 t22 t12 t19 t8 t37 t19 t52 t60 t37 t41 t40 t10 t34 t8 t10 t19 t33 t40 t34 t91 t37 t34 t33`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. But wait, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, as the parser, I should look for sequences where non-terminals can be reduced step by step until the entire string is composed of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that non-terminals are connected in various ways. The start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT9. So S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and NT9 \u2192 something. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, there are many productions, and some of them directly map to terminals.\n\nFor example, looking at the production rules, I see NT2 \u2192 't33', NT3 \u2192 't30', NT5 \u2192 't91', NT6 \u2192 't8', and others. So some of these non-terminals directly produce terminals. The key here is to find a parse tree where each node is either a terminal or expands into two non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nLet me try to map the string to see if it can be formed by these rules. I'll start from the beginning and see if the first few tokens fit any production.\n\nThe first token is t30. Looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't30'. But NT3 itself is a non-terminal that expands into NT6 NT2. So that would mean the first part is NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and each of those needs to produce the following tokens.\n\nSo, t30 would correspond to NT3, which is NT6 NT2. Let's see what the rest of the string looks like after that. The next tokens are t8, t8, etc.\n\nAfter t30 comes t8, t8, t65, t52, t37, t52, t99, ... I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is better. Perhaps I should build a parse tree or use dynamic programming to see if this string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, I can observe the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production is two symbols. So the string's length must be 2^n where n is the number of productions applied. The given string has 37 tokens. Let me check if 37 is a power of 2. Well, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 37 is in between, so 37 can't be represented as 2^n. Wait, but that can't be right because context-free grammars in CNF can generate strings of length that's a power of two or shorter. Hmm, but maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, since each application of a production in CNF increases the length by 1 (from 1 symbol becoming two), starting from 1 symbol, each step doubles the length. So the string length must be a power of two. For example, the start is S, which might be length 1. Then S \u2192 NT3 NT9 would make length 2. If each of those non-terminals expands into two, the length would be 4, then 8, 16, 32, etc.\n\nThe given string is 37 tokens, which is not a power of two. It's 37, which is 32 + 5. So 32 is a power of two (2^5), but 37 isn't. That suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar, as the grammar only produces strings of length 2^n.\n\nWait, but I might be missing something. Maybe some non-terminals produce terminals, so the actual length depends on which non-terminals are expanded. For instance, if some non-terminals produce a single terminal, maybe the overall length isn't strictly a power of two.\n\nBut in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So each step can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the total number of symbols at each step can vary. However, the length of the derived string can be anything because it's built by a series of expansions where each A can be replaced with two symbols (non-terminals or terminals). So the total number of symbols can grow in any way, but the structure of the parse tree has to fit the productions.\n\nBut in any case, the string's length is 37. I'm not sure if that's compatible. Maybe the grammar is designed in a way that allows certain lengths, but perhaps it's built so that each non-terminal eventually leads to a specific pattern.\n\nBut wait, another approach: let's look for the terminals in the string and see if their order and grouping match the productions.\n\nLooking back, t30 is produced by NT3, which branches into NT6 and NT2. Then t30 is matched by NT3, then we have t8, t8, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is t30 \u2192 NT3.\n\nThen NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So next two tokens should be NT6 and NT2.\n\nLooking at the string, after t30, the next two are t8 and t8? Or is that a stretch? Wait, the string is `t30 t8 t8 t65 t52 t37 t52 t99 t33 t70 t23 t34 t65 t52 t90 t13 t37 t22 t12 t19 t8 t37 t19 t52 t60 t37 t41 t40 t10 t34 t8 t10 t19 t33 t40 t34 t91 t37 t34 t33`.\n\nSo after t30, the next token is t8, which is a terminal. But NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So after t30, the next two symbols should be NT6 and NT2, which are non-terminals, meaning they themselves are productions.\n\nWait, but the next token is t8, which is a terminal. So unless NT6 is a terminal, but in the grammar, all the rules ending with terminals are given. For example, NT6 \u2192 't8', so yes, NT6 directly produces 't8'.\n\nSo, the first three symbols would be t30, followed by the production of NT6 (t8) and NT2 (another symbol). So let's see:\n\n1. t30 \u2192 NT3\n2. Then NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So NT6 produces t8, so second symbol is t8. Then NT2 is a non-terminal. Wait, but NT2 can produce 't33' directly or expand further.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the string.\n\nAfter t30 comes t8, which would be NT6. Then the next symbol is t8 again. Hmm, maybe the string starts with t30, then t8 (NT6), then t8 (NT2), then t65. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nBut then t65 is a terminal, so it should come from NT5 or another production. Looking at the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 't34', NT5 \u2192 't91', NT8 \u2192 't52', etc. Wait, there's a production NT5 \u2192 't91', but also NT6 \u2192 't8' and 't34'.\n\nWait, let me check each non-terminal's terminal options.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, the terminals are:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't30'\n- NT5 \u2192 't91'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n- NT8 \u2192 't52'\n- NT9 \u2192 't40' (appears multiple times)\n- Additionally, some other non-terminals have terminals as part of their production.\n\nWait, for"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-778","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a way of structuring the rules for a context-free grammar. Each production rule has a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t19 t34 t37 t23 t99 t91 t42 t30 t42 t88 t37 t70 t99 t40 t30 t41 t90 t37 t37 t42 t34 t70 t91 t41 t37 t25 t37 t22 t34 t40 t65 t33 t88 t8 t22 t70 t8 t13 t41 t37`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the productions directly convert non-terminals into terminals. For example, `NT9 -> t75`, `NT8 -> t52`, etc. So, when I see a 't' followed by a number, I can check against these productions. But there are also several 't's in the string without numbers, like 't25', 't34', etc., which correspond to specific terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S has two productions: `S -> NT3 NT9` and `S -> NT3 NT2`. Since the string starts with t19, I'll need to see if that can be part of a derivation starting with these.\n\nLooking at the productions, each production rule is a non-terminal splitting into two parts. So, for example, NT3 can produce certain combinations of non-terminals, some of which become terminals. \n\nThe string starts with 't19', so I need to find which non-terminal can produce 't19'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT1 has a production `NT1 -> NT0 NT4`, and also `NT1 -> NT9 NT8`. Wait, but none of the NT's directly produce 't19'; perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, maybe I should check all the NT's that have 't19' in their productions.\n\nLooking through all the productions where terminals are the right part, I see that NT1 has a production `NT1-> t40` and others, but not 't19'. Wait, looking again, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, let me look through each non-terminal and see if any produce 't19'. \n\nLooking at the NT0 productions: `NT0 -> NT1 NT3`, `NT0-> NT4 NT0`, etc. Wait, none of these produce 't19' as a terminal directly. Similarly, checking other NTs:\n\n- NT1: I don't see any 't19' in its productions, except maybe in the last few lines. Let me check all the NT1 productions. Hmm, I see at the end: `NT1-> t40`, but no 't19'.\n\n- NT2: Let me check. There are several rules, but I don't see any producing 't19'.\n\nWait, maybe 't19' is not directly a terminal but a step in the production. Maybe it's part of a larger sequence. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake because 't19' might be part of a NT's production. Let me see where 't19' is in the grammar.\n\nWait, in the end of the grammar, I see several lines ending with 't19', like `NT1 -> t19`? Wait no, looking at the last few lines:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines, I see:\n- `NT7 -> t40`\n- `NT5 -> t91`\n- `NT6 -> t65`\n- `NT3 -> t30`\n- `NT8 -> t37`\n- `NT9 -> t75`\n- `NT2 -> t33`\n- `NT6 -> t8`\n- `NT1 -> t40`\n- `NT7 -> t10`\n- `NT1 -> t19`\n- `NT1 -> t12`\n- `NT4 -> t88`\n- `NT2 -> t37`\n- `NT3 -> t90`\n- `NT9 -> t60`\n- `NT7 -> t70`\n- `NT8 -> t41`\n- `NT4 -> t42`\n- `NT9 -> t22`\n- `NT9 -> t14`\n- `NT4 -> t99`\n- `NT8 -> t23`\n- `NT5 -> t37`\n\nWait, I see that `NT1 -> t19` is present. So that's good. So there's a production where NT1 can become 't19'.\n\nNow, in the string, the first token is 't19', so in the derivation, at some point, S must produce something that includes 't19' as a terminal.\n\nGiven that S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. So let's see:\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n\nThen, NT3 and NT9 need to produce sequences that can lead to the string.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT3 can produce NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. So, let's say NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, then NT6 can produce NT9 NT2 or NT8 NT4, etc. Similarly, NT9 can produce various combinations, like NT1 NT5, NT7 NT9, etc.\n\nWait, this could take a while, but maybe a better approach is to work backwards, using the CYK algorithm. But I'm not very familiar with CYK, so perhaps I can find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me see: the string starts with t19. So let's see which non-terminals can produce 't19' as their first symbol. Looking at the grammar, only NT1 can produce 't19' directly. So the first production must involve NT1.\n\nSo the string starts with 't19', which is from NT1. So the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nBut since the first symbol is 't19', which is NT1, which only appears in the productions of NT3 and NT9, but wait no: NT3 produces NT6 NT2, etc. So if the first symbol is 't19', the first NT in the leftmost derivation must be NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is NT3 \u2192 NT1 NT3? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the first symbols after S's production use NT3 and NT9 or NT2, but one of them must derive to 't19' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, maybe S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then, the first symbol would come from NT3. Can NT3 produce a terminal as its first symbol?\n\nLooking at NT3's productions, the options are NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7.\n\nBut NT6 can produce NT8 NT4, etc., and NT0 can produce NT4 NT1, etc. But none of these directly produce 't19'; instead, NT1 can produce 't19'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in a longer derivation, but it might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t19, so it must be the first symbol, which comes from an NT. So which NT can derive to 't19' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT1, one of its productions is NT1 \u2192 t19. So perhaps in the leftmost derivation, NT1 is used first.\n\nSo the production chain would be S \u2192 NT3 NT9, but then one of NT3 or NT9 must expand to include NT1 as the first symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then NT3 expands to include NT1 NT3 or something.

{"custom_id":"request-789","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. I'm a bit nervous because it looks complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, which becomes NT3 NT9. So the string must start and end with these as the start symbol. Now, looking at the string provided: it starts with t8 and ends with t0 and t22, but wait, S is supposed to generate NT3 and NT9. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the string again.\n\nWait, the string is: t8 t13 t23 t13 t10 t25 t13 t40 t90 t37 t40 t30 t25 t8 t19 t37 t22 t91 t40 t37 t90 t13 t70 t88 t91 t52 t88 t8 t52 t52 t13 t12 t30 t37 t14 t8 t40 t52 t91 t30 t19.\n\nI notice that the first symbol is t8, which isn't present on the left-hand side (LHS) of any production. All the productions start with S, NT8, NT0, etc., but t8 is on the RHS of some productions. So in the string, the first token is t8. Let me look at the productions to see where t8 can appear.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT2 can produce t8, and NT0 can produce t13, etc. But for the string to start with t8, it must be derived from a non-terminal that can produce t8. Let me check if NT2 or any other rule has t8.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT2 -> t8 is not present because NT2 mostly produces combinations of NTs and terminals. Wait, actually, I see a production like NT2 -> NT6 NT8. Hmm, but that's an NT production, not a terminal like t8.\n\nLooking further, in the terminal productions, I see NT9 -> 't75', NT8 -> 't37', etc. Wait, let me look at all terminal productions:\n\nHere's a list of terminal productions:\n\nNT0 -> t13\nNT1 -> t25\nNT2 -> t33\nNT3 -> t30\nNT2 -> t37\nNT6 -> t8\nNT8 -> t52\nNT9 -> t75\nOther NT2 productions (NT2 -> t8?) No, I think I see one:\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT2 -> t33\n\nand\n\nNT6 -> t8.\n\nWait, checking: NT2 can produce NT6 NT8, but in another production, NT8 can produce t52, which is 't52'.\n\nWait, but I don't see any direct production where an NT directly yields t8 except for NT6 -> t8. So maybe the string starts with t8, which would have to come from NT6.\n\nSo, step 1: The first symbol is t8, so it must come from NT6.\n\nSo we start with S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t8, so the first part must be produced by an NT that can generate t8. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3 and NT9, do they have any terminals?\n\nNT3 can go to NT6 NT2, and then from NT6, it can produce t8 if NT6's production allows it. But NT6 has several productions, some of which produce combinations of NTs, but also one production is NT6 -> t8.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nIf the first part is t8, it's from NT6, so we can think that part is from NT6. Therefore, the string would start from S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Wait, but S produces NT3 and NT9, so the string starts with t8, which can only come from NT6, not NT3 or NT9. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol S -> NT3 NT9. So to generate a string, we have to expand both NT3 and NT9 until we get all terminals. The structure must expand both parts.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t8, which is derived from NT6. So, is there a way that NT3 or NT9 can produce t8? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3, it goes to NT6 NT2. So if NT3 is expanded, the first symbol would be NT6, which could produce t8. Similarly, NT9 has a production to NT7 NT9, but I don't think that leads to t8 directly.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first part is NT3 and then NT9. If NT3 expands into NT6 NT2, then the first symbol would be NT6, which could produce t8.\n\nWait, but the initial string starts with t8, so if the first symbol is t8, that would require that the first part of the derivation is NT6, which is part of NT3's expansion. But how?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think: the derivation starts from S, which becomes NT3 NT9. But then, to get a terminal, the NT3 and NT9 must be expanded, possibly multiple times, until the entire string is terminals. So let's say that the string starts with t8, which comes from the leftmost symbol. So, in the leftmost position, after some expansions, the first NT would produce a terminal, starting with t8.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9 \u2192 (something) (something) \u2192 t8 (something else) (something else) ... \n\nSo the first NT3 might have to expand until it produces a terminal, which is t8.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\n\nthen NT6 can produce t8, right? Because NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 t8. So if NT3 expands to NT6 NT2, then the first symbol is t8. So the leftmost symbol is t8, which is the start of the string.\n\nSo that's possible. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the second symbol is t13. Let's see where this could come from. The string is t8 t13 t23 t13...\n\nLooking at the entire string, after t8, we have t13, then t23, t13. Let me see, perhaps that comes from the other part of S's expansion, which is NT9.\n\nWait, S -> NT3 NT9, so the expansion would produce something like (expansion of NT3) (expansion of NT9). So if the first part is t8, then the second part is the expansion starting from NT9.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\nNT9 -> 't75' \u2192 which is a terminal. Also, NT9 has other productions like NT9 -> NT1 NT5, etc. But in the string, after t8 comes t13, so that might be from NT9's initial production as 't13'.\n\nWait, no, because S produces NT3 and NT9. The first part (NT3) expands to t8, so the latter part is the NT9. So if NT9 can directly produce 't13', that's how the second symbol would be. Let me check NT9's productions:\n\nLooking at the productions, NT9 has a production NT9 -> t75, and another NT9 -> NT1 NT5. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me re-examine all NT9's productions:\n\nNT9 -> 't75'\nNT9 -> NT1 NT5\nOther NT9 productions include NT9 -> NT7 NT9, which is recursive.\n\nBut in the string, the second symbol is t13. So perhaps the NT9 part needs to expand into something. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The string is t8 t13 t23..., so after t8, which comes from NT3, the next symbol is t13, which should come from NT9.\n\nLooking at NT9, do any of its productions directly produce t13? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, I think I see that:\n\n- NT0 -> t13\n\nBut NT9 doesn't produce t13 directly. Instead, NT9 can go to 't75' or other combinations.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look through the productions for each NT.\n\nLooking at NT0: NT0 -> t13. So if any NT eventually produces NT0, then that terminal would generate t13.\n\nLooking at NT6, which can produce t8.\n\nWait, maybe the expansion of NT9 is something that leads to t13.\n\nLet me see: NT9 can expand to NT1 NT5 and so on. So, let's think: NT9 -> NT1 NT5 \u2192 then NT1 could produce t25, and NT5 could produce other things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace this step by step.\n\nAfter"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-794","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me start by understanding what's given.\n\nThe grammar consists of various productions, all starting with symbols like S, NT0, NT1, etc., and some of them are terminating with 't' followed by numbers, like 't40', 't52', etc. The input string is a sequence of these 't' strings separated by spaces. The string I need to evaluate is: `t90 t88 t88 t40 t52 t14 t88 t30 t88 t13 t42 t10 t14 t33 t12 t65 t40 t37 t13 t75 t40 t42 t91 t41 t65 t41 t42 t70 t37 t65 t33 t37 t60 t37 t37 t52 t12 t23 t40 t12 t25`.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this case, the terminals are the 't' strings, and the non-terminals are the other symbols.\n\nMy plan is to construct a parse tree or use a parsing method to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm, but with so many non-terminals, that might be complicated. Maybe a recursive descent approach would work, but it's time-consuming to write all the functions.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that in CNF, the parse tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly two children. The leaves are terminals. Each non-terminal has productions that consist of two non-terminals or a terminal (if it's a single terminal production). But looking at the given grammar, many of the productions are binary, like S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to see if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar. The string starts with t90, which is a terminal. Since all productions are binary except the terminals, this suggests that the first token must be the result of a production that directly produces t90. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT9 \u2192 t75, but also NT0 \u2192 't13', NT7 \u2192 't40', and others. However, I don't see a production that directly gives t90 as a single terminal. So perhaps t90 must be part of a two-step process.\n\nWait, maybe t90 comes from a non-terminal that eventually produces it. Let's look for any non-terminal that produces t90. Scanning the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 t75, but that's only outputting one t. Similarly, NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 t88. So t88 comes from NT4. But in the string, the second token is t88, which would mean that the first part of the string is generated by a production leading to t88, followed by another t88. So perhaps the first part is derived from NT4, since NT4 \u2192 t88. Or maybe there's a non-terminal that produces t88 via a production that involves NT4 and something else.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 t88. So t88 can be a terminal, meaning that it's a leaf in the parse tree. So that would mean that the first two t88s in the string would have to come from some non-terminals that expand into t88.\n\nHmm, to break it down, the string starts with t90, so the production for t90 must come from somewhere. Wait, but I don't see any production for NT9 except NT9 \u2192 t90, wait no, looking again, there's ND9: NT9 \u2192 't75' but no NT9 \u2192 't90' directly. Wait, let me check: the last part of the grammar has lines like 'NT9 -> t75', 'NT7 -> t40', etc. Oh, wait, I might have misread earlier. Let me parse the grammar lines correctly.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t75\nBut no production for t90 except perhaps later. Wait, the user provided a bunch of grammar rules, but I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me make sure. Oh, the user wrote lines like:\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT1 -> 't40'\nNT7 -> 't40'\nNT5 -> 't91'\nNT6 -> 't65'\nNT3 -> 't30'\nNT8 -> 't37'\nNT9 -> 't75'\nNT2 -> 't33'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT1 -> 't40'\nNT7 -> 't10'\nNT1 -> 't19'\nNT1 -> 't12'\nNT4 -> 't88'\nNT2 -> 't37'\nNT3 -> 't90'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT8 -> 't41'\nNT4 -> 't42'\nNT9 -> 't22'\nNT9 -> 't14'\nNT4 -> 't99'\nNT8 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't37'\n\nWait, so I see NT3 \u2192 't90', which is right there. So there's a production where NT3 directly produces t90. So in the string, if a 't90' appears, it must come from a production of NT3.\n\nSo the string starts with 't90', which is the result of NT3 expanding to t90. Therefore, the first part of the string is generated by NT3 \u2192 t90.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT3 has several productions. One of them is NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. So to get t90, NT3 must produce t90 via the direct production, which is possible. But in that case, the NT3 that generates t90 must be part of a larger context.\n\nWait, no, because the entire string is supposed to be generated by S. So perhaps S expands into NT3 and NT9. Because the first line of grammar is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, right?\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the entire string must be generated by expanding S into NT3 and NT9, then each of them expanding into sequences that combine to the string.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is t90, which would correspond to t90 from NT3 expanding directly, but then what comes after t90?\n\nThe string is: t90 t88 t88 t40 t52 t14 t88 t30 t88 t13 t42 t10 t14 t33 t12 t65 t40 t37 t13 t75 t40 t42 t91 t41 t65 t41 t42 t70 t37 t65 t33 t37 t60 t37 t37 t52 t12 t23 t40 t12 t25.\n\nAfter t90, the next tokens are t88, t88, t40, t52, etc.\n\nWait, but if NT3 produces t90, then the first part of the string is t90, so the rest must come from NT9. But in S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the NT3 produces t90, and NT9 must produce the rest.\n\nBut looking at the string, after t90, the next tokens are t88 t88 t40 t52 t14... So that would have to come from NT9. But looking at NT9's productions: NT9 \u2192 't52', 't14', 't13', 't12', 't22', 't91', etc. So to get t88, perhaps NT9 can't produce it directly. Wait, no, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. In the grammar, NT9's productions are lines like 't52', 't14', etc., but looking at the given grammar, I don't see NT9 \u2192 t88. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar includes:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't22'\nNT9 \u2192 't14'\nNT9 \u2192 't12'\nNT9 \u2192 't42'\nNT9 \u2192 't91'\nNT9 \u2192 't41'\nNT9 \u2192 't42' (again)\nOther lines: no, I don't see anything about t88 in NT9's productions. So NT9 cannot directly produce t88. Therefore, the second part of the string (the part after t90) can't be directly generated by NT9.

{"custom_id":"request-813","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly. Also, the grammar doesn't produce \u03bb (epsilon), which would complicate things further.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the initial symbol is S. The string to evaluate starts with 't34 t99 ...' so I need to see if S can derive this string step by step.\n\nLet me parse through the grammar rules to see which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nI start by looking for rules that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't75' (from line NT9 \u2192 't75')\n- NT9 \u2192 't60' (line NT9 \u2192 't60')\n- NT2 \u2192 't33' (line NT6 \u2192 't8' and others, but direct matches seem fewer)\nWait, maybe I should list all terminals:\n\nFrom the rules, the terminals are:\n't34', 't99', 't90', 't52', 't33', 't13', 't25', 't8', 't99', etc.\n\nBut I need to find which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nLooking through:\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT9 (from S: NT3 NT9)\n- NT9 can produce 't75' and 't60'.\n- NT3 has a rule leading to terminals: NT3 \u2192 't30' or via other paths.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at NT8 rules. NT8 can end with 't52' or 't37' etc.\n\nFirst, the string is: t34 t99 t90 t52 t99 t33 t13 t25 t34 t30 t75 t90 t99 t10 t91 t10 t91 t99 t37 t70 t41 t42 t75 t65 t91 t22 t41 t70 t37 t19 t90 t60 t41 t37 t75 t10 t25 t70 t65 t33 t40 t22.\n\nThat's a lot. Let me see the initial step: S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first two symbols in the string must come from NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules: I see NT3 \u2192 't30' and NT3 \u2192 't90'.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the productions for NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 (rule 32)\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7 (rule 33)\nNT9 \u2192 't30' (from NT0 \u2192 't30', but NT0 can come from other things?)\nWait, actually, that's not correct. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT3 NT3\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nLooking through the NT3 rules:\n\nNT3:\n158: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n159: NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nSo NT3 can only produce NT6 and NT7 or NT0 and NT7. None directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because looking at the initial string, the first token is 't34', which must come from S's first rule, S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo NT3 produces something, and NT9 produces something.\n\nLooking at NT3: from the given rules, none of the productions for NT3 result in a terminal immediately. It seems NT3 must expand recursively until it hits a production that can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, all NT3's productions are to non-terminals. So how does NT3 ever produce a terminal? That can't be. So if NT3 only expands into other non-terminals, then it can never produce a terminal.\n\nWait, that would mean that the initial rule S \u2192 NT3 NT9 can never produce any terminal, because NT3 can't produce anything terminal. So the string cannot start with a terminal, making 't34' impossible.\n\nWait, but in the rule list, is there any rule that produces 't34'?

{"custom_id":"request-814","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, especially when they're in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like every non-terminal symbol is broken down into exactly two other non-terminals, except for some that terminate into terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like 't90', 't25', etc. My goal is to see if the string provided can be derived by starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe given string is pretty long: `t90 t90 t90 t19 t65 t37 t25 t52 t22 t60 t99 t70 t37 t37 t12 t23 t12 t41 t40 t13 t37 t42 t37 t10 t70 t30 t34 t8 t65 t41 t22 t41 t99 t19 t37 t42 t23 t91 t13 t22 t37 t99`. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce these 't...' strings. For example, NT8 -> 't52', NT6 -> 't34', etc. So, each terminal in the string must correspond to a production rule that results in that exact string. The plan is to parse the string symbol by symbol, checking if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the beginning of the string: three 't90's. So, the first thing I see is 't90 t90 t90'. Looking at the grammar, I check which non-terminals produce 't90'. According to the rules, NT9 -> 't90', NT7 -> 't90', and NT3 -> 't30' (wait, no, that's not right). Wait, looking back: NT9 has two rules, one of which is NT9 -> 't75' and another -> 't60', maybe I miscounted. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT9 has several production rules, including NT9 -> 't75' and NT9 -> 't60'. Oh, maybe I'm looking at other sections. Let me scan again: Yes, there's a rule NT9 -> 't90'\u2014let me check. Oh, here it is: NT9 -> 't90'. So, 't90' can come from NT9. So, the first part could be NT9 => 't90'.\n\nSimilarly, the next is another 't90', then another. So, if I start with the start symbol S, which produces NT3 NT9. Let's see if we can build each part step by step.\n\nBreaking down the string into individual tokens: t90, t90, t90, t19, t65, t37, t25, t52, t22, t60, t99, t70, t37, t37, t12, t23, t12, t41, t40, t13, t37, t42, t37, t10, t70, t30, t34, t8, t65, t41, t22, t41, t99, t19, t37, t42, t23, t91, t13, t22, t37, t99.\n\nSo the first three 't90's look like they could be from NT9 producing each of them, but I need to see how that fits into the grammar.\n\nStarting at S: S -> NT3 NT9. So the first part is NT3 leading to t90, then NT9 leading to another t90. But I have three t90s, so maybe NT3 and NT9 are each splitting into more non-terminals that eventually produce t90.\n\nWait, maybe let's think about this step by step. Let's consider the string as a sequence of symbols and try to match them against the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, the first two symbols should come from NT3 and NT9, each of which is a non-terminal that expands into a sequence. However, looking at the grammar, both NT3 and NT9 produce two non-terminals each. Wait, or do they? Let me check the production rules.\n\nWait, for NT3: NT3 has rules like NT3 -> NT6 NT2, and another NT3 -> NT0 NT7. Hmm, so NT3 is a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals. Similarly, NT9 has rules like NT9 -> NT7 NT9 and another rule. Wait, some of the rules for NT9 are more complex. Let me try to list all NT9's rules:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n- NT9 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT9 -> NT7 NT9\n- Oh, and also NT9 has other rules involving NT7 and NT5, etc., but perhaps the ones that produce terminal strings are the two I highlighted earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should check for each non-terminal whether it can directly derive a terminal. For example, checking each non-terminal rule to see if any produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that some non-terminals do produce terminals directly. For example:\n\n- NT9 -> 't90' (I think). Let me look: Yes, in the later part, under NT9, there's 'NT9 -> 't90''? Wait, let me scan the list again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under NT9 there's a rule 'NT9 -> 't90'': Yes, in the later lines, there's 'NT9 -> 't90''. Similarly, elsewhere, NT0 -> 't13', NT6 -> 't8', etc.\n\nSo, NT9 can produce 't90', and other NT non-terminals have their own terminal production rules.\n\nSo, the strategy would be to parse the string as if it's a sequence of these symbols and see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, the parsing can be done using either recursive descent or top-down parsing with a stack.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to try to build a parse tree starting from the root.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT3 NT9. So, the first two symbols (if generated by NT3 and NT9) would come from NT3 and NT9.\n\n2. NT9 can immediately produce 't90'. So the first symbol is 't90' from NT9.\n\n3. The next NT9's production: it could produce another 't90', so the second symbol is from NT9's production.\n\nWait, but S is NT3 NT9. So, the first token is from NT3, the second from NT9. Then the remaining tokens would need to be generated by the respective NT3 and NT9's expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the context of a string, the parsing works by starting at the beginning and applying the grammar rules to match the string from left to right.\n\nSo, the entire string must be generated by the start symbol S. So, S must produce a sequence that exactly matches the string, symbol by symbol, without any leftovers.\n\nBut S -> NT3 NT9, which means the first part of the string must come from NT3 expanding into a sequence, followed by NT9 expanding into another sequence that together covers the entire string.\n\nWait, but NT3 and NT9 both produce two non-terminals each. So, each would have their own expansion, and the overall string is the concatenation of these two expansions.\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be split into two parts: the first part generated by NT3 and the second by NT9, and these two parts together form the entire string.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's 39 symbols long. If S is NT3 NT9, then the total would be the sum of symbols from NT3's expansion and NT9's expansion. So, if both NT3 and NT9 expand into multiple symbols, their concatenation must equal the given string.\n\nHowever, given that the string is quite long and the grammar can have recursive rules, it might be easier to think in terms of recursive parsing or using a top-down approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the structure of the string and see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each symbol in the string can be derived starting from S. Let's attempt this step by step.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: 't90'. We saw earlier that NT9 -> 't90'.

The string is a sequence of t* followed by numbers, like \"t99 t8 t90...\" and so on, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single symbol or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. Looking at the productions, they're all combinations of NT (non-terminals) ending with a terminal character, except for some which have just NT symbols.\n\nAlright, the string to evaluate is: t99 t8 t90 t40 t34 t37 t33 t99 t65 t37 t8 t37 t10 t22 t37 t90 t88 t14 t91 t34 t91 t25 t75 t30 t90 t75 t30 t25 t30 t8 t34 t8 t37 t13 t33 t37 t99 t41 t23 t13 t40 t70 t33.\n\nI notice that this string is a series of t* followed by numbers, so each token starts with 't' followed by numbers. Let me count how many tokens there are. I'll split the string by spaces:\n\nt99, t8, t90, t40, t34, t37, t33, t99, t65, t37, t8, t37, t10, t22, t37, t90, t88, t14, t91, t34, t91, t25, t75, t30, t90, t75, t30, t25, t30, t8, t34, t8, t37, t13, t33, t37, t99, t41, t23, t13, t40, t70, t33.\n\nThat's 43 tokens. So the string is 43 t*... which probably correspond to 43 steps in the derivation.\n\nGiven the grammar is in CNF, each production introduces one terminal at a time, and the length of the derivation should match the number of terminals. So, each production adds one terminal, starting from S.\n\nLet me check if the grammar can produce this string. To do that, I need to see if the string can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, some of the tokens are t99, t8, t37, etc. I need to see if these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the productions for the terminals. Some terminals are given in the grammar:\n\nNT-> terminals like 't40', 't52', 't13', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT0 -> t13 is a production.\n\nBut some terminals like t99 may not have any production. Looking back at the grammar, are there any productions where the right-hand side is just a terminal? I think except for the ones explicitly listed, others are non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, all productions are either S -> NT... or NT-> NT NT. So the only way a terminal appears is if it's part of the production for a non-terminal. For example, NT0 -> t13 is a terminal.\n\nSo if a terminal that isn't in any production as a terminal (like t99) can't be generated, right? So if the string has t99, it would have to be generated by some NT-> t99, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal goes directly to t99.\n\nWait, let's scan the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT9 -> t75, NT8-> t37, etc. I don't see any production that ends with t99 except for NT9 and NT8, but I don't see t99 being a terminal in any production. So NTsomething can't produce t99, which means the string t99 is not part of the language. But in the string, t99 appears multiple times. \n\nWait, does this mean the entire string is invalid? Because if the grammar can't produce t99, then the string can't be in the language.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I missed a production for some NT that directly becomes t99.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NTs and their productions:\n\nNT9: \n- NT9 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT8 NT5\n- NT9 -> NT6 NT1\n\nNone of these go to terminal t99.\n\nSimilarly, NT1's productions:\n- NT1 -> NT4 NT8\n- NT1 -> NT7 NT4\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT8\n- NT1 -> NT1 NT2 (wait, no, that's a production for NT1: NT1 -> NT9 NT8, etc.)\n\nSo no, none of the NT produce t99. Therefore, t99 isn't a terminal in this grammar, which means the grammar cannot generate a string containing t99.\n\nSo the string includes t99 multiple times, which can't be produced by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-831","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side, except for the terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens, each of which is either a letter or a number. \n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. It looks like S starts with NT3 and NT9, as per S -> NT3 NT9, so the initial step is generating these two nodes. Then, each of these NT nodes can expand further. The tokens in the string must be generated by expanding these non-terminals correctly until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, each right-hand side seems to consist of two non-terminals except for a few that have terminals. For example, NT8 can go to 't52' or other combinations. So, each production is either a two-node production or a terminal symbol. \n\nThe string provided is: t40 t65 t19 t90 t30 t65 t14 t10 t88 t40 t37 t37 t12 t33 t99 t91 t23 t23 t37 t34 t23 t60 t40 t8 t42 t88 t12 t10 t10 t41 t33 t41 t23 t65 t33 t60 t41 t40 t22 t25 t91 t65 t37.\n\nEach token is a terminal, like 't40' or 't65'. The grammar produces these tokens when a non-terminal is reduced to a terminal. Now, I need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nI think I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using a recursive descent approach or a parsing algorithm, but since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps a recursive approach would help. But given the length of the string, it might be tedious to do manually, so maybe I can look for patterns or key terminal symbols that must be produced by specific non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT9 can produce 't75', 't60', and 't37'. But in our string, the last few tokens include t37, which might come from NT9. Also, there are 't40's, which can come from NT8 via 't52' or others.\n\nWait, let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t40 t65 t19... so S starts with NT3 and NT9.\n\nNT3 can produce several things. Looking at the rules, NT3 can go to NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. So, after S, we have NT3 and NT9. If NT3 goes to NT6 and NT2, let's see what they can produce.\n\nLooking at NT6: rules include NT3 NT6, NT4 NT5, etc. So NT6 can't produce t65 directly. Wait, in the grammar, NT6 can produce t34 (from S->...NT0->t13, not directly NT6). Alternatively, maybe I should check each rule.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see which non-terminals can produce t65, t40, etc. Let me note down the possible places each token can come from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that:\n\n- NT8 can produce 't52' or 't37' or 't40' (from NT8->'t40' in one rule? Let me check: yes, in the grammar, there's NT8 -> 't40'. So, t40 can come from NT8.\n\nSimilarly, t65 is generated by NT6, for example, NT6 has a rule NT6 -> 't34', but also looking elsewhere, maybe I missed that. Wait, looking through the rules again, I see a rule: NT6 -> 't8' (from NT0-> 't13'? No, wait, no, the rules under NT6: looking for 't65'. Let me check all NT6 productions.\n\nWait, no, under NT6: according to the grammar, I see NT6 -> NT4 NT5 and other options. Looking further down, yes, I see NT6 -> 't34' but not t65. Wait, in the provided rules, I have:\n\nNT6 -> NT4 NT5\nNT6 -> NT8 NT4\nNT6 -> NT3 NT1\nNT6 -> NT1 NT2\nAnd some other rules. Hmm, so t65 is not directly produced by NT6 unless another rule leads to it, but I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Maybe it's produced by another NT, like NT9 or NT0, but looking at the grammar, let me check all NT9 productions: NT9 can produce 't75', 't60', 't37', etc., but not t65. Hmm, so perhaps it's not possible. Alternatively, is t65 produced by any NT? Looking again, I don't see any NT that produces t65 except maybe via combinations. \n\nWait, maybe I should check other non-terminals for t65. Looking for t65, perhaps it's generated by NT4? Let me check NT4's rules: NT4 can go to NT8 NT0 (from NT4->... No, NT4's rules are: NT4 -> NT7 NT0, NT7 NT4, etc. But no, looking through the rules, I don't think any NT produces t65.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the string starts with t65. If no NT directly produces t65, then the parsing would fail right there. So unless there's a longer path that eventually produces t65 through multiple steps, but considering the grammar structure, perhaps it's not possible.\n\nWait, let me check again: looking through the rules, is there any production for NT that leads to t65? Let me scan through all the rules:\n\nLooking for any production rule where the right side can reduce to t65. Looking through all the rules... I don't see any NT that directly produces 't65'. So that's a red flag because the string starts with t65, and if there's no production for that, it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm being hasty. Let me re-examine all the rules step by step, perhaps there's a production I missed that leads to t65.\n\nLooking through the grammar, specifically for NT rules: \n\nLooking at NT8, I see NT8 can produce 't52' (from the list: NT8 -> 't52') so t52 is possible. But that's not t65. What about NT5? Let's see NT5 productions: NT5 -> 't91', 't37', 't5' etc. But not t65. What about NT0? NT0 can produce 't13', 't40', 't22', 't25', etc., but no 't65'. NT9 can produce 't75', 't60', 't37', which are also not t65.\n\nHmm, I'm starting to think that 't65' is not produced by any NT in the grammar. If that's the case, then the string can't be generated because the first token is 't65', and it's impossible to derive that.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be No, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Okay, so I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The rules look a bit complex, but I notice that some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals. For example, NT9 -> 't90', NT8 -> 't52', and so on. So when the string given contains these terminal symbols, they must correspond to the right rules.\n\nLooking at the string: `t90 t25 t65 t23 t65 t40 t37 t90 t88 t91 t91 t91 t42 t70 t65 t14 t37 t99 t70 t23 t10 t33 t8 t33 t60 t65 t13 t25 t13 t19 t70 t99 t41 t37 t37 t40 t42 t14 t10 t33 t8 t23 t42 t52`.\n\nI should break this down into parts based on the grammar rules. Each rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the start symbol is S -> NT3 NT9, the string should start with the terminals generated by NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is 't90'. From the grammar, NT9 -> 't90', so that's good. Then the next part should come from NT3. From the rules, NT3 can be broken down into NT6 and NT2. So, the string needs to be split into parts corresponding to NT6 and NT2.\n\nLooking at NT6 -> NT4 NT5. So, after 't90 t25' (assuming NT3 -> 't25'), the next elements should come from NT4 and NT5. NT4 can be either NT7 NT0 or NT2 NT1.\n\nLet me see. The string continues as t65 t23 t65 t40. Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step, building the parse tree as I go.\n\nStart with NT3 NT9: the first part should be 't25 t90' because NT3 is 't25' (from NT3 -> 't25'), and NT9 is 't90'.\n\nThen, the rest of the string starts after that. So the string after 't25 t90' is 't65 t23 t65 t40 t37 t90 t88 t91 t91 t91 t42 t70 t65 t14 t37 t99 t70 t23 t10 t33 t8 t33 t60 t65 t13 t25 t13 t19 t70 t99 t41 t37 t37 t40 t42 t14 t10 t33 t8 t23 t42 t52'.\n\nNow, the next symbols should come from NT6 and NT2 because NT3 -> NT6 NT2.\n\nLooking at the first symbol after that, 't65' is one of the terminals. Checking the grammar, which rule produces 't65': looking at NT8 -> 't52', NT0 -> 't13', NT3 -> 't30', NT6 -> 't65'. Oh, right, NT6 -> 't65'.\n\nSo NT6 is the first part here, which is 't65'.\n\nThen the next part is NT2, which should be the next symbol(s). So the 't23' and others after 't65'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT2 has several rules. Let's see, possibly it can split into NT7 NT7, NT5 NT6, NT7 NT8, NT8 NT9, etc. Wait, looking at the rules, NT2 can be broken down in various ways. Let's see the string: after 't65', the next symbol is 't23'.\n\nHmm, does any of the NT2 rules produce 't23'? Looking through, NT11 isn't a thing, but maybe NT2 can't produce 't23' directly. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the string: 't65 t23 t65 t40' is part of the remaining string. Wait, maybe I should check each step.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Since the initial string is 't90 t25 t65 t23 t65 t40 t37 ...', I should break it down as:\n\nFirst: NT9: 't90'\n\nThen: NT3 -> NT6 and NT2. So after 't90', we have 't25' and 't90', but the string after that is 't65 t23 t65 t40 ...'.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The entire string starts with 't90 t25 ...'. So the first two symbols are 't90 t25', which correspond to NT9 -> 't90' and NT3 -> 't25'. So that's correct.\n\nThen, after those two, we have 't65 t23 t65 t40 ...'.\n\nSo, this is the result of NT6 and NT2. Let's try to split NT6 and NT2 accordingly.\n\nLooking at the string: 't65 t23 t65 t40 ...'. The first symbol is 't65', which is the terminal for NT6. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the next part is NT2. So 't23' is the next symbol. Now, what does NT2 produce? Looking through the grammar rules, NT2 has several rules, including:\n\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT6\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT8\n- NT2 -> NT8 NT9\n- etc.\n\nSo, 't23' is one of the terminals, but looking at the rules, does any non-terminal produce 't23'?\n\nWait, I need to check if any of the non-terminals directly produce 't23'. Looking through the terminal assignments:\n\n- NT2 is 't23'\n- NT8 is 't52'\n- NT9 is 't91', etc.\n\nSo, NT2 is mapped to 't23'.\n\nSo that means after 't65', the next symbol is 't23', which corresponds to NT2. Then, what comes next? After 't23', the next symbols are 't65 t40 ...'.\n\nWait, no. The string after 't25 t90' is 't65 t23 t65 t40 ...'. So, the entire part after 't25 t90' is 't65 t23 t65 t40 ...'.\n\nWait, no, the initial string is 't90 t25 t65 t23 t65 t40 t37 ...'. So the first six symbols are t90 t25 t65 t23 t65 t40, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost in the details. Let's approach this methodically.\n\nAfter the initial two symbols (t90 and t25), we have to process the rest step by step.\n\nThe initial two are correct: NT9->t90, NT3->t25.\n\nNow, the rest is:\n\nt65 t23 t65 t40 t37 t90 t88 t91 t91 t91 t42 t70 t65 t14 t37 t99 t70 t23 t10 t33 t8 t33 t60 t65 t13 t25 t13 t19 t70 t99 t41 t37 t37 t40 t42 t14 t10 t33 t8 t23 t42 t52.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. t65: This is the terminal for NT6. So NT6 is produced here.\n\n2. Next symbol is t23. Now, since NT6 -> NT4 NT5, the next part must be NT4 and NT5.\n\nWait, that might not be right. Wait, NT6 breaks into NT4 and NT5. So after t65 (NT6), the next part is NT4 and NT5.\n\nWait, but after NT6, which is 't65', the next part is t23. So, t23 is the result of NT4 NT5.\n\nBut NT4's terminal is 't88' (from NT4->'t88'). So t23 cannot be the result of NT4 NT5 directly, because that would require combining two symbols, but t23 is a single symbol.\n\nWait a second, that can't be right. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t23 is part of the NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-852","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. This seems a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My task is to see if we can derive the given string using these rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\n`t13 t19 t12 t10 t90 t75 t90 t65 t23 t52 t34 t37 t60 t30 t8 t10 t30 t65 t10 t13 t42 t30 t34 t99 t37 t90 t52 t99 t52 t42 t37 t42 t25 t37 t70 t91 t65 t91 t40 t19 t33 t52 t10 t34`.\n\nWow, that's a lot of tokens! I notice that many of these tokens are terminals (like t13, t19, etc.), but there are also some that might correspond to non-terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are things like S, NT0, NT1, etc. So the terminals in the string are all 't' followed by numbers. I should check if each terminal is present in the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every non-terminal seems to produce terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and looking at the productions, NT3 and NT9 eventually produce terminals. So it's possible that the string is entirely generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if the structure of the string makes sense according to the grammar. The first step is S. From the grammar, S always starts as S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first two symbols should be the terminals resulting from NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3 and NT9, let's see what they produce:\n- NT3 can produce NT6 and NT2. Looking at NT6 and NT2, they further break down. NT6 can produce NT3 and NT6 or NT4 and NT5. But following the Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, but in the given grammar, some non-terminals are assigned to terminals. For example, NT0 \u2192 't13', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT0, NT1, etc., some are terminals. So when a non-terminal is on the right side of a production, it could be a terminal or another non-terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so if NT3 and NT9 produce terminals, then the entire string would be generated by S.\n\nBut let me check if the entire string can be produced by S. The string starts with t13, so let's see which non-terminal can produce t13. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT0 \u2192 't13', NT2 \u2192 't33', etc. So t13 is from NT0. But how does the grammar get from S to t13?\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9. So after expanding NT3 and NT9, we should get t13 as the first token. Let's see what NT3 can produce. NT3 can expand into NT6 and NT2 or NT4 and NT2, etc. But ultimately, each production leads to terminals. Wait, NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT6. NT0 \u2192 't13' and NT6 can expand into other non-terminals or terminals. Wait, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2 or other options, but in the end, some of these non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nWait, but this could take a while. Maybe there's a better way. Since the string starts with t13, which is produced by NT0, and S starts with NT3, maybe I need to see if NT3 can derived t13 as its first expansion.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nWait, but wait, in the productions given, does NT3 have NT4? Let me check:\nLooking back at the grammar, I see NT3 has production like NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, but I don't see NT4 in the productions of NT3. Wait, actually, in the initial list, I see NT3 is defined as:\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 -> NT4 NT2\nWait, no, looking at the initial grammar, after NT8, it goes to NT0, NT1, etc. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar productions. I need to look for NT3's rules. Here's a snippet:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\nNT3 -> NT4 NT8\nNT3 -> NT9 NT0\nNT3 -> NT9 NT6\nand so on. So yes, NT3 can produce NT9 NT0, which can lead to terminals like t90 and t13.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t13, which is from NT0. So perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Then NT3 produces something that starts with t13, or maybe NT9 does. Wait, no, S is divided into NT3 NT9, so both NT3 and NT9 need to produce something. The first symbol of the string is t13, so either NT3 or NT9 must produce t13 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the string is constructed in such a way that each non-terminal production corresponds to a part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, and the string must be a sequence that can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nBut given the string's length and the complexity of the grammar, it's time-consuming to check each step manually. Perhaps there's a pattern or a property I can use.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT0 \u2192 t13, NT1 \u2192 t25, etc. So the string contains various 't' followed by numbers, which correspond to terminals derived from specific non-terminals.\n\nNow, can the entire string be generated by the grammar? Each terminal in the string must correspond to a production of some non-terminal, and the non-terminals must be generated from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me consider the initial steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT9\n   - So the first symbol comes from NT3, and the next from NT9.\n\nIn the string, the first token is t13. We need to see if NT3 can produce t13 as its first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT8\nNT3 \u2192 NT9 NT0\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT6\nWait, do any of these right-hand sides start with 't13'?\n\nLooking at the productions, each production from NT3 produces two non-terminals. To get t13 as the first symbol, one of these productions must have 't13' as the result of a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT0 \u2192 t13, so if NT3 would derive a production that includes NT0 as its first symbol, it would yield t13.\n\nLooking back, one of the NT3 productions is NT9 NT0. So NT3 \u2192 NT9 NT0.\n\nSo if we have NT3 as NT9 NT0, then when expanded, NT3 should produce something that starts with the terminal from NT9 and then from NT0.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is t13, which is from NT0, not NT9. So if NT3 produces NT9 NT0, then the first token would be whatever NT9 produces. If NT9 produces another non-terminal, then the order might be different.\n\nThis seems confusing. Maybe I need to find a way to parse the string according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string contains a pattern that can be generated by the grammar. For example, looking for the start symbol S, which is NT3 NT9. Then S would generate two parts: the first part from NT3 and the second from NT9.\n\nThe string is long, but maybe the tokens can be arranged into two parts that can be generated by NT3 and NT9.\n\nBut without a clear tree structure, it's difficult to visualize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each occurrence of 't' followed by numbers is a terminal, and the entire string is the concatenation of all these terminals, which must be derived from S by applying the grammar rules.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the answer is Yes because each token is a terminal in the grammar, and since all non-terminals in the grammar eventually lead to terminals, it's possible that any combination of terminals is acceptable. However, that might not be the case because the production rules might require a certain structure.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is quite long, so I'll need to approach this methodically. \n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should make parsing easier, perhaps using a top-down approach like recursive descent or a parser generator.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first thing I see in the grammar is that S can only produce two non-terminals: NT3 and NT9. So, the next step is to see how these non-terminals can be expanded.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the string. The string is: \n\nt90 t40 t10 t10 t12 t30 t52 t99 t25 t30 t91 t40 t10 t52 t13 t33 t37 t34 t40 t23 t90 t91 t88 t52 t37 t8 t40 t65 t8 t33 t52 t33 t90 t25 t42 t8 t37 t23 t19 t41 t23 t91 t8 t75 t25.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. The first symbol is t90. Looking at the grammar, there's a production NT9 \u2192 t75, but that's not t90. Wait, in the given grammar, there's a NT9 \u2192 't90' under the NT9 rules. So, maybe NT9 \u2192 t90 is possible.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The user provided a long list of grammar rules. Let me scan through them:\n\nLooking for NT9 productions: Yes, I see NT9 -> t91 and NT9 -> t75, but also NT9 appears later in the list with a production NT9 -> t90. So, NT9 can produce t90.\n\nSo, the first token is t90. So, the first rule used must be NT9 \u2192 t90.\n\nNow, after t90, the next token is t40. Let's see what the other rule for NT9 is. From the grammar, the other production for NT9 is NT9 \u2192 t75. But that would give t75, which isn't the next token. Hmm, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I see that NT9 has two productions: one leading to t91 and another leading to t75. Oh, but that's not the only one. Wait, in the list, I also see NT9 -> t90. So, NT9 can produce t90, t75, and t91. So, t90 is produced by NT9.\n\nSo, after t90, the next token is t40. Now, NT9 can only produce t90, t75, or t91, but the next token is t40. Hmm, that's confusing. Because the first symbol is t90, which comes from NT9, and after that, the next symbol is t40, which is produced by another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar. Actually, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so S produces NT3 followed by NT9. So, the entire string is the concatenation of the strings generated by NT3 and NT9, right? So, the string is the combination of what NT3 generates and what NT9 generates.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case because there might be recursive productions. For example, NT9 can produce t90, but then we might have other productions involved. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is such that S can only generate two parts, NT3 followed by NT9, which might in turn produce other sequences.\n\nWait, but let's look at the first symbol t90. It's from NT9, so the rule must be NT9 \u2192 t90. Then the next symbol needs to be compatible with that. Wait, no, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so after expanding S, it's NT3 followed by NT9. Therefore, the entire string is the concatenation of what NT3 generates and what NT9 generates.\n\nWait, so the string must consist of the sequence generated by NT3, followed by the sequence generated by NT9. Therefore, the string is split into two halves: the first part should be generated by NT3, and the second part by NT9.\n\nWait, that makes sense because S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so after expanding, it's NT3 followed by NT9. So, the entire string is the concatenation of NT3's derived string and NT9's derived string.\n\nTherefore, the string we have is:\n\nt90 t40 t10 t10 t12 t30 t52 t99 t25 t30 t91 t40 t10 t52 t13 t33 t37 t34 t40 t23 t90 t91 t88 t52 t37 t8 t40 t65 t8 t33 t52 t33 t90 t25 t42 t8 t37 t23 t19 t41 t23 t91 t8 t75 t25.\n\nBut if we split this into two parts, then the first part would be everything up to the last NT3 production, and the second part would be the NT9 production. Wait, but in the grammar, NT3 can produce various parts, possibly recursively.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the string into two parts: the first part should be generated by NT3, and the second by NT9.\n\nWait, but looking at the entire string, it starts with t90, which is from NT9. That can't be, because in the S \u2192 NT3 NT9 rule, the S expansion starts with NT3, which would generate the first part of the string, and then NT9 would generate the second part. But the string starts with t90, which would come from NT9, not NT3.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me read the grammar again carefully.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT9. Since it's in CNF, these are the only two options, so the first symbol in the generated string should come from NT3, and the next symbol from NT9. But the string starts with t90, which is produced by NT9.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. It would suggest that the string starts with NT9 instead of NT3. So either the grammar is not correctly structured, or I'm misinterpreting the split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parsing is such that the entire string is generated by NT3 followed by NT9, but that the entire string could have interleaved non-terminals that are expanded further. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are two-symbols, so each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so all the symbols in the string should be terminals, which they are.\n\nHmm, another approach: Each production in the grammar either produces a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, the string is built by replacing non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me try to parse the given string step by step, starting from the start symbol S and expanding it according to the grammar.\n\nGiven the string:\n\nt90 t40 t10 t10 t12 t30 t52 t99 t25 t30 t91 t40 t10 t52 t13 t33 t37 t34 t40 t23 t90 t91 t88 t52 t37 t8 t40 t65 t8 t33 t52 t33 t90 t25 t42 t8 t37 t23 t19 t41 t23 t91 t8 t75 t25.\n\nThe entire string is 45 symbols long. Each reduction step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by 1.\n\nBut wait, in the initial step, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so we have two non-terminals, NT3 and NT9, replacing S. Then each of those can be expanded further.\n\nSo, one way to approach this is to check if there's a path from S through NT3 and NT9 to generate the string.\n\nBut considering the string starts with t90, which would require that the first symbol is produced by NT9, but according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so the first expansion is NT3 followed by NT9.\n\nWait, that suggests that the first symbol in the generated string should come from NT3, but here it's t90, which comes from NT9.

{"custom_id":"request-875","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break down my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It seems extensive with multiple non-terminals and terminals. Each production rule is either of the form A -> BC or A -> a, which aligns with CNF. The start symbol is S, and it seems like each rule eventually resolves into terminals. My goal is to check if the string `t30 t91 t99 t8 t37 t37 t8 t8 t25 t52 t13 t12 t42 t37 t37 t19 t90 t99 t33 t30 t23 t19 t91 t70 t70 t65 t37 t13 t70 t14 t52 t91 t99 t90 t34 t42 t8 t23 t12 t19` can be derived from this grammar.\n\nLet me parse the string first: it's a sequence of terms like t30, t91, etc., meaning each token is a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminal symbols directly. So I need to see if the string can be built by expanding non-terminals step by step according to the grammar rules.\n\nI'll start from the top-level non-terminal, which is S. Looking at the grammar, S can produce NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2 as per the first two rules. Both of these are two symbols, so I'll consider both cases.\n\nFirst, let's consider S -> NT3 NT9.\n\nNT3 can produce NT6 NT2, according to the third rule. So expanding NT3, the string starts with NT6 NT2. Similarly, NT9 can produce NT1 NT5. So the string so far is NT6 NT2 NT1 NT5.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals must expand into other symbols. Let's look at NT6. The grammar for NT6 has multiple production rules. One of them is NT6 -> NT8 NT4. Let me choose that. So NT6 becomes NT8 NT4.\n\nNow, the string is NT8 NT4 NT2 NT1 NT5. Next, NT8 can expand in various ways. Let's pick NT8 -> NT6 NT8. Wait, that's a recursive production, which might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe NT8 can produce t37 or another terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, some of the NT symbols directly produce terminals. Let me check if any of the NT8, NT9, etc., have a rule that ends with a terminal like t37.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT8 has a production rule NT8 -> 't37'. Similarly, NT9 -> 't52', and others. But in the initial steps, I picked S->NT3 NT9, then NT3->NT6 NT2, and NT6->NT8 NT4. So the string so far is NT8 NT4 NT2 NT1 NT5.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should trace the production more carefully.\n\nLet me outline the string's components step by step. The string is a sequence of terminals. Each step in the derivation must replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in CNF leads to two symbols, the length of the string in terms of symbols should match the number of steps taken in the derivation. Wait, the string has 38 tokens. Since S starts with two symbols, each step adds a symbol, doubling the number, but it's more complicated because non-terminals can produce terminals. Maybe it's better to approach this by building the parsing tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. CYK is a dynamic programming algorithm that parses strings according to a given CFG and determines if the string can be derived.\n\nBut since I don't have the full set of production rules, perhaps I can spot-check specific parts of the string to see if they can be derived.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with 't30'. Let's check which non-terminals produce 't30'. Looking at the grammar, NT3 has a production NT3 -> NT6 NT2 and also NT3 -> NT0 NT7 (among others). Wait, in the initial part, I have NT3 -> NT6 NT2, which leads to 't30', but looking at the grammar, maybe NT3 can produce 't30' via a production? Wait, let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nBut that's not NT3. Let me see which NT can produce 't30':\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 has the production NT3 -> NT6 NT2. So if NT6 can produce 't30', then NT3 would generate that. Wait, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any production that directly says NT6 -> 't30'. Instead, NT6 has production NT6->NT8 NT4 and others, including NT6-> 't8'. So 't30' must come from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking back at the expansion where S->NT3 NT9, and NT3->NT6 NT2, then NT6 could produce 't8' (since NT6->'t8' is a rule). So the first part would be something like 't8' followed by the expansion of NT2.\n\nBut the string starts with 't30', not 't8'. So perhaps that initial choice is wrong. Maybe S should produce NT3 NT2 instead of NT3 NT9.\n\nWait, let's try S->NT3 NT2.\n\nThen NT3 can expand to NT6 NT2. So the string is NT6 NT2 NT2.\n\nNT6 can produce 't8', so that would be 't8', then the next part needs to handle NT2 NT2.\n\nHmm, but the string starts with 't30', so that doesn't fit either. Maybe my initial approach is incorrect. Perhaps I should look for the earliest symbol in the string and see if there's a rule that starts with it.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is 't30'. So which non-terminals can produce 't30'? Let me check each production rule to see if any NT starts with 't30'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT6 has NT6->'t8', which is a terminal. But nowhere does an NT directly produce 't30' except in the initial part where NT3 is used. Wait, looking again:\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\n\nWhich means NT3 can't produce 't30' directly. Where does 't30' come from? Looking at the other production rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any production rule that directly yields 't30' as a terminal. That suggests that 't30' must come from the expansion of a non-terminal. But from which non-terminal can 't30' be derived?\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions except the terminals are non-terminals. So the only terminal symbols are those explicitly written as 'tXX'. So if 't30' is a terminal, then there must be a production that directly gives 't30'. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly leads to 't30' as a terminal.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back to the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't30'\n\nIs that correct? Let me search through the rules again.\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT2\n\nand later:\n\nNT3 -> NT0 NT7\n\nand \n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nand \n\nNT0 -> 't13'\n\nSo perhaps there's a way that NT6 can produce 't8' and NT3 can produce NT6 NT2, which would make 't8' followed by whatever NT2 can produce. But in the string, the first part is 't30', so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way that 't30' comes from a different non-terminal. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, is there any production that leads to 't30'? I don't see any production rule that directly outputs 't30'. So that suggests that 't30' must be derived from a non-terminal that eventually leads to it. However, if the grammar doesn't have any non-terminals that can produce 't30', then the string can't be generated. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps 't30' comes from a different non-terminal. Let me think: NT3 can produce NT6 NT2, and if NT6 can produce 't30', then that's possible.

{"custom_id":"request-896","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether this grammar generates the given string. Hmm, okay, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because that makes it easier to analyze. Each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, right?\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the structure of the grammar and see what terminals and non-terminals are involved. The non-terminals here are like S, NT0 to NT9, and various others. The terminals seem to be 't' followed by numbers like t13, t40, etc. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: t13 t40 t23 t40 t12 t91 t34 t34 t19 t33 t37 t90 t65 t41 t90 t25 t52 t37 t42 t33 t34 t91 t40 t41 t33 t40 t52 t13 t37 t19 t52 t30 t99 t90 t70 t52 t25 t33 t88 t33 t23 t37 t22 t40 t22 t40.\n\nMy task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let's recall that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production has two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can eventually derive a terminal string through a series of reductions.\n\nSo, the first thing I might do is look at how S is defined. I see S has two productions: S -> NT3 NT9 and S -> NT3 NT2. So S will eventually generate a sequence of three terminals, because each NT will eventually become terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's quite long, but let's break it down. The length of the string is 40 tokens (since each 't...' is a token). So I need to see if this can be generated by S.\n\nLet's think about the productions. Each NT likely expands into several terminals, perhaps with 't' as the terminals. So, for example, NT9 might expand into t40 or other terminals.\n\nI should try to identify the structure of the string. Perhaps it starts with t13, and since one of the S productions is NT3 NT9, maybe NT3 and NT9 generate certain parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a concatenation of certain terminals that can be generated by the given non-terminals.\n\nLet me look at the given grammar rules again. NT9 can go to 't40' directly, so that's a way to get a 't40' terminal. Similarly, other NTs may generate other terminals.\n\nWait, but each NT is a non-terminal that can produce two NTs or a terminal. So each time we expand an NT, it can produce two more NTs until we reach terminals.\n\nI think I need to build a parse tree for the given string, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe we can work backward, using the productions in reverse and trying to split the string into parts that fit.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each production in the grammar allows replacing a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. So starting from the string, if I can break it down into parts that each match the productions of the non-terminals, that might work. But it's a bit tricky because we're going from left to right, and it's a generating process, not a parsing one.\n\nBut let's think about what each non-terminal expands into.\n\nFor example, NT9 can go to 't40' (among others). In the string, I see several 't40's, so maybe NT9 is a common component.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 can expand to 't52', 't37', etc. There are 't52's and 't37's in the string. So perhaps multiple NT8 productions are used.\n\nWait, let's note the structure of the string: t13 t40 t23 t40 t12 t91 t34 t34 t19 t33 t37 t90 t65 t41 t90 t25 t52 t37 t42 t33 t34 t91 t40 t41 t33 t40 t52 t13 t37 t19 t52 t30 t99 t90 t70 t52 t25 t33 t88 t33 t23 t37 t22 t40 t22 t40.\n\nLooking at this, perhaps it starts with t13, which might come from NT0 or NT3, since NT3 is used in the production S -> NT3 NT9 or S -> NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT3 has production NT3 -> NT6 NT2. NT6 produces NT9 NT2, and NT9 can produce 't40'. So maybe NT3 can eventually produce 't40 t...' something else?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider which non-terminals produce 't13'. Looking up NT0: one of its productions is NT0 -> t13. So if NT0 can generate 't13', then that part is straightforward.\n\nLooking into the middle of the string, I see 't13' again at position 27, so maybe it's using the same NT0 production.\n\nAlso, looking through the grammar, I notice NT2 -> t33, which appears several times. So maybe NT2 is being used to generate those.\n\nSimilarly, 't90' appears several times, perhaps from NT9 or other NTs.\n\nLet me try to look at the structure step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t13. So somewhere in the parse tree, there's an NT0 -> t13.\n\nThen t40 appears next, which could be an NT9 -> t40.\n\nThen t23. Looking at the grammar, NT2 can produce t33, t37, t23, etc. So for example, NT2 -> t33 or t37 or t23.\n\nWait, NT2's productions include NT2 -> t33, which appears in the string at position 10, and t37 at position 19. Then, t23 is at position 3 in the string, so maybe NT2 -> t23 is used there.\n\nHmm. Let me try to see how the string could be built up.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to note that each production in this grammar is binary, so starting from S, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nBut instead of building a full parse tree, perhaps I can check if each terminal in the string is covered by some non-terminal's production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each production can eventually generate a certain sequence of terminals, and see if the entire string can be broken down into such sequences that match the grammar.\n\nBut given the length of the string, this might be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the entire string is covered by S's possible derivations.\n\nWait, S can be derived into NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Let's take each case.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT3 NT9. So we need to generate a string that is the concatenation of the strings generated by NT3 and NT9.\n\nIn the given string, let's check if the first part t13 can come from NT3.\n\nLooking into NT3's productions: NT3 -> NT6 NT2.\n\nSo the string starts with t13 t40 t23... So, the first part must be generated by NT3, which expands into NT6 NT2.\n\nSo, the initial part is 't13', which is 't13' as a terminal, so it comes from NT0 -> t13.\n\nThen, the next terminal is 't40', which is from NT9 -> 't40'.\n\nSo for NT3, after expansion into NT6 and NT2, we get 't13' (from NT0) and then 't40' (from NT9). So that part would require that NT6 and NT2 can generate the correct sequence.\n\nWait, but NT3 expands into NT6 and NT2. So the string after t13 would be t40, so that would come from NT9, but if NT3 is followed by NT9, then perhaps NT6 and NT2 must generate the rest of the string after t13 t40.\n\nBut let's see: the string is 't13 t40 t23 t40...'\n\nWait, maybe S is derived as NT3 -> NT6 NT2, then NT6 and NT2 are combined.\n\nSo for NT6, one of its productions is NT6 -> 't65', but that's not part of the string, so that's not used here. Another production of NT6 is NT6 -> NT0 NT5. So perhaps NT6 expands into NT0 and NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, after t13 t40, the next are t23 t40. So perhaps NT6 -> t23 and NT2 -> t40.

{"custom_id":"request-891","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me parse the string and the grammar to see what they look like. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. The tokens are: t37, t10, t13, t88, t8, t25, t65, t10, t37, t40, t99, t25, t41, t60, t33, t75, t70, t37, t25, t30, t10, t37, t88, t65, t41, t19, t40, t40, t10, t70, t40, t40, t10, t25, t90, t40, t37, t70, t88, t37, t70, t41, t88, t65, t23, t52.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, most of them are non-terminals converting into other non-terminals, but some end with a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, but also individual rules like NT9 \u2192 't75' and NT5 \u2192 't91'. These terminal rules are crucial because the string must match exactly these terminals.\n\nSince the string starts with t37, I need to check if t37 can be derived from the start symbol S. Let's see what rules produce t37. Looking through the grammar, I notice that NT8 and NT6 have rules ending with t37. NT6 \u2192 t8, but NT8 \u2192 t37. So if I can derive t37 from NT8, that's a start.\n\nBut wait, how do we get t37 into the string? Starting from S, which is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. NT3 converts into NT6 NT2, and NT9 converts into 't75'. So the initial step would be S \u2192 NT3 NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT2 't75'. This gives us 't75' at the end. But the string starts with t37, so that seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the initial S can produce a string that includes t37 somewhere in the middle. Let me think about the overall structure. The string is quite long, so it's better to break it down step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see which parts of the string match terminal rules. Let's list the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are: t37, t10, t13, t88, t8, t25, t65, t33, t75, t70, t99, t40, t23, t52, and others. Each non-terminal can expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI notice that:\n- NT9 \u2192 t75\n- NT8 \u2192 t37\n- NT1 \u2192 t40\n- NT5 \u2192 t91\n- NT6 \u2192 t65\n- NT4 \u2192 t88\n- NT3 \u2192 t30\n- NT0 \u2192 t13\n- NT2 \u2192 t33, t70, t23, t52\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n\nSo the terminals in the string are t37, t10, t13, t88, t8, t25, t65, t10, t37, t40, t99, t25, t41, t60, t33, t75, t70, t37, etc.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse from left to right. The string starts with t37, which can be produced by NT8 \u2192 t37. So the first symbol is from NT8.\n\nThen the next token is t10. Let's see what NT8 can expand into. From the grammar, NT8's rules include NT3 NT7 and others, but I don't see a direct rule for NT8 \u2192 t10. Alternatively, maybe NT8 can expand into something that leads to t10.\n\nWait, no, NT8's rules include things like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8. That's a recursive rule. Hmm. I need to find a way to get t10. Looking back, NT8's rules don't produce t10, but looking at other non-terminals, maybe NT0 can produce t10? Wait, NT0 has rules, and one of them is NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3. Hmm. NT1 can produce t40, and NT3 can produce t30. So that gives t40 t30, which doesn't help.\n\nWait, NT2 can produce t33, t70, t23, t52. Does any non-terminal produce t10? Let me check all rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the non-terminals that have terminals as their right-hand side are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t23\nNT6 \u2192 t8\nNT3 \u2192 t30\nNT7 \u2192 t40\nNT5 \u2192 t91\nNT9 \u2192 t75\nNT8 \u2192 t37\nNT1 \u2192 t40\n\nSo the only terminals are these. Therefore, in the given string, every symbol must correspond to one of the non-terminals, except the terminals. Wait, no\u2014if a symbol in the string is a terminal, it has to match exactly one of the rules that produce that terminal.\n\nSo looking at the string:\n\nt37 (from NT8)\nt10 (unknown, but in the string. So no non-terminal can produce t10?\n\nWait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me double-check. I see that some non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, but no rules produce t10. That means any part of the string that is t10 would be invalid because there's no production for t10. Therefore, if the string contains 't10', it must be directly from a rule that produces t10, which doesn't exist. So that would mean the string cannot contain 't10' because it's not part of any production.\n\nWait, that\u2019s a key point. If t10 is in the string but there's no rule that produces t10, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Let me verify that.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal expands directly into t10. So, the string has two instances of t10: the second and ninth symbols. Since there's no production rule for t10, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-914","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) and a string to check against it. My task is to determine if the string can be generated by the grammar. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing, but here I need to see if the string can be derived.\n\nBut wait, the given grammar seems quite extensive with many non-terminals. There are over 50 productions and a lot of terminals. The string to check is \"t90 t34 t30 t37 t88 t37 t37 t40 t34 t19 t37 t40 t70 t14 t37 t14 t37 t40 t37 t65 t99 t12 t90 t22 t30 t40 t13 t40 t70 t10 t60 t37 t8 t13 t37 t65 t23 t37 t37 t40 t33 t19 t90 t34 t41 t13 t52\". That's a long string with 64 tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT3 NT9 and S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So S starts with either NT3 followed by NT9 or NT3 followed by NT2.\n\nWait, but NT3, NT9, NT2 are non-terminals. So I need to expand them all the way down to terminals and see if the string can be built.\n\nEach production in the grammar seems to expand into other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and NT6 can go to NT9 NT2, which might go to terminals.\n\nBut handling all these steps manually is going to be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can trace the string by trying to find a sequence that matches the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first token: t90. In the grammar, which non-terminals produce t90? Let's check the productions:\n\nLooking through all non-terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't30' (Yes)\n- NT9 \u2192 't75', 't90' (Yes, the last line says NT9 \u2192 t90)\nWait, no, the grammar has multiple rules, some are terminals.\n\nWait, I should list all non-terminals that directly map to a terminal. Let me go through each production:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3, NT2 NT2, etc.\nBut looking for where a non-terminal directly becomes a terminal.\n\nLooking further down, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't13' (Yes)\n- NT6 \u2192 't8', 't34', etc. Wait, for example, NT6 \u2192 't8', 't34', 't65', etc. So NT6 can produce 't8', 't34', etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 \u2192 't30' (Yes), NT8 \u2192 't52', 't37', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal has a production that ends with a specific terminal, which could mean that in the string, each step could consume a certain token as a terminal derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with t90. So I need to see if there's a production that gives t90. From the grammar, NT9 has a production to t90: 'NT9 \u2192 t90' and another to t60, t70, etc. So yes, NT9 can produce t90.\n\nSo let's assume the first step is NT9 \u2192 t90.\n\nThen, what comes next in the string after t90 is t34. Since t90 is the result of NT9, the next non-terminal in the derivation would be NT9 again? Or maybe after t90, another non-terminal is being processed.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again: the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. When we expand a non-terminal, it produces a sequence of terminals and other non-terminals. The entire string must be generated by a series of these expansions.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT9: so the string would consist of the expansion of NT3 followed by the expansion of NT9.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT3 NT2: which would be NT3 followed by NT2.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of these expansions.\n\nBut the given string is quite long. Let me try to parse it as a sequence of NT expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT in the grammar can be associated with certain terminals, and the string must consist of these, perhaps in the right order.\n\nBut going through this manually for 64 tokens is tedious. Maybe I can approach it by reverse engineering, starting from the string and trying to reduce it using the grammar rules, but that might be complicated too.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the string can be broken down into segments that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t90, which comes from NT9 \u2192 t90. So the first part of the string is t90. Now, after that, let's see what comes next.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so after NT9 comes NT3.\n\nWait, no, the first production is NT3 followed by either NT9 or NT2, so S would produce NT3 plus NT9 or NT2.\n\nWait, but the first token is t90, which is NT9, so perhaps the first production used is the second one: S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nWait no, if S starts with NT9, that would mean S \u2192 NT3 NT9 is used, but then the second production is NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure this.\n\nLet me think about S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nThen, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nThen, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2.\n\nWait, NT9 can produce t90.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should construct the derivation step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the pattern in the grammar that allows the string to be built.\n\nLooking at the string: t90 t34 t30 t37 t88 t37 t37 t40 t34 t19 t37 t40 t70 t14 t37 t14 t37 t40 t37 t65 t99 t12 t90 t22 t30 t40 t13 t40 t70 t10 t60 t37 t8 t13 t37 t65 t23 t37 t37 t40 t33 t19 t90 t34 t41 t13 t52\n\nIt's a long string, perhaps we can look for patterns. For example, t90 comes from NT9. Then, t34 is a possible terminal from NT3, NT8, etc.\n\nWait, NT3 \u2192 t30 (Yes).\n\nSo t34 might come from NT8 \u2192 t34. Let me check: looking for NT8 productions that result in t34. Yes, the rule NT8 \u2192 't34' exists. So NT8 can produce t34.\n\nSo perhaps the string is structured with NT9 (t90) followed by NT3 (t30) followed by something else.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t90, then t34, then t30. Hmm, so t34 comes after t90, which is from NT9.\n\nSo perhaps NT9 (t90) is followed by NT3 (t30) and then something else, but in the string it's t34 after t90. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe the way the grammar is structured, the NT9 and NT3 are in a certain arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting point is S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Let's see: NT3 would expand to NT6 NT2, then NT6 would expand to other things.\n\nBut honestly, this is getting too tangled. Maybe another approach: the problem says the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which for CFGs implies that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let me confirm that:\n\nMost of the productions are of the form X \u2192 YZ, where Y and Z are non-terminals.\n\nBut the beginning of the grammar has some rules with terminals:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t90, t34, t90, t60, t70, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 \u2192 t52, t37, t65, etc.\n\nSo non-terminals can expand to either other non-terminals or to terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps each step in the string must correspond to a terminal produced by a non-terminal, possibly after expanding other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This helps in parsing because each step in a derivation deals with at most two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems to have a lot of production rules. The start symbol is S, and the first rule is S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So any string generated by this grammar will start with two non-terminals, each of which can expand further.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t52 t42 t33 t91 t70 t37 t65 t19 t37 t12 t37 t30 t8 t10 t52 t14 t88 t91 t52 t40 t10 t65 t41 t23 t42 t23 t30 t41 t37 t34 t90 t13 t70 t41 t23 t33 t13 t25 t42 t40 t23 t91 t34 t14 t37 t75 t10.\n\nFirst, I notice that the first part of the string is 't52 t42', but in the grammar, S starts with NT3 NT9. Let me check the production rules for NT3 and NT9.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n- NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT6 has productions like NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6, NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5, etc.\n- NT1 \u2192 NT4 NT8, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8, etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6, NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the string starting with 't52', which probably represents terminal symbols. The string starts with t52, which must come from a production rule leading to t52. Looking at the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 t52 and NT0 \u2192 t13, as well as others. So perhaps the first part comes from NT8 or some other non-terminal.\n\nWait no, the start symbol is S, which splits into NT3 and NT9. So let's see the paths for NT3 and NT9.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2 (from rule NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2)\nSimilarly, NT6 has many productions. So, let me try to see if 't52' can appear as a result of expanding NT3 or NT9.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT8 \u2192 t52 is a direct production, so NT8 can derive 't52'.\nBut how does NT3 derive to NT8? Let's see:\n\nFrom NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2.\n\nNow, NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6, which is recursive, or NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5.\n\nSo, for example, if NT6 expands as NT4 NT5, then NT4 might expand into something else, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first two terminals are t52 and t42.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so NT3 and NT9 each produce some terminal strings.\n\nBut t52 is a terminal, and if NT3 can produce t52, let's see NT3's production.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules, the first is NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. Now, NT6 might produce something else, but does it have a production that ends with t52? Looking further, I'm not sure NT6 directly leads to t52. The only t's I see are from specific rules. For example, NT8 can produce t52.\n\nSo perhaps the first part, t52, comes from NT8. So let's see which non-terminal produces t52. From the rules, NT8 \u2192 t52 is a direct rule. So that's one possibility.\n\nBut NT3 is expanding into NT6 NT2. So to get t52, NT6 must expand into something that leads to t52, but I don't see that. Alternatively, perhaps NT3 can't produce t52 directly; maybe the first t52 is from NT9?\n\nLooking at NT9's rules: NT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5, and then NT1 can expand into NT4 NT8, etc. I don't immediately see NT9 producing t52 either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the string starts with t52 t42, so let's see if these terminals can come from S's rules.\n\nBut S's first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, which would result in the string starting with NT3's expansion followed by NT9's expansion. So the first symbols would have to be the result of NT3 and NT9 being expanded to terminals.\n\nBut NT3's first rule is NT6 NT2. So to get a terminal like t52, maybe NT6 or NT2 must produce it.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4. So NT6 can become NT8 NT4, and then NT8 might produce t52.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the string starts with 't52 t42', which could be two terminals.\n\nLet me try to see if 't52' comes from NT8, as NT8 \u2192 t52 is a direct rule. So for that, let's see if NT8 can be in the expansion.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t52 t42, so t52 is the first terminal, then t42. How could that work?\n\nLooking again, the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT9. So the first part of the string is NT3's expansion, then NT9's.\n\nIf I can find that NT3 can produce a production that leads to t52 as the first terminal, then it's possible.\n\nLooking at NT3, its first production is NT6 NT2. So, unless NT6 or NT2 directly produce t52, that's not the case. Let me check NT6 and NT2's rules for direct terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT6: \nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT6 (this is recursive, not helpful for terminals)\nNT6 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4 (this is a direct production where NT8 can produce t52)\n\nSo if NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, then NT8 can produce t52, so the result of that rule would contribute a 't52' terminal. But wait, the rule for NT6 is NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, which would mean when NT6 is expanded, it produces the symbols NT8 and NT4. Since these are non-terminals, this would continue expanding until it reaches terminals.\n\nWait, no, in a string like NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, and then NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT4, and then NT8 \u2192 t52, and NT4 \u2192 ... perhaps?\n\nBut let me think differently. Let's see if the string can start with t52 t42.\n\nLooking at the string: t52 is first, then t42. If the string starts with t52, which is a production from NT8, then maybe the starting symbol must have one of its productions starting with NT8.\n\nBut the starting symbol is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, so S's production starts with NT3 and NT9. So the string should start with NT3's expansion followed by NT9's expansion.\n\nThis suggests that the first symbol in the string should be the first symbol produced by NT3, and the second symbol should be the first symbol produced by NT9. Alternatively, the entire NT3 expansion might result in multiple terminals before the NT9 expansion starts.\n\nWait, but if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then the entire string generated is the concatenation of what NT3 expands to and what NT9 expands to. So if the string starts with t52 t42, that implies that either:\n\n1. NT3 expands directly to 't52 t42', but looking at NT3's rules, the first thing it produces is NT6 NT2, which would require expanding those further. But 't52' is likely a terminal derived from a deeper production, not from NT3 directly.\n\n2. Alternatively, perhaps NT3 could expand to a series of symbols that, when fully expanded, includes 't52' as the first terminal, followed by 't42'.\n\nBut given that NT3's first production is NT6 NT2, and NT6 can produce NT8 NT4, which can produce terminal symbols, perhaps the expansion starts with t52 from NT8.\n\nWait, but S's first rule is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, producing NT3 followed by NT9. So the initial string starts with whatever NT3 expands to, followed by whatever NT9 expands to. So the first symbol would be the first terminal of NT3's expansion, then"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-934","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what's going on here. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see it's defined with a series of non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) and all the production rules. Some of these non-terminals are terminals because in CNF, the right-hand side can only have terminals if it's a single terminal symbol. I notice that many rules end with t followed by numbers, like t90, t88, etc. So, these are terminals.\n\nThe input string is a sequence of these terminals and non-terminals. The string is: `t90 t90 t40 t33 t10 t37 t91 t65 t37 t88 t90 t88 t91 t10 t70 t40 t70 t60 t10 t70 t19 t40 t65 t23 t37 t12 t37 t37 t8 t37 t99 t99 t19 t40 t99 t37 t33 t42 t19 t88 t13 t70 t33 t10 t70 t42 t13 t37`.\n\nFirst, I'm going to try to parse this string step by step using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use recursive descent parsing or look for the top-down approach. But maybe a better approach here is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's defined as:\nS \u2192 NT3 NT9\nS \u2192 NT3 NT2\n\nSo S can produce two different sequences. Both start with NT3 followed by either NT9 or NT2. So, the string starts with t90, which is a terminal. Let me check the productions for NT3 and NT9.\n\nLooking at NT3:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nand other rules, but most importantly, NT3 seems to have two different paths that lead back to each other. Maybe it's forming a cycle.\n\nWait, let me track back. The first symbol is t90. Let me see what NT3 produces. From the grammar, NT3 can go to NT6 NT2, and NT6 can go to NT9 NT2, and NT9 can go to NT3 NT7, which leads to NT6 again. This seems like it could form a loop, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, the first part is t90 t90 t40 t33 t10... Let me see how t90 can be derived. Looking at the grammar, some terminals are directly from non-terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 t52, NT9 \u2192 t75, etc.\n\nWait, in the string, the first element is t90. So I need to find a production rule that directly gives t90. Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a rule where A \u2192 t90. Most of the terminals are from specific non-terminals, like NT2 \u2192 t33, NT3 \u2192 t30, etc. So, t90 must come from a non-terminal that eventually produces t90.\n\nLooking at NT9, I see that NT9 has several production rules. One of them is NT9 \u2192 t75. Another is NT9 \u2192 t60. But there's no rule for NT9 \u2192 t90, so how does t90 get produced? Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check.\n\nAh, perhaps the non-terminals can derive to other non-terminals which eventually derive to terminal t90. So, I need to find a chain of productions leading to t90.\n\nWait, let's look at NT3. NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. NT6 can go to NT9 NT2. NT9 can go to NT3 NT7, which goes back to NT6, but maybe there's a path from NT6 to other non-terminals that can produce t90.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will have a binary structure. Each production except the terminals is a binary tree. So, the string must be a sequence that can be broken down into these binary structures.\n\nLet me think about how t90 can be produced. T90 is a terminal, so it must come from a non-terminal that can produce t90. Looking through all the non-terminals, I don't see a direct rule, but perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT9 has:\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT1\nAnd others. None directly give t90. Hmm. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps t90 is derived from a non-terminal that eventually leads to t90 via some chain.\n\nLooking at NT8: NT8 \u2192 t52, t37, t65, etc. But no t90.\n\nLooking at NT3: productions are NT6 NT2, and others like NT0 NT7, etc. NT6 can produce NT9 NT2. NT9 can produce NT3 NT7, which goes back to NT6 again. This seems cyclical and perhaps doesn't directly produce t90.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a path elsewhere. Let's check NT9's productions. There's NT9 \u2192 t75, t60, but no t90. Another possibility is NT2 can produce t33 and so on, but not t90.\n\nWait, maybe t90 comes from NT3 via a longer chain. Let's see: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2. NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7. NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4. NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT8. NT2 \u2192 t33 or other terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t90 is derived through NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7, and NT0 has some rules that can produce terminals.\n\nWait, NT3's rules:\nNT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7\nSo t90 must come from either of these paths.\n\nLet's take the first path: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2. NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT2. NT9 \u2192 NT3 NT7. This seems to loop back to NT3 and NT7.\n\nAlternatively, the second path: NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT7. NT0 can go to NT1 NT3, or NT2 NT2, etc. Let's see if NT0 can produce t90. NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3. NT1 can go to NT4 NT8 or NT12, etc.\n\nWait, but this might not be leading us to t90. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a production rule that directly or indirectly leads to t90.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps t90 comes from another non-terminal that I haven't considered directly. Let me check all non-terminals for t90.\n\nLooking at all non-terminals, I see NT9 has t75, NT8 has t52, and so on. None have t90. So perhaps t90 is derived from a non-terminal that eventually leads to it, but perhaps it's a complex chain.\n\nWait, maybe t90 can be derived from NT3, which goes to NT0 NT7. Let's see if NT0 can produce a sequence that includes t90. Hmm, NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3, and NT1 can go to NT4 NT8 or other. This might not directly give t90.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t90 is part of a longer chain. Let me try to see if any of the non-terminals can derive to t90.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me take a step-by-step approach. The string starts with t90, so I need to find a production that starts with t90. Since all terminal symbols are leaves in the parse tree, let's see if t90 is the leftmost symbol in the string.\n\nYes, the string starts with t90, so the first symbol must be derived from a rule that has t90 on the right-hand side.\n\nBut looking at all the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that produces t90. All t90 must be terminal symbols. So unless a non-terminal can produce t90, it cannot be part of the string.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. If the grammar includes a rule where a non-terminal can produce a terminal, like A \u2192 t90, then that non-terminal can generate t90. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any such rules. All the rules either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal, but only specific terminals.\n\nWait no, in CNF, rules can have two terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-947","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because that tells me that each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the base cases, which produce terminal symbols. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t90 t90 t30 t52 t88 t34 t8 t40 t40 t88 t37 t37 t40 t37 t14 t10 t52 t52 t88 t99 t70 t60 t65 t30 t65 t37 t23 t88 t40 t52 t8 t37 t65 t65 t40 t10 t37 t12 t40 t70 t37 t13 t33 t37 t42 t52 t65 t41 t88`.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and the first production rule is S -> NT3 NT9. So, the string must start with the symbols derived from NT3 and NT9. Looking at the string, the first element is t90, which corresponds to NT9 because the production NT9 -> 't90' is explicit. So, the first symbol is correct.\n\nNow, after NT9, the next symbol comes from NT3. Looking at the production rules for NT3, I see NT3 -> NT6 NT2 and NT3 -> NT0 NT7. So, the next part of the string should start with either the symbols from NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. \n\nLooking at the string, after t90, the next symbol is t90 again. Wait, that's the same as NT9. But according to the grammar, NT9 is a terminal symbol, not a non-terminal. So, after the initial S, which produces NT3 NT9, the first symbol after t90 should come from NT3's production. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the order. Let me clarify: The string starts with t90, which is the terminal from NT9. Then the next symbol is t90 again, which would be the NT9 again. But in the grammar, S starts with NT3 NT9, so the first two symbols should be the expansion of NT3 followed by NT9. So, after the first t90, the next symbols should come from NT3's expansion. \n\nWait, no. Since S produces NT3 NT9, the first production is two symbols: first NT3, then NT9. So, the first symbol is NT9, which is 't90', correct. Then the next symbol is t90 again, which would likely be another NT9, but in the grammar, NT9's production includes 't25', 't37', etc., but not 't90'). Wait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT9 has 't90' as one of its terminals. So, nt9 can produce t90. So, the first part is t90 (NT9) and the next symbol is also t90, which would imply that after the initial NT9, there's another NT9. But since S only produces NT3 followed by NT9, the next symbols after the initial NT9 should come from NT3's expansion. \n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string step by step, considering each production. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. My job is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar starting from S. \n\nLet's list the string: t90, t90, t30, t52, t88, t34, t8, t40, t40, t88, t37, t37, t40, t37, t14, t10, t52, t52, t88, t99, t70, t60, t65, t30, t65, t37, t23, t88, t40, t52, t8, t37, t65, t65, t40, t10, t37, t12, t40, t70, t37, t13, t33, t37, t42, t52, t65, t41, t88.\n\nFirst, the initial symbol is t90, which is the production for NT9 (as per the rules: NT9 -> 't90'). So, after S, we have NT3 NT9. So, the first two elements should be [t90, ...] but actually, NT9 is the second symbol. Wait, no, S -> NT3 NT9, so the initial expansion is NT3 followed by NT9, which produces two symbols in the string. \n\nWait, the string starts with t90, so that must be the first symbol from NT9. Then, the next symbol would be from NT3. So the second symbol is t90 as well, which would require that during the expansion of NT9, another t90 is produced. But that seems redundant. Perhaps the actual process is that NT9 can produce t90, but maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model this as a parse tree. Starting from S, which splits into NT3 and NT9. The NT9 part can generate t90, so the first symbol is t90. Then, the NT3 part must generate a sequence that starts with the remaining symbols in the string.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of 43 symbols. Let's count: 1. t90, 2. t90, 3. t30, up to 43. So, starting with t90 (from NT9), then the next part is NT3, followed by NT9 again. Wait, that can't be right because NT9 can't produce two t90s unless the NT9 is split into more symbols, but according to the grammar, NT9 is a terminal symbol, right? Looking at the production rules, I see NT9 can go directly to 't90', and other NTs go to combinations of NTs and\/or terminals. So, NT9 is a single terminal, 't90'.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, some of the non-terminals do produce terminals. So, for example, NT9 -> t90. So, that means when NT9 is used, it can directly produce t90.\n\nSo, stepping back, the start is S, which becomes NT3 followed by NT9. The first symbol is t90 from NT9. Then, the next symbol is t90 again, which must come from NT3. So, in NT3's production, one of the options is NT6 NT2, and another is NT0 NT7.\n\nLooking at the NT3 production: NT3 can produce NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7. Since after the initial t90, the next symbol is t90 (which is from NT9), but wait, that's the second symbol. So, NT3 and NT9 produce two symbols: NT3 produces a sequence of symbols that will be the first part of the string beyond the initial t90.\n\nWait, no. The entire string is a single sequence of symbols starting with t90, which must come from NT9. Then, the next part, the first symbol being t90, must be from NT3's expansion.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up the order. The start symbol is S, which is NT3 followed by NT9. So, in the parse, the first two symbols would be the expansion of NT3 and NT9. But in the string, the first symbol is t90, which would be the NT9's t90. The second symbol would then be the first symbol of the NT3 expansion.\n\nWait, that would make sense. So, the string starts with t90 (NT9) and then is followed by the expansion of NT3. Let me check: the string is t90, t90, t30, t52... etc. So, the first symbol is t90 (NT9). The next symbol is t90, which would be the first symbol from the expansion of NT3. So, in the grammar, NT3 can produce NT6 NT2 or NT0 NT7.\n\nLooking at NT6, it can produce NT4 NT5 or NT3 NT6. Wait, NT6 has production NT6 -> NT4 NT5, NT6 -> NT3 NT6, NT6 could produce a string of NT4 and NT5. NT3 could then produce NT6 or NT0, which has its own expansions.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that each symbol in the string must be matched by either a terminal or the result of a production. Since the NTs are non-terminals, I might need to find a way to derive the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if all the terminals in the string match the terminals allowed by the grammar."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, first, let me see. The grammar is in CNF, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make parsing easier.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it only has productions to NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Wait, actually, no. Wait, in the grammar, S can produce NT3 followed by NT9 or NT3 followed by NT2? Wait, actually, looking again, it's S -> NT3 NT9 or S -> NT3 NT2. Okay, so S produces two non-terminals: either NT3 and NT9 or NT3 and NT2.\n\nWait, but in the string provided, the first symbol is t30, so I need to see which non-terminals can produce t30. Let me scan through the productions for each non-terminal to see if they can derive terminal symbols.\n\nFor example, NT0 has productions like NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3, NT2 NT2, etc. Looking at the string, I see t30 early on. Checking NT0, I see NT0 \u2192 t13, because one of its productions is NT0 -> 't13'. So NT0 can directly produce 't13'. But in the string, the third token is t33, so maybe I need to find a path from NT3 or NT2 to t33.\n\nWait, the string starts with t30. So the first step must be that the start symbol produces something that can derive t30. So S produces either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2. Wait, no, the productions are S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. So the string starts with t30, which must come from NT3 or NT9 or another non-terminal that can produce t30.\n\nLooking at NT3, one of its productions is NT3 \u2192 t30. Yes, because NT3 \u2192 't30' is listed. So if NT3 can produce 't30', then that's possible. So the first token t30 must come from NT3.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2. Since the first token is t30, perhaps S \u2192 NT3 NT3, or maybe another option.\n\nWait, no, S's production is either NT3 followed by NT9 or NT3 followed by NT2. But in the first token of the string, it's t30. So let me see: if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then the first two symbols would be whatever NT3 and NT9 can produce.\n\nBut NT3 can produce t30 directly, so perhaps the first part is t30, and NT9 can produce something else. Alternatively, if S \u2192 NT3 NT2, then the first part is t30 and then NT2 can produce something.\n\nWait, but in the string, the next token after t30 is t19. So if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then the second token comes from NT9. So NT9 needs to produce t19.\n\nLooking at NT9, let's see what it can produce. From the productions, NT9 can produce t37 or t75 or t60 or t22 or t14 etc. Wait, looking at the NT9 entries, I see NT9 \u2192 t75, which is also in the string later. Also, NT9 \u2192 't60' and so on.\n\nWait, but I don't see NT9 \u2192 t19. Hmm, does any of the NT9 productions lead to t19? Let me check: Looking at the production list, I see NT9's productions include \u2192 't75', \u2192 't60', \u2192 't37', etc. But nowhere does it directly produce t19. Did I miss any? Wait, maybe indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT3 NT2, meaning NT3 \u2192 t30, and NT2 \u2192 t19. Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT2: From the productions, NT2 can produce t33, or t25, or t37, or t89, etc. Wait, no, looking at NT2's productions, one of them is \u2192 't33' (i.e., NT2 \u2192 't33'). So if S \u2192 NT3 NT2, then NT3 \u2192 t30, and NT2 \u2192 t19? But in the given string, the second token after t30 is t19. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the string structure. The string is t30 t19 t33 t52 t99 t40... etc. So it's a sequence of tokens. So the first symbol is t30, the second is t19, third is t33, etc.\n\nWait, if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then the first token would be whatever NT3 produces, maybe t30, and the second token would be NT9's production. But looking at the second token in the string, it's t19. So does NT9 produce t19? Looking through the NT9 production list, I don't see a production for NT9 \u2192 t19.\n\nWait, but maybe NT9 can produce a non-terminal that can produce t19. Let's see. For example, from the grammar, production NT9 \u2192 't99', which is NT9 \u2192 t99, and NT9 also has other productions. But t99 isn't directly 't19'.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I need to find the derivation sequence that matches the string.\n\nLet me try to see for each part.\n\nThe string starts with t30, t19, t33, t52, etc.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions: NT3 \u2192 t30. So that's direct. So the first token t30 comes from NT3.\n\nNext, after t30, we have t19. So if S \u2192 NT3 NT9, then the second token would come from NT9. But looking at NT9's productions, I don't see a production that leads to t19. Alternatively, if the second part comes from NT2, but let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt30, t19, t33, t52, t99, t40, t99, t52, t8, t88, t12, t33, t37, t91, t88, t91, t40, t23, t37, t42, t37, t34, t75, t37, t19, t23, t52, t19, t40, t19, t90, t23, t40, t88, t37, t12, t99, t33, t41, t14, t25, t91, t25, t33, t40, t25, t40, t52, t75, t37, t19, t23, t52, t19, t40, t19, t90, t23, t40, t88, t37, t12, t99, t33, t41, t14, t25, t91, t25, t33, t40, t25, t40, t52, t75.\n\nHuge string. Let's see.\n\nFirst part: t30.\n\nWe'll think of S \u2192 NT3 NT2 (since S \u2192 NT3 NT9 would have to go through NT9, which I don't see producing t19 directly, but maybe that's a longer path).\n\nWait, S can be either NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nSo let's choose S \u2192 NT3 NT2, then NT3 produces t30, and the second token is t19, so NT2 must produce t19.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions: Does it have NT2 \u2192 t19? Looking at the NT2 productions in the grammar, I don't see a production where NT2 directly produces t19. But NT2 could produce a non-terminal chain that eventually produces t19.\n\nLooking at NT2:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t33\n- NT2 \u2192 t25\n- NT2 \u2192 t37\n- NT2 \u2192 t89 (wait, is that t89? The grammar list shows NT2 \u2192 't37', 't33', 't77'?)\n\nWait, let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't33' is yes. But looking at the NT2 productions, I don't see any leading to t19. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT9: the first part is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-969","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure to understand how the non-terminals (S, NT0, NT1, etc.) are defined. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals (or terminals?) and a is a terminal. Wait, actually in CNF, for context-free grammars in standard form, all productions are left-hand sides being a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the terminal symbols are directly provided as the string 't' followed by numbers, like 't90', 't13', etc.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of these terminal symbols. So each symbol in the string must be derived by the grammar.\n\nThe approach I should take is to parse the string according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser with a stack-based approach might work, but perhaps a simpler way is to construct a parse tree step by step, ensuring that each token in the string can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a context-free grammar with each production having either two non-terminals or a terminal, perhaps the best way is to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nLet me list the productions again to see the structure:\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT9 or S \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nNow, looking at NT9, it has several rules, and in the string, the first token is 't90', which is derived from NT9. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, NT9 is assigned to the terminals 't75', 't60', 't99', 't22', 't52', etc. Wait no, actually, looking back, the grammar has a bunch of rules where each NTx eventually is assigned to specific 't' symbols. For example, I see that NT9 \u2192 't90', 't60', 't99', 't22', 't52', etc., which means some of them are terminals, while others might be non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, each production is for a non-terminal to expand into other non-terminals or terminals. So some of these NTx may be terminals if they only have one production that maps to a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, each production is in the form of NTx \u2192 something, and each 'something' is a sequence of NTy and\/or terminals. So the right-hand side can have both non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. However, in the given grammar, some rules have more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Wait, looking at the rules, I see that some NTs have productions like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8, which is two non-terminals, or NT0 \u2192 NT1 NT3, etc. So the grammar is actually a bit more complex. Wait, no, because each production only has two parts on the right. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT2, which is two non-terminals. But I also see NT8 \u2192 't52', which is a terminal. So in that case, NT8 can produce a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nAh, so some of the non-terminals can produce a single terminal (like NT8 \u2192 't52') while others produce two non-terminals (like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8). That makes the grammar more complex than straight CNF, but perhaps it's still context-free.\n\nSo the plan is to parse the string starting from S, trying to see if the entire string can be matched by the grammar.\n\nI'll start by trying to split the string into segments that match the grammar's terminals. Let's write down the string:\n\nt90 t30 t99 t60 t13 t37 t37 t10 t34 t99 t22 t52 t25 t37 t42 t10 t37 t40 t37 t65 t12 t25 t37 t99 t99 t91 t37 t90 t8 t88 t30 t12 t91 t52 t99 t37 t88 t88 t34 t23 t70 t13 t25 t23 t99 t90 t19 t33 t12 t37.\n\nNow, let's see the first symbol, t90. Looking at NT9, the RHS includes t90 in one of its productions. So NT9 \u2192 t90, which would match the first symbol. But wait, in the grammar, NT9 has multiple rules, one of which is NT9 \u2192 t90. Alternatively, can we have a more complex derivation for the first symbol? Maybe. But perhaps starting with the largest possible match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to find a way to build a parse tree, perhaps starting from S and trying to expand it.\n\nGiven the string is quite long, it's going to be tedious, but I'll proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT3 NT9 or NT3 NT2.\n\nBut since the first symbol is t90, and from NT9, we can get t90, but also from other possibilities. Alternatively, NT9 could be part of a larger production.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to represent the string as a list and parse it top-down, using the grammar as a set of possible rules. Each step, try to match the next part of the string with the grammar's rules.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can look for the occurrence of NT9 \u2192 t90. So the first token could be derived as NT9 \u2192 t90. Then, moving to the next part of the string from S's production.\n\nBut wait, S can only produce NT3 and another NT or terminal. So for S \u2192 NT3 NT9, the first token could come from NT3, which has several productions, and the second token would come from NT9.\n\nWait, but looking at NT9's productions, it has a production where NT9 \u2192 t90, but perhaps more complex ones as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a path where S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT9.\n\nNow, NT3 can produce t90, which matches the first token. So we take S \u2192 (t90) (NT9). Wait, but NT9 after that must match the remaining string. So after t90, the string starts with the second token, t30.\n\nSo we have t90 t30 t99 ... etc.\n\nBut wait, S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and NT3 \u2192 t90, so after S -> nt3 nt9, we have NT9 producing t90 as well. But after that, the next few tokens should come from NT9's RHS.\n\nWait, perhaps this is too vague. Maybe I need a better approach.\n\nAnother way is to think of the string as being generated by starting from S and expanding non-terminals step by step, but this requires knowing which non-terminals can derive which parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this with a parser that uses lookaheads or something similar, but that's complex.\n\nLet me see if I can find parts of the string that correspond to the grammar.\n\nLooking for 't90' \u2192 NT9 can generate it. So looking at the string, the 1st, 7th, 19th, etc., tokens all might be derived from NT9. Let's see.\n\nt90 is at the start, then t30, t99, t60, t13, t37, t37, t10, t34, t99, t22, t52, t25, t37, t42, t10, t37, t40, t37, t65, t12, t25, t37, t99, t99, t91, t37, t90, t8, t88, t30, t12, t91, t52, t99, t37, t88, t88, t34, t23, t70, t13, t25, t23, t99, t90, t19, t33, t12, t37.\n\nAnother way: Let's try to find the structure. The string starts with t90, which could come from NT9. Then, what about after that?\n\nIf the first part is S \u2192 NT3 NT9, and NT3 generates t90, then after that, the remaining string must come from NT9.\n\nSo after t90, we have t30, which might be generated by NT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each non-terminal (like S, NT3, NT8, etc.) can produce two non-terminals or a terminal symbol.\n\nI see a lot of non-terminals, so it might be helpful to map them out. Also, some of the non-terminals map directly to terminals like 't22', 't30', etc. Those are the leaf nodes.\n\nMy goal is to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, I can parse it using a method similar to the CYK algorithm. But since the structure is complex, maybe breaking it down step by step would help.\n\nFirst, I should note that the start symbol is S, which produces NT3 and NT9. So any valid string must start with either NT3 or NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't22'. So let's see if 't22' can be the start. The start symbol S produces either NT3 or NT9. But looking at the productions, for example, NT9 can produce 't75' (according to the given rules). But our string starts with 't22', which is not matching directly.\n\nWait, no, 't22' is a terminal that comes from which production? Looking through the rules, I see NT9 can produce 't75', NT2 can produce 't33', but 't22' is not directly in the initial productions. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the production rules provided, I see:\n\nNT2 -> NT9 (multiple times). So perhaps NT2 can eventually derive 't22'. Looking further down, NT2 has several productions, such as NT2 -> NT6, NT8, etc. Then NT6 can produce 't8' and 't34', which might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't22' is derived through a longer path. For instance, NT7 can produce NT9, and NT9 can produce 't75' or other things. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the structure of the string. The string is a sequence of terminals, which must be generated by the grammar. Since S starts with NT3 or NT9, and each step branches into two symbols, the string must be a parse tree where each node has two children until it reaches the terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is quite large, parsing manually might be time-consuming. But perhaps I can look for the top-down approach.\n\nLet me see, the string starts with 't22'. So perhaps the entire string is derived from NT2 or another non-terminal that can produce a series of terminals leading to 't22'. Let's check the production for NT2. One of the rules is NT2 -> NT9, which can derive 't75' or similar terminals. Wait, but 't75' is 't75', which is a terminal, so in the string, we have 't75' towards the end. So maybe the string starts with another part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at the string length might help. The string has 60 tokens. Since each production in CNF produces exactly two symbols, the parse tree would have a structure that corresponds to a full binary tree with 60 leaves. Wait, but 60 is not a power of 2 plus 1, so that complicates things. However, CNF allows S to produce directly two symbols, so each step can be seen as splitting into two, and so the parse tree would have a certain depth.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the key is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking for 't37' multiple times. NT8 and NT0 have productions that lead to 't37'. Similarly, other terminals like 't30', 't40', etc., appear as terminals from NT3, NT4, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can try to find a path for a segment of the string and see if it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since this is time-consuming, maybe I can check for the presence of terminals in the right order.\n\nWait, let me see if 't22' can be derived from any non-terminal. Looking at the production rules, for example, NT2 has several productions. Let's see if any of these can lead to 't22'.\n\nLooking through NT2's productions:\n\nNT2 -> NT6, NT8\nNT2 -> NT5, NT6\nNT2 -> NT3, NT1\nNT2 -> NT8, NT9\nNT2 -> NT7, NT8\nNT2 -> NT4, NT8\nNT2 -> NT9, NT9\nNT2 -> NT7, NT9\nNT2 -> NT8, NT9\n\nHmm, none directly produce 't22'. Wait, but perhaps through multiple steps. For example, NT2 could produce NT3 and NT1. Then, NT3 can produce, say, 't30' and some other NT, and NT1 can produce, say, 't40' and another NT.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions: NT3 can produce NT6, NT2, or NT0, etc. And NT6 produces 't8' or 't34', which might not be helpful for 't22'.\n\nAlternatively, NT1 can produce several NTs, including NT2, which could eventually lead to 't22' through NT2's paths.\n\nBut this manual approach is too time-consuming. Maybe I can look for the string's structure. For example, the beginning is 't22 t30 t40 t40 t88 t23 t37 t40 t12 t25 t70 t91 t23 t42 t33 t19 t22 t52 t37 ...'. \n\nLet me check if these terminals correspond to any possible combinations of NT productions.\n\nFor example:\n\nt22 could come from NT2 (if NT2 -> NT2 is wrong, wait NT2's production is mostly two NTs).\n\nAlternatively, let me think if the entire string can be represented as a parse tree starting from S.\n\nWait, but without knowing the entire parsing process, it's hard to be precise. Maybe a better approach is to check the presence of each terminal and see if the grammar can produce it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts where each part matches a production.\n\nBut since this is lengthy, perhaps I can instead look for contradictions or see if the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, for example, the string contains 't22' twice in a row towards the end. Does the grammar allow for consecutive 't22's? Let's see if NT2 can produce 't22'. Looking at the rules, 't22' is not a terminal in any of the initial productions, except through some non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps 't22' comes from NT2. Looking at NT2's productions, they all either produce NTs or some terminals. Wait, earlier I thought that NT2 can produce NT9 which can produce 't75', but I don't see 't22' in there. However, looking again, I see a production: NT6 -> 't8' and 't34', but 't8' is a terminal, and 't34' is another.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a direct production for 't22'. Let me check all the rules again. Hmm, in the list, 't8' is a production for NT6 under some rules, but not for 't22' directly. So I don't think 't22' is a terminal in the grammar, which contradicts the string because the string contains 't22'. Therefore, maybe the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Or maybe I misread the rules. Let me check again: looking at all the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes 't22'. So 't22' is a terminal, but the grammar doesn't have a rule where a non-terminal produces 't22'. So the only way to get 't22' is through a non-terminal that can produce it indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't22' is produced by a non-terminal. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal producing 't22' directly. Therefore, to have 't22"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
