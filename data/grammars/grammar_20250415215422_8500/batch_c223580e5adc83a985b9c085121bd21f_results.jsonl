{"custom_id":"request-0","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the string \"t48\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, I notice that most productions on the right-hand side are two non-terminals, except those that directly expand to terminals like NT54 \u2192 't12', NT8 \u2192 't32', etc. So, the terminals are the actual 't' followed by a number, and non-terminals are combinations like NT followed by numbers.\n\nSince the goal is to derive the string \"t48\", I need to see if there's a sequence of productions in the grammar that results in just \"t48\". Let me scan the grammar for any production that directly gives me 't48'. From the given rules, I see:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't96' and NT48 \u2192 't86' \n\nWait, but in the list, I don't see a production where NT48 directly expands to 't48'. Instead, NT48 seems to produce either 't96' or 't86'. So, that's a problem because if I can't get 't48' directly from NT48, I might look for longer sequences.\n\nBut then I look again and notice that some non-terminals might produce 't48' indirectly. Let me check if there's a production that leads to 't48'. Wait, another approach is to look for any NT that can produce a terminal, and then see if that can be combined in a way that leads to 't48'. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a non-terminal that can produce 't48' through multiple steps. For example, if there's a production where NT produces another non-terminal that eventually leads to 't48', but I need to track the steps.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Looking through the list:\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT48 -> NT96 \u2192 which then, looking at NT96:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT48 \u2192 't96'\n\nWait, that seems like a loop. Also, NT48 doesn't lead to 't48'; instead, it goes to 't96' or 't86'. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find a production where 't48' is one of the terminals in the expansion. Let me check all productions to see if any have 't48' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n- NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n- NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54\n- NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98\n- NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1\n- NT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95\n- NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\n- NT59 \u2192 NT56 NT53\n- NT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23\n- NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\n- NT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95\n- NT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86\n- NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86 (Wait, I see this production twice with different expansions)\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- Wait, no, I'm looking for 't48'. Let me scan all productions again:\n\nAh, wait, here's NT96 \u2192 't48' and NT98 \u2192 't48':\n\nNT96 \u2192 't48' via NT96 \u2192 NT48 \u2192 't48'\n\nWait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT48\n\nBut earlier, I thought NT48 doesn't produce 't48', but actually, if there's a production where NT96 \u2192 't48', that's where I need to check.\n\nWait, no, from NT96, the production is \u2192 NT48, but NT48's productions are:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't96' or 't86', as per the rules. So NT96 cannot directly produce 't48'; instead, it goes through NT48, which goes to another terminal, which is 't96' or 't86'. So that's a dead end.\n\nWait, but looking again, I realize that perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions for NT96 again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there's:\n\nNT96 -> 't48'\n\nYes! Here it is:\n\nLooking at the list, I see under NT96:\n\nNT96 -> 't48'\n\nAh, no, wait, I don't see that. Let me recheck:\n\nThe user provided the grammar, and I need to find all the NT96 and NT48 productions. Let me list the relevant ones:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT48 (since earlier, in the list, under NT96: NT96 \u2192 NT48. And NT48 has NT48 \u2192 't96' and 't86'). Wait, no, in the provided grammar, for NT96, it's:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT48 \u2192 't48'\n\nWait, the grammar has NT96 \u2192 't48'? Or is it NT96 \u2192 NT48?\n\nLooking back, in the productions provided:\n\nI see under NT96:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT48\n\nAnd under NT48:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't86'\n\nSo NT96 is NT48, which then becomes 't96' or 't86'.\n\nBut in the same list, under NT95 (for example), I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't41'\n\nBut looking at NT96: It's only \u2192 NT48. So NT96 cannot produce 't48' directly. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but looking again, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, the user provided the following grammar entries:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT48\n- NT98 \u2192 NT48\n\nSo, NT96 and NT98 both expand to NT48. But NT48's rules lead to 't96' and 't86', not 't48'.\n\nSo how can I get 't48'? Unless there's a rule that directly produces 't48' from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me scan again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96' and 't86'\nWait, in the list under NT48, it's:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't96'\nNT48 \u2192 't86'\n\nBut I don't see a production where NT48 \u2192 't48', so that's not possible.\n\nThen, where else could 't48' come from? Maybe another non-terminal that can lead to 't48' in a longer chain.\n\nLet me see if any non-terminal can produce 't48' via longer productions.\n\nLooking at NT36, for example, but I don't see it in the list. Alternatively, look for a production where a non-terminal leads to a chain that eventually can produce 't48'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't48' is an intermediate step along a longer production.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the grammar is presented.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and other S rules.\n\nThen, all the other productions are from various NTn terminals.\n\nBut in the user's grammar, for example:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23\n\nAnd NT28 \u2192 't36'\n\nHTHINKING: Okay, maybe 't48' is a part of a longer production that generates it as an intermediate step. But since all the productions for NTn either result in a terminal or another non-terminal, but none of them seem to produce 't48', unless a longer sequence can generate it. But since the grammar is in CNF, I think that every production is two non-terminals or single terminals. So to get 't48', it would have to be directly by a rule, but none of the rules in the grammar have that.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe a sequence of productions that leads from S down to 't48'.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, NT7 and NT23. Then, NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT16? Wait, looking at the list under NT7:\n\nYes, under NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT16.\n\nAnd NT66 \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-1","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string 't87' to determine whether it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production in this grammar is either replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or replacing it with a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and it has two productions: S \u2192 NT7NT23 and S \u2192 NT97NT54. That means the string we're checking, 't87', has to be derived starting from S, so one of these two paths.\n\nLet me look at the terminal symbols. The only terminal we see in the string is 't87', which is a single terminal symbol, so it should be a result of a direct production from a non-terminal to a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check all the productions to see which nt can produce 't87'. Scanning through the list, I see NT99 \u2192 NT66NT16, but that leads to something else. Also, looking for ' NT87' \u2014 does any NT produce 't87'?\n\nLooking again, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't87'. For example, NT94 \u2192 't87'? Let me check: Yes, NT94 \u2192 't87'. So 't87' can be derived from NT94.\n\nSo, if we can derive NT94 from some other non-terminal, then that would give us 't87'. Let's track back the productions that lead to NT94.\n\nLooking at NT94, it has one production: NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98. So, to get NT94, we need to have NT96 and NT98. Do both of those exist?\n\nNT96 can be produced by NT48 \u2192 NT96 NT23, or from other paths. Wait, NT96 has production NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23 or NT48 \u2192 't96'. Let me see: No, wait, looking at the productions, NT48 \u2192 't96' directly. So, if NT48 can produce 't96' directly, then NT96, which produces NT48 NT23, can we get 't96' from NT96?\n\nWait, no, because NT96 is a non-terminal that goes to NT48 NT23, and NT48 goes to 't96' and NT23 goes to other things. Let me think: to get 't96', I think from NT48, so if NT96 can somehow produce a terminal, but I think it's more about the entire path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nOur target is 't87', which is NT94. So, we need to see if S can be converted to NT94, leading to 't87' when NT94 is processed.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT97NT54. If S can derive to NT97NT54, then perhaps NT97 can produce the first part and NT54 can produce the second.\n\nBut NT97 \u2192 't31' and NT54 \u2192 't12' or 't53' or 't12'? Wait, let me check NT54: It has two productions: NT54 \u2192 't12' and NT54 \u2192 't53'. Wait, no\u2014looking back, I see that NT54 has NT54 \u2192 't12' as well as NT54 \u2192 NT8 't19' and other NT54s, but the specific ones. Wait, actually, looking at the full list, for NT54, there's NT54 \u2192 't12' (maybe that's a typo, but according to one entry: NT54 \u2192 't12'). Also, NT54 \u2192 't12', I think. Or perhaps it's a different one.\n\nWait, looking again, in the grammar, I see multiple NT54's, like S->NT97NT54 and another S->NT97NT54, but that's the same. But for the specific production, I see NT54 -> 't12', but also NT54 -> NT8 't32', and possibly others.

Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that CNF has specific rules: every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar given follows CNF because all the non-terminals on the left side produce two non-terminals on the right, except for the terminals, which are single terminals.\n\nThe target string is \"t25 t41\". I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo S must produce two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals (NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54) further produce other non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nI'll start by checking if \"t25\" can come from any of these productions. Wait, no, because S produces two non-terminals, which correspond to the words in the string. So the string is two tokens: \"t25\" and \"t41\", meaning we need S to produce two non-terminals, each of which must produce \"t25\" and \"t41\" respectively.\n\nLet me look at the productions of the non-terminals that lead to \"t25\". Scanning through the productions, I see NT50 \u2192 't85', which isn't helpful. Also, NT25 isn't a non-terminal mentioned; in fact, looking at the productions, I don't see any NT25. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the right-hand sides for any NT that produce \"25\". \n\nLooking at the grammar, NT50 \u2192 't85' and other NTs like NT23, NT48, etc., produce terminals like 't31', 't32', etc. Hmm, I don't see any NT that directly produces \"25\". So that's a problem because \"t25\" isn't present anywhere as a terminal production. \n\nBut wait, the string is \"t25 t41\", and neither \"t25\" nor \"t41\" are direct terminals in the grammar. They must be derived from non-terminals through multiple steps. So I need to see if any path leads to \"t25\" and \"t41\".\n\nLet me consider the first option for S: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Then I need both NT7 and NT23 to derive into \"t25\" and \"t41\" respectively.\n\nLooking at NT7: its productions are:\n- NT7 \u2192 NT99 NT66\n- NT7 \u2192 NT58 NT54\nWait, I see NT56 \u2192 't10' and other terminals like that, but not NT7. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Does NT7 lead to any terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, there's no rule for NT7 that reduces to a terminal; NT7 is always broken down into two non-terminals. So how can NT7 derive into \"t25\"? It can't because none of its productions directly produce a terminal except for NT55 and others, but NT7 isn't mentioned there.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong NTs. Maybe \"t25\" is produced by a different sequence. Let me try to see if any non-terminals produce \"t25\". Let's go through the productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT50 \u2192 't85', not helpful. NT46 \u2192 't37', no. NT48 \u2192 't96', no. NT94 \u2192 't87', NT98 \u2192 't41' (wait, NT98 produces 't41'? Let me check:\n\nWait, NT98 \u2192 NT40 NT95, and NT40 \u2192 't17'? Not directly. Wait, no, NT98 has a production where NT98 can go to 't40' and 't95', but I need to see the further derivations.\n\nWait, no, the rules for NT98 are:\nNT98 \u2192 NT40 NT95\nNT95 \u2192 NT22 NT84 or 't41'\n\nWait, so NT95 \u2192 't22' and 't84'? Let me see. NT95's productions include:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT95 \u2192 't22' (from NT22 \u2192 't57', wait no, that's not right. Wait, NT22 \u2192 NT57, which is 't57'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled.\n\nWait, let's approach this methodically.\n\nThe target is \"t25 t41\", which must come from two separate non-terminals in S's productions. Let's consider both options for S:\n\nFirst option: S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n\nI need NT7 to derive to \"t25\" and NT23 to derive to \"t41\".\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT99 NT66\nNT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\nAnd so on... It seems NT7 leads to various non-terminals, but do any of them produce \"t25\"?\n\nWait, after multiple steps, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, NT66 \u2192 NT51 NT26. Wait, I don't see a NT26 in the grammar; instead, NT26 doesn't exist. Wait, looking back, NT51 is a rule: NT51 \u2192 't51'. So if any NT leads to NT51, then we can get \"t51\", but we need \"t25\".\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I don't see any leading to \"t25\". So perhaps this path isn't possible.\n\nSecond option for S: S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nNow, NT97 and NT54 need to derive to \"t25\" and \"t41\" respectively.\n\nLooking at NT97's production: NT97 \u2192 't31' directly. So NT97 produces 't31', not 't25', so that won't help us for 't25'. Therefore, the first part can't be \"t25\" from this option.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check NT54's production: NT54 \u2192 't12', 't19', 't32', 't53', 't54', and so on. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12', 't19', 't32', 't53', 't54', and also:\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12', 't19', 't32', 't53', 't54'.\n\nWait, but that's \"t12\", \"t19\", \"t32\", \"t53\", \"t54\"\u2014none of these are \"t25\". So how can NT54 derive to \"t25\"?\n\nHmm, perhaps through multiple steps. Let's see if any of the non-terminals that NT54 leads to can produce \"t25\". But looking at the productions, none of the NTs directly produce \"t25\". So maybe this path isn't correct either.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps \"t25\" isn't directly a terminal but comes from a non-terminal that eventually reduces to \"t25\". Let me look for any NT that can derive into \"t25\".\n\nLooking through all NTs and their productions, it seems none of the NTs have a direct terminal of \"t25\". Therefore, it's impossible for the grammar to produce \"t25\" as a terminal. So the string \"t25 t41\" can't be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe through some intermediate steps. Let me consider NT7 again. If NT7 can't produce \"t25\", maybe another path.\n\nWait, perhaps \"t25\" is derived through another route. Let me see: Does any NT that can lead to \"t25\"?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly leads to \"t25\". For example, NT96 \u2192 't48' directly, but no NT leads to \"t48\" in a way that would give \"t25\".\n\nSimilarly, NT23 can produce various non-terminals, but not \"t25\".\n\nSo, since neither \"t25\" nor \"t41\" can be directly or indirectly produced by the grammar, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but the string is \"t25 t41\", so both parts must be produced from the two non-terminals in S's production. Since \"t25\" can't be produced, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. I can see that the starting symbol is S, and it has two productions: S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. So the string I'm evaluating must start with either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54.\n\nNext, I notice that NT97 is a terminal because in NT97 -> 't31'. But the string starts with 't86', which isn't a terminal I immediately recognize. Wait, no, let me check. Looking through the rules, I see NT86 is not a terminal\u2014it's a non-terminal because there are productions for NT86, like NT86 -> NT58 NT84. So, wait, no: in the list, I see NT58 -> NT94 NT54, which is a non-terminal. But in the string, I have 't86', which would mean that NT86 must derive to a terminal string.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, no, the rules are in the form of NTx -> aNTy... So for each Non-terminal on the left, the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through, I see NT58 -> NT94 NT54. So NT58 is a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals. Similarly, NT86 isn't a left-hand side; instead, I see NT86 is not a non-terminal, but perhaps I misread. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT53 -> NT28 NT18\nNT41 -> NT68 NT53\nNT18 -> t86 ?\n\nWait, no: The rules are:\n\nNT41 -> NT68 NT53\n\nNT18 isn't a left-hand side.

Let me look for NT86 in the rules. Yes, here it is:\n\nNT86 -> NT58 NT84\n\nSo NT86 is a non-terminal that produces NT58 and NT84.\n\nNow, looking at the string I need to evaluate: \"t86 t17\"\n\nThe first symbol is 't86', which in the rules is the production of NT84 or NT86. Let's check: NT84 can produce itself again, but according to the rules, NT84 is a non-terminal because there's NT84->NT58 NT86. Wait, but in the rules, NT84 is on the left of some productions. Let me scan again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86, and there's also NT84->... I think also NT84 is a non-terminal. Wait, actually, looking again, the rules for NT84 are:\n\nLooking through the list, NT84 appears in:\n\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- Also, is there another rule? Looking again, the list doesn't show another production for NT84 except that one.\n\nSo NT84 is a non-terminal that produces NT58 and NT86. But in the string, the first symbol is 't86'. So to get 't86' as the first symbol, that must mean that the first production starts with a non-terminal that can produce 't86'.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals that produce 't86', I see:\n\n- NT86 -> 't25'?\n\nWait, no. Wait, there's a production for NT86 -> 't25'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT86 -> NT58 NT84\n\nSo NT86 is a non-terminal; it can't produce 't25' directly. Instead, 't25' is the result of NT86's production. Wait, no:\n\nWait, looking again, at the bottom of the list, there is a rule:\n\nNT86 -> 't25'\n\nYes, here it is:\n\nNT86 -> 't25'\n\nSo NT86 is a non-terminal that can directly produce the terminal string 't25'. \n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is 't86', not 't25'. So that doesn't add up. So how did the string start with 't86'? That must mean that 't86' is derived from the left-hand side, which requires that the first symbol is from a non-terminal that directly produces 't86', but looking through the rules, the only non-terminal that directly produces a terminal is NT86 -> 't25' and others like S-> NT97 -> 't31', etc.\n\nWait, no. Let me check each non-terminal that can produce a terminal string:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT54 -> 't93'\n\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n\n- NT8 -> 't19'\n\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n\n- NT94 -> 't87'\n\n- NT46 -> 't37'\n\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n\n- NT48 -> 't86'\n\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n\n- NT97 -> 't54'\n\nWait, so NT48 can produce"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-29","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string `t86 t25 t35` can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal string. Wait, actually, the start symbol can have a production to a terminal as well, right? Or is that allowed? Let me recall: In CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, yes, the start symbol can have a production to a terminal, which makes it straightforward.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that some symbols like NT97 and others have productions that transform into terminals with suffixes like `t31', `t93', etc. These seem to be the leaf nodes of the grammar, producing specific terminal strings.\n\nThe string I'm supposed to evaluate is `t86 t25 t35`. So, each of these parts needs to be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each terminal symbol can only appear directly (from a production like A \u2192 a) or as part of the non-terminals expanded in steps.\n\nI think the approach is to work backwards from the start symbol S and see if it can derive this string. Let's see what the start symbol produces. From the grammar, S can produce either NT7 NT23 or NT99 NT54.\n\nSo, the string `t86 t25 t35` has three terminals. Let's see how the grammar can produce three symbols. In each step, a non-terminal can produce two terminals or two non-terminals, but since we're looking at the final string, each production must eventually lead to terminals.\n\nLet me think about how to split the string into parts. Since the grammar has a limited number of productions, perhaps each of these terminals corresponds to a non-terminal in one of the productions.\n\nLooking at the string `t86 t25 t35`, let's check each part:\n\n- `t86`: I need to see if there's a production that results in `t86`. In the grammar, I see NT86 is a terminal, so perhaps NT86 \u2192 't86', meaning the production is NT86 \u2192 't86'. Wait, but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT86 defined. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar's productions are given as rules, so for example, NT86 is written where?\n\nLooking again, I see NT84 has an alternative: NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86. So if NT86 \u2192 't86', that would make sense. So perhaps NT86 is a non-terminal that directly produces `t86`.\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT25. Hmm, I don't see NT25 in the grammar. Wait, but in the string `t25`, how is this generated? Let me check the productions more carefully.\n\nWait, the given grammar includes things like NT25: no, in the provided rules, I don't see NT25. So perhaps `t25` isn't directly a production, meaning there's an intermediate step to reach `t25`. Let's go through all the non-terminals and their possible productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out what each non-terminal expands to. Let's start:\n\nFrom NT58: NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54.\n\nNT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98.\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT96 NT23.\n\nWait, no, NT48 is in the productions. Let me check: NT48 appears as a terminal in another production, but as a non-terminal, let me see.\n\nWait, in the list of rules, for NT23: two options, for example. So it's better to perhaps create a dependency tree.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the string has three parts, so the start symbol S must produce something that splits into three after two expansions. Let's think:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT54, which produces NT99 and NT54. Each of these may produce further non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut wait, when S is split into NT99 and NT54, each of those can produce two symbols. Let me see if that could lead to three terminals.\n\nAlternatively, S could produce NT7 and NT23. Let me check NT7 and NT23.\n\nLooking at NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT56 NT40.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT99 NT53.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT66 NT84.\n\nNT84 can further split, but this seems like a long path. Let me track it:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT56 NT40.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT99 NT53.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT66 NT84.\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT51.\n\nNT51? Wait, in the provided rules, I don't see NT51 being defined as a terminal or as a production. Wait, let me check if NT51 is present.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT51 \u2192 anything. So if NT51 is not defined, then this branch would not produce a terminal. Thus, maybe this path leads to a non-terminal that can't produce a terminal. So perhaps the other production of S, which is NT99 NT54, is more promising.\n\nLet's take S \u2192 NT99 NT54.\n\nNow, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16.\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT51.\n\nWait, again, NT51 is not a defined terminal. So this path leads to a non-terminal that doesn't produce a terminal. Maybe not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Perhaps each NT has a production that leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, let's consider NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1.\n\nNT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95.\n\nNT45: NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95.\n\nWait, perhaps some of these can lead to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\n- t86: Looking through the productions, I don't immediately see a NT86. But in the rules, there's a NT86: no. Wait, actually, in the rules, NT84 is present, but not NT86. However, there's NT86 appearing in the production NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54, but that's an intermediate. Alternatively, in the rule NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1, which could produce 't1' as NT1 is defined as 't57', which is a terminal. Wait no, in the provided rules, NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1, and NT1 \u2192 't57', so NT1 is a production to 't57'. So perhaps 't1' is the terminal 't57'. But the string in question doesn't have 't57', so perhaps that's not the right path.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider each terminal in the string and see how they can be generated. The string is `t86 t25 t35`, which has three terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each of these must be directly produced by a ternary production, but in the rules, some non-terminals produce two terminals, so perhaps two non-terminals per terminal.\n\nWait, no, because each production is of the form NTAB \u2192 NT CD. But each rule can only produce two symbols. So, to get three symbols, we need two production steps where each step produces two, leading to four, but then we must have a production that combines two into one. No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps one of the productions directly results in a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, after two expansions, the three symbols come from one production splitting into two, and then another production splitting further.\n\nWait, for example, S \u2192 NTa NTb. NTa \u2192 terminal t1. NTb \u2192 NTc NTd. NTc \u2192 t2. NTd \u2192 t3. So the string would be t1 t2 t3.\n\nBut looking at S's productions: NT7 NT23 and NT99 NT54. Let's try S \u2192 NT99 NT54. Then, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16. NT66 \u2192 NT51. Again, problem. So perhaps the other production is better.\n\nLet me think about NT86: the string needs `t86`. Where is `t86` produced?

{"custom_id":"request-31","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific Context-Free Grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I'm evaluating is `t37 t68 t51`. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what a CFG in CNF looks like. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps in parsing because it allows for a binary split during reduction.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that most non-terminals (like S, NT99, NT58, etc.) produce two other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT7 NT23. But some non-terminals produce a terminal symbol, like NT40 \u2192 't71'.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t37 t68 t51`. Since this is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to analyze the string and see if each terminal corresponds to a production that can derive the entire string. I'll start from the rightmost symbol and work my way left, trying to see if each step fits into a possible production.\n\nLet's start from the leftmost symbol, which is 't37'. Looking at the grammar, I see a production NT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95. Wait, maybe that's not useful. Hmm, maybe I should look for a production that directly gives 't37'. Scanning through the rules, I notice that NT46 \u2192 't37'. So the first 't37' could be derived from NT46.\n\nNext, the second symbol is 't68'. Let's see if any production leads to 't68' directly. In the grammar, I see NT41 \u2192 't68'. So that could be derived from NT41.\n\nThe third symbol is 't51'. Checking the grammar, I see that NT53 \u2192 't85', but that's not 't51'. Wait, maybe looking further, NT55 \u2192 't53'? No, that's producing a terminal. Let me check. Oh, NT66 \u2192 't51'. So 't51' can be derived from NT66.\n\nSo putting it together, the string is 't37' 't68' 't51', which would correspond to NT46 't37', NT41 't68', and NT66 't51'. Now I need to see if these can be connected through the grammar.\n\nLet me think about how NT46 and NT66 are connected. Is there a way to derive NT46 and NT66 from a common non-terminal? Looking at the grammar, does any production lead to both NT46 and NT66? Let's check the productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the grammar's start symbol, S. S splits into two non-terminals: S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let me consider each possibility.\n\nFirst possibility: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. NT7... Hmm, looking back, I don't see a production for NT7 directly. Wait, but in the detailed productions, I see that NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16 and other splits. But in the string, we have 't37' as the first symbol, which is NT46 \u2192 't37'. So perhaps that path isn't directly connected to NT7 or NT97, which would start with 't71' or 't31'.\n\nWait, perhaps the string isn't derived from S directly. Wait, no\u2014 the entire string must be derived from S. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't possible because each symbol must correspond to a production's right-hand side, which itself involves non-terminals on both sides. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from right to left, using a technique called CYK parsing, which is suitable for CFGs in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nStarting with 't51': From the grammar, NT66 \u2192 't51', so it's derived from NT66. Now before NT66, we have 't68', which must come from NT41 as NT41 \u2192 't68'. Then, before NT41, we have 't37' derived from NT46 \u2192 't37'. Now, I need to see if NT46, NT41, and NT66 are connected through some production.\n\nLooking for productions that produce these non-terminals. Wait, maybe a production that leads to NT46, NT41, and something else, but I'm not seeing that. Alternatively, perhaps the tree can connect NT46 and NT41 through a non-terminal production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's no production that combines NT46 and NT41, so the string might not be valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each production again.\n\nLooking for a path that leads to NT46, which is 't37'; the derivation before NT46 must come from a production that splits into NT46 and something else. Alternatively, maybe the string isn't possible because each part must be derived from a specific structure that isn't directly present.\n\nWait another thought: the grammar's S can split into two parts, but in the string, there are three terminals, which would require more splits than the number of non-terminals, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is shorter than what's possible. Since the string has three terminals, each split would add a non-terminal, so to get three terminals, you would need at least two splits. Let's see:\n\nThe start symbol S splits into two non-terminals. So each of those splits would produce two more non-terminals, making four in total. To get to three terminals, perhaps some of the non-terminals can produce terminals. But in the case of our string, the three terminals are 't37', 't68', 't51'. Let's see if there's a way to have those terminals produced in sequence.\n\nIf we consider that the first 't37' comes from NT46, which is derived from some production. Let's see the possible productions leading to NT46. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any production that produces NT46 on the left side. Instead, I see NT41, NT22, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should draw the possible productions from each non-terminal. Let's see:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't37' (from NT46 \u2192 't37'?)\nNo, checking the grammar, I don't see that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has NT46 \u2192 't37'? No, checking:\n\nWait, the given rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT46 producing 't37'. Instead, for example:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't46' doesn't exist. Let me check:\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn the grammar rules:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't13' (from NT46 \u2192 't13'), no.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong. Let me check all NT's:\n\nLooking for any NT that produces 't37'. Yes, in the detailed productions, under NT46: NT46 becomes 't37'. Wait, no:\n\nLooking through, I see NT94 \u2192 't87', NT98 \u2192 't40', NT10 \u2192 't71', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing which NT produces 't37'.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar. Oh! I see:\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95, and then I don't see 't37' there.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me search the given grammar for 't37':\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't37' (yes, it's present as NT46 -> 't37'). So NT46 can produce 't37'. Similarly, NT41 \u2192 't68' (yes), and NT66 \u2192 't51'.\n\nNow, the problem is combining these non-terminals into a single string derived from S.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nIf I start from the first option: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Now, we'd have to check if NT7 can produce 't37', but wait, NT7 would have to be split.\n\nLooking at NT7, are there any productions for NT7? From the grammar, I don't see any NT7 on the left-hand side. The productions start with NT in uppercase, e.g., NT40, NT55, etc.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps my approach is flawed. Since S splits into two non-terminals, each of those might split further.

{"custom_id":"request-44","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is \"t99 t13 t86 t36\", and the grammar is a big set of productions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this because each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and each RHS is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, that's a good start.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string has four tokens separated by spaces, so I need to generate a derivation that matches these four tokens in order.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that some non-terminals expand directly into terminals. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n\nWait, but the string starts with \"t99\", which isn't an immediate terminal. Let me check the productions for NT99:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n\nHmm, both of those are non-terminals. Oh, but let's see where these go. For NT66:\n\nNT66 \u2192 't51'\n\nAnd NT16:\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40\n\nOkay, and NT56 \u2192 't10', and NT40 \u2192 't71'. So, that would make NT16 \u2192 't10' 't71', which is \"t10 t71\". So NT99 would then be 't51' and \"t10 t71\", making the full expansion \"t51 t10 t71\".\n\nWait, but the string starts with \"t99\". That doesn't match. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.\n\nLet me think again. The string is \"t99 t13 t86 t36\". I need to find a way to get 't99' as the first symbol. That probably comes from NT99, which becomes 't66' and 't16' (from NT66 \u2192 't66' and NT16 \u2192 \"t10 t71\"). But that would give \"t66 t10 t71\", which doesn't start with 't99'. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake in reading the productions. Let me check NT99 again. Oh, actually, there's a production for NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18. Oh, I must have been looking at it wrong before.\n\nSo, NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18.\n\nNow NT28 \u2192 't36' according to one of the productions: NT28 \u2192 't36'. And NT18 \u2192 NT86, because looking at NT18's productions: NT18 \u2192 't96' is one production? Wait, no. Let me go through the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at NT86: wait, no, the productions for NT18 are: NT18 \u2192 't33' and NT18 \u2192 NT57. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let me go through each step methodically.\n\nThe string is \"t99 t13 t86 t36\". Let's try to parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, the first token is 't99', so we need to see which non-terminal expands into 't99'. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18\n\nLooking at NT28 and NT18's productions:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT18 \u2192 't96' (I think, but wait, checking the list: looking for NT18's productions. Wait, I see NT18 \u2192 't96' and NT18 \u2192 't57'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the production list, for NT84: NT84 \u2192 't84', but that's not relevant here. For NT18, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, I think I might have mixed some up. Let me list all the NT18 productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n- NT18 \u2192 't57'\n\nSo, NT18 can become either 't96' or 't57'. Let's try 't96' first because the first token is 't99'.\n\nWait, no, the first token is 't99', so NT99 must produce the first symbol, which is 't99', but as we have NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18, the expansion can't directly give 't99'. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait a second, maybe I need to re-examine the grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and then break down the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The starting symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, its productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, any string derived from S must go through one of these two initial splits. The string we have is four terminals: t71, t13, t48, t68. Since each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal, and in this case, we have four terminals, we can expect two production steps because each non-terminal contributes to two more parts.\n\nWait, actually, each step in the parsing introduces more terminals depending on the non-terminals. Let me think: the string has four parts, so perhaps it's through two levels of productions. Let me see the breakdown:\n\nThe string is t71 t13 t48 t68. Each part is a terminal.

Let me see if I can reconstruct a derivation.\n\nFirst, the entire string must be generated from S. So starting with S.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Then, each NT7 and NT23 must generate t71 and something else. Wait, but the string is four parts, so maybe it needs two levels of expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the terminals and see their parent non-terminals.\n\nt71 is produced by NT40.\n\nt13 is produced by NT13.\n\nt48 is produced by NT48.\n\nt68 is produced by NT41.\n\nSo, the string is composed as NT40 NT13 NT48 NT41, but actually, the string is t71 t13 t48 t68, which would be NT40 NT13 NT48 NT41.\n\nWait no, because each NT can either produce a terminal or another non-terminal. So perhaps, the string's four terminals come from four non-terminals in a chain.\n\nBut let's approach it as a parse tree.\n\nThe string has four terminals, so the parse tree must have three splits (since each split adds a non-terminal). Wait, no, the production tree for four terminals would require three splits, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is binary, so for a string of length n, there are n-1 productions applied.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each terminal is generated by a single non-terminal, so the string is four terminals, each from their respective non-terminals. But in the grammar, non-terminals can only produce two terminals each. Wait, no: non-terminals can produce one terminal or one non-terminal and one terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, each non-terminal can produce either a single terminal (e.g., NT40 \u2192 't71') or two non-terminals (e.g., NT40 \u2192 NT7 NT23? No, wait, the grammar's S is S->NT7 NT23, but looking at NT40's rules:\n\nWait, looking through the given grammar:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't71' and also some other productions? Let me check. From the grammar:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't71'\n\nSo NT40 only produces 't71', no other options. So in that case, any occurrence of NT40 in the derivation must result in 't71'.\n\nSimilarly, let's check each of the terms:\n\nt71: NT40 \u2192 't71'\n\nt13: NT13 \u2192 't13'\n\nt48: NT48 \u2192 ['t48', 't96']\n\nWait, wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't96'\n\nBut also NT48 \u2192 't48'?

{"custom_id":"request-66","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t37 t12 t71 t17 t54` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That helps because all the steps involve replacing non-terminals with either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see the start symbol is S, and the productions from S are S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, the string starts with either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. The string we have is `t37 t12 t71 t17 t54`. Let me see how this could break down.\n\nI'll start with the first part, which is the terminal t37. I check the grammar and find that t37 is a terminal. So, looking for where it appears, I see NT94 \u2192 t96 NT98, but that's not helpful. Wait, no. Let me look for t37 directly. Scanning through the productions... Oh, wait, in NT66 \u2192 t51, but that's nt66. Hmm. Wait, actually, t37 appears in production NT46 \u2192 t37 NT46. So, when NT46 is derived, it becomes t37 followed by NT46. So, the first symbol t37 must come from NT46.\n\nBut how does NT46 get built up? Let me see. In the grammar, NT46 can only be derived from itself unless there's a rule that leads somewhere else. Wait, looking again: NT46 \u2192 t37 NT46. So that's the only production for NT46, which seems a bit odd\u2014it's an infinite loop, isn't it? Because NT46 can only expand into t37 and another NT46. So, to terminate, NT46 must be derived with something that doesn't reference itself. But in the productions, I don't see any other rules for NT46 except this one. So maybe NT46 isn't used elsewhere, and the string starts with t37, meaning we have to have NT46 somewhere in the derivation.\n\nWait, but the string given is t37 t12 t71 t17 t54. That's five symbols. Let me structure this as a leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT97 NT54, which would give us two symbols. The first symbol is t31 because looking at NT97 \u2192 t31. So, the first part is t31. But our string starts with t37, which suggests it must have been derived from NT46. But S can only go to NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So if S goes to NT97 NT54, which gives us t31 and t12, but our string starts with t37, so that's a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, if S goes to NT7 NT23, what's NT7? Looking at the grammar, NT7 \u2192 t71. So t71. Then NT23 can go to various things. Let's see. NT23 can go to NT45 NT53 or NT62. Hmm, but our string starts with t37, not t71. So that suggests that perhaps the string isn't derived from S with S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me make sure. The string given is `t37 t12 t71 t17 t54`. Let me consider if this could be part of a larger derivation starting from S.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if each terminal in the string can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nt37: As I noted, t37 comes from NT46 \u2192 t37 NT46. But NT46 doesn't have any other production except this, so unless it's expanded with something else, it would just be t37 followed by another NT46, which would lead to an infinite string, but we have a finite string. So maybe NT46 is not part of the derivation. Therefore, perhaps the string starts with t37, which suggests it must have been from NT46, but given that NT46 only expands into itself and a terminal, it can\u2019t terminate correctly. So perhaps this string is impossible.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in looking up NT46. Let me check again. The grammar for NT46 is indeed NT46 \u2192 t37 NT46. So, it's only that rule. So, whenever you have NT46, it must expand into t37 followed by NT46, meaning it can never be the end\u2014it must have another NT46. Therefore, the string cannot have t37 as a terminal unless it's the last thing, which would require NT46 to have no more rules, which it doesn't.\n\nBut wait, maybe somewhere else it's connected. Alternatively, perhaps the string's initial steps don't come from S, but that's not possible because the string must be derived from S.\n\nWait, the string has five symbols: t37, t12, t71, t17, t54. Let's check each:\n\nt37: Can only come from NT46.\n\nNext, t12: Where does t12 come from? Looking at NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1, which gives 't84' and 't53'. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, NT54 is in the grammar and has two productions: NT54 \u2192 't12' and NT54 \u2192 't53'. So NT54 can become 't12' or 't53'. So, the second symbol t12 would come from NT54. But NT54 is in the productions of S as well. So, perhaps in the derivation, after S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which gives t71, but wait, no. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT97 NT54, which would first give t31 and then NT54, which can give t12. So, the first part is t31, and the second part is t12, but our string starts with t37, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to have S \u2192 NT46 NT46 or something else? But S's productions are only from NT7 NT23 and NT97 NT54.\n\nThus, since the string starts with t37, which comes from NT46, which only expands into t37 and another NT46, it's impossible to terminate the derivation correctly because NT46 would have to keep expanding. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because the initial t37 cannot be the end of a derivation from S.\n\nWait, but maybe NT46 is part of another production. Let me check. Looking at the grammar, there's a production for NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT53, which is 't57'. Wait, that's a terminal. But that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built from S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's see. NT97 \u2192 t31, and NT54 can be t12 or t53. So the first part would be t31 and then whatever comes from NT54, which can be t12 or t53. So the string would start with t31, which is not part of our target string. Our string starts with t37, which suggests that S must go to the other production, NT7 \u2192 t71, and then NT23.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT7 NT23. NT7 \u2192 t71. So that's a t71. Then NT23 can go to various things. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT23: \u2192 NT45 NT53 or \u2192 NT62.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I think I saw NT23 has another production: NT23 \u2192 't62' or something like that? Let me check the grammar again. Oh, actually, looking back, I see NT23 is produced by:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nNT23 -> NT62\n\nWait, no, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Scanning the grammar list:\n\nLooking through the NT23 productions: I see \"NT23 -> NT45 NT53\" and \"NT23 -> NT62\". Also, \"NT23 -> t62\" from somewhere else? Wait, actually, I don't see any terminals for NT23 except in the case where it's in S: S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, wait, is there any terminal t62 in NT23? Let me check the given productions.\n\nLooking at the list: Yes, I see NT23 is present in several rules, but I don't see it directly"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to see if I can derive the given string by expanding the non-terminals according to these rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t37, t48, t53, t31, t87.\n\nLet me list the rules that produce these terminals. \n\n- t37 is produced by NT46: NT46 \u2192 t37\n- t48 can be produced by NT48 in two ways: either through NT48 \u2192 t48 NT96, but looking at the given rules, NT48's productions are:\n  - NT48 \u2192 t96 NT23\n  - NT48 \u2192 t86\nWait, no, looking back, the rules for NT48 seem to be:\n  - NT48 \u2192 t96 NT23\n  - NT48 \u2192 t86\nSo, t48 is actually produced by NT48 as t86, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check all NT48 rules.\n\nWait, the rules under NT48 are:\n- NT48 \u2192 t96 NT23\n- NT48 \u2192 t86\n\nAh, so t48 isn't directly a terminal. Instead, t86 is produced by NT48. So t48 must be a typo, perhaps, but the string has \"t48\", which isn't directly in the grammar as a terminal. Hmm, that might be a problem. Let me see other NTs:\n\nLooking elsewhere, NT46 produces t37, which matches. Then t48: wait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me re-examine the rules more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused because of the way the rules are written. Each rule is of the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals or other symbols. So for example, NT48 has two rules:\n- NT48 \u2192 t96 NT23\n- NT48 \u2192 t86\n\nSo, t96 and t86 are terminals? Wait, looking at the given rules, some symbols like t37, t48, etc., are terminals because they are used directly. So, if the grammar produces these terminals, then the string can consist of these.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the terminals are things like t37, t54, etc. So, the string \"t37 t48 t53 t31 t87\" needs to be checked against the grammar.\n\nLet me check each terminal in the string:\n\n1. t37: produced by NT46 \u2192 t37. Yes, that's a rule for NT46.\n\n2. t48: Looking for a rule that produces t48 as a terminal. But looking through the rules, I don't see any NT producing t48 directly. All rules either have non-terminals or produce other terminals. So t48 doesn't seem to be directly produced by any NT.\n\nWait, did I miss a rule? Let me scan the rules again. \n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see a rule where a terminal is just t48. For example:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 t85\n- NT48 \u2192 t96 NT23\n- NT48 \u2192 t86\n\nSo, t48 isn't a terminal, so the second position (t48) shouldn't be present in the string. But the string has it. So that might mean the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me check again. Maybe t48 is a typo, or perhaps I misread a rule. Let me check NT18: NT18 \u2192 t68. That's t68, not t48.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me see if any expansion can produce t48 in the string. For example, if an NT produces t48, but it seems no NT does that. So t48 should not be part of any string generated by this grammar.\n\nSimilarly, the third terminal is t53. Let's see where that comes from. Looking at the rules, NT53 \u2192 t85, but wait, no, NT53's rule is not listed here. Wait, looking back: \n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT46: t37; under NT53: no, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see NT23's rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT23 \u2192 NT58 NT23\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me list all NTs and their rules systematically.\n\nLet me start over and list all the NTs and their production rules to make it clearer.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n3.

Wait, now I'm getting confused because line 30 and 34 both mention NT8 \u2192 t32 and NT8 \u2192 t19. Wait, that's inconsistent because each production rule must be unique.

{"custom_id":"request-82","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t71 t93 t85 t54 t51 t57` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure a bit, but I'm still going to need to analyze it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This might help in reconstructing the parse tree or trace how the string can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that the start symbol is S. The initial productions from S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, S generates two non-terminals, NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54. Let's examine each case.\n\nFirst possibility: NT7 and NT23. I'll explore this branch.\n\nFor NT7, looking at the rules:\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT16, which means I need to split that into NT66 and NT16.\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT51 NT51, according to the rules. So, NT66 becomes two NT51s.\n\nNow, each NT51 can derive a terminal. Looking up, NT51 \u2192 't51', which is in the string. So, we have 't51' from both NT51s.\n\nSo, from NT66, we get 't51 t51', but in the string, we have 't71' once. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again for NT66: The production is NT66 \u2192 NT51 NT51. So, yes, two NT51s, both of which produce 't51'. So the first production path of S \u2192 NT7 NT23 leads to 't51 t51', but our string starts with 't71', so this path might not be correct. Unless I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, wait, maybe I misread the NT66 production. Let me check:\n\nLooking up NT66: The rule is NT66 \u2192 NT51 NT51. So yes, two NT51s, each producing 't51'. So if the first part is NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT16, and NT66 becomes 't51' and 't51', but the string has 't71' as the first symbol. That's a problem because the NT7 branch gives 't51', but we have 't71' which comes from NT40.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me structure this more clearly. The string is t71 t93 t85 t54 t51 t57.\n\nSo, each token is a terminal.\n\nLet me see where each token comes from.\n\nLooking at the rules, each terminal is derived from a non-terminal:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't71' (Wait, no, the rules don't have NT77, but looking at NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT16, which becomes 't71' because NT40 is 't71' from the rule NT40 \u2192 't71'. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me list the terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers like 't32', 't40', 't51', etc. So each terminal corresponds to a rule that produces that.\n\nLet me check each token in the string and see which non-terminal it can come from:\n\n- 't71' comes from NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- 't93' comes from NT97 \u2192 't93'\n- 't85' comes from NT16 \u2192 't85'\n- Wait, no: looking at the rules, NT16 is derived from NT40\u2192 't71', but I might have made a mistake. Let me check the rules again:\n\nRules:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't71'\n\nSo, 't71' comes from NT40.\n\nSimilarly, NT93 is 't93' because NT97 \u2192 't93'.\n\nWait, let me get each terminal mapped to its source:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT97 \u2192 't93'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68' (but not relevant)\n- Wait, let me list all terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT97 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't32'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't41'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't19'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, but the string has 't71', 't93', 't85', 't54', 't51', 't57'.\n\nSo, 't71' is from NT40.\n\n't93' is from NT97.\n\n't85' is from NT16, which is derived from NT40 \u2192 't71' (Wait, no: NT16 is a separate non-terminal.)\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify: Each terminal is derived from a specific non-terminal. For example, 't71' is from NT40, 't93' is from NT97, etc. So, I need to find if the string can be constructed starting from S, using the productions.\n\nLet me try building the parse tree from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst option: S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nSo, we have S as root, with NT97 and NT54 as its children.\n\nNow, NT97: looking at the rules, NT97 can only produce 't31' (from NT97 \u2192 't31'), but our string starts with 't71', which is from NT40. Wait, this is a problem because NT97's only terminal is 't31', which is not the first symbol. So maybe this path is not correct.\n\nSecond option: S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which produces the string 't71' and others? Or perhaps another path.\n\nWait, wait, no: the string is t71 t93 t85 t54 t51 t57. So, first token is 't71', which comes from NT40. But in the second option of S, we have NT7 and NT23. NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT16. NT66 \u2192 NT51 NT51. So 't71' comes from NT40, which isn't directly in this path. So perhaps this path is incorrect. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT7 could produce a 't71' elsewhere. Let me check the rules again for NT7.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT7 is a non-terminal. Does NT7 have any production that includes 't71'? Let me check:\n\nWait, the rules list:\n\nFor NT7: I don't see NT7 being a terminal; all its productions go to other non-terminals. So NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT16, NT66 \u2192 NT51 NT51, as we saw earlier. So this branch only generates 't51's. So if the string starts with 't71', this path can't contribute that, so maybe the initial production should be the other option, S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nWait, but that would mean the first symbols are 't71' and 't93'? Let me see: if S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT16, which becomes 't51 t51'. But that's 't51 t51', not starting with 't71'. So maybe that's incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the production paths. Alternatively, perhaps the string is generated via the other initial production, S \u2192 NT97 NT54, but that leads to 't31 t12', which doesn't match the string.\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused. Let me map each terminal in the string to a non-terminal:\n\n- 't71' \u2192 NT40\n- 't93' \u2192 NT97\n- 't85' \u2192 NT16\n- 't54' \u2192 NT54 (since NT54 \u2192 't12', but wait, 't54' is another terminal; maybe not. Wait, no: looking at the production list, NT54 \u2192 't12', so 't54' must come from another non-terminal. Let me check: Maybe NT23 can produce 't54'?\n\nWait, no.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll start by understanding the grammar and the string we're testing.\n\nFirst, the grammar has production rules that produce terminals like 't' followed by numbers. Each non-terminal can split into two other non-terminals or a terminal. So, to generate the string, each part in the string must come from a terminal in one of the production rules.\n\nThe string is `t10 t13 t17 t37 t12 t33`. Let's break this down into individual symbols: 't10', 't13', 't17', 't37', 't12', 't33'. Each of these must be directly produced by a grammar production. Let me list the relevant non-terminals and their productions to see if each terminal is present.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT54 -> 't12' (so 't12' is produced by NT54)\n- NT40 -> 't71' and 't32'\n- NT99 -> 't86' and 't87'\nWait, no, looking again: NT40 -> 't71' and 't32' (right)\nNT50 -> 't85' and 't53'\nNT23 appears in several places, like NT23 -> 't66' and 't86'?

Let's see, NT13 -> 't41' and 't18' (from NT13: NT41 and NT18). Hmm, so 't13'? Wait, looking back: NT84-> 't57', NT23-> 't86' etc. No, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the rules include NT50 -> 't85', 't53', and NT13-> 't41', 't18'. Wait, where's 't13'? Maybe I'm looking at the wrong rules. Let me check: NT13 isn't a terminal; perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the string has 't13', and I need to see if any rule produces 't13'. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't13'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial scan.\n\nWait, I think I missed some rules. Let me go through each rule again:\n\nLooking at NT13: It's a non-terminal, and it has production NT41 and NT18. So NT13 isn't producing a terminal; it's splitting into NT41 and NT18, which themselves have different productions. So 't13' doesn't appear as a terminal in the grammar. Wait, but the string has 't13' as the second symbol. So if 't13' is not in the grammar, then the string cannot be generated. Wait, but looking again, is there any rule where 't13' is on the right-hand side? Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT50 -> 't85', 't53'\n\nNT41 -> 't68', 't53'\n\nNT18 -> 't96', 't53'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe the 't13' is a mistake, but let's confirm. Alternatively, perhaps 't13' is supposed to be NT13, but NT13 doesn't produce 't13' directly. So, if 't13' isn't present in the grammar, the string cannot be generated. But that seems odd; perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the string. Let me double-check: the string is `t10 t13 t17 t37 t12 t33`. So 't13' is in the second position.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, perhaps 't13' is being produced by NT13, but in the current rules, I don't see NT13 producing 't13' as a terminal. So perhaps this is an error, or perhaps 't13' is not in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I overlooked a rule that produces 't13'. Let me go through all the rules again:\n\n- NT99: 't86' and 't87'\n- NT58: 't94' and 't54'\n- NT94: 't96' and 't98'\n- NT55: 't90' and 't1'\n- NT90: 't94' and 't95'\n- NT45: 't99' and 't95'\n- NT59: 't56' and 't53'\n- NT53: 't28' and 't23'\n- NT96: 't48' and 't23'\n- NT98: 't48' and 't95'\n- NT16: 't56' and 't40'\n- NT23: 't45' and 't53'\n- NT84: 't58' and 't86'\n- NT23: 't13' and 't50' (Wait, no, I think I saw this before. Let me check NT23: it's split into 't45' and 't53' and also into 't13' and 't50'. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

For example, one rule is NT23 -> 't66' and 't86', another is NT23 -> 't13' and 't50'. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking through the initial grammar rules:\n\n- Line where NT23 appears: \n\n\"NT23 -> NT45 NT53\" and \"NT23 -> NT45 NT53\" (Wait, I think that's not correct.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar and see how the start symbol S can derive the string. The grammar has two initial production rules for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSince the string starts with `t68`, I should check which of these rules can lead to a string starting with `t68`. Let's compute the first symbols of each production's right-hand side.\n\nFor S \u2192 NT7 NT23:\n- NT7 can produce 't48' as per the rule NT7 \u2192 't48'.\n- NT23 can produce 't62' as per NT23 \u2192 't62'.\nSo the first symbol would be `t48`, which doesn't match the first token `t68`. So this production can't generate the given string.\n\nNow check the other production S \u2192 NT97 NT54:\n- NT97 can produce 't54' (from NT97 \u2192 't54').\n- NT54 can produce 't12' (from NT54 \u2192 't12').\nSo the first symbol would be `t54`, but our string starts with `t68`. That doesn't match either.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. The string starts with `t68`, but both initial productions for S lead to starting symbols `t48` or `t54`. So neither production directly starts with `t68`. Maybe there's a way to derive `t68` through some intermediate steps from S.\n\nLet me look for any productions that can lead to `t68`. Checking the NT rules:\n\nLooking for NT with 't68' as the first symbol. I see NT41 \u2192 't68' and NT13 \u2192 't33', etc. Not directly `t68` except in NT41. So how can S derive `t68`?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial productions for S can lead to some NT that eventually leads to `t68`. Maybe S \u2192 NT97 NT54, and then NT97 can derive something else that can lead to `t68`.\n\nBut wait, looking at NT97's productions, it only goes to `t54` directly. So I don't think NT97 can produce `t68`. Similarly, NT7 goes to `t48`. So perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look deeper. Let's see. The first token is `t68`. Looking at the grammar, the only way to get `t68` is through NT41, which is produced by S if possible.\n\nBut S's initial productions don't directly lead to NT41. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to get NT41 from NT97 or NT7. Looking for any productions that can generate NT41.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT41.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68' (so NT41 directly produces `t68`). So if I can get to NT41 somewhere, then I can get `t68`.\n\nBut how does NT41 get derived from S? Let me see. For S \u2192 NT97 NT54, does NT97 or NT54 produce NT41?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT97 produces `t54`, which is a terminal, so it can't go further. NT54 produces `t12` as a terminal. So no, NT54's production leads to terminals, so that path would terminate with `t54` and `t12`, giving \"t54 t12\".\n\nThat doesn't include `t68`. The other initial production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which leads to `t48` and `t62`, so that's \"t48 t62\". Also not useful for `t68`.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Perhaps the string can be broken down into a series of NT productions that eventually derive `t68 t54 t13 t4 t90 t66 t62`.\n\nLet me list the string tokens again: t68, t54, t13, t4, t90, t66, t62.\n\nI need to see if these can be derived in order from the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nIf the first token is `t68`, then perhaps somehow NT7 or NT97 can be transformed into something else that leads to `t68 t54...`.\n\nBut wait, as per the grammar, NT7 can only go to `t48`, and NT97 can go to `t54`. So neither leads to `t68`.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT41 again. NT41 is in the grammar, right? It's one of the non-terminals with production to 't68'.\n\nYes, from the rules, NT41 \u2192 't68'. So to get `t68`, we need to have NT41 in the derivation.\n\nNow, can NT41 be obtained from either of S's productions?\n\nLooking at the NT rules that can produce NT41, it seems that only NT97 and NT7 can lead to other NTs, but they don't produce NT41.\n\nWait, unless there's a chain leading from S to NT41.\n\nWait, what about S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nThen, perhaps NT97 can go to some NT that leads to a production that includes NT41. Let's see.\n\nWait, NT97 \u2192 't54', so it's a terminal. So S \u2192 NT97 NT54 would immediately give 't54 t12' because NT54 \u2192 't12'. But that's not our first token.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way for some other NT to lead to NT41.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nI see NT91 isn't in the rules, so focus on NT41's possible origins.\n\nLooking at the rules, let's see if any NT has NT41 in its productions.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT99's production is NT66 NT16. No.\n- NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54. No.\n- NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98. No.\n- NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1. No.\n- NT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95. No.\n- NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95. No.\n- NT59 \u2192 NT56 NT53. No.\n- NT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23. No.\n- NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23. No.\n- NT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95. No.\n- NT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40. No.\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. No.\n- NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86. No.\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50. No.\n- NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18. No.\n- NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18. Yes! NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18.\n\nWait a minute, NT13 can produce NT41 and NT18. So maybe that's the way.\n\nSo let's try S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Wait, that doesn't seem to help because NT97 goes to 't54' and NT54 to 't12', which is not our first token.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT97 NT54, but then from there, somehow NT97 can lead to a longer derivation that includes NT41.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because NT97 only produces 't54', so S would directly result in 't54 t12', which doesn't match the first token.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for another starting point. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me re-express the grammar:\n\nThe non-terminals (NT) are all the symbols except the terminals, which are 't' followed by numbers.\n\nSo, the NTs are: S, NT7, NT97, NT40, NT58, NT94, etc.\n\nThe initial productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23  \nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nI need to see if starting with S and substituting according to the grammar rules can produce the target string.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the target string tokens in order: t68, t54, t13, t4, t90, t66, t62.\n\nI need to see if each of these can be generated by a series of NT productions.\n\nStarting with t6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait no, the initial S is produced by two options: S-> NT7 NT23 or S-> NT97 NT54. So when parsing, the initial step is to see whether the string can be derived from either of these.\n\nBut our string starts with t36, which is part of the NT28 -> 't36' production.

{"custom_id":"request-122","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string `t32 t90 t23 t51 t12 t54 t86 t17` can be generated by the given CFG. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it's easier to analyze for CYK parsing or checking derivations.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It starts with S and expands into NT99 or NT97. The right-hand sides are all combinations of two non-terminals. Then those non-terminals further break down into more non-terminals and symbols until we get to terminal symbols which are the 't' strings and other 't' identifiers, plus some letters like nt followed by numbers, which are terminals too.\n\nThe string we have is `t32 t90 t23 t51 t12 t54 t86 t17`. I notice that this is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, so each token is a separate symbol in the string. The task is to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach is to work backward from the string and try to match it against the production rules. Since the grammar is CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals. However, since some productions also go to terminals (like NT54 \u2192 't12'), we can have terminals mixed into the derivation.\n\nLet me list out the tokens for clarity:\n\n1. t32\n2. t90\n3. t23\n4. t51\n5. t12\n6. t54\n7. t86\n8. t17\n\nI'll start by matching the entire string to the top-level productions of S.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT99 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT99 NT23. So, NT99 is the first part, and NT23 is the second. The string starts with t32, which is terminal, but in the grammar, NT23 can be a symbol. Wait, looking back, NT23 can be 't62' or further broken down. So maybe not.\n\nWait, no, the productions for NT23 are:\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nThen each of those further break down, until there's a point where NT84 \u2192 't23' and some other production. Hmm, this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let me see:\n\nNT97 can be 't31' or maybe break down further.\n\nLooking at NT97 \u2192 't31' (a terminal), and NT54 \u2192 't12'. But the string starts with t32, which is different from t31. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, let me check. The string starts with t32. So perhaps looking at NT54 \u2192 't12' is not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which has two options: S \u2192 NT99 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nIf we choose S \u2192 NT99 NT23, then the first part of the string must be derived from NT99, and the second from NT23.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t32, which is a terminal. I need to see if t32 can be generated by either NT99 or NT23.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nThese go deeper, so let's see what NT45 and NT13, etc., produce.\n\nLooking at the productions, each NT can either produce a terminal or split further. For example:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't71', NT8 \u2192 't32', etc.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT99 NT23:\n\n- NT99 can produce sequences of terminals. Let's check if any combination can produce the string's first few symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this step by step, trying to match the string from the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for sequences in the string that match known productions.\n\nAlternatively, think about the steps required to generate the string:\n\nt32 \u2192 which can be produced by NT8 \u2192 't32'\n\nBut in the grammar, NT8 has production NT8 \u2192 't32' and also NT8 \u2192 NT56 NT40. Wait, in the given grammar, NT8's productions are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT97 \u2192 't54'\n- NT1 \u2192 't57'\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n- NT40 \u2192 't17'\n- NT84 \u2192 't4', 't84', 't57', 't23'\n\nWait, so looking at NT8, it can produce 't32', but in the given string, after t32 comes t90, which could be NT66, NT40, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to attempt to parse the string from the top.\n\nAlternative approach: the string has 8 symbols, so the derivation must start from S, expanding step by step until the full string is obtained.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT99 NT23\n\nSo, we need to get t32, t90, t23, etc., starting with NT99.\n\nBut NT99 can only produce a combination of symbols. Looking at the productions for NT99:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18\n\nSo, NT99 can be expanded into NT28 NT18.\n\nThen, each of these can expand further.\n\nNT28 expands to NT45 NT53.\n\nNT18 expands to NT41 NT18.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy, but perhaps let's try.\n\nSo, from S \u2192 NT99 NT23:\n\nnt99 \u2192 NT28 NT18 \u2192 NT45 NT53 NT18 \u2192 NT45 NT53 NT41 NT18 \u2192 etc. But this might lead to a lot of symbols. Let's see, maybe it's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying the other option of S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nNT97 \u2192 't31' or perhaps another path.\n\nLooking at NT97's productions:\n\nNT97 \u2192 't31'\n\nWait, so if we choose NT97 \u2192 't31', but the string starts with t32, which is different, so this doesn't fit. Therefore, maybe NT97 can't be part of the derivation because it would produce t31 instead of t32.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the NT97 productions again.\n\nLooking back: The user's grammar has:\n\nNT97 -> 't31'\n\nSo, NT97 cannot produce anything except the terminal 't31'.\n\nTherefore, if S \u2192 NT97 NT54, and NT97 produces 't31', then the string starting with t32 can't be generated by that path.\n\nThus, it must be that S \u2192 NT99 NT23.\n\nSo, let's proceed with S \u2192 NT99 NT23.\n\nNow, the string starts with t32, which has to come from NT99. From the grammar, NT99's production is NT28 NT16.\n\nSo:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16\n\nNow, the first symbol is t32, which needs to be derived from either NT28 or NT16.\n\nLooking at NT28 \u2192 NT45 NT53, and NT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40.\n\nWait, but NT28 can't produce 't32' directly since NT28 \u2192 't66', according to the productions.\n\nWait, checking the productions of NT28:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, NT28 is defined as:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT28 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT28 \u2192 NT56 NT23\n- NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 't32' (Wait, no, NT8 is above, not NT28)\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, NT8 is:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't40' perhaps?\n\nWait, no. Looking back.\n\nIn the grammar provided, the productions starting with NT8 are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n\nAh, yes, NT8 \u2192 't3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S, which can split into NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54. So S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Each of these non-terminals can further split according to the rules provided. The leaves of the grammar are the string elements in lowercase, like 't93', 't25', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of eight tokens. Each token is a terminal, which means each must be produced directly by the grammar. So I need to find a derivation path starting from S and ending with this exact sequence.\n\nLet me list the string tokens in order: t93, t25, t33, t68, t36, t71, t23, t93.\n\nI'll start by checking if the entire string can be generated from S.\n\nLooking at the productions, S can split into two parts. Let's consider the first option: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Then each of NT7 and NT23 can further split. Let me see what these produce.\n\nNT7: Looking at the productions, NT7\u2192 NT66 NT16. So NT7 splits into NT66 and NT16.\n\nNT66: Its production is \u2192 NT51 NT23. So NT66 splits into NT51 and NT23.\n\nNT51: It produces NT59 NT1. NT59\u2192 NT56 NT53. NT53 is \u2192 NT28 NT23.\n\nSo this chain for the first part is getting complicated. Let me see if any of the terminal tokens match up.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t93. In the grammar, some non-terminals produce 't93', for example NT54\u2192't93' and NT97\u2192't31', which doesn't match. Wait, no, actually looking at the table, I see NT54\u2192't12' and NT97\u2192't31'. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as a series of productions. Let me make sure I parse them correctly.\n\nFor example, NT54\u2192't12', and S can go to NT97 NT54. So S could be NT97 and NT54. NT97's production is \u2192't31', and NT54 is \u2192't12', so S\u2192 t31 t12. But that's not relevant for the given string. I'm supposed to see if the string t93 t25 t33... can be derived.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to find a way to generate the string piece by piece.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backward from the string to see if each step can be matched by the grammar.\n\nEach terminal in the string must be produced directly by a non-terminal. So let me consider the last token in the string, t93. Which non-terminals produce t93?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT94\u2192't87', NT46\u2192't37', NT48\u2192't96', etc. Wait, some non-terminals produce t93. Wait, actually, checking the list: I see NT23\u2192't62', NT84\u2192't4', but no, t93 is produced by NT54\u2192't93' because looking again:\n\nWait, no. Let me go through the production rules for each NT:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT54\u2192't53' and 't12' as per the table. Wait, no. The user wrote:\n\nHere is the grammar:\n\nLooking at the detailed productions, for example, NT54 \u2192 't12'. Similarly, NT54\u2192't93'? Wait, no. Let me parse it.\n\nWait, the user wrote a very long list of productions. For instance:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT97\u2192't31'\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing NT54\u2192 't12' and elsewhere. Let me make sure.\n\nLooking at the detailed list, for example:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12';\n\nNT56 \u2192 't99';\n\nNT23 \u2192 't62';\n\nWait, but the string has t93 as the first token. So I need to find which non-terminal can produce 't93'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT53\u2192 't96',\n\nBut where does 't93' come from? Let me go through the detailed list again.\n\nLooking at NT54: NT54\u2192't53' and 't12'?\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, but in the detailed list, the productions are as written.\n\nWait, looking at the detailed productions provided:\n\nLine by line:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\n...\n\nThen, in the detailed part, the user provided:\n\nNT54 -> 't53'\n\nWait, no. Let me check the user's grammar again:\n\nThey wrote the grammar in a table format, where each line is a production, like:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\n\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\n\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\n\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\n\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\n\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\n\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\n\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\n\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\n\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\n\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\n\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\n\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18\n\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\n\nNT90 -> NT84 NT8\n\nNT50 -> NT55 NT1\n\nNT8 -> NT40 NT96\n\nNT58 -> NT22 NT8\n\nNT98 -> NT40 NT90\n\nNT1 -> NT88 NT53\n\nNT50 -> NT59 NT46\n\nNT88 -> NT7 NT40\n\nNT54 -> 't93'\n\nOh, okay, here we go. So NT54 is the only non-terminal that directly produces 't93'. So in our string, the first token is t93, which must come from NT54.\n\nSo the string starts with NT54 \u2192 't93'. That means the first two tokens in the string should correspond to the two symbols produced by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, no. The string is a sequence of terminals. Each terminal must be produced directly by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo for the string t93 t25 t33 t68 t36 t71 t23 t93, each token must be a terminal, meaning it must be produced directly by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, non-terminals can produce other non-terminals, which then produce terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals, but the derivation process may involve non-terminals in between.\n\nWait, but in the string, each token is a terminal, which must be the result of some non-terminal's production. So each token must be a terminal, and thus each token must be the result of a non-terminal in the grammar that directly produces it.\n\nTherefore, for the string, each token must correspond to the direct production of some non-terminal.\n\nSo for example, t93 is directly produced by NT54, as per the grammar. So the first step is NT54 \u2192 't93'. But wait, NT54 is a single non-terminal symbol, but in the string, the first token is t93, which is a terminal, so in the derivation, NT54 must be a terminal. So that can't be, since NT54 is a non-terminal and must be expanded further.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach non-terminal can be expanded into other non-terminals or terminals. Terminals are the base cases.

{"custom_id":"request-148","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string `t96 t86 t68 t31 t17 t31 t86 t96 t41` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's dive into this.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, all the production rules given here fit that structure. \n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't96', 't86', etc. Some of these, like 't97' and 't84', are actually terminals because in the grammar, they appear as direct outputs of the productions. For example, `NT97 -> 't31'` and `NT54 -> 't12'`. So, whenever a production leads directly to a terminal, that's where the parsing might end for a particular non-terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it's `t96 t86 t68 t31 t17 t31 t86 t96 t41`. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nI'll start from the top-level non-terminal, which is S. The productions for S are `S \u2192 NT7 NT23` and `S \u2192 NT97 NT54`. So, the string must start with either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Since the first symbol in the string is 't96', I'll check if any production starts with 't96'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that `NT96 \u2192 't87'`. So, when NT96 is involved, it leads to 't87'. But in the string, the first symbol is 't96', which isn't any of the immediate terminals from the productions. Wait, maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string by breaking it into the constituent non-terminals and terminals. The string is a sequence of terms, so I need to see if each part can be derived from the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting with the first 't96', I recall that `NT96 \u2192 't87'`. So, the production `NT96 -> 't87'` would mean that in the string, whenever we see 't87', it's generated by NT96. But the string has 't96', which isn't 't87', so maybe I need to see where 't96' comes from. Looking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't96'. So, perhaps this production is not part of the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should start reconstructing the parse tree. Let's see: the string is `t96 t86 t68 t31 t17 t31 t86 t96 t41`. Let's look for terminals that are direct results of productions. For example, NT97 \u2192 't31', so 't31' must be derived from NT97. Similarly, NT84 \u2192 't4' and 't84'.\n\nLooking at the string, let's identify 't96', 't86', 't68', 't31', etc. I need to see if these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to reverse the process. Let's look at the sequence and see if each terminal can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is 't41'. Let me check where 't41' comes from. Looking at the productions, I see `NT41 -> 't68'`, so 't68' comes from NT41.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the last symbol is 't41'. So, that would mean 't41' must be a terminal, but according to the productions, only NT41 produces 't68'. So, unless there's a rule that allows NT41 to produce 't41', that can't be the case. Hmm, perhaps I confused something here.\n\nWait no, let me correct that. Looking at the productions, `NT41 -> 't68'` and `NT54 -> 't12'`, but 't41' is not a direct terminal. So, maybe the string ends with 't41', which isn't directly produced by any production, meaning that perhaps the derivation ends right before that. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the string is composed of a series of terminals, each of which is generated by a series of non-terminals. So, perhaps I should trace the sequence backward, seeing if each terminal can be generated.\n\nStarting from the end, let's see if 't41' can be generated. Hmm, but in the productions, NT41 only goes to 't68', so perhaps that's not the case. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the non-terminals. Let me check all the productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT41 produces 't68' (once) and NT54 produces 't12' (once). Wait, no NT41 \u2192 't41' exists, so 't41' itself is not a terminal in this grammar. That poses a problem because the string has 't41' at the end, but according to the productions, it can't be derived directly.\n\nWait, perhaps 't41' is from NT41 \u2192 't68' but then 't68' can come from another non-terminal, but that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the entire string and see if it can be built by leftmost derivation. Let's pick the leftmost symbol, 't96', and see what that can correspond to.\n\nLooking through the productions, the only non-terminals producing 't96' via two-step derivations (since all are CNF with only two symbols or terminals). Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps focusing on each symbol:\n\n1. t96: Looking for a production that ends with 't96'. From the productions, NT96 produces 't87', NT86 \u2192? Wait, I don't see any NT that produces 't96' directly. Hmm, maybe 't96' comes from NT86. Let me check: NT86 is not present in the productions. Wait, production rules include NT28 \u2192 't36', but in the productions, I don't see NT86 \u2192 anything. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me re-examine the productions.\n\nWait, in the productions, NT86: I don't see any NT86 production. The closest is NT84 \u2192 't4' and 't84', but NT86 is not listed. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the production rules again to make sure I have them all. \n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT7 appears in S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and NT7 has a rule: NT7 \u2192 NT84 NT86. So, NT7 \u2192 NT84 NT86. So, 't96' could come from NT86, but where does NT86 produce? I don't see a production for NT86. Wait, production rules include NT86 \u2192? Looking again, NT86 is part of S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, no, S has two rules: NT97 and NT54, but NT86 doesn't appear as a non-terminal leading directly to a terminal. Oh, but NT86 is only involved in S \u2192 ? No, S's rules are S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, NT7 is part of S's first rule.\n\nHold on, perhaps I should re-examine each production:\n\nProduction rules in order:\n\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54\n\n- NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1\n\n- NT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT56 NT53\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\n\n- NT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95\n\n- NT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18\n\n- NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18\n\n- NT90 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT55 NT1\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT40"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-141","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string `t10 t23 t36 t41 t4 t33 t93 t66 t17` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break down the steps I should take.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps because I can apply certain parsing techniques, like CYK, or use recursive methods to track how the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it has a series of productions where non-terminals are broken down into other non-terminals and terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers and some single-character symbols like 't93', 't31', etc. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT99, NT58, etc.\n\nThe string to check is `t10 t23 t36 t41 t4 t33 t93 t66 t17`. So, each of these represents a terminal symbol, and the string is a sequence of these.\n\nMy approach should be to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by the grammar, and see if the non-terminals can be combined to produce the overall string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step combines exactly two symbols, which might help in tracking.\n\nI think the best way is to work backward from the string and see if we can construct the entire sequence by matching the grammar.\n\nLet's list the terminals in the string in order: t10, t23, t36, t41, t4, t33, t93, t66, t17.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some non-terminals expand to two symbols, which suggests that each step combines two symbols. But the input string has nine terminals, which is an odd number. Each production in CNF splits non-terminals into exactly two, so the length of the derived string should be 2^n where n is the number of steps. But 9 is not a power of 2 (since 2^3=8 and 2^4=16), so maybe it's not possible. Thus, the string length being 9 makes me think it's not possible, but let me check.\n\nWait, the initial grammar starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which is two non-terminals, so each step should cause the number of symbols to increase by 1 each time. Wait no, actually, each step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the total number of symbols increases by 1 each time. Starting with S (1 symbol), after one step, it becomes two, then after another step, it becomes three, etc. So for the string to be generated, the number of terminals must have a length that is (n+1) where n is the number of productions used. But 9 terminals would require 8 productions, which is possible. However, the structure might not allow certain combinations.\n\nBut more importantly, the terminals in the string must be matched by the grammar's productions. Let's try to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nLet me look through the grammar to see which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\nLooking at the productions, some non-terminals produce a single terminal:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT93 \u2192 't87' (Wait, but in the string, we have 't93'. Oh, right, in the grammar, it's NT99 \u2192 't66' or others, but I need to check which NT produces 't93'.)\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar and note which non-terminals produce which terminals. Let me list them out:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT23 \u2192 various, but for example, NT66 \u2192 't51'\n- NT55 \u2192 't90' (Wait, NT55 \u2192 't90') Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't10'\nNT40 \u2192 't71'\nNT95 \u2192 't41'\nNT8 \u2192 't32'\nNT56 \u2192 't99' Hmm, no, let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, no.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make parsing a bit easier, using something like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I should go that route or try to find a derivation manually since the string might be a bit long.\n\nLooking at the string, it has ten tokens. Let me list them out again to make sure I don't get confused:\n\nt68, t35, t53, t93, t12, t23, t23, t66, t93, t86.\n\nSince each production is two non-terminals, the parse tree should result in the start symbol S expanding into a sequence that directly corresponds to the string. Let's check the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S->NT7 NT23 or S->NT97 NT54. So the first step is that S must expand into two non-terminals. Each of those can then further expand.\n\nLet me look at the string. It starts with t68. Let's check which non-terminals can produce t68. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT41 produces t68. So NT41 -> t68. That's helpful.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is NT41. Wait, no: wait, the first token in the string is t68, which comes from NT41.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar has NT41 -> t68. So when we see 't68' in the string, it must come from NT41.\n\nLooking at the first token, t68. So the first symbol in the string is t68, which is derived from NT41. So in the parse tree, the root has S as the top symbol. So perhaps one of the two non-terminals from S must be NT41, but let's see.\n\nWait, let me try to reconstruct the derivation:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23 (Production 1)\nor\nS -> NT97 NT54 (Production 2)\n\nWe have to see which expansion leads to the string. Let's check the first option: S -> NT7 NT23. From here, NT7 and NT23.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7 can only be expanded into t48. Because in the grammar, NT79... Wait, no. Wait, the productions for NT7 aren't directly given. Let me check the provided grammar again:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see NT7 producing anything except perhaps in the last entry: NT7 -> 't48'. Wait, no, looking again, under NT799, NT755, etc., I see NT7... Let me scan for NT7.\n\nWait, in the initial list, I don't see any NT7 production listed. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted. Looking back, under NT23, we see productions like NT23-> NT45 NT53, NT23-> NT13 NT50, and also NT23->t66. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the provided grammar lines again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce t68: NT41.\n\nBut for NT41, I don't see a production in the grammar that gives t68. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions again to make sure.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT66: NT66-> NT51 NT... No, it's listed as NT66 -> NT51.\n\nWait, I think I need to list the non-terminals that produce t68, t35, etc. Let's make a list for each terminal.\n\nt68 comes from NT41 (NT41 -> t68).\n\nt35: Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce t35? Let's check all productions where a non-terminal leads to t35.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT123 (Wait, no, I don't see that). Wait, looking again: under NT7->'t48', that's production for NT7? No, wait, wait. Wait, the grammar entries are:\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let's scan through the grammar lines:\n\nI see NT56 -> 't10', NT50 -> 't85', NT94 -> 't87', etc.\n\nWait, let me look for all non-terminals that produce t35. Hmm, perhaps someone's production ends with t35. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I don't see any NT producing t35. Wait, did I miss something?\n\nWait, the string has t35, but in the given grammar, are there any non-terminals that expand to t35? Let me check each production.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT16 -> 't90': no.\n- NT23 -> 't66', etc.\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT28 -> 't36', 't13', etc.\n- NT8 -> 't32', 't19', etc.\n  \nWait, I don't see any NT in the grammar that produces t35. Hmm. That's a problem because the string includes t35, but according to the grammar, maybe it's not possible. Did I miscount or miss a production?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misremembering the productions.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure. My first thought is to break down the string into its tokens and see how they can be formed by the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order: t53, t57, t41, t4, t13, t13, t66, t68, t37, t25. \n\nI remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single terminal, a terminal followed by a non-terminal, or a non-terminal followed by two non-terminals. So, every step in the derivation is either adding a terminal or splitting a non-terminal into two parts.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which is defined as:\nS -> NT7 NT23 (either form, since S can be written as either production)\nBut in the given grammar, S seems to have two productions: S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar for S is:\nS produces NT7 NT23 OR NT97 NT54. So, I guess depending on the path taken, S can produce different start sequences.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t53. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, what do I have for NT53? Let's check the productions for NT53: NT53 -> NT28 NT23. Oh, so NT53 splits into NT28 and NT23. Hmm, but in the string, it's t53 right after S, which suggests that either the S production starts with NT53 or another symbol.\n\nWait, no, looking back: The first production for S is NT7 NT23, which would translate to \"t53\" if NT7 is \"t53\"? But that's not the case. Let's look for where NT tokens are mapped to 't' tokens.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NT tokens that map to 't' are:\nNT7 -> 't71'? Wait, no, let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT7 -> 't48'? No, I don't see that. Wait, let me parse each rule:\n\nLooking line by line, I see:\n\nFor NT7: It's only in the rule NT16 -> NT56 NT40, and NT40 is 't71'? Let me go step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT to 't' mappings first:\n\nLet me go through each rule and check if the RHS includes terminals (i.e., those starting with 't').\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n1. S -> NT7 NT23 (Not terminals, so this might be part of the start sequence)\nWait, but in S, the first production is S -> NT7 NT23, which would produce t53 t57, but let's check:\n\nIn the grammar, NT7's production isn't given directly, but I can derive it. Wait, the given grammar has some NT and t combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the string step by step. Let's think about how the string could be built from the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t53 t57 t41 t4 t13 t13 t66 t68 t37 t25.\n\nLooking at the first token, t53. Looking in the grammar for NT53, I see that NT53 -> NT28 NT23 (from line NT53: NT53 -> NT28 NT23). So, to get t53, there must be a path where NT53 is derived into a terminal.\n\nLooking for where NT53 can be a terminal or part of a chain leading to a terminal. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I'm looking for any production where NT53 appears as a terminal or is derived into a terminal. Wait, NT53 is only on the LHS, so I need to see if there's any rule where NT53 is used as a terminal, but looking at the entire grammar, I don't see that. So maybe NT53 is an intermediate that must be broken down further.\n\nWait, that suggests that the first token t53 must come from NT53, but NT53 only produces NT28 and NT23. So, t53 must be a terminal that's part of the overall parsing. But since NT53 doesn't produce a terminal, I must have a way to get t53 from somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking back, the NT53 production is: NT53 -> NT28 NT23. So to get t53, perhaps I need to have a production where either NT28 or NT23 produces 't53'? Or maybe another path.\n\nWait, let me check all the NT rules to see where a terminal 't' is produced.\n\nStarting with NT7: I see NT16 -> NT56 NT40; NT40 -> 't71'. So from NT16, I can get 't71'. Also, NT56 -> 't99'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't53', so maybe that's part of a different derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first token is from S producing through NT7 and NT23. Let's see:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23. If NT7 is 't53', then that would start right. But looking at the grammar, does NT7 produce 't53'? Let's check the rules for NT7.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT7 being a terminal. Wait, maybe in another production.\n\nWait, maybe NT97 -> 't31', NT7 -> 't48'? Or is that not the case?\n\nWait, looking at all the rules:\n\nLooking through the given list, here's what I see:\n\n- NT54 -> 't12' (line: NT54 -> 't12')\n- NT12 is 't12'? Not directly, but wait, NT54 -> 't12', so that would mean that when NT54 is derived, you get 't12'?\n\nWait, actually, the given grammar has certain rules where NTx is mapped to a 't' followed by some digits. For example, NT54 -> 't12', which would mean that whenever NT54 appears, it produces the terminal 't12'.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 -> 't48', not sure where that is. Wait, looking through again.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48' (is that correct?)\n\nWait, let me check the rules again:\n\nWait, in the initial list, I have:\n\n\"NT54 -> 't12'\"\n\n\"NT97 -> 't31'\"\n\n\"NT40 -> 't71'\"\n\n\"NT8 -> 't32'\"\n\n\"NT56 -> 't10'\"\n\n\"NT95 -> 't41'\"\n\n\"NT28 -> 't36'\"\n\n\"NT8 -> 't19'\"\n\n\"NT41 -> 't68'\"\n\n\"NT54 -> 't12'\"\n\n\"NT46 -> 't13'\"\n\n\"NT48 -> 't96'\"\n\n\"NT94 -> 't87'\"\n\n\"NT46 -> 't37'\"\n\n\"NT23 -> 't62'\"\n\n\"NT48 -> 't86'\"\n\n\"NT13 -> 't33'\"\n\n\"NT97 -> 't54'\"\n\n\"NT1 -> 't57'\"\n\n\"NT18 -> 't96'\"\n\n\"NT16 -> 't90'\"\n\n\"NT28 -> 't66'\"\n\n\"NT40 -> 't17'\"\n\n\"NT84 -> 't4'\"\n\n\"NT84 -> 't84'\"\n\n\"NT53 -> 't53'\"\n\nWait, no, wait.

The string in question is \"t85 t68 t32 t84 t35 t48 t90 t66 t66 t48 t85\".\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has a specific structure where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can sometimes have a terminal. This usually makes parsing easier because it limits the context in which symbols can appear.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is 'S', and it immediately branches into either 'NT7' and 'NT23' or 'NT97' and 'NT54'. So the overall structure starts with S -> NTsomething NTsomething. From there, each NT can branch further until we reach terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe given string consists of ten tokens, each starting with 't' and a number. So the string is a sequence of ten terminal symbols. I need to see if this is a possible derivation from the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try building the string step by step, seeing if each token can be generated by the rules provided.\n\nStarting with S, the possible first steps are:\n1.

So the first token is 't48'.\n\nThen, NT23 has two options:\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nLet's look at both sub-options.\n\nSub-option 1: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\nNT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18\nNT28 can be 't36' or 't66' or 't13' or 't86' etc. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT28: I see production rules like NT28 \u2192 NT36, NT66, etc. Wait, in the given grammar, it's:\n\nLooking at the NT28 entries:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT36\n- NT28 \u2192 NT66\n- NT28 \u2192 NT40 (Wait, no, looking back, I don't see NT28 \u2192 NT40. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nThe NT28 productions are:\n\nNT28 -> NT36\nNT28 -> NT66\nNT28 -> NT40\nNT22 -> NT57\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT28 -> NT36\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86, and so on.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, under NT28:\n\nLooking back: Yes, the grammar has:\n\nNT28 -> NT36\nNT28 -> NT66\nAlso, further down: NT84 -> NT58 NT86, etc., but NT28 also has NT40? Wait, no, looking at the list:\n\nWait, I need to list all NT28 productions. From the given grammar:\n\nNT28 -> NT36 (production)\nNT28 -> NT66 (production)\nNT28 -> NT40? No, wait, looking carefully, I don't see NT28 -> NT40. Let me check:\n\nLooking down the list, I see NT28:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT36\n- NT28 \u2192 NT66\n- NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86 (Wait, that's under NT84, not NT28)\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me try to find all NT28 rules:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT28 -> NT36\n- NT28 -> NT66\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53 (Wait, no, that's in NT23)\nWait, no, looking at the entire grammar, I see under NT28:\n\nIt says:\n\n- NT28 -> NT36\n- NT28 -> NT66\nThen further down, under NT23, it says:\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT97 -> 't31'\nAnd others, but for NT28, I'm fairly certain the only productions are:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT36\nNT28 \u2192 NT66\n\nSo, in the first sub-option, after S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which becomes 't48', then we go to NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. Now, we need to see what comes next.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95. Let's see.\n\nThen, NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18. So, generating symbols.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT36 or NT66. So if we take NT28 \u2192 NT66, which gives 't66' maybe.\n\nWait, let me try to outline the steps.\n\nSo, starting with 't48' from S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then from NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53.\n\nSo current string: t48, then NT45 and NT53.\n\nThen, NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95.\n\nSo now, after 't48', we add 't's from NT99 and NT95.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18, NT28 can produce 't66' or 't36' or maybe others? From earlier, NT28 \u2192 NT36, NT66.\n\nBut let's assume we take NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18.\n\n NT28 \u2192 NT36 \u2192 't36'\n\n NT18 \u2192 NT68 or something? Wait, no, looking at the grammar for NT18: No, let me check NT18.\n\nWait, checking NT18's grammar:\n\nNT18 -> NT41 NT18? No, looking through the grammar:\n\nWait, from the given grammar, under NT18:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT96 NT53\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map the entire order of production steps to see if it can build the given string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to start from the target string and see if each step can be produced by the grammar, possibly building a parse tree in reverse.\n\nGiven the string is: t85 t68 t32 t84 t35 t48 t90 t66 t66 t48 t85\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 11 tokens, each starting with 't' followed by a number. The first token is 't85', then 't68', 't32', etc.\n\nI need to check how each token can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire string has to be derived, perhaps the top-down approach starting from S would be better.\n\nBut the string is 11 symbols long. Let me think: each NT production adds two non-terminals, and each of those can add more. So the number of non-terminals can increase until all terminals are produced.\n\nWait, maybe let's see:\n\nEach S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nThen, each of those NT7 and NT23, and NT97 and NT54, will break down into more NTs until we reach the terminal symbols.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, perhaps the depth of the parse tree isn't too high.\n\nWait, the string is 11 tokens, so it's possible that the derivation involves multiple splits. Each split step adds tokens.\n\nBut to check this, perhaps a better approach is to see if each token in the string can be matched in reverse, i.e., starting from the end and seeing if the grammar can produce the needed symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for 't's in the grammar that match the given tokens. Looking at the grammar, several terminals are present:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT50 \u2192 't85'\n\nWait, yes, NT50 \u2192 't85' is one of the productions.\n\nSimilarly, let's see NT57 is 't57' and so on.\n\nSo, looking for the tokens in the string:\n\nt85, t68, t32, t84, t35, t48, t90, t66, t66, t48, t85.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT50 \u2192 't85', so t85 can come from NT50.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- t68: Checking if any NT produces 't68'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-180","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF is a specific form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that all rules either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So, it's definitely in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t23 t12 t13 t99 t93 t62 t68 t85 t68 t57 t87`. This is a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S. From the given rules, S can produce two sequences:\n\n1. NT7 and NT23\n2. NT97 and NT54\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nI'll need to see which of these can lead to the target string. Let's see.\n\nLet me first check S \u2192 NT7 NT23 because the string starts with t23. So, the first symbols are t23, which would be derived from NT23.\n\nLooking at the grammar's NT23 rules: NT23 can produce NT45 NT53 or NT48 NT23. Let's see the t23 appears again in the string, so that's a possibility. But wait, in NT23, if the production is NT48 NT23, the t23 is a terminal, which is valid.\n\nBut let's follow this path. The first symbol t23 is from NT23, which could come from NT45 NT53 or NT48 NT23. If it's from the first option, NT45 and NT53, but let's see the string. After t23 comes t12, which is another terminal. So, perhaps it's better to go through NT23.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I can build a parse tree for the string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol. Alternatively, I can try to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the given string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to see if it can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the first symbol t23. From the grammar, NT23 can produce 't62' if that's a production, but checking the rules:\n\nWait, looking back, the NT23 rules are:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT48 NT23\n\nSo, as per the given rules, NT23 doesn't directly produce 't62'. Instead, NT62 is produced by NT28 \u2192 't28'? Wait, no, no, looking at the list, I see:\n\nLooking for 't23', 't12', etc., in the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols. For example:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the given rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12' (Yes, this is one of the productions.)\n\nAlso, NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1, but that might not be relevant here.\n\nSimilarly, NT95 \u2192 't41', NT50 \u2192 't85', etc.\n\nWait, but in the string we have t23, t12, t13, etc.\n\nSo, to get 't23' from NT23, according to the productions, NT23 can produce:\n\nEither NT45 NT53 or NT48 NT23.\n\nIf it's NT48 NT23, then 't48' may produce a terminal. Let me see if NT48 produces 't48'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production for NT48 directly producing a terminal. Let's check the rules:\n\nLooking for NT48: I see NT48 \u2192 't96' is not a terminal, wait, in the list, does any NT produce 't48'?\n\nLooking through all the terminals:\n\nI see NT48 \u2192 't96' (from some rules like 'NT48 -> NT96 NT23', but I don't see a direct 't48' production.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string properly.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right. Some of the non-terminals are terminals, and others are non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each rule to see which symbols are terminals. The rules that end with something in quotes are terminals. For example, the rule NT54 -> 't12' tells me that NT54 is a terminal. Similarly, NT97 -> 't31' and others are terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t35 t57 t54 t90 t99 t13 t93 t4 t17 t71 t87 t31`.\n\nLet me jot down the string: t35, t57, t54, t90, t99, t13, t93, t4, t17, t71, t87, t31.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to build the string from the start symbol S using the given rules.

Let me check the rules again:\n\nThe rules start with S -> NT99 NT23 or S -> NT58 NT54. So the initial symbol S expands to two non-terminals. So S can be replaced by, for example, NT99 and NT23.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t35. Looking at the production rules, I don't see a rule that starts with NT35.

Let me see what each of those can produce.\n\nNT99 can produce other symbols, and looking at the rules, NT99 can go to NT28 NT18. Then NT28 can go to NT36, which isn't a terminal, so that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this backward. Let's try to break down the string into possible chunks that match the production rules.\n\nThe string has 12 tokens.

Let's check if any of these expansions can produce parts of our string.\n\nFirst, S could expand to NT99 NT23. So let's see what NT99 and NT23 can produce.\n\nFrom the rules, NT99 -> NT28 NT18. Then NT28 can go to NT36, which is a terminal? Wait, no, looking back, the rules for NT28: NT28 is a non-terminal as it has rules like NT28 -> NT66 NT13.\n\nWait, no, earlier I saw:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT28 -> NT66 NT13. Hmm, but 66 isn't a terminal, so it's still a non-terminal. So perhaps this path won't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S expands to NT58 NT54. Let's see what NT58 and NT54 can produce.\n\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54. NT94 can go to NT96 NT98, and then NT96 -> NT48 NT23, which is t48 and NT23. But in the string, I don't see t48 or t23 immediately. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking for tokens that are terminals: t57, t35, etc.\n\nWait, t57: Looking at the rules, maybe NT1 -> 't57'. Because in the rules, I see NT1 -> 't57'.\n\nSo t57 is produced by NT1.\n\nSimilarly, t54 is a terminal. Looking at the rules, NT54 can be 't12' or 't53'? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> 't57'\n\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n\n- NT54 -> 't53'\n\n- NT54 -> 't53'. Wait, no, looking:\n\nWait, no. Let me check all the rules where a non-terminal becomes a terminal:\n\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n\n- NT54 -> 't53'\n\nNo, actually, looking at the rules provided:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT23 -> 't57' is one of the rules, but wait, I don't see any for NT54. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, one rule is NT54 -> 't53', another is NT54 -> 't12'. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, let's note down which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n\n- NT7: 7 -> t48.\n\n- NT23: 23 -> t57, and in another rule, 23 also appears in NT84 -> 't23'. So 23 can be a terminal in some cases.\n\n- NT54 can produce t12, t53, and t53 has a rule, etc.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, identify which terminals in the string can be produced by which non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt35: I don't see any rule directly producing t35 as a terminal, so perhaps this non-terminal can only be produced by a series of steps.\n\nSimilarly, t57: from the rules, NT1 is the only non-terminal that produces t57, because NT1->t57.\n\nt54: from NT54, as per above, can produce t12 or t53.\n\nt90: looking for which non-terminals produce t90. I see NT90 can produce t4 and t96 (from NT8 -> 't4' and NT40 -> 't17'? Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, under NT40, I see rules:\n\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n\n- NT40->something else? Let me check.\n\nWait, some rules for NT40:\n\nNT40->'t71'\n\nAlso, NT84->'t4'\n\nOther rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT92: Not present.\n\nWait, perhaps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It seems like it's a CFG where each non-terminal on the left side of the rules on the right side is split into two other non-terminals, except for the terminals which are the actual symbols.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands into NT7 and NT23, as per the first rule: S -> NT7 NT23, and also S -> NT97 NT54. So S can go down two different paths: one involving NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54.\n\nLooking at the string, it's all terminal symbols, so I need to see if there's a way to derive this string starting from S by expanding the non-terminals into terminals.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual tokens: t31, t33, t85, t33, t32, t25, t71, t68, t71, t19, t51, t54, t25.\n\nNext, I need to see which production rules correspond to these terminals. For example, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT97 -> t31 (from S's production)\n- NT54 -> t12, but wait, in the string there's t54, so perhaps NT54 has a rule that ends in t54.\n\nWait, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at NT54, there's a rule: NT54 -> 't12' but also other rules like NT54 -> 't12' (I think I misread earlier; let me check again).\n\nWait, no, the rules under NT54 are:\n\n- NT54 -> 't12' (I think that might be a typo in the initial input; let me recount. The initial grammar had NT54 -> 't12' as a rule. Wait, no, the grammar above says NT54 -> 't12', which might be the case. Let me confirm: looking back, the user provided the grammar with NT54 -> 't12', yes. So that's a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but in the string, I have t54, which in the rules is produced by NT54's rule that ends in 't12'. Hmm, perhaps I need to check which NT54 rule leads to t54.\n\nWait, looking again: Oh, wait, no, in the grammar provided, NT54 is transformed into 't12', so that's how t12 is produced. But the string has t54. So that suggests that perhaps NT54 can produce t54 somehow. Wait, no, let's check NT54's rules.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT54:\n\nNT54 -> 't12'\n\nThat's a terminal. So the only way to get 't12' is directly. So if the string has 't54', maybe that's a mistake, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the string should have 't12', not 't54'. Wait, no, the string has t54, so maybe that's produced by another NT.\n\nLooking for rules that produce 't54' or 't53' or similar.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to track how the string can be derived. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe entire string is 13 tokens long. We need to see how this can result from the grammar.\n\nSince S can expand in two different paths, let me consider both.\n\nFirst path: S -> NT7 NT23\n\nLet me see what NT7 and NT23 can produce.\n\nLooking up the rules:\n\nNT7 -> 't48' from the grammar, so 't48' is a terminal from NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT97 is a production that appears in S's second option: S -> NT97 NT54. So, perhaps the string starts with NT97, leading to 't31'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't31'. From the grammar, NT97 -> 't31', so that works for the first token.\n\nSo the first step could be S -> NT97 NT54, leading to 't31' ... Now, I need to see if the rest of the string can be generated from the remaining parts: NT54 and the rest of the string.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when S expands to NT97 NT54, each non-terminal is handled separately. So the string after 't31' should come from NT54, and then the remaining tokens come from expanding the rest. But wait, this might not be correct because when you derive, each non-terminal is expanded into two, so the entire derivation might produce multiple tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the order. Let me think. Each step in the derivation can replace a non-terminal with a sequence of two non-terminals, but in the end, all non-terminals are replaced by terminals to form the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the string as being built in a structure that can be processed by the grammar, perhaps in a left-to-right fashion, and see if each production corresponds to a part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the parsing method for CFGs, like looking for the leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, maybe the better approach is to look at the possible structures of the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t31 t33 t85 t33 t32 t25 t71 t68 t71 t19 t51 t54 t25.\n\nWait, that's 13 tokens. Let me try to split it into parts that might correspond to the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a top-down approach, starting from S and seeing how the string can be built.\n\nFirst, S must produce either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t31, which is produced by NT97. So S must have expanded via S -> NT97 NT54, because NT97 -> t31, and NT54's first symbol is maybe something else.\n\nWait, but let's see the first step:\n\nIf S -> NT97 NT54, then NT97 becomes t31, then NT54 must produce the rest of the string. But the rest of the string is 12 tokens after t31, so t33 t85 t33 t32 t25 t71 t68 t71 t19 t51 t54 t25.\n\nWait, that might not fit because the string length doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake because S's production into NT97 and NT54 would require that the entire string is generated by NT97 followed by NT54. That can't be because the entire string is a single unit. So perhaps the other path is better.\n\nWait, no. When you expand a non-terminal, it's replaced with a sequence of symbols, which can themselves be non-terminals or terminals. So each expansion of S will produce a sequence of non-terminals and terminals, which then gets expanded further until all are terminals.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the initial expansion would be S -> NT97 NT54, leading to [t31, (expansion of NT54)].\n\nBut to get the entire string, we need the entire sequence, so [t31, ...], and then the rest of the string must be generated by NT54's expansion.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nAfter t31, we have t33 t85 t33 t32 t25 t71 t68 t71 t19 t51 t54 t25.\n\nBut how does NT54 expand into that? Let me look at the rules for NT54.\n\nFrom the grammar: NT54 -> 't12'. That's a terminal. So that can't be, because the rest of the string after t31 is more than one token, which would require NT54 to expand into more than one symbol. But according to the rules, NT54 can only produce 't12' directly. So maybe this path is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the other option is that S expanded into NT7 and NT23, starting with t48 (since NT7 -> 't48'). But the string starts with t31, so that can't be from NT7. So perhaps this is a dead end, meaning that the S must expand into NT97 and NT54, but NT54 can't expand into multiple tokens because its only production is 't12'.\n\nWait, but according to the provided grammar, NT54 only has 't12' as a production, so that would mean that the second part of the string after t31 is a single t12, which doesn't match the given string.

{"custom_id":"request-243","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to unpack this step by step. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. CNF requires that every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. From the grammar provided, I can see that all the production rules follow this structure, either producing two non-terminals or a single terminal. So that's a good start.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is `t23 t32 t4 t96 t68 t35 t85 t71 t57 t37 t37 t35 t66 t31`. Since each element in the string is a terminal symbol, I need to see if there's a way the grammar can generate this sequence by following the productions.\n\nI think the best approach here is to try to parse the string top-down using the given grammar. Starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string step by step. Let me look at the grammar rules. \n\nThe start symbol S can produce two options: NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So in the derivation, S should expand into one of these two pairs. Let's check the string: the first token is t23. So I need to see if S can produce something that starts with t23.\n\nLooking at the options, S \u2192 NT7 NT23 would mean the first part is NT7 and the second is NT23. The first part, NT7, isn't a terminal, so that doesn't directly give me t23. Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me see the productions again.\n\nWait, the production for NT7 is: \n\nNT7 -> 't48', as per the last line in the grammar: NT7 \u2192 t48.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then the first part would produce t48 and the second part NT23 would produce t23? So the first two tokens would be t48 and t23, which don't match the string's initial t23. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, S could be NT97 NT54. Let's see NT97 \u2192 t31 and NT54 \u2192 t12. So that would give us t31 t12 as the first two tokens, which also doesn't match the string's t23 t32.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the overall structure of the string and see if I can break it down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string: t23 t32 t4 t96 t68 t35 t85 t71 t57 t37 t37 t35 t66 t31.\n\nI notice that each production in the grammar ultimately ends in a terminal, so the string should consist of a series of terminals connected by the grammar rules. \n\nI'll try to parse the string starting from the root (S) and see if I can split it into parts that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can be NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. We saw that S \u2192 NT7 NT23 leads to t48 t23, which doesn't match the string, which starts with t23 t32. So maybe the other option: S \u2192 NT97 NT54 gives t31 t12, which also doesn't match. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe S can produce one of these two, but perhaps through multiple steps. Alternatively, perhaps I need to build up the string by matching production rules step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split into substrings where each substring corresponds to a production in the grammar. Each production in CNF has either one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps I can split the string into parts of one or two terminals, and see if those parts correspond to any of the productions. Let's list all the tokens: [t23, t32, t4, t96, t68, t35, t85, t71, t57, t37, t37, t35, t66, t31].\n\nNow, let's look at each production and see what terminals they produce. For example:\n\nLooking at NT96 -> t86. But in the list, I have t96, which isn't directly a production. Wait, wait, let's check the productions again.\n\nWait, for NT96: the production is `NT96 -> t86`. Similarly, NT86 is `t25`, but that's a production for NT86, which is actually 't25', but in our tokens, we have t85, which produces a non-terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm looking at it wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should go through each production and see which terminals they directly produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t48\n- NT23 \u2192 t62\n- NT40 \u2192 t71, t17, etc.\nWait, let me make a list.\n\nWait, perhaps it's too time-consuming to go through all of them, but I can look for tokens that directly correspond to a terminal production.\n\nFor example, t96 is produced by NT86 \u2192 t25? Wait, no, wait the production is NT86 -> t25 is not present. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, NT86 is present as: NT86 -> t25 (from line `NT86 -> t25`).\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t48\n- NT23 \u2192 t62 (from line 1: NT23 \u2192 t66 NT16? Wait, no, line 1 is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Wait, no, let me go through each production line.\n\nWait, the grammar has non-terminals that may produce other non-terminals or terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-239","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is provided with several production rules, and the string to evaluate is `t23 t25 t41 t53 t12 t19 t66 t48 t53 t51 t84 t86 t86 t48`. \n\nFirst, I should remember that CNF grammars have production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The goal is to check if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol, which here is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT93 NT54. Wait, but looking at the given grammar, I see S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. So, the S can branch into two different sets.\n\nThe string I'm checking is a sequence of t's followed by numbers. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, as per the grammar (e.g., NT54 -> 't12'). So, the string is fully in terminals; that means the derivation should start with S and reduce to this sequence step by step.\n\nI need to find a derivation path from S to the string. Since the string is 14 tokens long, and each production in CNF either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of steps needed should match the length minus one. Let me count the number of tokens: the string has 14 elements. For a CNF grammar, the derivation length should be such that n (number of symbols) = 2^k where k is the number of splits. But if there are terminals, the number of steps is n-1, but since it's a binary tree structure, the path length could vary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by looking for where the string can start matching the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t23 t25 t41 t53 t12 t19 t66 t48 t53 t51 t84 t86 t86 t48.\n\nI notice that t23 is the first symbol. Looking at the grammar, I see NT23 has several productions. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50, and so on. Also, NT23 appears in the initial productions: S \u2192 NT23 NT7, and S \u2192 NT23 NT54 (wait, no, S \u2192 NT97 NT54, so perhaps I got that wrong. Let me double-check the initial productions.\n\nWait, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So S can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nLooking further, NT23 has multiple options. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, but in the initial step, S can start with NT7 or NT97. Let's check where 't23' comes from. Since 't23' is a terminal, it should come from a production like NT23 \u2192 't23'? But looking at the grammar provided, I don't see any rule for NT23 that directly produces 't23'. The rules I see for NT23 are:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT96 -> NT43 NT53 (Wait, checking the list, actually: looking at the list, I see that NT23 has two productions, but not directly to 't23'. Wait, checking the given grammar more carefully, the list provided is a long list of production rules.\n\nWait, let me go through the rules again. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nSo, no direct production for NT23 to 't23'. So how does 't23' come about? Well, perhaps through a non-terminal that eventually reduces to 't23'.\n\nWait, in the initial productions, S can be NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So for S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then NT7 must reduce to 't23'. Looking at the rules: NT7 \u2192 't23'? Checking the rules, yes, I see NT7 \u2192 't48'. Wait, no, looking at the list, I have:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't48' (I think I have that correct.)\n\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't48' (Yes, under NT7 rules.)\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't23'. So if S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then NT7 must produce 't7...', but in the string, the first token is 't23'. So that can't be right. Alternatively, looking for where 't23' could come from. Wait, but S splits into NT7 and NT23. So if the first part is NT7, it becomes 't48', which would start the string with t48, but our string starts with t23, so that can't be.\n\nTherefore, the second initial production must be the one to consider: S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So NT97 produces 't31' and NT54 produces 't12'. But again, in the string, the first token is 't23', so that would come from one of the non-terminals in the first step.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. S can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So if I have the string starting with t23, maybe it's the NT23 part. So NT23 needs to produce t23. But looking back, I don't see any rule for NT23 \u2192 't23'. So perhaps I should check further down the rules for NT23.\n\nLooking through the given rules for NT23, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nBut that's it, no direct terminal production. So how does 't23' come into play? Maybe the NT23 is further reduced, but the problem is in the first step, S \u2192 NT7 NT23 would lead to a part starting with t48, which doesn't match the string's first token t23. So perhaps I need to look for paths where NT23 eventually leads to t23.\n\nWait, perhaps in a deeper step? Let's think about it. For example, if S \u2192 NT97 NT54, then NT97 \u2192 't31', and NT54 \u2192 't12'. So if that's the path, the first token would be t31, which doesn't match the string t23. So that must come from the other initial path: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Wait, but as we saw earlier, S \u2192 NT7 NT23. NT7 \u2192 't48', so the first token would be t48, which doesn't match t23. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the initial productions. Let me check the given grammar carefully.\n\nThe initial productions are given as:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nWait, looking back at the user's given grammar, yes, S can go to NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nBut according to the rules I see that S is split into NT7 and NT23, but NT7 \u2192 't48', so t48 is the result of NT7. But the first token in the string is 't23', which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look for other possible connections. Let's see where 't23' could come from.\n\nLooking through the rules, does any rule directly produce 't23'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't53'\nWait, no. Let me scan through the rules:\n\nWait, in the list:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't23'? Checking: I see NT53 \u2192 't33' (maybe), NT56 \u2192 't10', NT48 \u2192 't96', NT55 \u2192 't93', and so on. Wait, let me look for any production that ends with 't23'.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nHmm, no, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't23'. So perhaps 't23' comes from a non-terminal that eventually rules into 't23'. Let me check production rules that could lead to 't23'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT13 \u2192 't33', NT19 \u2192 't19' (directly), etc.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-259","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t96 t86 t66 t19 t35 t71 t54 t96 t99 t41 t23 t32 t87 t13 t93` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and the steps involved in parsing the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given string consists of a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S following the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, there are two productions:\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT7 followed by NT23 or NT97 followed by NT54. Let me check the string: the first two tokens are t96 and t86. Hmm, neither of the starting productions has these terminals. Wait, that can't be right because the string starts with 't96', which is part of the grammar. Let me check the grammar rules for NT96. Oh, here's NT96 -> NT86 NT98, and NT86 is present in the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this more methodically. Since the string starts with t96, I need to find which non-terminals can produce t96. Looking through the grammar, NT96 -> NT86 NT98. So, NT96 must be split into NT86 and NT98. Let's break down the string into parts that match these productions.\n\nThe string is:\nt96 t86 t66 t19 t35 t71 t54 t96 t99 t41 t23 t32 t87 t13 t93\n\nLet me group them into possible non-terminals:\n\nt96 could come from NT96. So, the first rule is S->NT97 NT54 or S->NT7 NT23. Neither match the initial 't96', so perhaps the first production is not used. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the string starts with t96, which is in NT96.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is using S->NT96 NT98? But the grammar doesn't have S directly producing NT96. So, maybe I need to see if there's a way to derive t96 from S through other productions. Alternatively, perhaps S can produce a path that eventually leads to NT96 and then breaks down into more non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. S can only directly go to NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So the string must start with either of those. Since the string starts with t96, which isn't part of S's direct productions, I must have made a mistake. Oh wait, perhaps the initial S can't produce t96 directly, so maybe the string isn't possible. But that can't be right because the string has t96, which is a production of NT96.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let me clarify: the grammar's non-terminals must be expanded until we reach terminals. So, S can only directly split into non-terminals, and those non-terminals must then split into other non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with t96, which must come from a non-terminal that can produce it. Looking at NT96's production: NT96 -> NT86 NT98. So, t96 must be the result of expanding NT96 into NT86 and NT98. Let me see where t86 comes in the string: the second token is t86, which is perfect because NT86 is present.\n\nSo the initial part is NT96 -> NT86 NT98, which gives us t96 t86 (since NT86 can produce t86 directly). Now, NT98 needs to be expanded. Let's look at NT98's productions. From the grammar, NT98 -> NT48 NT95. Wait, no, checking the grammar, I see NT98 -> NT48 NT95. So NT98 must be split into NT48 and NT95.\n\nNow, the string after t86 is t66. Let me see how that fits. The next tokens after t86 are t66, t19, etc. So, let's look for a way to get t66 after t86. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's step back.\n\nThe string is: t96 t86 t66 t19 t35 t71 t54 t96 t99 t41 t23 t32 t87 t13 t93\n\nAfter t86 (from NT96), we have t66. So, perhaps after NT86 (t86), the NT98 must produce something that includes t66 and subsequent terms. Wait, but NT98 -> NT48 NT95. So the next non-terminals after NT98 would be NT48 -> t48 (since I don't see NT48 productions in the grammar, except NT48 -> t48?). Wait, checking the grammar: yes, NT48 -> t96 and NT48 -> t86? Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT48 -> 't96' and NT48 -> 't86'.\n\nWait, but earlier, the grammar list includes:\n\nNT48 -> 't96'\n\nand \n\nNT48 -> 't86'\n\nWait, no, looking back, in the grammar provided, under the productions, I see:\n\nNT48 -> 't96' and other terms. Wait, the grammar's NT48 production is:\n\nHmm, let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT48 -> NT96\nNT95 -> 't41'\n\nWait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nThe user provided a long list of productions. Let me parse them correctly.\n\nFirst, NT96 is defined as:\n\nNT96 -> NT86 NT98\n\nNT48 is defined as:\n\nNT48 -> NT96\n\nThen under NT96, the NT96 -> 't48' is mentioned, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, let me look through the list again.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nNT48 is defined as:\n\nNT48 -> 't96'\n\nand another production:\n\nNT48 -> 't86'\n\nWait, let me check the exact list:\n\nThe productions under NT48:\n\nLooking through the list, under NT48, I see:\n\nNT48 -> 't96'\nNT48 -> 't86'\n\nAnd also, looking at other non-terminals, I might have missed some, but perhaps not. So NT48 can directly produce 't96' or 't86'.\n\nWait, but in the string after t86, we have t66. If NT98 is producing NT48 and NT95, then the sequence after t86 would be NT48 and NT95. NT48 can produce 't96' or 't86'. So 't66' comes after t86, which suggests that perhaps NT48 is producing 't66', but that's not possible because NT48 only produces 't96' or 't86'.\n\nHmm, this seems confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the string needs to be broken down into a series of productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting with possible S productions.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT7 NT23\n\nBut the string starts with t96, which isn't part of NT7 or NT23. So if S starts with NT7, the first terminal would be whatever NT7 produces. Looking at NT7 productions:\n\nNT7 -> 't48' and NT7 -> 't71'. So from NT7, we can get 't48' or 't71'. But the first token is t96, so this doesn't fit.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT97 NT54\n\nNT97's production is NT16 -> 't90', and NT97 -> 't31'. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nFrom the list, NT97 has two productions:\n\nNT97 -> 't31'\nNT97 -> 't16'\n\nWait, checking the grammar:\n\nNT97 -> 't93'\nWait, no, looking through the list, I don't see 't31' and 't16' as productions of NT97.

So each production is either generating two non-terminals (like A \u2192 BC) or a terminal (A \u2192 a). \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t85 t4 t23 t86 t84 t85 t12 t12 t93 t54 t17 t66 t32 t87 t41`\n\nI think the strategy here is to work backwards from the string, trying to see if we can derive it using the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree starting from S and see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to map each token in the string to the corresponding production rule and see if the entire string can be generated. Let's list each token and see which non-terminal they produce.\n\n1. t85: Let's see which A \u2192 a production generates 't85'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT46 \u2192 't37', NT48 \u2192 't96', NT50 \u2192 't53'... Wait, maybe I should look more carefully.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, NT46 \u2192 't37', NT48 \u2192 't96', but wait, in the initial productions, there's NT50 \u2192 't85'\u2014no, wait, the grammar part shows NT50 \u2192 't85'? Let's check. Oh, look here: \n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT50 \u2192 't85'? Or am I missing that? Let me go through the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT50 appears here: NT50 \u2192 't85'? Wait, in the given list, I see:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't85'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back at the grammar list:\n\nLooking through each production, the ones that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't93'\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't54'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't57'\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't84'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't99'\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't51'\n\nAnd others, but these are the terminal productions.\n\nSo, for each token, we need to find which non-terminal A produces it. Let me map each token in the string to the corresponding A:\n\n1. t85: Looking through the grammar, I see NT50 \u2192 't85'? Or wait, in the production list, there's NT50 \u2192 't85'? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list, under NT50: two productions? Or is it one? Let me recount. No, looking through:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't85' is not present. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT59 NT46\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT7 NT40\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't93'\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't54'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't57'\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't84'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't99'\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't51'\n\nAnd that's all the terminal productions. Wait, so none of them produce t85. So perhaps I'm looking at the wrong place. Maybe t85 is a non-terminal that somehow expands into a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check again. Oh! Maybe I made a mistake. Looking at the grammar, perhaps there's an NT96 \u2192 't96'? No, in the terminal productions, NT48 \u2192 't96'. So the production NT48 \u2192 't96' exists.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminal token 't85' is not present directly, but maybe it's generated by some non-terminal. Looking through the terminal productions again, I don't see any that produce t85. That's odd. So perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for NT46, there's a production NT46 \u2192 't37' and also NT46 \u2192 't13'. Wait, no, let me check the grammar again. Here's the full list of NT productions:\n\nLooking for 't85': Hmm, perhaps it's produced by a non-terminal that's deeper in the grammar. Let's see: For example, perhaps NT50 expands to something that then expands to 't85', but in the terminal productions listed, I don't see NT50 producing a terminal.\n\nWait, let me go through each terminal production again carefully:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't93'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT46 \u2192 't13'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT97 \u2192 't54'\n- NT1 \u2192 't57'\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n- NT40 \u2192 't17'\n- NT84 \u2192 't4'\n- NT84 \u2192 't84'\n- NT56 \u2192 't99'\n- NT66 \u2192 't51'\n\nWait, so none of these produce 't85'. That's a problem because the string starts with t85, so if it's not produced directly, we need to see if it's produced via some other path.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake and there is a production for t85 in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-286","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of production rules that expand symbols like S, NT7, NT99, etc., down to terminals (like 't48') and other non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t53 t41 t48 t90 t87 t99 t57 t19 t25 t12 t36 t84 t12 t12 t53 t41`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two terminals on the right, or two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, Chomsky normal form requires each production to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, some rules have 't' as the right-hand side. For example, NT54 \u2192 't12' or 't53'. So the grammar allows for productions that directly produce terminals. Got it.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. To check if this string is generated by the grammar, I can try to find a leftmost derivation in the grammar that results in this string. Alternatively, maybe a rightmost or middle derivation. But perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree or a derivation step by step.\n\nLet me look for the start symbol, which is S. The given grammar has two productions for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo the string must start with either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. The given string starts with t53, which is a terminal. So I need to see which of S's productions can lead to a string that starts with t53.\n\nLooking at the first production: NT7 and NT23. Let's see what those can produce.\n\nNT7 \u2192 't48' (from the given rules, looking up NT7's productions: yes, NT7 \u2192 't48').\n\nSo NT7 can produce 't48'. Now, NT23 has several productions. Let's check:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 (among others). Wait, but in CNF, non-terminals can only produce pairs of non-terminals or a terminal. So for NT23, let's see all its productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT23 \u2192 NT45, NT53? Wait, no: looking at the grammar, it seems that NT23 has multiple productions, some with two non-terminals and some with a terminal. So perhaps I need to see which of these can lead to 't41'.\n\nWait, the string starts with t53, which is the terminal. So maybe the other part of the S production is generating that. Let me check S's other production: S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nNT97 \u2192 't31' (from the rules, looking up: yes, NT97 \u2192 't31').\n\nAnd NT54 can produce 't12' or 't53' (looking up NT54's productions: yes, NT54 \u2192 't12' and NT54 \u2192 't53').\n\nAh, so if S \u2192 NT97 NT54, then NT97 produces 't31', and NT54 can produce either 't12' or 't53'. In the given string, the first two terminals are 't53' and 't41'. Wait, no, the string is: t53 t41 t48 t90 t87 t99 t57 t19 t25 t12 t36 t84 t12 t12 t53 t41.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write out the string properly: it's a list of tokens, so it's t53 followed by t41, then t48, and so on.\n\nSo the string starts with t53. So perhaps NT54 in S's second production can produce 't53'. Wait, checking NT54:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT54 \u2192 't12' or 't53'. So yes, NT54 can produce 't53'. So S \u2192 NT97 NT54, then NT97 produces 't31', which would be the first symbol of the string, but the string starts with 't53'. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, the S production via NT97 NT54 cannot start with 't53' because NT97 produces 't31'.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first production of S is the correct path, S \u2192 NT7 NT23, but NT7 produces 't48'. So the first part of the string would be 't48', but the given string starts with 't53', which doesn't match. So this suggests that S's first production is not what's being used here.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the given string, the first token is 't53'. That means the derivation must start with something that produces 't53'. So S must produce a string that starts with 't53'.\n\nLooking back at the two productions of S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23: NG1 produces 't48' (from NT7 \u2192 't48'), so it would produce a string starting with 't48', which doesn't match the given string's 't53'.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54: NG2. NT97 \u2192 't31', so the first symbol would be 't31'. But the given string starts with 't53', which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if both S productions start with 't48' or 't31', but the given string starts with 't53', then the string cannot be generated by this grammar. But that seems too straightforward\u2014maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar or the string.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules might clarify. Let's list all the NT rules and their productions.\n\nFor example, NT54 has two productions:\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals might have similar mix of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with 't53'. So perhaps there's a non-terminal production that directly produces 't53'.\n\nLooking at the given rules, let's see which non-terminals produce 't53'. Checking each:\n\nFor example:\n- NT53 \u2192 't85' (from the rules)\n- NT23 \u2192 't57' (from NT23 \u2192 't57') but wait, that's a terminal: yes, NT23 \u2192 't57' (from the given rules)\nWait, let me check all rules:\n\nLooking for 't53', is it produced directly by any non-terminal?\n\nLooking through the rules, yes:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't85' (one of the productions is 't85')\nWait, no\u2014looking back: Wait, is there a non-terminal that produces 't53' directly?\n\nLooking through the rules, each line is a production. For example, NT23 \u2192 't57' (a terminal), but that's in the rules. So wait, I see that some lines are for non-terminals producing other non-terminals, and others are directly producing terminals.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nFor each line in the grammar, it's of the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a (a terminal). Since it's Chomsky normal form, all productions have two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct form is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, any production that ends with a terminal must have exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, both terminals or both non-terminals.\n\nWait, the given rules include:\n\nFor example, NT23 \u2192 't57' (a terminal), but that would be B \u2192 a, which is allowed because in CNF, a single terminal is allowed on the right (as a production like A \u2192 a).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (a single terminal). So rules that have, say, NT23 \u2192 't57' would not be in CNF because it's only one symbol on the RHS. Hmm, that might be a mistake. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking again at the given grammar, some productions have the RHS as two non-terminals, others as a mix, or a single symbol (terminal). For example:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54 (two non-terminals)\n- NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54 (another production,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check the full list.\n\nActually, checking NT13's productions: it only says NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18. Then NT41 \u2192 't68', and NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT18.\n\nWait, so NT18 is defined as NT66 NT18. That seems like it can produce a string of NT66 followed by another NT66, etc. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So for NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT18, this allows for multiple expansions. So it's a chain that can lead to a certain number of NT66 followed by something else.\n\nBut let me see. The second token in the string is t13, which comes from NT13. Let me write down the sequence:\n\nString: t32 t13 t17 t10 t25 t25 t48 t71 t12 t31 t51 t12 t90 t35 t93 t85\n\nSo after t32 (NT8 \u2192 NT40 NT96), the next token is t13 (NT13). So let's see the expansion of NT8.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT40 NT96.\n\nNow, what is NT40? Looking up the grammar, NT40 has several productions. Let's list them:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT58 NT1\n- NT40 \u2192 NT56 NT40\n- Also, looking at NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT57, but that's not relevant here. Wait, let me check the full list for NT40.\n\nWait, the grammar as given has:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT40 NT96\n- NT8 \u2192 NT56 NT53\n\nBut for NT40, the productions are:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT58 NT1\n- NT40 \u2192 NT56 NT40\n- Also, NT40 \u2192 't71'\n\nWait, so NT40 has three productions: two to non-terminals and one terminal. So in the case of NT8 \u2192 NT40 NT96, then NT40 could be either a terminal or further expanded. But the first part is NT40. Let's see how it's handled.\n\nThe second token after NT8 is t13 (NT13), which is part of NT8's expansion via NT8 \u2192 NT40 NT96. So NT96 is another non-terminal. Let's look at NT96:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23 and NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT95.\n\nSo in this case, after t32 (NT8), the next part is t13 (NT13). But NT8 is supposed to produce NT40 and NT96. So after NT40 (which is the first part of NT8's production), what do we get?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the entire derivation step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. The grammar rules for S are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT99 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nThese are the two possible expansions for S. Let's see both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT99 NT7\n\nThen, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n\nNT7 \u2192 't48'\n\nSo let's see how Nt99 and NT7 are expanded.\n\nSo, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16.\n\nNow, NT66 is a non-terminal. Let's look at its productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT66 \u2192 NT28 NT18 or NT66 can be a terminal? Wait, no, looking at the production list, NT66 is never directly a terminal. Its only productions are to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT66 \u2192 NT28 NT18.\n\nSo, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, which then breaks down into NT66 \u2192 NT28 NT18 and NT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe starting from S and trying to see if the string can be generated from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to check if the string can be split into factors that are part of the grammar's derived strings.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the given string can be decomposed into the terminals and non-terminals as per the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first token, t32, which comes from NT8. So let me write S \u2192 NT8 NT54 according to one of its rules.\n\nWait, S has two options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT99 NT7\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nThe first option starts with NT99, which gives t66 and t16, but the string starts with t32, which is from NT8, so the first option is probably not used. Let me check:\n\nIf we take S \u2192 NT99 NT7, NT99 would produce something starting with 't66' and 't16', but the string starts with 't32', so this path is not helpful.\n\nThe second option, S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's see:\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nSo the first two tokens when using this rule would be t31 t12. But the string starts with t32, so this path is also not matching.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Because the first token in the string is t32. So neither option of S produces t32 as the first token. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no. S's first options are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT99 NT7. Let's see NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, and NT66 is a non-terminal, NT16 is another non-terminal.\n\nBut in the first token, the string is t32, which is a terminal, so that must come from NT8, as established before. But in that case, the initial expansion of S would need to include NT8 somewhere.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT99 NT7 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. If the string starts with t32, which comes from NT8, perhaps S is derived through another path that includes NT8.\n\nWait, but the start is S. So S needs to produce something that includes NT8 in its expansion.\n\nLooking back, none of the direct productions of S start with NT8.\n\nSo S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar consists of a set of production rules. Each non-terminal symbol is expanded into two other non-terminal symbols until we reach terminals. Looking at the rules, I notice that some symbols like NT54, NT97, etc., are mapped directly to terminal tokens with values like 't93', 't31', etc. Others expand further into two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t54 t84 t54 t13 t66 t96 t96 t54 t41 t99 t17 t41 t13 t86 t54 t35 t85`.\n\nMy approach will be to try to find a derivation path that expands the start symbol S into the given string. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production has two non-terminals on the left. I'll start by looking at the possible start rules and see if any of them can directly produce parts of the string.\n\nThe two initial productions are S -> NT7NT23 and S -> NT97NT54. Let's see each:\n\n1. S -> NT7NT23\n   NT7: From the list, NT7 isn't directly a terminal; looking through the production rules for NT7, it seems I don't see NT7 in any right-hand side. Wait, let me check all NT rules. Scanning through, I see NT40 -> 't71', NT48->'t96', but no NT7. So perhaps NT7 is a terminal. Wait, no\u2014looking at the first set of productions, NT7 is used but not defined? Or maybe it's a typo in the way the user presented it. Or perhaps NT7 is a terminal. But in the provided grammar, NT7 is used but not defined as a production; it's on the left side. That might be a problem because if NT7 isn't a non-terminal that expands, then how do we handle it? Maybe the grammar actually treats it as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me look again. The user presented the grammar as a series of S -> NT97NT54 and other NT -> ... So it's a typical context-free grammar with non-terminals on the left. But the string has 't54', 't84', etc., so the non-terminals need to expand into these tokens.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me look carefully. For example, NT16 -> 't90' and NT8 -> 't32', so some non-terminals directly produce terminals. But others expand into two non-terminals.\n\nSo S is either NT7NT23 or NT97NT54. But looking at the grammar, I don't see NT7 or NT23 in any of the right-hand sides. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n- The first line after S -> is NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n- Next, NT58->NT94 NT54\n- NT94->NT96 NT98\n- NT55->NT90 NT1\n- NT90->NT94 NT95\n- NT45->NT99 NT95\n- NT59->NT56 NT53\n- NT53->NT28 NT23\n- NT96->NT48 NT23\n- NT98->NT48 NT95\n- NT16->NT56 NT40\n- NT23->NT45 NT53\n- NT84->NT58 NT86 (and others)\n- Wait, I see NT84 appears in multiple production rules, but perhaps it's the same symbol.\n\nHold on, looking at NT84 in the grammar:\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- Also, NT86 -> ..., and NT58 -> ..., etc. But the user also has PT84 and NT84 in the right side? I think I might be mixing up NT84 and t84. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see that some grammar symbols have 't's attached, like NT97-> 't31', which suggests that those are terminals. So for example, NT97 produces a terminal 't31', while others expand further.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar rules, most of them have two non-terminals on the right until some points where they produce a terminal. So for example, NT54 -> 't12' and NT46->'t13', etc.\n\nWait, the key is to check if the given string can be split into such productions.\n\nThe target string is: `t54 t84 t54 t13 t66 t96 t96 t54 t41 t99 t17 t41 t13 t86 t54 t35 t85`.\n\nFirst, let me count the number of tokens: 17.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT...

The start symbol here is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce either NT99 followed by NT23 or NT97 followed by NT54. Since S is the starting point, the string must ultimately derive from one of these two paths.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into tokens. Each token corresponds to a production's right-hand side.

Wait, looking at the grammar, NT23 has a rule NT23 \u2192 t62 (from S). But for NT25, there's no direct rule. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, wait, in the grammar, \"t25\" seems to appear in NT25: NT25 \u2192 t25? But I don't see that in the rules provided. Maybe I made a mistake. Looking back, the user provided a long list of rules, but I only see \"t25\" without a production rule. Wait, no, let me check again: looking at the rules, I don't see NT25 \u2192 t25. So where does t25 come from? Maybe it's part of another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT25. Let me look for any rules that produce 't25'. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1\n- NT66 \u2192 t51 (wait, that's in an alternative rule, but earlier in the grammar, it's written as 't51' under NT66). Oh, no, looking again, the start is S, which splits into NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54. The NT99 then splits into NT66 NT16, which in turn splits into NT56 NT40, etc. I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to map each token to the production that can generate it.

For each token, I'll see if it's a terminal, so I can trace back how it can fit into the production tree.\n\n1. t13: NT13 \u2192 t13 (so NT13 is a leaf)\n2. t37: NT37 \u2192 t37 (leaf)\n3. t99: NT99 \u2192 t99 (leaf)\n4. t13: NT13\n5. t62: NT23 \u2192 t62 (leaf)\n6. t68: NT68 \u2192 t68 (leaf)\n7. t87: NT87 \u2192 t87 (leaf)\n8. t68: NT68\n9. t68: NT68\n10. t87: NT87\n11. t53: NT53 \u2192 t53 (leaf)\n12. t25: Hmm, where does t25 come from? I don't see a production rule for NT25 in the grammar. Unless it's part of a larger production elsewhere. Maybe I missed a rule. Let me check again. Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo or a misunderstanding. Hmm, perhaps NT25 isn't directly present; maybe t25 is part of another production. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces 't25', so that's a problem.

{"custom_id":"request-326","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, the grammar is quite extensive with multiple non-terminals and terminals. The string to evaluate is `t62 t35 t32 t33 t54 t62 t25 t4 t41 t31 t33 t4 t57 t51 t31 t36 t10 t41`.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. That might help in parsing the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nWait, I need to confirm if NT97 and NT54 are terminals, but no, in CNF, terminals are represented as terminal symbols, and non-terminals as NT followed by something. So I think NT97, NT54 are non-terminals. Wait, but in the grammar, some of them, like NT97, have productions that go to other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT97 \u2192 't31', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT54 \u2192 't12'.\n\nSo for S \u2192 NT7 NT23, I need to check if NT7 and NT23 can be derived into terminals. But wait, NT7's production is NT7 \u2192 't48', which is a terminal. NT23 has a couple of productions: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 or NT23 \u2192 't62'. So NT23 can be either 't62' or go further into NT45 and NT53.\n\nWait, let me take the string and see the sequence. The string starts with t62, so maybe that's from NT23 \u2192 't62'. Let's see, if NT23 is 't62', then the first part is 't62'. Then the next is t35, which I need to check if any non-terminal can produce that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there any NT that produces 't35'? Let's see. scrolling through the rules: NT53 \u2192 't85' and NT22 \u2192 't57' and NT7 \u2192 't48'. Hmm, not seeing anything for t35. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the productions for t35.\n\nWait, the NT productions are things like NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT95, etc. I don't see a production where the result is 't35'. So maybe 't35' isn't a direct production, which would mean the string can't be formed, but that might be too quick. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the string is 't62 t35 t32 t33 t54 t62 t25 t4 t41 t31 t33 t4 t57 t51 t31 t36 t10 t41'. Let me process it step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is t62. Looking at the grammar, NT23 can produce t62. So maybe the first NT23 is t62. Then the second symbol is t35. So which NT can produce t35?\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal symbols associated with non-terminals are at the end, like NT54 \u2192 t12, NT97 \u2192 t31, etc. I see NT56 \u2192 t99, NT98 \u2192 t48 NT95, and so on.\n\nWait, I'm looking for a production where a non-terminal directly goes to t35. But scanning through the productions, I don't see any NT with a \u2192 t35. That's odd. So does that mean t35 cannot be produced by any rule in the grammar? That would imply the string isn't in the language.\n\nBut before concluding, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar to see if any NT actually produces t35.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT95, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, etc. I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes t35. So, no, there is no such production.\n\nSo if the string requires t35, which isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, that would mean the string cannot be generated by this grammar.

I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol, S, by applying the productions step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two production rules:\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce two different sequences of two non-terminals each. Let's note that these are the starting points.\n\nI should check if the string can be derived starting from either of these rules. Let me try to map the string tokens to these productions.\n\nThe string is: `t25 t87 t71 t17 t4 t13 t86 t17 t51 t4 t87 t41 t54 t84 t86 t68 t10 t90 t41`\n\nWait, no, actually, the string is given as a series of tokens separated by spaces, so it's: ['t25', 't87', 't71', 't17', 't4', 't13', 't86', 't17', 't51', 't4', 't87', 't41', 't54', 't84', 't86', 't68', 't10', 't90', 't41']\n\nThat's quite a long string with 20 tokens. So, I need to find a way to parse this string by tracing back the production rules.\n\nI think the best approach is to try both possibilities for S and see if any of them can generate the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT7 NT23:\n\nNT7: Looking at the grammar, NT7 is not present in the rules. Wait, actually, in the grammar, some NT have productions with terminals, like NT54 \u2192 't12', NT97 \u2192 't31', etc. But looking at NT7, in the given grammar, I don't see NT7 defined as a production with a terminal. Wait, no\u2014the grammar has NT7 only on the left-hand side, maybe in S?\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The start symbol is S, and in the productions, S is expanded into NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So, the right-hand sides are NT symbols. None of these are terminals, so the string must be generated by expanding these NTs until only terminals remain.\n\nSo, starting with S, which expands into two NTs, and each of those can be further replaced until we reach the terminal tokens in the string.\n\nSo, the string has 20 tokens, so the derivation will have 20 steps, expanding each non-terminal until all are terminals.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a parsing approach, trying to match the string from left to right, consuming tokens step by step, trying to find a way to derive it using the given productions.\n\nBut manually doing this for 20 tokens is going to be time-consuming. Perhaps I can find patterns or see if the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the first token in the string and see if it can be matched by any production from NT7 or NT97 or the other NTs that lead to them.\n\nWait, the first token in the string is 't25'. So, I need to see if any production for NT7, NT97, or other NTs can produce 't25' as the first step. But looking through the grammar, most NTs only have other NTs on the right-hand side, except some have terminals. For instance, NT7 is on the right-hand side of some other productions?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all NTs and their productions to see if any lead to 't25'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12'\nNT97 \u2192 't31'\nNT40 \u2192 't71'\nNT8 \u2192 't32'\nNT56 \u2192 't10'\nNT95 \u2192 't41'\nNT28 \u2192 't36'\nNT8 \u2192 't19'\nNT41 \u2192 't68'\nNT54 \u2192 't12' (duplicate)\nNT46 \u2192 't13'\nNT48 \u2192 't96'\nNT94 \u2192 't87'\nNT46 \u2192 't37'\nNT23 \u2192 't62'\nNT48 \u2192 't86'\nNT13 \u2192 't33'\nNT97 \u2192 't54'\nNT1 \u2192 't57'\nNT18 \u2192 't96'\nNT16 \u2192 't90'\nNT28 \u2192 't66'\nNT40 \u2192 't17'\nNT84 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a list of all production rules leading to terminals, or perhaps more importantly, track how the string can be reduced.\n\nAnother strategy is to see if the string can be generated by S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nLet me explore the first case: S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nThen, the first NT7 and NT23 must produce the first 't25' and something else.\n\nBut wait, looking at the productions, NT7 is not a terminal; looking at the rules, only on the left are NT7 as a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see where the 't25' can come from.\n\nLooking at all the NTs, most have productions that go to other NTs or to terminals. Let's note that 't25' is the first token, so the first step is that either NT7 or NT97 or any other NT that can directly produce 't25' must be the start. But in the given grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't25'.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the first token is 't25', but none of the NT productions in the grammar have 't25'. So that suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go back through the grammar to see if any NT has 't25' on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT46 \u2192 't13'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT97 \u2192 't54'\n- NT1 \u2192 't57'\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n- NT40 \u2192 't17'\n- NT84 \u2192 't4'\n- NT84 \u2192 't84'\n- NT56 \u2192 't99'\n- NT66 \u2192 't51'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n- NT23 \u2192 't86'\n- NT84 \u2192 't23'\n- NT53 \u2192 't85'\n- NT40 \u2192 't35'\n- NT22 \u2192 't57'\n- NT7 \u2192 't48' (Wait, no, check the rules: in the NT7 rule, is it 't48'?

{"custom_id":"request-348","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. So, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a good start because it's structured in a predictable way. Each rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the string we're evaluating: `t71 t35 t10 t96 t12 t37 t31 t84 t35 t4 t35 t35 t85 t13 t99 t96 t93 t32 t31`. Hmm, that's quite a long string. My approach should be to parse the string backwards because, in Chomsky Normal Form, the parsing starts from the beginning, but sometimes working backwards can help. Alternatively, I can look for the start symbol, which is S.\n\nLet me see: the start symbol is either S -> NT7NT23. Wait, but looking at the first part, the rules are given as S can go to NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54, then other rules. So S is S -> NT7NT23, but looking at the string, the first token is 't71', so maybe that's from NT7 or NT23? Wait, no. Wait, NT7 is a non-terminal that can produce 't71' as per the rule NT7 -> 't48'? Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT7 -> 't48'. So if NT7 is part of a larger production, that 't48' would come from it.\n\nBut the string starts with 't71', which looks like a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see NT40 -> 't71', so 't71' comes from NT40. But in the S rule, S can go to NT7NT23 or NT97NT54. So let's think about that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by trying to break down the string into possible components that match the grammar rules. Since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, the string must be built by expanding each non-terminal in a top-down fashion.\n\nWait, let me think: the given string is a series of terminals. Each terminal is a token, so the entire string must be built by expanding the S symbol according to the rules, resulting in a sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me try to match the string backward, which is a common approach in parsing because each production starts from the left, but sometimes working backward can help find the rightmost non-terminal.\n\nThe last token in the string is 't31'. Looking at the rules, NT97 -> 't31', so that would mean that at the lowest level, the production must end with NT97. So that suggests that the last part of the derivation was 't31', which comes from NT97.\n\nLooking at the rules again, S can go to NT97NT54, so perhaps the last part comes from NT54. Wait, let's check NT54's rule: NT54 -> 't12' or 't53' or 't12' again? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, under NT54, I see two rules: NT54 -> 't12' and NT54 -> 't53'. Wait, no, looking again: I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT54 -> 't12' and also NT54 -> 't53'? Let me check:\n\nYes, here: NT54 -> 't12' and NT54 -> 't53'? Wait no, actually, I don't see NT54 being a terminal; looking back:\n\nWait, let me scan for NT54 rules. Yes, one of the rules is NT54 -> 't12' and another is NT54 -> 't53'? Wait, no, I think I misread. Looking back:\n\nIn the list, under NT54: it's:\n\nNT54 -> 't12'\n\nWait, that's one rule. Let me check again: Yes, the rules for NT54 are:\n\nNT54 -> 't12'\n\nWait, no, I think I'm mistaken. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT54, it's:\n\nNT54 -> 't12'\n\nWait, no, wait. Looking again, the grammar list shows:\n\nNT54 -> 't12' and another rule for NT54 -> 't53'?\n\nWait, let me make sure.

Wait, 't19' is a single terminal? Or is it 't8' with 19? No, it's a single terminal letter 't19' which is unusual because typically they are 'tXX' but maybe it's a typo. Wait, looking back, the string is `t66 t13 t62 t93 t51 t51 t10 t37 t86 t23 t62 t32 t4 t19 t23 t32 t13 t53 t35 t86`.\n\nWait, so in the string, I see 't66', 't13', 't62', 't93', etc. So in the grammar, I need to find NTs that derive these terminals. Let's check each possible terminal in the string:\n\n1. 't66': Looking for an NT that can produce 't66'. Let's see if any of the NT rules end with 't66'.\n\nFrom the rules given:\n\n- NT58 -> 't94' 't54' [not 't66']\n- NT94 -> 't96' 't98'\n- NT66 -> ... Wait, perhaps looking back, does any NT directly produce 't66'? Looking through the provided rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't66' as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's go through all NT rules that are terminals:\n\n- NT54 -> 't93'\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32' and 't19'\nWait, that's odd. So 't19' is a different terminal than 't32'. So in the string, 't8' should correspond to 't32' or 't19', depending on the NT.\n\nBut in the grammar, how are 't' different? Each 't' has a number, so 't66' is a distinct terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't93'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32' and 't19'\nWait, that doesn't make sense because NT8 has two different transitions: one goes to 't32' and another to 't19'.

{"custom_id":"request-363","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the provided grammar. It starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. From there, there are a bunch of other productions that break down these non-terminals into other non-terminals and eventually into terminals. The string I need to check is \"t96 t93 t93 t68 t35 t57 t41 t4 t13 t4 t53 t66 t4 t71 t62 t96 t51 t57 t23 t57\".\n\nWait, let me write that correctly: the string is \"t96 t93 t68 t35 t36 t57 t41 t4 t13 t4 t53 t66 t4 t71 t62 t96 t51 t57 t23 t57\". I'll count the tokens to see the length, but maybe I'll approach it differently. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of a derivation replaces exactly one non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. But for checking if a string is generated, it's more efficient to use the CYK algorithm or to parse the string as per the grammar. However, doing CYK might be time-consuming, so perhaps I'll try to see if I can break the string into possible steps according to the rules.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: 't96', 't93'. Let's see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nFrom the grammar, 't96' is produced by NT48 \u2192 t96. So that could come from NT48. But in the initial productions, S produces NT96 NT23. Let's see NT96. Checking the grammar, NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23, which are two non-terminals. So NT96 can expand into two parts, but how does that help?\n\nWait, maybe looking at the entire string is better. Let's split it into tokens:\n\n1. t96\n2. t93\n3. t68\n4. t35\n5. t36\n6. t57\n7. t41\n8. t4\n9. t13\n10. t4\n11. t53\n12. t66\n13. t4\n14. t71\n15. t62\n16. t96\n17. t51\n18. t57\n19. t23\n20. t57\n\nThat's 20 tokens. The grammar's initial symbols are NT96 or NT97, and S branches into those.\n\nLet me try to map this step by step. The initial S branches into either NT96 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54.\n\nLet's pick NT96 first. From NT96, the production is NT48 and NT23 (since NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23). We need to see if 't96' 't93' or similar can come from that.\n\nWait, 't96' can come directly from NT48 as per NT48 \u2192 t96, so that might be a possibility. But let's see how the entire string could be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting from the beginning of the string and seeing which tokens can match the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps reconstructing paths from the string backward. For example, looking at the last token 't57' and seeing which non-terminals produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't57', from NT50 productions. NT50 also can split into NT55 NT1, or NT59 NT46, etc.\n- NT57 appears as 't57' in NT50's production. Wait, in the grammar above, under 'NT50 -> 't57', but looking through the provided grammar:\n\nWait, under NT50, the only direct terminal is in the production NT50 \u2192 't57' only? Wait, actually, looking back, I see that in the given grammar, there's a NT50 -> 't57' directly. So yes, that's a production.\n\nSo 't57' can come directly from NT50. That means the last token 't57' is generated by NT50, which is fine.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, under NT50, looking at the productions, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Actually, looking at the grammar provided, one of the NT50 productions is NT50 \u2192 't57'. So that's a terminal.\n\nBut then earlier, I thought that NT50 had other productions, but let me recheck. The user-provided grammar lists:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT50 -> 't57' (direct terminal)\nOther productions for NT50: NT50 -> NT55 NT1, NT59 NT46\n\nSo 't57' is directly produced by NT50.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider the second last token is 't57', so the last symbol is covered by NT50.\n\nNow, moving backward, the token before that is the 19th token, which is the 19th token: 't57' is 19th, so the last two tokens are 19, 20: 't57', 't57'. Wait, no, the 20th token is 't57' as the last. Hmm, perhaps my token count is wrong.\n\nWait, the string is: t96 t93 t68 t35 t36 t57 t41 t4 t13 t4 t53 t66 t4 t71 t62 t96 t51 t57 t23 t57\n\nWait, that's 20 tokens. So the last token is 20: 't57'.\n\nSo, the last symbol is 't57', which is produced by NT50.\n\nSo, the last part of the string is generated by NT50, which comes from NT59 NT46 (since NT50 \u2192 NT59 NT46), or from NT55 NT1.\n\nBut in the last positions, the string ends with ...t23 t57. Hmm, wait, perhaps I need to reconstruct how these tokens could arise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps focusing on the start.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which can go to NT96 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nLet's pick NT96 first.\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23.\n\nNow, NT48 \u2192 t96. So the first token in the string is t96, so that would correspond to ND48 \u2192 t96.\n\nSo t96 is from NT48, which is part of NT96.\n\nSo the first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT96 NT23 \u2192 (NT48) (NT23) \u2192 t96 and NT23.\n\nSo now, we have the string starting with t96 and the remainder should come from NT23 and NT23? Wait, no. Wait, NT96 is replaced by NT48 and NT23. So after the first step, we have NT48 (which produces 't96') and NT23 (which we need to expand further).\n\nSo the first token 't96' is generated by NT48, and we now need to process the NT23 non-terminal to generate the rest of the string.\n\nSo the rest of the string after 't96' is t93 t68 t35 t36 t57 t41 t4 t13 t4 t53 t66 t4 t71 t62 t96 t51 t57 t23 t57.\n\nSo from NT23, we need to generate all these tokens.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT23 has several productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 (duplicate)\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50 (duplicate)\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT86 NT53\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT53 NT50\n\nWait, but let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided:\n\nNT23:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53 (repeated)\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50 (repeated)\n- NT23 -> NT86 NT53 (I think this is part of the other NT86 production)\nWait, perhaps the user provided"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-384","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, except for the initial productions which might have a terminal. But looking at the rules, it seems that most non-terminals on the left produce terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t31 t33 t99 t13 t4 t99 t53 t33 t51 t32 t68 t19 t66 t99 t99 t84 t32 t93 t62 t35 t12`. That's a lot of tokens. My goal is to parse this string using the given grammar's productions.\n\nI remember that one common way to handle CNF grammars is with a recursive descent parser or a Pratt parser, where each production rule is considered as a step in parsing, and the steps correspond to building a parse tree.\n\nI should list all the production rules and see how they can derive this string. Let's list the rules again for clarity:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23  \nS -> NT97 NT54  \nOther NT rules produce combinations of NT and terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t31`, which must come from some production of NT97, since in the grammar, NT97 -> 't31'. So the first two symbols would be 't31' and then the next token, which is `t33`.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT97 can only produce 't31', so the rule for NT97 is just 't31'. But the rule S can go to NT97 NT23, which would be 't31' followed by NT23. But wait, in the string, after t31 comes t33, not t32 as would be if NT97 -> 't31' and then NT23 could produce a t33.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine. Let's see: S can produce NT97 NT23. So that would produce 't31' followed by NT23. But looking at NT23 rules, they can produce different combinations.\n\nLooking at the NT23 rules: NT23 can go to 't62' or to NT45 NT53 or to NT23, NT23, etc. Hmm, maybe I should think about how the parser would split the string.\n\nWait, another approach is to start with S, which consists of two non-terminals: NT7 and NT23. The string starts with t31, which is 't31' from NT97. But S's rule is NT7 and NT23, so maybe NT7 is 't7' since in the grammar, NT7 -> 't7', and NT23 can produce 't62' or other things. So starting with t7 t62 would make S -> t7 t62, but the string starts with t31.\n\nAh, perhaps S is generated by NT97 NT23. So NT97 is 't31', and NT23 must produce something that followed by t33 and the rest.\n\nLooking at NT23's production: NT23 can be 't62', but in the string after t31, the next is t33. Or NT23 can produce NT45 NT53.\n\nLooking at NT45's production: NT45 is 't90'. Wait, no, looking back, the rule for NT45 is that it can produce 't90', or wait, no: checking the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT97 -> 't31'  \nOther NT7's: NT79? Wait, no, let me list all the NT99, etc., for clarity.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps.\n\n1. The string starts with t31, which must come from NT97. So the first part is NT97.\n\n2. The next thing after t31 is t33. So, after NT97's 't31', we need to get t33. Looking back at the grammar, after NT97, what comes next.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string step by step.\n\nParsing in CNF can be done by checking the start symbols and seeing if each part can be derived. Alternatively, I can simulate the parser by using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me sketch the string: t31 t33 t99 t13 t4 t99 t53 t33 t51 t32 t68 t19 t66 t99 t99 t84 t32 t93 t62 t35 t12\n\nWait, that's 21 tokens. So the first part is t31, which comes from NT97. Then after t31, we have t33. Let me look at the grammar to see what can produce t33 after NT97.\n\nWait, NT97 can be only 't31' directly. So I think that the production for NT97 is 't31', which consumes t31 and leaves NT23 to parse.\n\nSo after t31, the next part is t33. So NT23 must produce t33. But looking at the rules for NT23:\n\nNT23 -> 't62'  \nOr NT23 can produce NT45 NT53.\n\nWait, does any of these produce t33? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the NTx rules for x=23, do any produce t33? Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT28's production: NT28 can produce 't66' but also NT45 NT53, which would produce 't90' and NT53. Wait, NT53 can produce 't85' and NT53's rule is NT28 NT18. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT23 can produce 't33' via some other rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the NT23 rules. Let me re-examine the given grammar.\n\nLooking back, I see for example:\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16  \nNT58 -> NT94 NT54  \nNT94 -> NT96 NT98  \n...  \nLooking for something that when derived would give t33.\n\nWait, perhaps NT23 can split into NT13 NT41. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there's an NT13 -> NT41 NT18. So maybe T13 can eventually produce a terminal like 't33'? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT23 can produce NT13 NT41, and then those can give us t33.\n\nBut let me see step by step:\n\n1. S produces NT97 NT23. So first, parse 't31' from NT97, then parse the remaining string starting from t33.\n\n2. Now, the remaining string starts with t33. Let's see what NT23 can produce.\n\nLooking at the NT23 rules:\n\n- Directly can produce 't62' or split into NT45 NT53.\n\nSo, if NT23 produces t62, then that would match only 't62', but our string has t33 after 't31'. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, if NT23 splits into NT45 NT53, we need to parse 't33' as part of that split.

The string is \"t66 t19 t41 t90 t31 t51 t25 t41 t19 t12 t84 t71 t90 t66 t17 t10 t53 t32 t99 t25 t90\".\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, all the rules in the grammar should follow this structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see the start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo, S directly expands into two non-terminals. The next step would be to see if the string can be derived from these productions.\n\nThe string starts with 't66', which is a terminal. I need to check which rule in the grammar can produce 't66'. Looking through the productions, I find NT66 -> NT59 NT23. So, NT66 can be rewritten into two parts: NT59 and NT23. \n\nWait, but that's the next step. So, in the string, after 't66', the next part should be 't19 t41 t90 t31 t51 t25 t41 t19 t12 t84 t71 t90 t66 t17 t10 t53 t32 t99 t25 t90'.\n\nSo, assuming S expands into NT66 and NT23 (from S -> NT66 NT23), but looking back, S's possible first expansions don't include NT66 directly. Wait, in the grammar, is there an S -> NT66 NT23? No, it's either S -> NT7 NT23 or S -> NT97 NT54. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with 't66 t19...', so the first step is to see if any production starts with NT66. Looking at the grammar, NT66 -> NT59 NT23. So, perhaps we have to go deeper. Alternatively, perhaps I should parse the string step by step, expanding each part according to the grammar.\n\nLet me think about parsing. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation should produce the string. Alternatively, I can construct the parse tree and see if it fits.\n\nThe string has multiple parts, so I should try to split it into units that match the productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the entire string step by step.\n\n1. The first token is 't66'. From the grammar, NT66 -> NT59 NT23, but that's an expansion of 't66' into 't59 t23', so 't66' is in NT66. So, the first part is 't66', which must come from NT66.\n\nSo, starting with NT66, it splits into NT59 NT23. Now, 't59' and 't23' need to be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT59 -> NT56 NT53, but wait, no: looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT55 is defined.

{"custom_id":"request-405","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is: t41 t57 t36 t85 t57 t4 t86 t68 t10 t17 t10 t96 t13 t53 t17 t19 t87 t68 t99 t85 t71 t12\n\nFirst, I think I should look for the start symbol, which in the grammar is S. The rules for S are S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54.\n\nSo, if I can parse the string by recursively breaking it down according to the rules, then it should be acceptable. Let me list down the steps.\n\n1. Start with the entire string: t41 t57 t36 t85 t57 t4 t86 t68 t10 t17 t10 t96 t13 t53 t17 t19 t87 t68 t99 t85 t71 t12\n\nI need to split this into two parts based on the start rules. The first part when starting with NT7 NT23 would mean the beginning symbols are the words that can derive from NT7 and NT23. Similarly, from S's second rule, it's NT97 and NT54.\n\nI think I should attempt to parse the string starting with one option and see if it works.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols:\n\nt41 is a terminal, but in the grammar, we have production rules for NT41 -> t68, which is a terminal. So t41 is not directly a terminal, which is odd. Wait, no, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT41 -> t68\nSo, t41 is derived from NT41. But in the string, the first symbol is t41, which would require NT41 to produce it. But NT41's production is t68, which is another terminal, so how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Maybe I misread the grammar. Hmm.\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules:\n\nNT56 -> t10\nSo, in the string, after S, is t4 and t86. Looking at the option S->NT97 NT54. NT97 is t96, but in the string, the first symbol is t41, so maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, the first rule is S->NT7 NT23, so perhaps the first part is T7 and T23.\n\nBut the string starts with t41, which I don't see directly in the grammar, but perhaps through a derivation. Let me think.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, NT41's production is t68, but in the string, we have t41 as the first symbol. So unless there's a rule that produces t41, it's a problem.\n\nHold on, the problem is in the given grammar, is there any production leading to t41 directly? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT41's productions: NT41 is NT54 and NT95 because in the grammar, I see NT54 and NT99 -> NT66 NT16. Wait, no, wait:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT41's production: NT97 -> 't31'. Wait, no, that's NT97.\n\nWait, the NT97 rule is S->NT97, but looking at the NTs: NT56 -> t10. Are we looking at the right NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me make a list for each NT and their possible productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT56 -> t10\n- NT95 -> t41\n- NT7 -> t48\n- NT23 -> t62 or t58 or other?\nWait, no, wait. Let me parse each NT's production.\n\nStarting with NT: \n\nNT7: NT7 -> t48 (from the rules)\nNT23: NT23 -> t62 or t57 or something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of each NT and their productions to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me take each NT and list their productions:\n\n1. NT7 -> t48 (rule: NT77 -> 't47'? Wait the rule is NT7 -> 't48')\n2. NT23: Rules include NT23 -> NT58, NT23 -> NT13.\n   But the string starts with t41, t57, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see which parts of the string can be matched by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has 21 symbols, so the parse tree would be a binary tree of 20 splits, leading to the required number of symbols.\n\nBut that's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps I can trace the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to think about possible derivations that could lead to this string.\n\nLooking at the string: t41 t57 t36 t85 t57 t4 t86 t68 t10 t17 t10 t96 t13 t53 t17 t19 t87 t68 t99 t85 t71 t12\n\nFirst, perhaps S parses into two non-terminals, like NT97 and NT54.\n\nSo, S -> NT97 NT54.\n\nNow, let's look at NT97: According to the rules, NT97 -> 't31'. But the string starts with t41, so that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production is S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nNT7 is 't48', so that would take the first symbol as t48, but the string starts with t41. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps the first two symbols are t41 and t57, which may be the beginning of a derivation.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the string starts with a symbol that can only come from a specific NT.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t41. From the grammar, the only NT that produces t41 is NT95. Because in the rules, NT95 -> 't41'.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nYes, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t41, which could be derived from NT95. So perhaps the first part is NT95.\n\nBut then, how does the string start with t41? Wait, the string starts with t41 t57, so if NT95 produces t41, then the next symbol is t57. But NT95 only produces t41 as a terminal, so the next symbol would have to be another terminal or another NT.\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the grammar, each production for NTs either is a terminal (like NT95 -> t41) or a combination of two non-terminals (like NT23 -> NT45 NT53).\n\nSo, when we have a terminal in the string, it's directly matched by an NT's production that gives that terminal. The non-terminals need to be expanded into terminals through other productions.\n\nSo, for the string to start with t41, that must be produced by an NT that has a production ending with t41. From the grammar, that's NT95 -> t41.\n\nBut then, after NT95, what comes next? The string's next symbol is t57, which needs to be matched by another NT production.\n\nBut in this case, the NT95 can't produce t57; it just produces t41. So this suggests that perhaps the string cannot be generated because the first symbol t41 would require NT95, but the next symbol t57 cannot be derived from NT95, because NT95 only produces t41.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's a way to split the string so that the t41 is matched by NT95 and the next part is matched by some other NTs in a way that t57 is a result of combining other rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial split isn't S->NT97 NT54 or S->NT7 NT23 because that leads to symbols that don't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string cannot be derived from the given grammar because the first symbol t41 comes from NT95, but the rest of the string doesn't align.

{"custom_id":"request-406","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing and makes it easier to track the leftmost derivations.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t51 t62 t93 t86 t54 t53 t33 t33 t36 t19 t90 t25 t32 t4 t57 t66 t4 t84 t93 t36 t51 t41`.\n\nI'll note that all symbols except for the 't' followed by numbers seem to be terminals. Wait, actually, in the grammar, most of the symbols like S, NT99, NT58, etc., are non-terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t51, t62, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which in the first production goes to NT7 and NT23. So any string generated by the grammar must start with a derivation from S. However, looking at the string, it starts with t51, which is a terminal. So, if S cannot derive a terminal directly, I might need to see how the non-terminals can lead to these terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the left-hand sides are S and various NT... symbols, and all productions either go to two non-terminals or a terminal. But the terminals in the string are single-character 't's followed by numbers, so I need to see if these terminals can be reached through the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me check if the symbols in the string are covered by the grammar. For example, t51 is a terminal, and looking at the grammar, I see that NT51 is not present. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT66 \u2192 t51. So that means NT66 is a non-terminal that can produce t51. Similarly, t62 can be produced by NT28 because looking at the grammar, I see NT89 may not be present, but wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I don't see a production for NT66 \u2192 t51. Let me scan through the productions:\n\nYes, there's a production NT66 \u2192 t51. So NT66 can be a non-terminal that produces t51.\n\nSimilarly, t62: looking through the productions, I see that NT28 \u2192 t36 and t86. Wait, but t62 is a terminal. Checking the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal produces t62 directly. Wait, maybe I need to see if it's produced through a series of steps.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar's productions include NT28 \u2192 t36?

Wait, looking at the grammar, is there a production for a non-terminal that leads to t62? Scanning through, I see that NT28 \u2192 t36 and t86, and also that NT28 \u2192 nt23? No, in the first list, I see NT28 \u2192 't36' (as per the user's input), but looking again, the user's grammar has ND28 \u2192 't36' and also NT28 \u2192 't13'? Let me check the user's grammar again.\n\nWait, the user's grammar includes:\n\nNT28 \u2192 't36'\nNT23 \u2192 't86'\nNT23 \u2192 't13' ?\n\nWait no, let me recheck the user's grammar:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\nWait, so NT23 can produce NT13 and NT50. But in the terminal side, I see NT23 \u2192 't66' and 't86', etc.?\n\nWait, perhaps I misparsed that. Wait, in the user's grammar:\n\nLine: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\nLine: NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\nLine: NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\nLine: NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86\nLine: NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nWait, so NT23 can go to NT45 NT53, NT84 (since in a prior line it's NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86, but that's another NT84). Wait, no, perhaps the lines after that are for NT84 and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the productions more clearly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a mapping of non-terminals to their possible terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through the user's grammar, I can create a list where each non-terminal is mapped to the terminals it can produce:\n\n- S: NT7, NT23\n- NT7: 't48'\n- NT23: (looking through all productions, NT23 appears on the left-hand side of some productions, but as far as terminals, in production NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86, NT23 is a non-terminal elsewhere, so perhaps NT23 can produce t66 and t86 (from NT84: NT23 \u2192 't66'), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of each non-terminal and the terminals they can produce.\n\nLet me parse the grammar correctly:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-421","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a series of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT99, NT58, etc.) has productions that break them down into combinations of other non-terminals or terminal symbols. The terminals here are 't' followed by numbers, like 't7', 't31', etc. \n\nThe string to check is `t23 t32 t57 t17 t31 t68 t10 t51 t32 t93 t84 t86 t53 t48 t10 t4 t13 t35 t87 t32 t68 t33 t48`. It seems like it's broken down into tokens separated by spaces. My first thought is to parse this string using the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. This structure should make the grammar easy to apply using a recursive descent parser, but since I'm not actually writing a parser, I'll try to approach this as a human would.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top-level productions in the grammar. The start symbol is S, and from the production rules, S can be rewritten as either NT7\u2192NT23 or NT97\u2192NT54. So, the string starts with either 't23' or 't31'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't23'. Let's see if the first possible production S \u2192 NT7\u2192NT23 can produce this. \n\nNT7 has the production NT66\u2192NT16. Wait, no, let me check. Looking back, NT7 is actually Nterminal 7. Scanning through the rules, I see NT79 is a possible production, but looking again, it's not. Wait, let me find NT7. Looking at the rules, I see there's NT7\u2192...? Let me scan through the list.\n\nWait, the rules are given as S \u2192 NT7 NT23, S\u2192NT97 NT54, so NT7 and NT97 are the first parts. Let me check NT7's production. Scanning down, I see NT79 is written as NT99? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.\n\nWait, actually, each line is a rule. For example, the first line after S is S \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT23. So NT7 has a production NT66 \u2192 NT16. Let me look for NT7's rules. I see NT76 perhaps? Wait, maybe I miswrote it. Let me go line by line.\n\nWait, the first line is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Then S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Next, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16. Then NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54. Continuing, NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98. OK, so NT97 has production NT54, but does NT97 have any other rules? I don't think so. Wait, I need to see what NT97 is rewritten into. Wait, no, the production rules are for the non-terminals. So NT97 is on the left side in S\u2192NT97 NT54, and maybe NT97 has its own production. Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see NT97 having any other productions besides possibly itself. Wait, maybe I'm missing it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the non-terminals and their possible productions to get a clearer picture. Let me go through each rule:\n\nS \u2192 NT7\u2192NT23\nS \u2192 NT97\u2192NT54\n\nThen NT99\u2192NT66\u2192NT16\n\nNT58\u2192NT94\u2192NT54\n\nNT94\u2192NT96\u2192NT98\n\nNT55\u2192NT90\u2192NT1\n\nNT90\u2192NT94\u2192NT95\n\nNT45\u2192NT99\u2192NT95\n\nNT59\u2192NT56\u2192NT53\n\nNT53\u2192NT28\u2192NT23\n\nNT96\u2192NT48\u2192NT23\n\nNT98\u2192NT48\u2192NT95\n\nNT16\u2192NT56\u2192NT40\n\nNT23\u2192NT45\u2192NT53\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should create a list of all non-terminals and their immediate productions.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nS: NT7\u2192NT23, NT97\u2192NT54\n\nNT7: NT66\u2192NT16\n\nNT97: (Only appears on the right side in S's production, so I don't see a direct production, maybe it's terminal?)\n\nWait, looking through the rules, do any non-terminals appear as leaves (terminals)? The terminals are t followed by numbers, but I don't see t as a terminal; t is part of the terminals, like 't7', 't31', etc. So every production that reduces to a terminal is a terminal production.\n\nSo looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't62'\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n\nYes, that's one. So NT97 has a production to 't31'.\n\nSimilarly, checking others:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't32'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't84'\n\nOthers I can see:\n\nNT90 \u2192 't94' 't95'\n\nWait, let's check each rule:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7\u2192NT23\n\nBut in the list, NT7 has production NT66\u2192NT16.\n\nNT66\u2192 NT51 \u2192 t51\n\nSo NT66\u2192 NT51, and NT51 is a terminal? Or does it have further rules? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT51 is a non-terminal? Let me see: Is there a rule for NT51? Looking through the list, I don't see NT51. Hmm, but in the rules I have, NT51 is used in NT66\u2192 NT51 \u2192 t51.\n\nWait, but NT66 is derived from NT51. So NT51 must have a production to 't51' because in that case NT51 is a terminal. Or does it have a rule to another non-terminal? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT51 as a non-terminal on the left side, so if NT51 is on the right side, and the grammar is in CNF, then NT51 must be a terminal. Because in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right. So if NT51 has a production, it must be to a terminal. So I can assume NT51 \u2192 't51'.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals would be where a non-terminal is rewritten to a terminal.\n\nSo putting that aside, let's see if the string can be built up.\n\nThe string starts with t23. Let's look at S's productions. S can go to NT7\u2192NT23 or NT97\u2192NT54. The first token is t23, so we need to see if t23 is the result of NT7's path or NT97's.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT7 has a production NT66\u2192NT16. Then NT16's production is NT56\u2192NT40. NT40's production is 't71' or is that NT40\u2192't71'? Wait, looking back, I see NT40\u2192 't71' as a terminal production. So NT40 can be t71.\n\nWait, let me re-express this. For NT7\u2192NT66\u2192NT16\u2192NT56\u2192NT40\u2192t71.\n\nWait, but the first token is t23. So perhaps the S\u2192NT7\u2192... path is not the right one because t23 isn't in the end of that path. So perhaps we pick S\u2192NT97\u2192NT54 and see if that produces t23.\n\nBut in NT54's production, we have several options. Let me check NT54. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54.\n\nWait, looking for NT54's productions.

{"custom_id":"request-426","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol. CNF also implies that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe given string is `t53 t71 t96 t41 t84 t85 t37 t19 t84 t93 t37 t96 t12 t33 t87 t71 t57 t17 t66 t57 t37 t93 t36`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar has a number of production rules, each either combining two non-terminals or producing a terminal symbol. My task is to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, according to the grammar, S can produce NT7 NT23. So, the first step is to split S into NT7 and NT23, and each of them needs to derive into their respective terminal sequences.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts that might correspond to NT7 and NT23. Each NT node will expand into a sequence of terminals. Let's list all the NTs and see their productions.\n\nLooking at NT7: The production is NT7 \u2192 't48' (from NT7 -> 't48'). So, NT7 corresponds to 't48'.\n\nNext, NT23: There are multiple productions for NT23. Let's see: NT23 \u2192 't62', 't32', or combinations. Wait, the grammar for NT23 has:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53 (duplicate)\nNT23 -> NT48 NT23\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user input had some repetition, but each production is unique. Let's recheck the grammar provided.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, some lines are duplicated, which might be errors, but I think the key point is that each non-terminal has a fixed set of productions. For example, NT23 has two different productions:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- Also, is there another production? Looking again, yes, there is NT23 -> NT48 NT23, which is a recursive production. Also, there's another line: NT23 -> 't62'.\n\nWait, looking back at the given grammar, under NT23:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT48 NT23\nWait, no, actually, the lines are:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT23 -> NT48 NT23\nWait, let me count the actual lines. From the initial list, under NT23, there's:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT48 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n\nHmm, three productions for NT23. One produces a terminal, and the others are recursive.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions, so NT23 can produce t62, t32, or recursively produce more NTs.\n\nWait, no, looking at the specific lines:\n\nWait, no, the NT23 is under the initial grammar as:\n\nLine 20: NT23 -> NT45 NT53\nLine 21: NT23 -> NT13 NT50\nLine 22: NT23 -> NT48 NT23\nLine 23: NT23 -> NT48 NT23 (repeated, perhaps a typo)\nWait, looking at the user's input, the grammar seems duplicated, but focusing on unique productions for each non-terminal:\n\nI think the key ones are:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT23 -> NT48 NT23\nAnd also, another line: NT23 -> 't62'.\n\nWait, looking again, in the user's input, under NT23, the productions are:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT23 -> NT48 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT48 NT23 (duplicate)\nWait, but actually, the user's input includes more lines, perhaps with duplicates. I think it's best to extract the unique productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fourth line is a different production. Looking at the initial data:\n\nThe given grammar is a list of rules, each starting with a non-terminal, then arrow, then right side.\n\nLine 15: NT53 -> 't85'\n\nLine 16: NT40 -> 't17'\n\nLine 17: NT84 -> 't4'\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse each non-terminal and their productions from the provided rules.\n\nBut this might take time. Alternatively, for this problem, perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree for the given string, starting from S and seeing if we can expand the non-terminals step by step.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and NT7 is 't48', then the first token in the string should be 't48'. But the string starts with 't53', which is not 't48'.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because S expands to NT7 NT23, which would equate to two non-terminals that must produce the first two terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is 't53'. So, the first non-terminal (NT7) must produce 't53', but according to the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't48'. Therefore, the first token should be 't48', but it's 't53' instead. Therefore, this is impossible. So the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nYes, looking back, the rule for NT7 is indeed NT7 \u2192 't48', so the first step of the parse would require the first terminal to be 't48', but the string starts with 't53' which is from NT53, for example. But in the start symbol S, the expansion is NT7 NT23, so the first two terminals must come from NT7 and NT23. So if NT7 is 't48', the first token must be 't48', but it's 't53' instead.\n\nSo that's a direct contradiction. Thus, the string is not in the language generated by the grammar.\n\nBut just to be thorough, perhaps the user's grammar has more productions that I've overlooked, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT7 is followed by another rule? No, the grammar has S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and each of these is a single non-terminal, not split further. So each non-terminal must derive a sequence of terminals starting immediately.\n\nTherefore, the first non-terminal (NT7) must produce the first terminal of the string, which is 't53'. But NT7 only produces 't48', so it's impossible.

The correct string is: `t99 t93 t84 t57 t84 t99 t48 t17 t57 t17 t32 t10 t53 t36 t86 t86 t85 t93 t66 t93 t23 t90 t54 t23`.\n\nWait, no, in the user instruction, it's written as `t99 t93 t84 t57 t84 t99 t48 t17 t57 t17 t32 t10 t53 t36 t86 t86 t85 t93 t66 t93 t23 t90 t54 t23`. I think I need to parse this correctly.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is left-hand side with two symbols on the right. The start symbol is S, and the rules involve NT and t followed by numbers. The letters like 't' are terminals, while the NT parts are non-terminals.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from S using these rules. So I need to break down the string into the sequence of symbols and see if they can form a derivation tree starting from S.\n\nLet me list the string: [t99, t93, t84, t57, t84, t99, t48, t17, t57, t17, t32, t10, t53, t36, t86, t86, t85, t93, t66, t93, t23, t90, t54, t23].\n\nI think the approach is to look for parts of the string that match the right-hand sides of the grammar productions. Each production has two non-terminals on the RHS, except for the terminals like t99, t93, etc. So starting from the start symbol S, which produces two non-terminals, each of those non-terminals would then produce two non-terminals, and so on, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut the complexity here is that the string has 24 symbols, which is a lot. I need to see if it can be broken down step by step using the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse the process: try to match the string against the grammar by breaking it down into the smallest possible units that match the productions.\n\nFirst, looking for NTs that produce two terminals. Let's see what the production rules are. The grammar has a lot of rules, some lead to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n- NT58 -> NT94 NT54\n- NT94 -> NT96 NT98\n- NT55 -> NT90 NT1\n- NT90 -> NT94 NT95\n- NT45 -> NT99 NT95\n- NT59 -> NT56 NT53\n- NT53 -> NT28 NT23\n- NT96 -> NT48 NT23\n- NT98 -> NT48 NT95\n- NT16 -> NT56 NT40\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT99 -> NT28 NT18\n- NT13 -> NT41 NT18\n- NT90 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT50 -> NT55 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT40 NT96\n- NT58 -> NT22 NT8\n- NT98 -> NT40 NT90\n- NT1 -> NT88 NT53\n- NT50 -> NT59 NT46\n- NT88 -> NT7 NT40\n- NT54 -> 't93'\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT8 -> 't19'\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n- NT94 -> 't87'\n- NT46 -> 't37'\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n- NT48 -> 't86'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT97 -> 't54'\n- NT1 -> 't57'\n- NT18 -> 't96'\n- NT16 -> 't90'\n- NT28 -> 't66'\n- NT40 -> 't17'\n- NT84 -> 't4'\n- NT84 -> 't84'\n- NT56 -> 't99'\n- NT66 -> 't51'\n\nLooking for NT rules that produce two terminals, I can see some:\n\n- NT54: 't93' (so when NT54 produces 't93', but according to the rule, NT54 can go to 't93' but I think it's more precise to see that NT54 -> 't93' when it's NT54 -> 't53'? Wait, looking back. Some rules might have letters after NT, like NT54 -> 't93' meaning that when NT54 is on the left, it produces the terminal symbols t93. So, for example, NT98 -> 't40' 't90' would mean NT98 can produce 't40' followed by 't90'.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the rules are written as NTa -> NTb NTc. So some non-terminals on the right are terminals, others are NTs.\n\nWait, in the rules, some have 't' followed by digits. For example, NT54 -> 't93' \u2014 so when NT54 is expanded, it produces t93 as a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the string, I see t99, t93, t84, etc. So each of these must be generated by some NT rule.\n\nWait, but no, in the rules, the non-terminals can only produce terminals or other non-terminals. So for example, NT54 can produce 't93' as a terminal, but in the grammar, NT54 is a non-terminal that can produce multiple things. Like NT54 -> 't93' is one possibility, but there are other rules where NT54 might be on the RHS, like NT88 -> 't7' 't40' and some other rules.\n\nWait, sorry, clarification: in the provided grammar, most rules have two non-terminals on the right, except for some that have 't' followed by numbers. So, for example, NT54 can produce 't93', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT84 has a rule NT84 -> 't4' and another rule 't84', so NT84 can produce 't4' or 't84' as terminal(s) or non-terminal(s).\n\nWait, no, actually, it's written as NT84 -> NT58 NT86 (which is two NTs), and NT84 -> 't4' (which would be a single terminal), and another rule NT84 -> 't84' (another single terminal). Wait, how does that work? Because in Chomsky normal form, each production must have exactly two symbols on the RHS. But in the provided grammar, some rules have two NTs, others have one NT or one terminal. Wait, that's not possible because each production in CFG must have exactly two symbols on the RHS. So perhaps in the provided grammar, some rules have the structure NTa -> NTb T, meaning that's a production where one side is a non-terminal, and the other is a terminal. So for example, perhaps NT28 -> 't36' is a production (but I don't see that in the given rules).\n\nWait, let's double-check the given grammar. The right-hand sides of all the productions are written with two symbols, which can be NTs or terminals. So for example, looking at the NT54 rule: NT54 -> 't93' is written as a production, which is just a single terminal.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

It has several productions that start with NT followed by two other non-terminals, and some that replace directly to terminals. For example, NT54 -> 't12' and NT97 -> 't31' etc. So, the key is to parse the string by applying these productions step by step.\n\nI guess the approach is to start with the entire string and try to break it down into smaller parts using the reverse of the grammar rules.

Let's attempt to break down the string into the grammar's components.\n\nFirst, the entire string is:\n\nt86 t31 t36 t31 t54 t48 t51 t62 t13 t57 t68 t25 t41 t12 t19 t41 t53 t85 t87 t10 t86 t25 t86 t84.\n\nThat's quite a long string with 23 tokens.\n\nLet me see the possible starting points. S can derive into two options: NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. The string starts with t86, which isn't 't7' or 't97', so perhaps the other way around.\n\nWait, maybe I should note that the start symbol is either S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Neither of these directly corresponds to the first token of the string, which is t86. So maybe the first step is to figure out which of these productions could possibly fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of these non-terminals (like NT7, NT97, etc.) have rules that can lead to the string. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the NTs and their final terminal expansions. For example, NT97 -> 't31', NT54->'t12', NT23 is involved in several rules, like NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to process the string from left to right, trying to match the rules as we go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's manageable since each production is a binary split. We can model this as a parsing strategy, like the recursive descent parsing, but in reverse.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a recursive approach, starting from the top symbol S and trying to split the string accordingly. Let's attempt that.\n\nS can be NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nThe string starts with t86. Let's see which of the options could potentially produce a left part starting with t86.\n\nLooking for NT* that expands to a string starting with t86.\n\nWait, the first option is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Let's see what NT7 might expand into. Looking at the grammar, I don't see a production for NT7 leading to a terminal. Only possible if it's further expanded, but let's check:\n\nLooking through the NTs, I don't see NT7 -> something terminal. It must be expanded further.\n\nWait, the given expansions for some NTs are provided. For example:\n\nNT54 -> 't12'\n\nNT97 -> 't31'\n\nNT28 -> 't66', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the parsing should be done by repeatedly splitting the string into two parts according to the grammar rules until all tokens are matched.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step.\n\nGiven the string: t86 t31 t36 t31 t54 t48 t51 t62 t13 t57 t68 t25 t41 t12 t19 t41 t53 t85 t87 t10 t86 t25 t86 t84.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Then the token sequence should correspond to NT7 (something) and NT23 (something). So perhaps the string can be split into two parts: the first part matched by NT7, and the second part matched by NT23.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT97 NT54 is the starting point, with NT97 producing the first token 't97', but the string starts with 't86', so that's not matching. Therefore, perhaps the correct starting production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, start with S expanding to NT7 NT23. Now, the first part must be matched by NT7, and the second part by NT23.\n\nSo, the string is: t86 t31 t36 t31 t54 t48 t51 t62 t13 t57 t68 t25 t41 t12 t19 t41 t53 t85 t87 t10 t86 t25 t86 t84.\n\nWait, but the first token is t86. Does NT7 produce t86? Looking at all NT rules, I don't see any NT that directly outputs t86 as a terminal. So, it must be derived from a non-terminal that eventually expands to t86. For example, perhaps NT86, but I don't see NT86 in the productions. So maybe NT7 expands into NT86, and then that into t86.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, none of the NTs directly produce t86 except perhaps indirectly. Let me see: NT7 could be expanding into a chain that leads to t86.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and perhaps I should look for another starting point.\n\nAnother thought: The string starts with t86. Let me check which NTs can lead to t86.\n\nLooking at the 'terminal' productions: NT86 doesn't exist, but perhaps NT86 is a terminal? Wait, no. Looking at the productions, all terminals are when NT97 is 't31', NT54 is 't12', etc. The only ways to get terminals are via these specific substitutions, except for the cases where NT is immediately replaced by a terminal.\n\nSo, maybe looking at how t86 can be produced. For example, perhaps looking for a rule where replacing a non-terminal leads to 't86'.\n\nLooking through all NT rules, I don't see that. Unless perhaps, NT46 \u2192 't37', and is part of a larger rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see which components of the string can match the rules.\n\nLet me consider the first token, t86. Perhaps it's an intermediate non-terminal, like NT46, which expands to 't37', but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's derived from a larger chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts according to the grammar's rules, like looking for two parts that can each be matched by NT7 and NT23.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to model this as a parser, trying at each step to match the string with the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, I remember that in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where A is a terminal and a is a terminal symbol. Wait, but looking at the grammar provided, I see that some symbols on the right-hand side are actually terminal symbols. For example, I see NT54 -> 't93', which means 't93' is a terminal. So, in this grammar, many of the productions have terminals on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t31 t41 t19 t57 t32 t17 t10 t10 t31 t32 t53 t71 t99 t19 t17 t37 t35 t53 t51 t53 t62 t66 t86 t87 t85.\n\nFirst, I need to parse this string into tokens. It looks like it's already a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. So I don't have to worry about tokenization; each part is a separate token.\n\nNext, I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm or a similar parsing method. But since the grammar is somewhat complex, maybe I can try to trace the string through the grammar rules step by step.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model this as a tree and see if the string can be constructed by combining the non-terminals. But that might get complicated. Maybe I can start by breaking down the string into parts that correspond to the non-terminals and see if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list out the string again: t31, t41, t19, t57, t32, t17, t10, t10, t31, t32, t53, t71, t99, t19, t17, t37, t35, t53, t51, t53, t62, t66, t86, t87, t85.\n\nWait, let me look at the productions again. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t31, t41, t19, t57, t32, etc. I know from the grammar that NT97 -> 't31', so the first production must start with NT97. So the first part of S is NT97 NT54.\n\nSo the first token is t31, which is from NT97. Then we need to see what follows NT97. Let's look at the context where NT97 appears.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT97 \u2192 't31', so after NT97, there should be a production that starts with NT54. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT97 is only the production NT97 \u2192 't31', which is a terminal. So after NT97, in the string, the next part must be derived from NT54.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me clarify. The start symbol is S, which can go to NT97 NT54. So the string must start with the production of S, which is either NT97 NT54 or NT99 NT23. In our case, the string starts with t31, which is from NT97, so the first part is NT97 and the second is NT54. So the first two symbols in the string should correspond to NT97 and NT54. But looking back, after t31, the next token is t41, which I don't think is a terminal. Let me check the grammar rules for NT54.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT54 \u2192 't12'. So if the second part is NT54, it should produce a terminal t12. But in our string, after t31, the next token is t41, which is not t12. So that would mean that this path is impossible. Maybe I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the order wrong. The start S produces NT97 NT54, so the string must start with t31 from NT97, followed by whatever NT54 can produce. But NT54 produces 't12'. So if the string starts with t31, the next symbol should be t12. But in the given string, after t31 comes t41, which doesn't match t12. So perhaps the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine. Alternatively, maybe the string is generated by the other production of S, which is NT99 NT23. Let's see. NT99 is a non-terminal, so let's see what it produces.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 can produce NT66 NT16. So NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16. So the first part of the string would be NT99, producing NT66 and NT16. Both are non-terminals, so each would need to be expanded.\n\nAlternatively, the string could start with NT97, but that leads to t31 followed by t12, which doesn't match the given string.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the string is generated by S \u2192 NT97 NT54. S produces two non-terminals, so the string should be split into two parts corresponding to NT97 and NT54.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t31, which is from NT97. The next token is t41, but NT54 is supposed to produce 't12', not 't41'. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nBut let me make sure. Maybe there's a way to derive t31 t41... from S through a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps S can produce NT97 NT54, which would give t31 followed by the expansion of NT54. But NT54 can't produce t41, so that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way that NT54 could produce t41? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT54 \u2192 t41. It's only NT97 \u2192 't31', so that doesn't seem possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the string is split into NT97 and NT54. Maybe the string is structured differently. Let me consider the entire string and see if it can be divided into subsequences based on the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with NT99 NT23, which is another production of S. So maybe the string begins with NT99, leading to two non-terminals that can produce t31, etc.\n\nWait, let me check: NT99 --> NT66 NT16. ThenNT66 --> 't51' (from NT66 \u2192 't51') and NT16 --> 't90'. So that would be t51 t90. But the first part of the string is t31, so that doesn't seem to match.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe the string cannot be parsed by the grammar because the terminals don't match the possible productions. Since the first symbol is t31, which only comes from NT97, but after that, the next symbol must be t12, which it isn't.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

All productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, including when one of B or C is a terminal, but the grammar provided seems to follow this structure since every rule has two symbols on the right.\n\nThe string to analyze is a concatenation of terminal symbols (like 't54', 't87', etc.) and non-terminals (like NT59, etc.) wait, no\u2014the string consists entirely of terminal symbols. So each token in the string is a terminal, which suggests that the entire string must be derived through the grammar by expanding non-terminals into sequences of terminal symbols via the given productions.\n\nBut wait, the grammar has some rules where a non-terminal is directly mapped to a terminal. For example, NT97 \u2192 't31', NT54 \u2192 't93', etc. So the string must be buildable by expanding non-terminals into their corresponding terminals step by step, considering the production rules.\n\nThe string is quite long, so I need a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is made up of 25 tokens. Each token is either a 't' followed by a two-digit number (like 't54', 't87') or, wait, looking back, the grammar has a mix. Some entries, like NT54 \u2192 't12', so that when NT54 is expanded, it becomes 't12'. So the terminals are either letters and numbers or, in some cases, the grammar may produce a terminal from a non-terminal.\n\nBut looking at the list of grammar rules, the right-hand sides vary. Some are two non-terminals, some are a non-terminal and a terminal, and some are two terminals. For example:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT50 \u2192 't85'\n- Others are two non-terminals.\n\nBut in the given string, all the tokens are terminals (like t54, t87, t23, etc.), with no non-terminals except possibly some that I might have missed. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see lines like NT50 \u2192 NT55 NT1, NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98, etc. So non-terminals are used in production rules, and sometimes those non-terminals correspond to terminals as per certain rules.\n\nSo to check if the string is generated, I need to see if there's a parse tree that, when reduced using the grammar rules, yields exactly the given string. Since the string is all terminals, all non-terminals in the parse tree must have been expanded into terminals, and the structure must match the production rules.\n\nGiven the string length, it's 25 symbols, so the parse tree must have a certain structure. Let's denote the string as S1: t54 t87 t23 t66 t10 t90 t31 t31 t32 t99 t51 t41 t90 t53 t62 t48 t57 t4 t12 t31 t35 t35 t19 t25 t25.\n\nBut wait, the initial grammar starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23, so the root is a non-terminal NT7 and NT23. But each of these could be expanded into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking more closely, in the given grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\n\nSo the top-level string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT7 and NT23. Let's see what NT7 and NT23 produce.\n\nLooking up NT7:\n\nWait, I'm going to scan the grammar for NT7.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has entries like:\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\n\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\n\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\n\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\n\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\n\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\n\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\n\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\n\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\n\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\n\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nSo, perhaps I should start by trying to parse the first few symbols to see if they match any production rules.\n\nWait, the string starts with t54, t87, t23, t66, t10,...\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can produce t54. Scanning the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 t96 (from NT94 -> NT96 NT98; then NT96 \u2192 t48, but wait, NT96 is expanded into t48 and NT23.

The 18th token is t12. So that would require a production rule that allows a non-terminal to produce 't12', which is NT54 \u2192 't12'. So if at some point, we have NT54 in the parse tree, it can expand to 't12'.\n\nNow, to get the string, starting at the beginning:\n\nThe first token is t54. So, we need a production that starts with 't54' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, none of the productions start with 't54' as the first terminal. The grammar's productions either have two non-terminals or a mix, but no production produces 't54' as a single terminal. For example, looking for NTx \u2192 't54' doesn't exist. So maybe the parse tree starts with a non-terminal that can expand into 't54' through a multi-step process.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol 't54' must come from a chain of expansions. Let's see where 't54' could come from.\n\nBut in the grammar, the only place where a non-terminal becomes 't54' is in NT54 \u2192 't12', so 't54' would require that NT54 is expanded into a terminal t12, which is different from t54. So how can I get 't54' in the string? It seems that none of the non-terminals directly produce 't54'\u2014 only NT54 produces 't12'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production either replaces a non-terminal with two others or with a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t57 t17 t85 t96 t66 t12 t85 t36 t84 t35 t32 t19 t19 t68 t36 t37 t87 t51 t93 t85 t86 t33 t86 t19 t68 t87`.\n\nFirst, I should look at the initial production rules for S. From the grammar, S can go to NT7 and NT23 with '7' and '23' respectively, but those are terminals. Wait, no, looking again, the productions for S are S->NT7 NT23 and S->NT97 NT54. Wait, let me check: Each production for S is S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So when S is expanded, it starts with either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Both of those are non-terminals, so the string begins with these sequences.\n\nLooking at the first token of the string, it's 't57'. So I need to see if 't57' can be produced by either NT7 or NT97. Let's check the productions under NT7 and NT97.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT7: Does any rule produce NT7? Let's see. Scanning through, NT7 isn't directly a non-terminal, but it's a terminal? Wait, no. Wait, the productions start with NT99, NT58, etc. Wait, I think I need to verify each rule properly.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. The grammar rules are all for non-terminals, except for some terminals. Wait, no. The grammar rules only have non-terminals on the left side, and the right side can be either non-terminals (indicating a production) or terminals (which would be the end of a derivation). So, looking at the productions, for example, S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which would mean NT7 and NT23 are non-terminals, and when they're expanded, they produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, so for example, NT7 in the productions is actually a terminal? Because when I look at the rules, for example, NT97 \u2192 't31' is a rule, meaning NT97 can produce the terminal 't31'. Similarly, NT54 \u2192 't53' or 't93' or 't12', etc.\n\nWait, but the initial productions for S are S\u2192NT7 NT23 and S\u2192NT97 NT54. So NT7 and NT23 must be non-terminals, because if they were terminals, they wouldn't have any further productions. So I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo let me list all the non-terminals and their productions properly.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- S -> NT7 NT23\n- S -> NT97 NT54\n- NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n- NT58 -> NT94 NT54\n- NT94 -> NT96 NT98\n- NT55 -> NT90 NT1\n- NT90 -> NT94 NT95\n- NT45 -> NT99 NT95\n- NT59 -> NT56 NT53\n- NT53 -> NT28 NT23\n- NT96 -> NT48 NT23\n- NT98 -> NT48 NT95\n- NT16 -> NT56 NT40\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT99 -> NT28 NT18\n- NT13 -> NT41 NT18\n- NT90 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT50 -> NT55 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT40 NT96\n- NT58 -> NT22 NT8\n- NT98 -> NT40 NT90\n- NT1 -> NT88 NT53\n- NT50 -> NT59 NT46\n- NT88 -> NT7 NT40\n- NT54 -> 't53' (terminal)\n- NT97 -> 't31' (terminal)\n- NT40 -> 't71' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't32' (terminal)\n- NT56 -> 't10' (terminal)\n- NT95 -> 't41' (terminal)\n- NT28 -> 't36' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't19' (terminal)\n- NT41 -> 't68' (terminal)\n- NT54 -> 't12' (terminal)\n- NT46 -> 't13' (terminal)\n- NT48 -> 't96' (terminal)\n- NT94 -> 't87' (terminal)\n- NT46 -> 't37' (terminal)\n- NT23 -> 't62' (terminal)\n- NT48 -> 't86' (terminal)\n- NT13 -> 't33' (terminal)\n- NT97 -> 't54' (terminal)\n- NT1 -> 't57' (terminal)\n- NT18 -> 't96' (terminal)\n- NT16 -> 't90' (terminal)\n- NT28 -> 't66' (terminal)\n- NT40 -> 't17' (terminal)\n- NT84 -> 't4' (terminal)\n- NT84 -> 't84' (terminal)\n- NT53 -> 't85' (terminal)\n- NT40 -> 't35' (terminal)\n- NT22 -> 't57' (terminal)\n\nWait, now I'm seeing that some of the non-terminals, like NT54, have multiple productions, some to terminals and some to non-terminals.

Let me re-express this clearly.\n\nEach production is of the form NT \u2192 ..., where the ... can be terminals or other non-terminals. So each non-terminal can either produce a terminal or another non-terminal, but since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, only one non-terminal can follow each production.

Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT53 \u2192 't85' is a production.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol generating a terminal. The string to evaluate is \"t36 t51 t66 t90 t57 t54 t12 t87 t41 t36 t12 t54 t87 t25 t87 t10 t66 t4 t19 t86 t51 t4 t41 t96 t10 t71\".\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar defines a series of productions where NT symbols eventually expand into terminal symbols labeled 't' followed by numbers. Each NT symbol can only produce two other NT symbols, and the grammar is structured such that each step reduces the number of non-terminals, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nTo determine if the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a derivation path from the start symbol S that expands into the given string. Since all the rules are in CNF, each step in the derivation will double the number of symbols, but since the string is fixed, I might need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a tree where each non-terminal expansion leads to sub-strings, and check if the entire string can be broken down into such sub-strings according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts and see if each part can be matched to the NT production rules.\n\nThe string is 27 tokens long. Let's see the grammar's end productions, which directly produce terminals. The right-hand sides of the grammar consist of various t symbols. For example:\n\n- S -> NT7 NT23\n- S is not directly a terminal, so we have to expand further.\n\nEvery non-terminal eventually produces some 't' symbol. Each production's left and right sides are two non-terminals, so each step in the derivation doubles the number of non-terminals until terminals are reached.\n\nBut since the string is given, perhaps it's better to start from the original string and work backward to see if each part matches any non-terminal's expansion.\n\nLet me list all the possible NTs and their productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, here's the list with non-terminals on the left and their possible replacements:\n\n- NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n- NT58 -> NT94 NT54\n- NT94 -> NT96 NT98\n- NT55 -> NT90 NT1\n- NT90 -> NT94 NT95\n- NT45 -> NT99 NT95\n- NT59 -> NT56 NT53\n- NT53 -> NT28 NT23\n- NT96 -> NT48 NT23\n- NT98 -> NT48 NT95\n- NT16 -> NT56 NT40\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT99 -> NT28 NT18\n- NT13 -> NT41 NT18\n- NT90 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT50 -> NT55 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT40 NT96\n- NT58 -> NT22 NT8\n- NT98 -> NT40 NT90\n- NT1 -> NT88 NT53\n- NT50 -> NT59 NT46\n- NT88 -> NT7 NT40\n- NT54 -> 't93' (terminal)\n- NT97 -> 't31' (terminal)\n- NT40 -> 't71' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't32' (terminal)\n- NT56 -> 't10' (terminal)\n- NT95 -> 't41' (terminal)\n- NT28 -> 't36' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't19' (terminal)\n- NT41 -> 't68' (terminal)\n- NT54 -> 't12' (terminal)\n- NT46 -> 't13' (terminal)\n- NT48 -> 't96' (terminal)\n- NT94 -> 't87' (terminal)\n- NT46 -> 't37' (terminal)\n- NT23 -> 't62' (terminal)\n- NT48 -> 't86' (terminal)\n- NT13 -> 't33' (terminal)\n- NT97 -> 't54' (terminal)\n- NT1 -> 't57' (terminal)\n- NT18 -> 't96' (terminal)\n- NT16 -> 't90' (terminal)\n- NT28 -> 't66' (terminal)\n- NT40 -> 't17' (terminal)\n- NT84 -> 't4' (terminal)\n- NT84 -> 't84' (terminal)\n- NT56 -> 't99' (terminal)\n- NT66 -> 't51' (terminal)\n\nLooking through these, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT56 -> 't10', so 't10' is immediately produced by NT56.\n\nBut the given string has a lot of 't's followed by numbers. So perhaps I can reverse-engineer the string by trying to split it into possible non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string is \"t36 t51 t66 t90 t57 t54 t12 t87 t41 t36 t12 t54 t87 t25 t87 t10 t66 t4 t19 t86 t51 t4 t41 t96 t10 t71\"\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated by expanding S.\n\nSince S has two rules: NT7 NT23 and NT99 NT54. I think NT7 and NT23 are non-terminals. Looking at the NT7 rule, does it have a production? Wait, looking back at the grammar, I don't see NT7 as a left-hand side of any production. Wait, in the grammar list, is there a rule for NT7? No. Only rule for NT7 is when it's on the right-hand side as a terminal. So NT7 is a terminal symbol. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT7 is on the right-hand side of some productions, but perhaps my initial mistake is that non-terminals are all the NT99, NT58, etc., letters, and the terminals are the ones with the 't' prefix. So NT7 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Similarly, NT8 is treated as a non-terminal, but in the productions, NT8 appears on the right side, but not on the left. So perhaps the start symbol S can expand into NT7 NT23, where both are non-terminals. Wait, no, because in the grammar, the start symbol S's rules are S->NT7 NT23 and S-> NT99 NT54. So each of these rules has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, so S is at the top level.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the production rules start with NT99 -> NT66 NT16, etc. So S is the start symbol, and the productions for S are:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT99 NT54\n\nWait, no, looking again: the first two lines are:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT99 NT54\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the productions start with NT99, etc., but that's a mistake. It's the other way: the first two rules are for S. So all other productions are for the NT non-terminals.\n\nSo S can expand into NT7 NT23, which are two non-terminals, each of which can further expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut NT7 is a terminal, as on the right-hand side, it's part of the production where NT8 -> 't32' and 't19', etc. Wait, no. Actually, in the grammar, terminals are the ones that are not on the left of any production. Wait, no: in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A->BC where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can go to terminals. So in this case, the last productions like NT54 -> 't93' (a terminal) are allowed. So any non-terminal on the left has two non-terminals on the right, except for those that produce terminals.\n\nWait, for the grammar:\n\nNT54 -> 't93' So that's a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-499","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break down how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. That\u2019s helpful because it simplifies the analysis.\n\nThe grammar provided has several production rules. Let me list out the important ones that directly produce terminals:\n\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT99 \u2192 't51'\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT84 \u2192 't54'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT53 \u2192 't85'\n- NT66 \u2192 't51' (Wait, but NT66 is also part of other rules. Let me check the main S rule. S is initialized as NT7 NT23, so the top-level symbol is S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t35 t31 t84 t10 t53 t33 t33 t51 t54 t32 t84 t19 t10 t35 t87 t54 t85 t19 t48 t62 t87 t86 t54 t12 t99 t84`.\n\nSince the start symbol is S, the string must be generated by expanding S through its productions. Let me start by looking at S's rules.\n\nThe first rule is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So, S expands into NT7 and NT23. Both are non-terminals, so each must be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions: from the given, only NT7 \u2192 't48' is listed. So, NT7 expands to 't48'. That takes care of the first part.\n\nNow, NT23 has multiple production rules. Let's look through them:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 again\n- Or others, but these are the prominent ones. So, let's say NT23 expands to NT45 NT53. Now, both NT45 and NT53 need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT45: The productions include NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT46, and others. For this, I need to choose one of the possible expansions. Let me pick NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT46. So now, NT99 and NT46 must be expanded.\n\nNT99 has two productions: \u2192 't51' and \u2192 NT28 NT18. Similarly, NT46 can produce 't37' or NT48 NT46 (though that seems a bit odd, maybe not the direct one). Let me pick the terminal option for as much as possible.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't54', but according to the rules, the initial S is NT7 (t48) and NT23, so the string starts with t48 t... but wait, the given string starts with t54. That suggests that this might not be the correct path because S's first expansion is t48 followed by something else. Hmm, that would mean the string starts with t48, but the given string starts with t54. So, perhaps this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me recheck the production rules. The S rule is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So the string generated by S would start with the symbols generated by NT7 and NT23. Since NT7 can only be 't48', the string starts with 't48'. But the given string starts with 't54', which is the fourth symbol in the initial S expansion. So this suggests a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given string has the start of the expansion as t54, but according to S \u2192 NT7 NT23, the first symbol should be t48. Therefore, this suggests that the string might not be present in the language, but I should double-check to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion isn't direct. Let me see if S can be expanded in a way that the first symbol is t54. Looking at S's production again, S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So, S can't be directly t54; it's always NT7 NT23. So, the first two symbols in the string must be generated by NT7 and NT23.\n\nBut according to the given string, the first symbol is 't54', which would require NT7 to produce 't54', but from the production rules, NT7 only produces 't48'. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because the initial symbols don't match any expansion of S.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I missed something. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nThe given string is: t54 t35 t31 t84 t10 t53 t33 t33 t51 t54 t32 t84 t19 t10 t35 t87 t54 t85 t19 t48 t62 t87 t86 t54 t12 t99 t84.\n\nBut according to S's production rules, the first two symbols must be t48 (from NT7) followed by something else from NT23. However, the given string starts with t54, which can't be generated by NT7. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since S starts with NT7 NT23, which starts with t48, but the string starts with t54, which isn't possible, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nSo the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-507","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's see. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side except for the terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: t31 t53 t12 t66 t32 t51 t86 t33 t86 t36 t33 t71 t35 t48 t85 t4 t12 t71 t71 t10 t35 t48 t13 t23 t53 t48 t85.\n\nFirst, I need to find a leftmost derivation (LMD) of this string using the grammar. Each step in the LMD should correspond to expanding a non-terminal into two non-terminals according to the grammar rules until all symbols are terminals, and the entire string is matched.\n\nLet's look at the start symbol S. The production rules from S are S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. So the first two symbols of S's expansion must be either t71 and t52? Wait, actually, looking at the NT-> productions, NT7 is S->NT7 NT23, and NT7 then directly produces t71. Similarly, NT97 produces t93.\n\nWait, hold on. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT7 -> T7\nNT23 -> T23\n\nNT97: does it produce 't93'? Let me check the production rules. Yes, NT97 -> 't31' and S has S -> NT97 NT54. So in the LMD, the first two symbols in the string should be generated from NT97 and NT54.\n\nSo the first symbol is t31 (from NT97), and the second is likely t53 because NT54's production includes t54. Wait, the production for NT54 is 't53'? No, looking again: NT54 -> 't12' and 't53'? Or wait, the production for NT54 is 't12' and another rule, like NT54 -> 't53'? Wait, no, in the provided grammar, NT54 is 't12'\u2014 wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each NT's production is either combining two NTs or turning into a terminal. So for NT97, the production is NT97 -> 't93', right? And S has S->NT97 NT54. So the starting expansion for S is NT97 NT54, which would produce t93 and whatever NT54 produces.\n\nWait, the string starts with t31, not t93. Hmm, that's confusing because NT97 produces t93, so maybe I'm missing that. Alternatively, perhaps NT97 produces t31 when combined with another production. Wait, maybe I have to look at how NT97 is used in the expansion.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to trace the string backward using the grammar, perhaps by building the parse tree in reverse or using the CYK algorithm, but since I might not remember CYK, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down step by step according to the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF (Chomsky normal form), each symbol in the string (except the start symbol) must correspond to a derivation step where each step breaks down a non-terminal into two non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe start symbol is S. According to the productions, S can be NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t31. Let's check which non-terminals produce 't31':\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT97 -> 't31' (I think that's NT97 producing t31). So the first part of S is NT97, which would produce t31 and something else when expanded. The second part would be NT54, which may produce another set of terminals.\n\nWait, but S->NT97 NT54. So the entire string would be the output of NT97 followed by NT54. So let's see what NT97 produces. NT97 directly produces 't31', that's its only production. Wait, no, wait the production for NT97 is NT99 -> NT66 NT16? No, that's a different NT.\n\nWait no, for NT97: Looking back, the production is S->NT97, which directly produces t31. So when S uses this production, the first symbol is t31, and the second is whatever NT54 produces.\n\nSo now, the string is: t31, followed by the expansion of NT54, which is a sequence of symbols.\n\nSo, the next symbols in the string after t31 are t53, t12, t66, t32, t51, t86, etc. So I need to see what NT54 produces. Looking at the grammar: NT54's productions are NT54 -> 't53' and 't8', 't22', 't46', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, the production for NT54 is not matching the first symbols. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake: looking back, the productions for NT54 are:\n\nLooking for NT54:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT54, I see:\n\nNT54 -> 't53' \n\nWait, no, actually, I think I might have miswritten the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT54, the production is \"NT54 -> 't12' NT86\" or \"NT54 -> 't53' NT46\"? Wait, perhaps I'm recalling wrong.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps it's more accurate to parse each NT production:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the specific rules are as follows, for example:\n\nNT54 -> 't12'\n\nBut wait, in the initial grammar list, some lines are:\n\nNT54-> 't53'\n\nBut that might not be accurate. Wait, perhaps some of the NTs directly produce terminals. For example, NT7 produces t71, NT23 produces t52.\n\nWait, let me try to list the NTs and their production rules correctly.

Let me start by understanding the problem. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is a specific type of context-free grammar where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because many algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, can parse it efficiently, but I'm not sure if I need to go that deep here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t90 t10 t41 t87 t86 t86 t33 t93 t35 t35 t48 t62 t90 t10 t31 t37 t37 t31 t85 t37 t32 t68 t62 t96 t12 t86 t62 t41`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of symbols, which are either non-terminals (like t90, t10, etc.) or terminals. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, some of the symbols like 't93' are terminals because they're in the productions on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and then further productions. So the string is a series of these terminals and non-terminals. \n\nThe string starts with `t90`, which is a terminal. So I need to see how the string is built up by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either a non-terminal breaking down into two non-terminals or a non-terminal directly matching a terminal. So the string must be broken down step by step following the grammar rules.\n\nLet me see the grammar productions. Starting with S, which can produce NT99 or NT97, and each of those can produce combinations leading to more non-terminals. The terminals are on the right side, like 't93', so each terminal corresponds to a production that ends the chain for that part.\n\nSo to check if the string is in the language, I can try to parse it step by step. Each symbol in the string must be a terminal that is directly derived from a non-terminal in the grammar. If I can split the string into parts that match the grammar's productions, then yes, otherwise no.\n\nI think the best approach is to simulate the derivation of the string step by step using the grammar.

So NT99 must expand into more non-terminals which eventually derive terminals in the string.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 has multiple productions:\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT23 \u2192 NT86 (I think I saw that in the grammar, but looking back, yes, NT23 can go to 't62' through NT23 \u2192 NT86? Wait, actually, I need to check the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nFor example, NT8 \u2192 't32', so when NT8 is encountered, it can be replaced with a terminal symbol. Similarly, NT54 can produce 't12', etc.\n\nSo, in the first step, the string starts with `t90`. Let me see what can produce 't90' directly or via a chain.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't90' is produced by NT84 \u2192 NT84 can produce `t58` wait, no, let's check: \n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, I see NT84 \u2192 `t84`? Or is it another path? Let me look:\n\nWait, looking back, I see for example NT94 \u2192 `t87`, NT46 \u2192 `t37`, etc. So each non-terminal corresponds to exactly one terminal production.\n\nSo each non-terminal produces a specific terminal. So when I see a non-terminal in the string, I need to see if it has a production that goes directly to that terminal.\n\nWait, no: the grammar's RHS can have combinations, so a non-terminal can expand into two other non-terminals, which themselves expand until they hit terminals.\n\nSo, for instance, NT84 can expand as `t84`? Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT84 \u2192 't23', but I see NT23 \u2192 't62' and others. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, let's make a list of terminals:\n\nIn the grammar, many productions end with a single terminal. For example:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\nNT97 \u2192 't31'\nNT40 \u2192 't71'\nNT8 \u2192 't32'\nNT56 \u2192 't10'\nNT95 \u2192 't41'\nNT28 \u2192 't36'\nNT8 \u2192 't19'\nNT41 \u2192 't68'\nNT54 \u2192 't12'\nNT46 \u2192 't13'\nNT48 \u2192 't96'\nNT94 \u2192 't87'\nNT46 \u2192 't37'\nNT23 \u2192 't62'\nNT48 \u2192 't86'\nNT13 \u2192 't33'\nNT97 \u2192 't54'\nNT1 \u2192 't57'\nNT18 \u2192 't96'\nNT16 \u2192 't90'\nNT28 \u2192 't66'\nNT40 \u2192 't17'\nNT84 \u2192 't23'? Wait, I don't see that, no. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nBut I don't see NT84 being a terminal. Wait, looking back, there's S \u2192 NT84, and NT84 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I don't see NT84 as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I need to check.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and terminals:\n\nTerminal symbols are the ones like t93, t10, t41, etc. So any production that ends with a letter followed by a digit is a terminal.\n\nSo, looking through, I see: 't93' is a terminal, as are 't31', 't71', 't32', etc. So NT97 \u2192 't31' means that NT97 can be replaced by the terminal t31.\n\nSo, my approach is to try to build the string step by step, replacing non-terminals with terminals based on the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is long, so I'll try to split it into parts that can follow the grammar.\n\nLet's try the initial approach: S \u2192 NT99 NT23.\n\nThen, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16.\n\nSo S becomes NT66 NT16 NT23.\n\nNow, let's see:\n\nNT66 \u2192 't51' (from the grammar: NT66 \u2192 't51'), so NT66 can be replaced with t51.\n\nNT16 \u2192 't90' (from NT16 \u2192 't90'), so that's t90.\n\nNT23 has multiple options. So S becomes t51 t90 NT23.\n\nBut our string is t90 t10 t41 t87 t86 t86 t33 t93 t35 t35 t48 t62 t90 t10 t31 t37 t37 t31 t85 t37 t32 t68 t62 t96 t12 t86 t62 t41.\n\nWait, the string starts with t90. But according to this expansion, the first part is t51, which doesn't match the string. So this suggests that this path is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nSo S \u2192 t31 (since NT97 \u2192 t31) and then NT54.\n\nNow, let's see if starting with t31 matches the string's first symbol t90. No, it doesn't. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps S can't be the start because the first symbol in the string is t90, but NT97 gives t31, which is not t90, and NT99 gives t90 only through NT99's productions.\n\nWait, from NT99, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of terminal symbols, and since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production starts with a non-terminal and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It has a series of productions that convert non-terminals into terminals. Some of them directly produce terminals, like S \u2192 NT58 NT86, but wait, in the provided grammar, S is rewritten into various combinations of NTs, and each NT eventually reduces to a string of terminals.\n\nThe string provided is: t68 t66 t84 t31 t66 t41 t17 t23 t33 t53 t53 t4 t57 t13 t71 t32 t68 t41 t33 t25 t23 t4 t48 t66 t66 t48 t99 t17.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the string's components. The start symbol is S, which in the grammar can produce two types: NT99 NT23, NT97 NT54, and others. Looking closely, the first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT23. So, let's see if the string can be broken down starting from there.\n\nStarting with the string, the first symbol is t68. Looking at the grammar production NT66 \u2192 t51? Wait, no. Let me check the productions for NT66, NT53, etc. NT66 has a production NT66 \u2192 NT51 t51? Or does it have a production that ends with a terminal? Looking at the grammar, NT66's productions are:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT66: NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16. But no, NT66 itself: looking at the list, I think I may have misread. Let me go step by step.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, each line is a production, so NT99 is listed as \"NT99 -> NT66 NT16\", and \"NT66 -> NT51\" perhaps?

Let me parse each line correctly.\n\nEach line represents a production for a non-terminal. For example, the first line is S -> NT99 NT23. Then S -> NT97 NT54. Next, NT99 -> NT66 NT16. NT58 -> NT94 NT54, and so on.\n\nLooking for the string, t68 appears at the start. So we need to find a production that starts with a non-terminal that eventually reduces to t68.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t68 (from the line NT41 -> 't68'), and NT59 \u2192 NT56 NT53, and NT56 \u2192 t99 (from NT56: NT56 \u2192 't10'), and NT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23. Wait, wait, let me check NT53: in the grammar, NT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23. Are those terminals or non-terminals?\n\nLooking at NT28: There's a production NT28 \u2192 t36. So NT28 is a terminal. Similarly, NT23: NT23 has multiple productions, some are terminals and some are non-terminals.\n\nWait, I think I need to go step by step.

So S can be either NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54, etc.\n\nWait, the first production for S is S \u2192 NT99 NT23. We'll assume that's the one to follow, as I don't see NT97 as the first step, but wait, in Grammars, the first alternative is considered unless there's a different starting point.\n\nWait, the initial S has two productions: NT99 NT23 and NT97 NT54. I think I should try each and see which one can generate the string.\n\nFirst, let's try starting with S \u2192 NT99 NT23.\n\nThen, the next step is to see what each of these non-terminals produce. So NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16.\n\nNow, the next token is t68. Wait, can NT66 produce t68? Looking through NT66, the productions: from the grammar, I don't see any NT66 \u2192 t66. The productions for NT66 are: I thought earlier it was NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, but that's for NT99. For NT66, I see in the grammar, NT66 appears in the production NT84 \u2192 NT66 NT86. So NT66 is part of that production. But does NT66 itself have a production to a terminal?\n\nLooking at the grammar, the line NT66 is written as \"NT66 -> NT51\". Wait, checking the grammar: No, there's no NT66 -> ... except in the production NT84 \u2192 NT66 NT86. So NT66 is a non-terminal that can only produce NT51 (from another production line: NT66 \u2192 NT51).\n\nWait, looking again: The grammar includes:\n\nNT66: NT84 \u2192 NT66 NT86\n\nIs that correct? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. The line NT84 is: NT84 -> NT58 NT86. Then, NT23 has NT23 -> NT45 NT53. Let me search for NT66 in the grammar:\n\nLooking at all the lines: I don't see NT66 as a left-hand side except in NT84. So NT66 is only a non-terminal in the production of NT84.

Wait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7 is mapped to t7, NT97 to t31, NT16 to t56, etc. So perhaps each NT in the RHS maps directly to a unique tX.\n\nSo for example:\n\nNT58 \u2192 't58', NT86 \u2192 't86', NT57 \u2192 't57', NT23 \u2192 't19', etc.\n\nSo each production RHS is a sequence of tX's, where X is determined by the NT on the left.\n\nTherefore, each production is a concatenation of certain tX's.\n\nNow, let's note down the RHS translations for all grammar rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23 \u2192 t7 t19\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54 \u2192 t31 t12\n3. NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16 \u2192 t66 t56\n4. NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54 \u2192 t87 t12\n5. NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98 \u2192 t85 t63\n6. NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1 \u2192 t51 t40 (since NT55 \u2192 't51' and NT1 \u2192 't57'?)\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify this mapping.\n\nEarlier, I thought each NT symbol maps to a single tX, but looking again, the problem is that some NTs may map to single tXs, others may not. Wait, for example, in the grammar, the production S \u2192 NT7 NT23 becomes t7 t19, meaning that NT7 is t7, NT23 is t19.\n\nSimilarly, NT97 \u2192 't31', so NT97 is t31. NT54 \u2192 't12', so NT54 is t12.\n\nLooking through, most NTs on the RHS correspond to tX's, but I need to make sure which NT maps to which tX.\n\nLet me list all the NTs and their corresponding tX:\n\nFrom the grammar, each rule's RHS is a pair of NTs, each of which corresponds to a single tX. So, for example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t7 (from S \u2192 NT7 NT23)\n- NT23 \u2192 t19 (from S \u2192 NT7 NT23)\n- NT97 \u2192 t31 (from S \u2192 NT97 NT54)\n- NT54 \u2192 t12 (from S \u2192 NT97 NT54)\n- NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16 \u2192 from NT99 \u2192 't66' and 't56' (since NT66 \u2192 t66 and NT16 \u2192 t56?)\nWait, wait. Let me list each production RHS and the corresponding tX's:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23 \u2192 t7 t19\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54 \u2192 t31 t12\n3. NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16 \u2192 t66 t56\n4.

{"custom_id":"request-539","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit that form because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t87 t12 t37 t41 t4 t66 t48 t54 t13 t19 t17 t10 t17 t41 t13 t31 t12 t33 t31 t17 t4 t48 t37 t48 t19 t90 t33 t57 t33`. It looks like a sequence of terminals, each probably representing a step in the derivation.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string using the given grammar and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. Since it's in CNF, I can try to construct a parse tree or use a top-down parsing method like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to reconstruct the possible derivation.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which can be split into two non-terminals, either NT99 and NT7, or NT97 and NT54. I'll need to see if the first symbol corresponds to either of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t87`. Wait, in the grammar, NT97 produces `t31` and is also involved in other productions, but T87 is another non-terminal. Checking the grammar, I see that NT97 is only in two production rules: one to NT48 NT95 and another to NT54. Wait, no, actually, looking through, I don't see any production that directly leads to `t87`. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT94 \u2192 t96 NT98. NT96 \u2192 NT48 t23, and NT48 \u2192 t96 t48. Wait, maybe it's about the sequence of terminals in the string. Let's see.\n\nWait, wait. I need to look at each production and see which symbols correspond to the non-terminals in the string.\n\nLet me list out the possible non-terminals and their corresponding terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, non-terminals produce either terminals or other non-terminals. So, for example, S \u2192 NT99 NT7 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nThe string starts with `t87`, which I think might come from a production like NT97 \u2192 NT48 t23 or wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT97 \u2192 't31' is not in the given productions. Wait, no, looking again, the productions are:\n\nNT97 -> 't31' (from NT97 being part of some productions), but looking through the grammar, I think some of these are not in the right places. Wait, let me scan through.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT97 -> 't31' (it's actually in the production S \u2192 NT97 NT54, but looking at the productions, NT97 is written as 't31' in one place. So, perhaps NT97 \u2192 t31. Similarly, NT54 might produce t12 or something else.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see lines like S -> NT97 NT54, and then NT97 has a production that ends with 't31'. So perhaps NT97 \u2192 t31. Similarly, NT54 has multiple productions, such as 't12' (from NT54 \u2192 't12'), and others.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t87. Hmm, I don't see NT87 in the grammar because from the given productions, I think the grammar goes up to NT99, NT58, etc., but maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar productions again, I see NT94 \u2192 t96 NT98, and then NT87 is produced somewhere. Let me check each production to see if any non-terminals produce t87.\n\nLooking through the productions, I spot NT94: 't96' is one of its productions. Then, checking if any other non-terminals produce t87. Hmm, the production NT87 is not listed because in the given grammar, the highest non-terminal seems to be NT99, NT98, etc., but perhaps it's present in a production elsewhere.\n\nWait, I might have an error. Let me check the productions more carefully. Yes, I see in the grammar:\n\nNT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98\nNT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\nNT48 \u2192 t96 NT48? Wait no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the productions after NT40: \n\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19' (is this a separate production? I might have misread.)\n\nWait, some of the productions list a non-terminal equal to a terminal, which is the leaf node.\n\nSo, for example, NT56 \u2192 't10', NT95 \u2192 't41', etc.\n\nSo, t87 is a terminal symbol. I need to find a non-terminal that produces t87. Looking through the productions, I see NT94 \u2192 t96 NT98, and NT98 \u2192 't48' and another production for NT98 as NT54, which I think produces t84 or something else.\n\nWait, maybe NT94 can produce t96 and then NT98. But where is t87 coming from? Let me check if I missed any productions.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I think I might have an issue here. There's no production for a non-terminal that produces 't87' as a terminal. Did I miss something? Let me go line by line.\n\nLooking at each production line after 'grammar: ', I see:\n\n- S -> NT99 NT7\n- S -> NT97 NT54\n\nThen, NT99 has multiple productions, one of which is NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54\n\nNT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1\n\nNT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT56 NT53\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT17\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, NT40 \u2192 't71'? Wait, let me check: looking at the provided grammar, one line is NT40 -> 't71'. Yes, so NT40 produces t71.\n\nWait, but in the initial part of the grammar, I see S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's see if NT97 can produce t87.\n\nLooking for NT97 in the productions, I don't see a production where NT97 is a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, in the grammar, there's a line: S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Then, NT97 has the production NT97 -> 't31'. So, NT97 \u2192 t31.\n\nBut the string starts with t87, which is the first symbol. Hmm. So how can the grammar derive t87 from S? Because S's productions are S \u2192 NT99 NT7 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, but if the first symbol is t87, which would come from NT97 \u2192 t31? No, wait, that would produce t31. But we're seeing t87. So maybe t87 comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting something wrong. Let me check all the productions.\n\nLooking deeper, I see NT94 \u2192 t96 NT98. Then, NT98 \u2192 t48 NT48 or something. Wait, no, in the productions, NT98 has two productions: one to 't48' and another to 't95'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT98 is defined as:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 't48' [maybe another production?]\n\nNo, looking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar has a bunch of productions, and the string provided is a sequence of symbols. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar is producing. Let's look at the productions. The start symbol is S, and the productions from S are:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo, every string generated by this grammar will start with either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. The string to check starts with 't25', which I notice isn't a nonterminal; it's a terminal symbol. Wait, let me check: in the grammar, the right-hand sides of productions are combinations of NTs and sometimes terminal symbols, like 't93', 't31', etc.\n\nWait, but the first production for S branches into NT7 and NT23. Then, looking at NT7, in one of the productions, it becomes 't48'. Similarly, NT23 has several productions, some of which are terminals. Hmm, but in the initial S production, NT7 becomes 't48', and NT23 becomes 't86', perhaps?\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is 't25', which doesn't match the initial productions of S. Let me see what the initial steps would involve.\n\nWait a minute, the string starts with 't25', but looking at the grammar, are there any productions that produce 't25'? Let me check all the NT symbols.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't25'. Wait, but maybe 't25' is an intermediate step that comes from a production. Let me check if any NTs produce sequences that include 't25'.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT50 has a production to NT55 NT1, and NT55 produces NT90 NT95. Hmm, not seeing 't25'. Let me check other NTs.\n\nWait, NT7: in one production, NT7 -> 't48'. NT48: one production is 't96', another is... looking, NT48 is 't96', but I don't see a production that would lead to 't25'. \n\nWait, maybe I should check each symbol in the string and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string again: `t25 t48 t84 t93 t62 t13 t87 t68 t54 t62 t57 t93 t93 t85 t87 t23 t93 t4 t12 t41 t13 t62 t87 t41 t12 t84 t37 t87 t99 t32`.\n\nHmm, the first symbol is 't25'. I need to see if the grammar can produce this. But looking at the productions, none of the nonterminals seem to directly produce 't25'. The only productions are combinations of NTs, so I need a path from the start symbol to these terminals.\n\nWait, let me list the NTs and their productions. Maybe some NTs can produce sequences that include 't25'.\n\nLooking at NT23: NT23 can produce 't86', among other things. Let me check: NT23 -> NT13 NT50, and NT13 can produce 't33', and NT50 can produce 't85' via some other path. Hmm, but I don't see a path that would include 't25'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the entire string and see if each symbol can be derived. Let's consider each token and see where they could come from.\n\nStarting with 't25': does any NT produce 't25' in one production? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't25'. The only 't's are in the right-hand sides, so perhaps 't25' comes from a production of a specific NT.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should look for a possible sequence of productions that could generate this string. Let's consider the entire string and see if it can be broken down into a sequence of nonterminals that match the grammar.\n\nLet me start from the beginning:\n\n1. The string starts with 't25'. But in the grammar, no NT directly produces 't25'. So, perhaps the starting symbol S can't produce 't25' as the first symbol, unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the first production of S is NT7 NT23. The possible symbols are either from NT7 or NT23. From earlier, NT7 -> 't48', and NT23 can produce 't86' or other things. So the first symbol would be 't48' or another symbol from NT23.\n\nWait, the first part of the string is 't25 t48...'. So 't25' isn't from the first production of S, because the first symbol is 't48' according to the first production.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misreading. Let me double-check. The start symbol is S, which can branch into NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. So, for the first part of the string to be 't25', it would have to come from NT7 or NT23, but no NT directly produces 't25'.\n\nSo maybe 't25' can't be the first symbol. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar because the first symbol 't25' isn't derivable from S.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the production rules. Let me check all NTs to see if any can produce 't25'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT7: 't48'\n- NT23: 't86', and also has a production to NT13 NT50\n- NT99: several 't's, but none include 't25'\n- NT58: 't94' and 't54'\n- NT55: 't90' and 't95'\n- NT94: 't96'\n- NT45: 't99' and 't95'\n- NT59: 't56' and 't53'\n- NT53: 't28' and 't23'\n- NT96: 't48' and 't23'\n- NT98: 't48' and 't95'\n- NT16: 't56' and 't40'\n- NT23 again: same as earlier\n- NT40: 't71'\n- NT8: 't32'\n- NT56: 't10'\n- NT95: 't41'\n- NT28: 't36' and 't23'\n- NT8: 't19'\n- NT41: 't68'\n- NT54: 't12'\n- NT46: 't13' and 't37'\n- NT48: 't96' again\n- NT94: 't87'\n- NT46: both 't37' and 't13'\n- NT23 again\n- NT48 again\n- NT13: 't33'\n- NT97: 't54'\n- NT1: 't57'\n- NT18: 't96'\n- NT16: 't90'\n- NT28: 't66'\n- NT40: 't17'\n- NT84: 't4' and 't84'\n- NT84 again\n- NT56: 't99'\n- NT66: 't51'\n- NT54: 't53'\n- NT23: 't86'\n- NT84: again producing 't23'\n- NT53: 't85'\n- NT40: 't35'\n- NT22: 't57'\n- NT7: 't48'\n- NT28: 't13'\n- NT84: 't57'\n- NT86: 't25'?\n\nWait, here it is: NT86 has a production to 't86'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is useful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side, or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I see that the start symbol is S, which can produce either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Each of these is a combination of two non-terminals. The string I need to check is a sequence of terminals, so I'll be dealing with the production rules that lead to these terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t93 t13 t66 t13 t17 t37 t41 t23 t10 t17 t54 t10 t10 t19 t33 t35 t51 t23 t57 t25 t57 t87 t36 t36 t36 t85 t25 t32 t36 t93.\n\nI notice that many of these are two-digit numbers like t93, t13, etc. Some of these might be derived directly from production rules. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting from S, it can produce NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT7 NT23\nNow, NT7 doesn't seem to be a terminal in the grammar; the given NT7 rules eventually lead to terminals like t48, t57, etc. But wait, in the grammar, under NT7, there's NT7 -> 't48'. So, maybe NT7 is a non-terminal that expands to 't48'.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 has several production rules. Let's see: NT23 can become NT45 NT53, or NT13 NT50, or NT86, or NT84, or NT66, or others. \n\nWait, NT23 can also be a terminal? Let me check. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production rules where NT23 directly becomes a terminal. But another production for NT53 becomes 't86', and so on.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to represent the entire string as a parse tree starting from S and see if each step leads to the correct terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is long, perhaps I can process it in sections that match the production rules. Let's see, the string starts with t93. From the grammar, NT54 can become 't12' and also 't11'? Wait, looking back: NT54 has a rule NT54 -> 't12' and another rule NT54 -> 't13'.

So perhaps NT54 is derived as NT53, which is another non-terminal. So perhaps 't53' comes from NT53.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT53 has a rule: NT53 -> NT28 NT23.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar and the string. The string is a sequence of terminals, which in this case are the 't' followed by numbers. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the top-level productions (starting with S), it seems that S can be rewritten in two ways: either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. So the first step is to split the string into these possible components. \n\nThe string starts with 't41', which could be part of either of the top-level productions. Let me check if 't41' is a terminal in any of the productions. Scanning the productions:\n\n- NT40 -> 't71', 't32', etc.\n- NT18 -> 't96'\n- NT13 -> 't68'\n- NT97 -> 't54' and 't31'\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n\nAh, I see that NT41 is a production that produces 't68', which would mean the string starts with 't68', but the string starts with 't41'. So that's a problem. Wait, no, wait\u2014it's important to double-check. Let me check if any NT produces 't41'.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I see NT41 -> 't68' and NT13 -> 't68', but none of the NTs produce 't41' as a terminal. That suggests that 't41' is derived from a non-terminal. Let me see:\n\nLooking for 't41' as a result of a production\u2014wait, no. The right-hand side of each production is a combination of NTs, and the left-hand side is the non-terminal. So unless one of the right-hand sides produces a terminal 't41', I wouldn't get that.\n\nWait, looking at the list, I don't see any NT where the production ends in 't41'. So that might be a problem, but I must have made a mistake because the string does start with 't41'. So maybe I should check if 't41' is somehow part of a longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps 't41' is part of a larger production, but in the grammar, the productions are such that each step either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So to get 't41', we'd have to have a production where NT41 directly produces 't68', but in the string, we have 't41'. That doesn't match. Hmm, that seems confusing. \n\nBut wait, in the string, the first element is 't41'. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT41 -> 't68'. So the string starts with 't41', which would need to come from NT41. But since NT41's production is 't68', that's not matching. So either the string starts with 't68', but it doesn't.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is a terminal sequence, which would mean that each symbol in the string must be a terminal. But in the grammar, the only symbols that are terminals are when the production directly outputs one (e.g., NT54 -> 't12'). \n\nSo the string must be derived by substituting all NTs to their terminals. Therefore, for the string to be valid, every symbol in the string must either directly come from a production that results in a terminal or be derived via non-terminals that expand to that terminal.\n\nSo, let's break down the string:\n\nt41 t99 t85 t35 t41 t41 t86 t36 t99 t10 t19 t62 t48 t37 t96 t93 t51 t32 t17 t4 t96 t31 t17 t87 t33 t19 t84 t10 t17 t25 t62.\n\nThat's 31 symbols. Let's see if each can come from a terminal in the grammar. Let's start with the first one: t41. Looking at the productions, no NT directly produces 't41', so that's a red flag. Did I miss any?\n\nWait, I see NT13 -> 't68', which produces 't68', not 't41'. NT54 -> 't12', etc. So no NT directly produces 't41'. Therefore, the string cannot start with 't41' unless that 't41' is generated through a series of expansions that eventually result in 't41', but since none of the NTs directly produce 't41', that seems impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is different. Wait, S is the start symbol. Let's check S's productions:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo any string generated must start with either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Neither of these have terminals, so the first symbol must be a terminal from either NT7 or NT23, or NT97 or NT54.\n\nLooking at the left-hand sides:\n\nNT7: let's see what it produces. Looking through the productions, I don't see NT7 on the left except as part of other NTs. For example, NT40 -> 't71', NT8 -> 't32', etc. So, wait, maybe the parse tree starts with these.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting lost here. Maybe an alternative approach: Let's parse the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if it can derive the string.\n\nThe string has 31 symbols, so it's a bit long, but perhaps I can do a portion of it. Let's take the first few tokens: t41, t99, t85, t35, t41, etc.\n\nWait, but as we saw, none of the NTs directly produce t41, so the first token can't be 't41'. So this suggests the string can't be generated by the grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because all the other terminals in the string must be produced by some NT. Let me check each symbol again.\n\nWait, the first token is 't41' which I don't see being directly produced by any NT, so perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check all NTs again.\n\nLooking back at all the NT productions:\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I don't see any that directly produce 't41'. For example, NT13 -> 't68', NT41 -> 't68', NT54 -> 't12', etc. None of these directly produce 't41'. So unless 't41' is part of a longer production, which it can't be because the grammar is in CNF, so each step produces either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, the string starting with 't41' can't be generated by this grammar because that symbol isn't in the terminals of any production.

The string starts with t35, which suggests the first part of the string comes from NT7 or NT97 or another non-terminal. But wait, since the string is split into tokens, maybe I need to reconstruct how the string is built.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in Chomsky Normal Form, the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of one or two non-terminals or terminals. So, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols.\n\nIf S produces NT7 and NT23, then the expansion starts with these two. But the string provided starts with 't35', so maybe we need to trace back how the NT's derive into t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by expanding S and applying the productions step by step.\n\nLet's try to find the sequence of non-terminals that can generate the given string. Each step will involve matching two tokens (if the RHS is two non-terminals) and replacing them with the corresponding symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this as a top-down parsing attempt.\n\nStarting with S, the first step would be to produce either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, S1: NT7 NT23.\n\nWe need to see if NT7 and NT23 can produce the remaining string. But NT7 is 't48', so the first token should be 't48', but the string starts with 't35', so S1 can't be the correct path. So, we try S2: S2: NT97 NT54.\n\nSimilarly, NT97 is 't54', but the string starts with 't35', which is different. Hmm, that suggests that the initial symbols don't match either production. But that can't be, because the first production for S is NT7 NT23, which starts with NT7, which is 't48', but our string starts with 't35'. So perhaps the first two tokens must come from two different productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Each production for S generates exactly two non-terminals, so S can be considered as generating a two-symbol string, where each symbol is either a non-terminal (which then produces more symbols) or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, to parse a string, we start at the root (S) and split the string into two parts as per the productions. Since S produces either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54, each of these non-terminals will produce their own sub-strings. So the entire string should be the concatenation of these two sub-strings.\n\nTherefore, the string can be considered as either:\n\nString1: [tokens from NT7] [tokens from NT23]\n\nOr\n\nString2: [tokens from NT97] [tokens from NT54]\n\nSince the given string is:\n\nt35 t85 t48 t48 t4 t99 t57 t37 t32 t54 t53 t86 t32 t32 t37 t32 t31 t19 t25 t4 t85 t68 t41 t85 t90 t19 t25 t41 t54 t35 t37\n\nWe can check if this can be split into two parts where the first part is generated by NT7 and the second by NT23, or the other way around.\n\nLet me check NT97 and NT54. NT97 is 't54', which matches 't54' in the string. So String2 would have the first token 't54', which is the second token in the given string. So the first part would start with 't54', so the first token 't35' doesn't match that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is a single chain. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nPerhaps I should represent the string as a list and try to split it at each production step.\n\nStarting from the root S, the entire string must be the concatenation of the two parts derived from the RHS of the production. So, for S -> NT97 NT54, the entire string should split into NT97's substring and NT54's substring. Similarly for S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nLooking at the first possible production: S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nNT7's expansion starts with 't48', but the string starts with 't35', so this production can't generate the string. Next, S -> NT97 NT54.\n\nNT97's expansion is 't54', which is the second token in the given string, but the first token is 't35', which doesn't match. So either this isn't the correct approach, or perhaps the parsing is more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The productions are terminals and non-terminals, so perhaps each step may involve expanding non-terminals into more symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be built by multiple expansions, so the initial step splits the string into two parts according to a production, and each part is then checked recursively.\n\nBut honestly, this approach seems too time-consuming, and I might miss a key point. Maybe I should instead try to reconstruct the possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reverse the process: start from the end and see if the last token is matched by any production. Then, split the remaining string accordingly.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nThe last token is 't37'. Looking for non-terminals that can produce 't37'. From the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT48 -> t96 (but not 37)\n- NT28 -> t66\n- NT46 -> t37\n- NT53 -> t85\n- NT48 -> t96\nWait, wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT46 -> t37? Yes, looking at the rules, NT46 is in the grammar, and one rule is NT46 -> t37.\n\nSo, the last token 't37' must come from NT46. So let's backtrack: we have a production where the last two symbols (the part generating 't37') come from the RHS of the rule NT46 -> t13 t50 or NT46-> t37, assuming some rule. Wait, looking back, yes, in the grammar, there's a rule NT46 -> t37.\n\nSo, the last token 't37' comes from NT46, so we take the last non-terminal in the RHS as NT46, then split the string into two parts, excluding the last token, and then try to have the previous part end with the other non-terminal of that production.\n\nWait, no, because the production for NT46 is either t13 t50 or t37. Wait, let's look at the rules:\n\nNT46:\nLooking through the grammar, there's a rule NT46 -> t13 t50?

{"custom_id":"request-600","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right. In CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t37 t37 t25 t53 t87 t37 t93 t54 t86 t93 t86 t17 t12 t62 t23 t13 t51 t53 t36 t31 t33 t85 t86 t41 t37 t31 t13 t96 t17 t41 t41 t37`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT7 or NT97 or NT99 and others, as seen from the given productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that many non-terminals expand into other non-terminals and a single terminal. My plan is to construct the derivation tree step by step, starting from S and expanding non-terminals until I reach the terminals in the string.\n\nI'll start by looking for possible expansions of S:\n\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT97 NT54\n3. S -> NT99 NT54\n\nI need to see which of these can match parts of the string. Let's check each option:\n\nOption 1: NT7 -> something. Looking at the productions, NT7 isn't defined anywhere in the grammar. Wait, none of the productions start with NT7. The non-terminals are NT99, NT58, etc. So NT7 isn't a starting option. That means S can't produce NT7 NT23 because NT7 doesn't have a production. So S -> NT7 NT23 is impossible.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT97 NT54. Both NT97 and NT54 have productions. Looking at NT97, the production is -> 't31'. So NT97 can directly produce 't31'. For NT54, one production is -> 't12'. Another is NT54 -> 't12' as a terminal. So let's see: S can expand as \"t31 t12\" if we take NT97 -> t31 and NT54 -> t12. That would give \"t31 t12\". But our string starts with t37 t37, so that won't match. So maybe we need to find another way.\n\nOption 3: S -> NT99 NT54. NT99 expands into NT66 NT16. NT66 is produced by NT66 -> 't51', and NT16 is NT16 -> 't90'. So the expansion could be \"t51 t90\" from S -> NT99 NT54, with NT99 expanding to NT66 NT16 and NT54 expanding to 't12'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me write down each step:\n\nS -> NT99 NT54 \u2192 (NT99->NT66 NT16) (NT54->t12) \u2192 NT66 NT16 t12\nBut NT66 is a non-terminal, so it needs to expand. Looking at the productions, NT66 -> 't51'. So:\n\nS -> NT99 NT54 \u2192 NT66 NT16 t12 \u2192 t51 NT16 t12\nNow, NT16 needs to expand. NT16 -> 't90', so:\n\nt51 t90 t12. So the first three symbols would be t51 t90 t12, which don't match the given string starting with t37 t37. So S -> NT99 NT54 doesn't seem to help.\n\nSo maybe the string starts with multiple applications. Let me think differently. Maybe the string is generated by a series of expansions. Let's break down the string:\n\nt37 t37 t25 t53 t87 t37 t93 t54 t86 t93 t86 t17 t12 t62 t23 t13 t51 t53 t36 t31 t33 t85 t86 t41 t37 t31 t13 t96 t17 t41 t41 t37.\n\nLooking at the start, t37 appears twice. Maybe the first two t37s come from some non-terminal expansions.\n\nLooking at the productions, which terminals start with t37. Scanning through all the productions, I see NT50 -> 't85', NT48 -> 't86', NT1 -> 't57', NT2 -> 't96', etc. Hmm, let's see if any non-terminals expand into t37. Checking all productions, I don't see any NT -> 't37' directly. So t37 must come from a combination of non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps non-terminals that can produce t37. Looking through all the productions, none of the NTs expand directly into t37. So t37 must come from a combination of two non-terminals. So the string starts with two t37s, which might mean that the first two non-terminals in the first step both expand into t37.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with two t37s because the same non-terminal produces t37 twice. Let me check if any NT produces t37 in two different ways. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT producing t37, so t37 must be a combination. For example, if NT37 is split into two, but none of the NTs produce t37 directly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built by multiple steps, each time expanding non-terminals into two parts, which might result in the sequence. Let me try another approach.\n\nAnother way is to construct the parse tree from the string, seeing if it can be derived from S.\n\nStarting with the string, let's split it into parts and see which productions can generate those splits.\n\nLet me consider the first two t37s. So the first part is t37 t37. Let's see which NTs can produce t37 followed by t37.\n\nLooking for NTs that have a production where the first symbol is t37 and the second is t37. But I don't see any such NTs. Alternatively, perhaps each t37 comes from a production that has two non-terminals, each of which expand into t37.\n\nWait, but again, no NT produces t37 directly, so maybe it's more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the possible expansion sequences. Let's see:\n\nLooking for a production that has two non-terminals which can each produce t37.\n\nBut again, none of the NTs have a production that starts with t37.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the t37 comes from an NT that eventually expands into two t37s through a chain of productions.\n\nThis seems complicated. Another approach is to list all possible NTs that can produce t37, but as per the given grammar, none do. So t37 must be the result of a production involving two non-terminals that together expand into t37.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one production involves t37 and another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long, so let's see if there's a pattern or recurring NTs.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the first t37 comes from NT57, but checking the productions, there's an NT1 -> 't57', but NT1 is not producing t37.\n\nWait, perhaps the NTs that lead to t37 must have a production where both parts are t37.\n\nLooking again, perhaps NT58 -> 't87', but that doesn't help.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the string starts with two t37s because the same NT is expanding in two different ways, but I don't see any NT that produces two t37s in one production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the t37s are from two different NTs that produce t37. But in the grammar, there's no NT that directly produces t37.\n\nWait, perhaps the first t37 comes from NT28 -> 't36' and NT1 ... Hmm, wait, looking at the productions, NT28 -> 't36', but that's one symbol, not t37.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for any NTs that have two t37s in their production.\n\nWait, I think I might be stuck here. Perhaps the answer is 'No', because I can't find any NTs that can generate t37, making it impossible to have two t37s at the beginning. Alternatively, maybe t37 is generated from some combination of non-terminals that I haven't considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the t37 comes from NT56 -> 't10"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has two main characteristics: all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC (where A, B, C are non-terminals), or A \u2192 a (where a is a terminal), and there's a start symbol S that can produce any non-terminal. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because all rules are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal.\n\nThe grammar has a bunch of non-terminals (NT followed by numbers) and terminals (t followed by numbers or just letters). The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by writing down the grammar rules and the string.\n\nThe grammar rules are:\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT95 (Wait, in the given grammar, I see two separate S rules: the first one is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and the second is probably S \u2192 NT97 NT54, but I notice that in the provided rules at the end, S is shown as NT7 NT23 and NT97 NT54. Wait, looking back, the first part shows S as \"S -> NT7 NT23\" and \"S -> NT97 NT54\". So S can produce either of these two options. That means the start symbol has two possible top-level productions.\n\nThe string to check is: t96 t93 t66 t31 t71 t10 t10 t37 t90 t93 t32 t12 t41 t53 t31 t84 t4 t17 t10 t25 t54 t87 t4 t87 t51 t66 t19 t23 t32 t32 t86.\n\nI need to see how this string can be generated from the grammar.\n\nSince the string is a long sequence of terminals, I'll try to parse it step by step using a top-down approach, starting with S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nLet me check each option.\n\nFirst, option 1: S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo the first symbols produced by this rule will be the symbols from NT7 and NT23. I'll see if the string starts with anything that matches these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT7: I see NT7 \u2192 t48. So NT7 is replaced by the terminal t48. Similarly, NT23's rules are a bit complex, but let's check. The rules for NT23 are:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\nNT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18\nNT28 \u2192 NT13 NT50\nNT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18\nNT50 \u2192 NT59 NT46\nNT46 \u2192 t13\nNT41 \u2192 t68\nAnd other rules like NT84 is replaced by t32, and so on. Wait, but in this case, I'm starting with S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which would output t48 (from NT7) followed by whatever NT23 produces.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nString: t96 t93 t66 t31 t71 t10 t10 t37 t90 t93 t32 t12 t41 t53 t31 t84 t4 t17 t10 t25 t54 t87 t4 t87 t51 t66 t19 t23 t32 t32 t86.\n\nWait, but if S \u2192 NT7 NT23 starts with t48, which isn't present at the beginning of the string, which starts with t96. So this production might not be the path to take. Or maybe I've misread the grammar rules.\n\nLet me check: looking back, the grammar rules start with S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nBut wait, I see that later in the grammar, several non-terminals like NT7, NT23, etc., have production rules that may include terminals. For example, NT84 \u2192 t32, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build a table of all the non-terminals and their possible production rules, including the terminals.\n\nBut that might take a while, but perhaps I can find a way to check the string's production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's helpful to reverse the process: think about the string as a sequence of terminals and see if it can be decomposed using the grammar's rules.\n\nAnother approach is to use a recursive descent parser, checking each symbol step by step.\n\nLet me first consider that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nWhen I apply S \u2192 NT7 NT23, the string must start with the two terminals that NT7 and NT23 produce. From the grammar:\n\nLooking up NT7: in the provided rules, I see NT7 \u2192 t48. So the first symbol would be t48, but the string starts with t96. So that path doesn't work. Therefore, maybe the string starts with something that comes from the other production of S.\n\nThe other option is S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's see what NT97 and NT54 produce.\n\nLooking up NT97: the rule is NT97 \u2192 t31.\n\nLooking up NT54: the rule is NT54 \u2192 t12. But wait, in the provided rules, I see more detailed rules for some non-terminals, but it seems that NT54 can produce a terminal or non-terminals. Wait, let me check the given grammar:\n\nThe grammar rules are:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\nNT90 -> NT84 NT8\nNT50 -> NT55 NT1\nNT8 -> NT40 NT96\nNT56 -> t10\nNT95 -> t41\nNT28 -> t36\nNT8 -> t19\nNT41 -> t68\nNT54 -> t12\nNT46 -> t13\nNT48 -> t96\nNT94 -> t87\nNT46 -> t37\nNT23 -> t62\nNT48 -> t86\nNT13 -> t33\nNT97 -> t54\nNT1 -> t57\nNT18 -> t96\nNT16 -> t90\nNT28 -> t66\nNT40 -> t17\nNT84 -> t4\nNT84 -> t84\nNT56 -> t99\nNT66 -> t51\nNT54 -> t53\nNT23 -> t86\nNT84 -> t57\nNT53 -> t85\nNT40 -> t35\nNT22 -> t57\nNT7 -> t48\nNT28 -> t13\nNT84 -> t57\nNT86 -> t25\nNT50 -> t85\nNT16 -> t23\n\nWait, that's a lot. So looking back, for NT97, the rule is NT97 \u2192 't31', which I think is a terminal. Similarly, other NT rules often go to terminals or deeper non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, for S \u2192 NT97 NT54, NT97 is t31 and NT54 is, wait, in the given rules, the production for NT54 is not given directly, but I see in the rules a line:\n\nNT54 -> 't12'\n\nSo NT54 would produce t12. But in the string, after the first t31 (from NT97), the next symbol is t93, not t12. So this path also doesn't match the string's next symbol.\n\nHmm, that suggests that neither of the initial S productions directly start with the first symbol"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-619","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. All productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. So, looking at the grammar provided, I need to make sure all the productions follow this rule. Wait, but actually, the user provided the grammar as already in CNF, so I can assume that's correct and move on without checking each production. That's a relief; I just need to focus on parsing the string.\n\nNext, the string given is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t99 t57 t32 t17 t90 t48 t36 t62 t68 t37 t4 t25 t87 t4 t86 t36 t23 t53 t25 t25 t85 t19 t68 t54 t33 t85 t4 t57 t35 t32 t84 t35 t90`.\n\nI think the key here is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol, which is S. Let me check the productions:\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Each of these has two non-terminals on the right side, which is allowed in CNF.\n\nLooking at other productions, they seem to consist of two non-terminals except for the ones that produce terminals, which are just single tokens. For example, NT54 \u2192 't12' is a production with a terminal, but in CNF, that's allowed since it's just a single symbol on the right.\n\nSo, now, I need to see if the given string can be derived from the grammar. Since the string consists of a series of terminals, I should see if each can be matched by the productions.\n\nLet me think about how the parse tree would look. The start symbol S splits into NT7 and NT23. Let me look at NT7 and NT23's productions.\n\nLooking at NT7, in the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't48', which is a single terminal. So, NT7 can be replaced by 't48'. Similarly, NT23 has two different productions: one to 't62' and another sometimes. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT23 appears in multiple places. One rule is NT23 \u2192 't62', so that's a direct terminal. Another is NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. Hmm, so depending on which production we take, the expansion can vary.\n\nBut since in our string, T23 is followed by T68, then T37, T4, etc., I need to see if this can be derived.\n\nLet me try to construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, the string starts with T7: t48 (from NT7 \u2192 't48'). So the first token matches.\n\nNext, after NT7, we have NT23. The next tokens after t48 are t57, t32, etc.\n\nWait, the string is: t99 t57 t32 t17 t90 t48 t36 t62 t68 t37 t4 ... Hmm, no, wait: Actually, the string starts with t99, not t48. Wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, the original string is `t99 t57 t32 t17 t90 t48 t36 t62 t68 t37 t4 t25 t87 t4 t86 t36 t23 t53 t25 t25 t85 t19 t68 t54 t33 t85 t4 t57 t35 t32 t84 t35 t90`.\n\nWait, I think I misread that. Let me write it down properly:\n\nThe string tokens are:\nt99, t57, t32, t17, t90, t48, t36, t62, t68, t37, t4, t25, t87, t4, t86, t36, t23, t53, t25, t25, t85, t19, t68, t54, t33, t85, t4, t57, t35, t32, t84, t35, t90.\n\nSo, the first token is t99. So, starting from S \u2192 NT97 NT54, which is T97 and T54.\n\nBut in our string, the first token is t99, which isn't directly produced by the start symbol S in either of its productions. Let me check the grammar rules for NT99.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16. Then NT66 \u2192 NT51, which is 't51', a terminal. NT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40. Hmm, so NT99 can produce 't51' and a combination further down.\n\nBut our string starts with 't99', which is T99. But according to the grammar, does T99 produce anything? Let me check if any of the productions have T99 as the left-hand side.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, and not directly as a terminal, but T99 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal. So, S can produce NT97 or NT54, both non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't99', which is T99, a terminal. So, T99 can perhaps only be derived by production that has T99 on the LHS? Or perhaps not. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the only way T99 can appear is if it's produced by a rule where T99 is the LHS, but looking through the rules, I don't see any rule for T99 as LHS. Only NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let's look at the rules again. The user provided the grammar as follows:\n\nThe lines start with S, then other non-terminals, and the terminals are in single quotes.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- ...and so on.\n\nSo, T99 is a non-terminal only if any production has T99 as LHS. But I don't see any production where T99 is the LHS. Only NT99 has T99 as part of a production, but as RHS. So, that would mean T99 can't be a terminal, because in the grammar, it's a non-terminal.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the string, T99 appears as a terminal. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's 't99', which is a terminal. But in the grammar, does T99 have a production that produces a terminal? From what I can see, all productions either split into non-terminals or into terminals.\n\nWait, let me check again. Is there any production where the non-terminal is T99 and produces a terminal?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT99 appears as NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n- NT66 \u2192 NT51\n- NT51 is a terminal? Or is it NT51? Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT66 -> NT51\nSo, NT66 can produce 't51', which is a terminal.\n\nBut for T99, it's the non-terminal, so T99 can only be derived from NT99, which is not a terminal. Hmm, so this might cause a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused about NT99 and T99. Let me clarify:\n\nThe grammar symbols are all uppercase, perhaps non-terminals, except when they end with something else, like T99 is a specific non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the grammar; perhaps in the given grammar, NT99 is a non-terminal that produces 't99' as a terminal. Looking again:\n\nThe grammar rules are listed, and in each rule, the LHS is the non-terminal, followed by the RHS, which can be a combination of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the first few productions:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nNT97 -> 't31'\nNT54 -> 't12'\n\nSo, NT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which has all productions of the form A -> BC or A -> a. So, every production either replaces a symbol with two symbols or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t37 t35 t93 t37 t35 t71 t25 t32 t85 t31 t31 t25 t71 t10 t17 t85 t90 t54 t62 t71 t96 t71 t96 t17 t54 t19 t84 t31 t66 t86 t48 t84 t93.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT99, etc.) and terminals (like 't93', 't37', etc.). Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every non-terminal can be expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step. Since the string has 39 symbols, each production either adds one terminal or keeps adding non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nStarting with S -> NT99 NT54 or S -> NT97 NT23. Let me look at which production might produce the starting symbols of the string.\n\nThe first symbol is 't37'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT46 -> 't37' and NT94 -> 't87', but not immediately 't37'. Wait, looking again, there's NT98 -> 't40' and NT58 -> 't54' or 't22' from NT58's production: NT58 -> NT94 NT54 or NT22. Oh wait, NT58 can go to 't22' when NT54 -> 't53' isn't terminal. Hmm, but 't37' is produced only by NT46. Let me check the productions:\n\nYes, NT46 -> 't37'.\n\nSo, to get 't37' as the first symbol, the leftmost symbol must come from NT46. But wait, S can't directly produce NT46. So perhaps that's not the starting point. Alternatively, maybe the first production in the string comes from a non-terminal that can be expanded into 't37' and something else.\n\nWait, looking at S's productions:\n\nS can be NT99 NT54 or NT97 NT23.\n\nLooking at NT99's productions: NT99 -> NT66 NT16. Neither are terminals yet. NT66 can go to 't51', and NT16 can go to 't90'. So from NT99, the first expansion could be 't51 t90', but the string starts with 't37', so that's not matching.\n\nLooking at NT97: NT97 -> 't31' (since NT97 -> 't31' is a direct production). So if S is NT97 NT23, then the string starts with 't31 t... So the second part of S is NT23, which can be NT45 NT53. Let's see NT45: NT45 -> 't68'. NT53 -> 't85'. So if S starts as NT97 (t31) followed by NT23 (t68 t85), but the string starts with 't37', so this doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the starting NT isn't S directly. Since S is the top, perhaps the start is generated from S, but I need to see if the string starts with symbols that can be generated from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should list all the non-terminals that can eventually produce a terminal and see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nLooking at all the non-terminals:\n\nStart with S -> NT99 NT54 or NT97 NT23.\n\nLet me consider S -> NT97 NT23 first, because S->NT97... might give 't31' as the first terminal.\n\nSo the first symbol would be 't31' from NT97. Then next symbol is 't35'.\n\nLooking at NT23: NT23 can be broken down into NT45 NT53 or other productions. Let's see:\n\nNT23's main production is NT45 NT53, which can go to 't68' and 't85' respectively. So the string after 't31' would need to start with 't68 t85'. But the actual string starts with 't35' after 't31', so that doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe I picked the wrong initial production.\n\nAlternatively, S->NT99 NT54.\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16. Let's see NT66 -> 't51' and NT16 -> 't90', so the first two symbols would be 't51 t90', but the string starts with 't37 t35', which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe neither initial production is correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the entire string and see if I can break it down.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt37 t35 t93 t37 t35 t71 t25 t32 t85 t31 t31 t25 t71 t10 t17 t85 t90 t54 t62 t71 t96 t71 t96 t17 t54 t19 t84 t31 t66 t86 t48 t84 t93.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by expanding S.\n\nLet me see if any of the non-terminals can generate sequences of terminals matching parts of this string.\n\nLooking for 't93' first: Where is 't93' generated?\n\nLooking at the productions, NT84 can go to 't93' because NT84 has a production -> 't93' (the second option is 't84').

{"custom_id":"request-644","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, all the start symbols (like S, NT99, etc.) produce either two non-terminals or a terminal directly.\n\nThe given string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. The string is: `t13 t57 t17 t68 t4 t32 t32 t48 t12 t96 t37 t66 t96 t85 t53 t85 t48 t85 t35 t41 t13 t51 t62 t71 t17 t87 t51 t25 t23 t10 t84 t31 t86 t17`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. My approach here is to model the reductions step by step according to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the start symbol, looking at the given grammar, I see the start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT93 NT54\n\nWait, I notice that one of the options for S is S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, the string must be built starting from either S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, I'll try S \u2192 NT97 NT54 because the string starts with 't57', which is probably part of NT97 or another rule.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT97 \u2192 't54' and also has other productions:\n- NT97 \u2192 NT45 NT54 (But NT54 ends with 't54', not longer, wait, looking again: NT54 \u2192 't12' or 't53' or 't54'). Wait, in the grammar, the production for NT54 is listed as NT54 \u2192 't12' and NT54 \u2192 't53'? Let me check the grammar provided:\n\nLooking back, yes, in the grammar, NT54 can produce 't12' or 't53'. Wait, actually, in the grammar block, NT54 appears twice: once as S \u2192 NT97 NT54, and then under NT54 \u2192 't12' and NT54 \u2192 't53'. Wait, that can't be right because each symbol should have one set of rules. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nAh, no, in the given grammar, there are multiple lines under each NT symbol. For example, under NT54, it's written as:\n\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT54 -> 't53'\n\nWait, that can't be correct because each production is under a single line. So, actually, probably, each NT symbol has multiple production rules. So, NT54 can produce 't12' and 't53' as terminal symbols.\n\nWait, but in the initial rules, the first rule under S is S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, S produces NT97 and NT54, each of which might be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't13', so maybe we need to track how the symbols reduce.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start by looking for possible reductions in the string against the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe 31 tokens, and each step in the grammar replacement would replace a symbol with two others (non-terminals) until they become terminals.\n\nGiven that the problem is manageable, I think building a parse tree might be the way to go, but manually tracking that with such a long string would be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to match the start of the string.\n\nLet me first note the structure of the string:\n\nt13, t57, t17, t68, t4, t32, t32, t48, t12, t96, t37, t66, t96, t85, t53, t85, t48, t85, t35, t41, t13, t51, t62, t71, t17, t87, t51, t25, t23, t10, t84, t31, t86, t17.\n\nLet's break this down into components:\n\nLooking at the initial steps, S can produce either NT97 NT54 or NT7 NT23.\n\nIf we take S \u2192 NT97 NT54, then the start would be t97 and t54.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is t13, which doesn't seem to match t97 or t54. So that might not be the right path.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nAgain, t7 and t23. The string starts with t13, which isn't t7 or t23, so that can't be either. Wait, but hold on, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the NT symbols. The NTs represent non-terminals that can produce multiple symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the possible starting reductions where the first symbol is either t7 or t97, and then proceed.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t13, which doesn't match any of the initial non-terminals S's productions. So maybe I need to consider that the initial steps might involve more reductions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to try to process the string step by step, working backward from the end, checking if it can be reduced.\n\nWait, another approach is to perform a leftmost or rightmost derivation, perhaps using the parse table.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps a better approach is to attempt to parse the string according to the grammar rules.\n\nHowever, since parsing a long string manually is time-consuming, maybe I can look for a pattern or see if all the terminals in the string can be covered by the grammar.\n\nLooking again at the given grammar, I can try to map what the rules generate.\n\nLet me list some of the production rules:\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't54'\n- NT48 \u2192 't48'\n- NT53 \u2192 't53'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12' and 't53'\n- Other non-terminals produce various terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to identify all the terminals in the string and see if each one can be produced by some rule.\n\nList of terminals in the string:\n\nt13, t57, t17, t68, t4, t32, t32, t48, t12, t96, t37, t66, t96, t85, t53, t85, t48, t85, t35, t41, t13, t51, t62, t71, t17, t87, t51, t25, t23, t10, t84, t31, t86, t17.\n\nNow, for each terminal, check if it's present in any of the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't71', 't40'\n- NT53 \u2192 't53'\n- NT7 \u2192 't48'\n- NT58 \u2192 't94', 't54'\n- NT46 \u2192 't13', 't37'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62', 't86', 't23'\n- And more.\n\nWait, actually, NT96 is a non-terminal that produces 't96', among others.\n\nWait, but in the string, there's a 't48' which is produced by NT48, which I think has a production NT48 \u2192 't48', but does NT48 have any other rules? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, from line 'NT48 -> ...' I don't see a production rule for NT48. Wait, let me go back to the grammar provided:\n\nThe given grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT99 NT54\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\nNT96 -> NT48 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-646","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string I'm checking is:\n\n`t93 t23 t41 t13 t32 t62 t66 t68 t90 t86 t68 t23 t93 t23 t84 t66 t4 t68 t10 t31 t71 t23 t13 t12 t31 t35 t23 t19 t85 t90 t54 t19 t93 t85`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure by looking at the production rules. The start symbol is S, and from the productions, I can see that S directly expands into either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So the string must begin with either 't93' (from NT7 -> 't93') followed by 't23' or 't93' directly if another path is taken. Wait, no\u2014the production for NT7 is 't93', so S -> NT7 NT23 would mean the first two tokens are 't93' and whatever NT23 expands to, right? Wait, no, NT23 is a non-terminal. Let me check: the production NT23 can expand into several things, each of which is a pair of non-terminals except one.\n\nLooking at the NT23 productions:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT23 -> NT48 NT23\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53 (same as first)\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50 (same as second)\nSo, NT23 can expand to either NT45 NT53, NT13 NT50, or NT48 NT23. Wait, hold on, looking at the provided grammar, the productions for NT23 are:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT23 -> NT48 NT23\nAnd perhaps others. Wait, in the given grammar, I have to list all NT23 productions. Let me scan through:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT99 -> NT28 NT16\nWait, no, that's NT99. Wait, the grammar provided lists all the non-terminals and their productions. Looking through, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- Also, is there another NT23 production? Let me check: the grammar includes NT23 \u2192 NT48 NT23. So that's a recursive production. So, NT23 can expand into NT45 NT53, NT13 NT50, or NT48 NT23. The recursive one (NT48 NT23) would allow for longer derivations.\n\nSimilarly, I should check all non-terminals to see where they lead.\n\nNow, the given string starts with 't93', which must come from NT7 -> 't93'. So S -> NT7 NT23 would give us 't93' followed by whatever NT23 gives. Alternatively, S -> NT97 NT54 would give 't31' (from NT97) followed by 't54' (from NT54). But the string starts with 't93', so the first production S -> NT7 NT23 is the one that applies here.\n\nTherefore, the next part after 't93' should be the expansion of NT23. Looking at the string, after 't93' comes 't23', which is 't23'. Now, NT23 can expand into several options:\n\n1. NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n2. NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n3. NT23 -> NT48 NT23\n\nI need to see if any of these can lead to 't23' as the next token. Looking at the productions of NT45, NT53, etc.\n\nLooking at NT45: NT45 -> NT99 NT95. Neither of those are terminals; NT99 is a non-terminal, and NT95 expands into 't41' and NT95. Wait, no\u2014NT95 is a non-terminal that can expand into 't41' and 't90'? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT95 -> 't90' and another production?\n\nWait, no, the grammar has each production rule, and each non-terminal's production rules are all at the same level. So for example, NT94 -> NT96 NT98, etc. So for NT95: Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the productions for NT95 are:\n\nNT95 -> 't84' (maybe?), or NT95 -> ...? Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\n\nNT84 -> NT84 (Wait, that doesn't make sense). Wait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, I need to find all NT95's productions.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nNT95 -> 't90' no, not in the given list. Wait, let's check:\n\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n\n- NT86 -> NT23 NT93\n\n- NT58 -> NT22 NT8\n\n- NT50 -> NT55 NT1\n\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n\n- NT94 -> 't87'\n\n- NT46 -> 't37'\n\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n\n- NT48 -> 't86'\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should go step by step.\n\nFirst, S -> NT7 NT23, so 't93' and NT23.\n\nNT23 can expand as NT45 NT53, NT13 NT50, or NT48 NT23.\n\nLooking at the string after 't93': the next is 't23', so that suggests that after NT23, the next token is 't23'. So what does NT23 produce? One of its productions must result in 't23'. Looking at NT23's possible expansions:\n\n- If NT23 expands to NT48 NT23, then the next part would be NT48 NT23. Now, NT48 expands to 't96'. So that would produce 't96' followed by whatever NT23 gives. But in the string, after 't93' is 't23', not 't96'. So this path might not fit.\n\nWait, but I'm only looking at the next token after 't93', which is 't23'. So the entire expansion of NT23 must start with 't23'. Therefore, if NT23 directly produces 't23', that would be ideal. But looking at NT23's productions, they all are either pairs of non-terminals. So there's no direct terminal 't23' production for NT23. So this seems problematic.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Each production for a non-terminal can only have two non-terminals or a terminal. But in the given grammar, no production for NT23 ends with a terminal. So NT23 can't produce a single 't23'. So that would mean that the string can't have 't23' after 't93', unless there's a way for NT23 to derive 't23' through some sequence of productions.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because NT23's productions are all to non-terminals. So if NT23 has to produce 't23', it would have to go through multiple steps. So perhaps the next part of the string is a derivation of 't23' from NT23.\n\nBut the string after 't93' is 't23' as the next token. So let's think: Starting with S -> NT7 NT23, which gives 't93' then NT23.\n\nSo, to get 't23' after 't93', NT23 must derive a string that starts with 't23'. So let's see if any of the NT23 expansions can lead to 't23'.\n\nLooking at the possible expansions of NT23:\n\n1. NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nSo, NT45 and NT53 must expand to something that combines to 't23'. Let's see what NT45 and NT53 can do.\n\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95.\n\nNT99 -> NT28 NT16.\n\nNT28 -> 't36' (no, NT28 -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-662","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of 't' terms followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF means. Each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals (except a, which is a terminal). Looking at the grammar, every rule starts with a capital letter on the left and has either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal with a single lowercase letter. Wait, no, I should check that. Hmm, looking at the grammar rules, all the productions seem to have exactly two non-terminals on the right. The exception might be when a terminal symbol is present as a single character, but in the given grammar, I don't see any rules where a terminal is directly produced; they all seem to go to two non-terminals. Wait, actually, some rules have a terminal on the right side. For example, NT97 -> 't31', where 't31' is a terminal. So that's fine because in CNF, terminals can be included as single symbols in the productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t41 t87 t31 t84 t93 t4 t71 t71 t54 t96 t17 t99 t13 t51 t85 t62 t13 t12 t66 t71 t51 t33 t66 t71 t96 t25 t96 t96 t4 t36 t87 t84 t17 t31 t33`.\n\nI think the standard approach is to use parsing or build a derivation tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can apply the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars. But manually doing CYK for such a long string might be tedious. Alternatively, since the string is built of terminals, perhaps I can trace back through the productions to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nLet me outline a possible plan:\n\n1. Identify the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal in the productions has exactly two non-terminals on the right. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\n2. The string consists of a series of terminals. Each terminal is either a single letter followed by a number, but in the given grammar, the terminals are like 'tX', where X is a series of digits. So, for example, 't41' is a terminal.\n\n3. The idea is to see if this sequence can be generated by the start symbol S, following the production rules.\n\n4. To check, I can try to reconstruct the parse tree starting from S and see if it can produce the string.\n\nAlternatively, since all the productions only have two non-terminals on the right, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, building a binary tree of productions.\n\nGiven the string has 36 tokens, the parse tree will have a height log2(36), but since it's a binary tree, it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about how the parsing works step by step. The CYK algorithm uses dynamic programming to keep track of possible non-terminals that can derive substrings of the string.\n\nBut doing this manually for 36 tokens would take a long time. Instead, maybe I can build a parse tree step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two rules:\n\nRule 1: S -> NT7 NT23\n\nRule 2: S -> NT97 NT54\n\nHmm, wait, no. Looking back, the grammar says S can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, the rules for S are:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nWait, so each S production is two non-terminals. So the first step is that S -> NT7 NT23. Then each of these non-terminals will have their own productions.\n\nNow, let me look at the string. The first token is 't41'. So in the first step, we have to find a non-terminal that can produce 't41'.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see NT41 is defined as NT16 -> NT56 NT40. Wait, no, wait: in the grammar, looking for NTsomething that can produce 't41'. Let me check the production rules for NT that can produce 't41'.\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\n\nAh, yes, NT13 -> NT41 NT18.\n\nSo if NT13 can produce 't41' followed by 't18', which is in the string, then that's possible.\n\nLooking at the string: positions 18-19 are 't13 t51'. Wait, no, the first token is t41, then t87, t31, etc. Let's see the exact order:\n\nThe string is: t41 t87 t31 t84 t93 t4 t71 t71 t54 t96 t17 t99 t13 t51 t85 t62 t13 t12 t66 t71 t51 t33 t66 t71 t96 t25 t96 t96 t4 t36 t87 t84 t17 t31 t33.\n\nWait, the string is 36 tokens, each being a terminal. So the first token is t41. So to derive t41, we need NT13 -> t41 t18.\n\nLooking at the string, after t41 comes t87, then t31, which is much later. Hmm, this suggests that maybe the string doesn't align with a possibleparse tree, because NT13 would produce t41 followed by t18, but the next tokens are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that t41 must come from a production that starts with t41, which is NT13, as per the rule NT13-> NT41 NT18.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t41, which would require that the first production is NT13, which would then require NT41 and NT18. But NT41 is another non-terminal, and so on.\n\nBut let me check the entire string for any possible NT that can start a rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for each terminal in the string and find the possible NT it can come from, then trace whether the sequence makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach from the start symbol and try to see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nThen, NT7 has a rule. Looking at the grammar, looking for NT7. Wait, I don't see any production for NT7. Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT50 -> 't71'\n\nWait, no. NT16 is -> NT56 NT40.\n\nWait, let me check all the NT productions to see if any have 't41' as their left-hand side.\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18.\n\nSo if NT13 is part of the start symbol, but the start symbol is S -> NT97 NT54 or NT7 NT23.\n\nWait, S has two options: option 1 is NT7 NT23, and option 2 is NT97 NT54.\n\nSo first, I think the first step is to see if the string can be parsed using either of these options.\n\nOption 1: Start with NT7 NT23.\n\nSo the string starts with t41. For this to fit, NT7 must derive t41, but looking at the productions, I don't see a rule where NT7 produces a terminal directly. Wait, the productions for NT7 is:\n\nLooking back: NT7 might not have a production, but let's check. Looking at the production rules given:\n\nNT7 has a rule NT7 -> 't48'.\n\nAh, yes, in the grammar:\n\nNT7-> 't48'\n\nWait, let me confirm: looking through the rules, yes, I see:\n\nNT7-> 't48'\n\nSimilarly, others have rules like:\n\nNT40->'t71'\n\nSo in the start symbol's first production, S-> NT7 NT23:\n\nNT7 can produce 't48', and NT23 can produce which terminal?\n\nLooking at NT23, it has the following rules:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nNT23 also has NT23-> 't62'\n\nAh, yes, in the given grammar, we have NT23-> 't62'.\n\nSo the start symbol's option 1 is: S-> NT7 NT23. So taking the leftmost derivation, it would first replace S with NT7 NT23. Then, to produce the string, each non-terminal in NT7 and NT23 must produce"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-666","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string, and I need to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and it's been expanded in the given productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and another production for S: S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So the start symbol S can derive two different sequences, each starting with NT prefixes. So, the string must be a combination of these.\n\nThe given string is quite long: `t17 t19 t25 t10 t12 t23 t12 t23 t10 t33 t31 t62 t31 t23 t25 t41 t48 t19 t19 t32 t54 t53 t84 t12 t90 t53 t54 t25 t87 t4 t87 t85 t62 t35 t48`.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My approach is to see if the string can be constructed by the grammar, checking each step to see if the productions can be applied.\n\nI should start by looking at the possible initial expansions from S. It can go to NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So the string should start with either \"t7 t23\" or \"t97 t54\", but wait, looking at the string, it starts with t17, which is not among these. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me look at the grammar's S productions again. Oh, no, S is followed by NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So the initial symbols would be NT7 followed by NT23, which when expanded would become 't7' and 't23' respectively. But the string starts with t17, not t7 or t97.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the NT symbols are variables, and their expansions might start with 't' followed by a number. So perhaps the string's first part corresponds to an NT production.\n\nWait, let me look at the NT94 production: NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98, and in the string, I see t96 and t98 in the middle. Maybe that's a clue. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into a sequence of NT symbols that each have productions leading to the t's.\n\nI think the best approach is to model this as a series of steps where each t in the string must be derived from a non-terminal symbol in the grammar that can produce it. So, starting from S, we can generate two possible sentences, but since the string starts with t17, which isn't directly part of S's direct expansions, I need to see if t17 can be derived from somewhere else.\n\nWait, t17 is generated by NT40 \u2192 't71'. Looking at the grammar, NT40 can produce 't71' which is t71, but in the string, we have t17. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check NT40's production: NT40 \u2192 't71'. So, how can t17 be part of the string? Maybe it's not directly connected to NT40.\n\nWait, maybe I got the grammar wrong. Let me re-express the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is as follows:\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT7 NT23\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo S can produce a combination where the first part is NT7 leading to t7, and second is NT23 leading to t23. But the string starts with t17, which isn't directly from S's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps t17 comes from another non-terminal. Let me look for NT that can produce t17.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT40 \u2192 't71', NT46 \u2192 't13', NT48 \u2192 't96', etc. Hmm, but nowhere is there an NT that produces 't17'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t17 is part of a longer derivation. Let's try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt17, t19, t25, t10, t12, t23, t12, t23, t10, t33, t31, t62, t31, t23, t25, t41, t48, t19, t19, t32, t54, t53, t84, t12, t90, t53, t54, t25, t87, t4, t87, t85, t62, t35, t48.\n\nLooking for t4, which is produced by NT8 \u2192 't32'; t19 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 't19'; t25 \u2192 NT84 \u2192 't25'; t12 \u2192 NT85 \u2192 't53'? Wait, no, wait: looking at the grammar, let's make a list of all terminals and their corresponding NTs.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't71', which is 't7' concatenated wrong? Wait, no, let me check each terminal production:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT50 \u2192 't53', wait let's check each line where NT produces a terminal:\n\nNT50: 't53'\nNT54: 't12'\nNT40: 't71' \u2192 Wait, but earlier in the grammar, it's written as NT40 \u2192 't71' but the string has t17. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT54 \u2192 't54' and NT40 \u2192 't71', which would mean the terminals are t54 and t71, but the string has t17, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, there's a confusion here.

{"custom_id":"request-686","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of symbols, and each symbol must match the production rules of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of a start symbol S and various non-terminal symbols (S, NT, followed by numbers) that can produce other symbols or sequences. Some of these rules terminate with terminals, which are the actual symbols in the string, like 't...', 't71', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\nt33 t90 t33 t12 t66 t31 t93 t87 t96 t57 t41 t86 t37 t57 t86 t31 t32 t87 t31 t12 t33 t85 t17 t51 t86 t32 t87 t48 t23 t71 t48 t25 t48 t84 t86 t32.\n\nI'll try to break down the string into parts that match the production rules.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, the only options are:\n- S -> NT99 NT23\n- S -> NT97 NT54\n\nLooking at the string, the first parts could correspond to these. Let's see if I can break the string using these rules.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT99 NT23\nNT99 could be the first symbol, and NT23 the next. Looking at the string, the first symbol is 't33'. Wait, but NT99's production either ends with 't85' or splits into two NTs. Since 't33' isn't a terminal that NT99 produces directly, maybe this option isn't the way to go.\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT99 has production rules. Looking back, the grammar has NT99 -> NT66 NT16 and NT99 -> NT28 NT18. Both of these are non-terminals, which would mean the string would have to expand further. The first part of the string is 't33', which doesn't match NT99 or NT23 directly.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT97 NT54. Let's see what NT97 and NT54 produce. NT97 produces 't31' and 't93'. NT54 produces 't32' and 't12'. Hmm, but the string starts with 't33', which doesn't immediately fit. So this option might not be the right starting point either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. In CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals, which can be generated by the grammar if each terminal can be derived through the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\nt33, t90, t33, t12, t66, t31, t93, t87, t96, t57, t41, t86, t37, t57, t86, t31, t32, t87, t31, t12, t33, t85, t17, t51, t86, t32, t87, t48, t23, t71, t48, t25, t48, t84, t86, t32.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some rules have terminals. For example, NT54 -> 't32', which is a terminal. So t32 is directly produced by NT54. But in the string, the second occurrence is t32. Let's track if that can happen.\n\nSimilarly, NT16 is a non-terminal. Its only production is to 't90' and 't71', so NT16 -> 't90' and 't71'. So if the string has a t90 followed by t71, that could come from NT16.\n\nBut let's see where t33 comes from. Looking at the grammar, NT28 produces 't36', which is not t33. NT23 has production rules like NT23 -> NT45 NT53, but also NT23 has a rule that produces 't57'. Wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT23 has production rules like NT23 -> t48 t53? Or maybe I need to check the specific lines.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar is listed with all the rules. For example:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT23 -> ...\nAnd somewhere, line 18: NT23 -> t71 t48. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-examine the grammar provided. Each line is of the form NTxxx -> something.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nLine 22: NT23 -> NT45 NT53\nLine 23: NT23 -> NT13 NT50\nLine 24: NT23 -> NT45 NT53? Wait, no, lines go beyond 49. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in listing. Let me count more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- Line 1: S->NT99 NT23\n- Line 2: S->NT97 NT54\n- Line 3: NT99->NT66 NT16\n- Line 4: NT58->NT94 NT54\n- Line 5: NT94->NT96 NT98\n- Line 6: NT55->NT90 NT1\n- Line 7: NT90->NT94 NT95\n- Line 8: NT45->NT99 NT95\n- Line 9: NT59->NT56 NT53\n- Line 10: NT53->NT28 NT23\n- Line 11: NT96->NT48 NT23\n- Line 12: NT98->NT48 NT95\n- Line 13: NT16->NT56 NT40\n- Line 14: NT23->NT45 NT53\n- Line 15: NT84->NT58 NT86\n- Line 16: NT23->NT13 NT50\n- Line 17: NT99->NT28 NT18\n- Line 18: NT13->NT41 NT18\n- Line 19: NT90->NT84 NT8\n- Line 20: NT50->NT55 NT1\n- Line 21: NT8->NT40 NT96\n- Line 22: NT58->NT22 NT8\n- Line 23: NT98->NT40 NT90\n- Line 24: NT1->NT88 NT53\n- Line 25: NT50->NT59 NT46\n- Line 26: NT88->NT7 NT40\n- Line 27: NT54->'t93' (Terminal)\n- Line 28: NT97->'t31' (Terminal)\n- Line 29: NT40->'t71' (Terminal)\n- Line 30: NT8->'t32' (Terminal)\n- Line 31: NT56->'t10' (Terminal)\n- Line 32: NT95->'t41' (Terminal)\n- Line 33: NT28->'t36' (Terminal)\n- Line 34: NT8->'t19' (Terminal)\n- Line 35: NT41->'t68' (Terminal)\n- Line 36: NT54->'t12' (Terminal)\n- Line 37: NT46->'t13' (Terminal)\n- Line 38: NT48->'t96' (Terminal)\n- Line 39: NT94->'t87' (Terminal)\n- Line 40: NT46->'t37' (Terminal)\n- Line 41: NT23->'t62' (Terminal)\n- Line 42: NT48->'t86' (Terminal)\n- Line 43: NT13->'t33' (Terminal)\n- Line 44: NT97->'t54' (Terminal)\n- Line 45: NT1->'t57' (Terminal)\n- Line 46: NT18->'t96' (Terminal)\n- Line 47: NT16->'t90' (Terminal)\n- Line 48: NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-683","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the initial symbol if it's a single non-terminal. So, the grammar starts with S -> NT7 NT23, and other rules like S -> NT97 NT54, and so on. \n\nThe string I need to check is `t33 t13 t85 t71 t4 t13 t87 t85 t33 t57 t48 t51 t90 t51 t41 t51 t33 t86 t87 t85 t37 t51 t51 t4 t12 t57 t48 t68 t71 t17 t25 t33 t48 t48 t68 t48`. It's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols. \n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each rule splits the derivation into exactly two non-terminals, so the string should have a length that's a power of 2. Let me check the length.\n\nThe string has 33 tokens. Wait, that's 33, which isn't a power of 2 (since 2^5=32 and 2^6=64). However, in CNF, the number of symbols in the string can vary a bit, but the number of production steps will vary. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Actually, each production step increases the length by 1, so starting from S (1 symbol), after n steps, the string length is 2^n. But the given string has length 33, which is between 2^5 (32) and 2^6 (64). So, maybe it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the count includes the 't's which might be considered as single symbols, so the number of 't's is 32, which is 2^5, but the string includes spaces which I'm not sure about. Wait, let me recount.\n\nLooking at the string: each 't' is followed by a number, separated by spaces. So, the total number of symbols (including both 't' and numbers) is: Let's count the numbers. The string is `t33 t13 t85 t71 t4 t13 t87 t85 t33 t57 t48 t51 t90 t51 t41 t51 t33 t86 t87 t85 t37 t51 t51 t4 t12 t57 t48 t68 t71 t17 t25 t33 t48 t48 t68 t48`. Each 't' and number is a token. Let's count the number of tokens.\n\nLooking at it: it's t33, t13, t85, t71, t4, t13, t87, t85, t33, t57, t48, t51, t90, t51, t41, t51, t33, t86, t87, t85, t37, t51, t51, t4, t12, t57, t48, t68, t71, t17, t25, t33, t48, t48, t68, t48.\n\nWait, that's 34 tokens. So the count is 34, which isn't a power of 2. That's a problem because, in CNF, the derivation length must be such that the number of symbols is 2^n. So having 34 symbols would mean that the number of production steps would have to result in 34 symbols, but 2^n is only 32 or 64, so 34 is in between. This suggests that maybe the string isn't possible because the number of symbols doesn't fit the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of tokens. Let me count them carefully.\n\nBreaking down the string into individual tokens:\n\n1. t33\n2. t13\n3. t85\n4. t71\n5. t4\n6. t13\n7. t87\n8. t85\n9. t33\n10. t57\n11. t48\n12. t51\n13. t90\n14. t51\n15. t41\n16. t51\n17. t33\n18. t86\n19. t87\n20. t85\n21. t37\n22. t51\n23. t51\n24. t4\n25. t12\n26. t57\n27. t48\n28. t68\n29. t71\n30. t17\n31. t25\n32. t33\n33. t48\n34. t48\n35. t68\n36. t48\n\nWait, that's 36 tokens. Hmm, 36 isn't a power of 2 either. Wait, I must have miscounted earlier. Let me recount the tokens provided in the string.\n\nThe string is: `t33 t13 t85 t71 t4 t13 t87 t85 t33 t57 t48 t51 t90 t51 t41 t51 t33 t86 t87 t85 t37 t51 t51 t4 t12 t57 t48 t68 t71 t17 t25 t33 t48 t48 t68 t48`\n\nEach space-separated part is a token.

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual string is different? Let me see again. The user provided the string as `t33 t13 t85 t71 t4 t13 t87 t85 t33 t57 t48 t51 t90 t51 t41 t51 t33 t86 t87 t85 t37 t51 t51 t4 t12 t57 t48 t68 t71 t17 t25 t33 t48 t48 t68 t48`.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted.

So, the idea is to parse the string step by step, checking if each part can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nBut wait, since the string is given, maybe I can approach this by building a derivation tree. Alternatively, I can try to match the string by walking through the grammar rules. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of terminals and try to see if each can be formed by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by listing all the terminals in the string: t51, t71, t90, t32, t32, t96, t99, t96, t32, t99, t37, t71, t19, t71, t99, t4, t71, t12, t41, t99, t19, t87, t53, t10, t87, t87, t68, t10, t48, t17, t32, t93, t54, t13, t93, t33, t62.\n\nHmm, that's 35 tokens. Now, the start symbol is S, which produces NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nSo, the entire string should be generated by one of these initial productions. Let's look at both possibilities.\n\nFirst, S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nThen, each of these NT7 and NT23 should be expanded to produce the symbols in the string.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's a sequence of t's and numbers. Maybe I should check if each symbol corresponds to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the grammar rules, some NTs produce terminals (like 't4', 't71', etc.) directly. So, each token in the string might correspond to a terminal derived from some NT.\n\nSo, the strategy would be to parse the string starting from S, using the grammar's rules, and see if we can reduce the string to S.\n\nBut manually parsing a string with 35 tokens is going to be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for the order in which the terminals appear and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree by recursively applying the grammar rules. But with 35 tokens, that's going to take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reverse the string and see if it can be derived starting from the last symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent or a shifting method.\n\nAlternatively, consider that Chomsky normal form allows productions with two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So, each production in the string must consist of a sequence that can be broken down into two symbols at a time.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the order of terminals in the string. Let me see the first few tokens: t51, t71, t90, t32, t32, etc.\n\nSo, t51 is a terminal; what does it correspond to? Looking at the grammar, NT53 -> 't51', so NT53 can produce 't51'.\n\nSimilarly, t71 corresponds to NT40 (since NT40 -> 't71'). So, t51 is from NT53, t71 from NT40, t90 from NT99, t32 from NT8, etc.\n\nWait, but how do these NTs relate to each other through the grammar? For example, if S is NT7 NT23, then S is split into two parts, each part being a NT. So, the first NT is NT7, which needs to derive into the first part of the string, and the second NT is NT23, which needs to derive into the second part.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of alternations between NT7 and NT23 expansions. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parse the string and see if each part aligns with the possible NTs.\n\nLet me consider the first six tokens: t51, t71, t90, t32, t32, t96.\n\nFrom S, it's NT7 NT23. So, the entire string is the concatenation of the derivations of NT7 and NT23.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part (after S) is derived from NT7 and the second from NT23, or vice versa. Or wait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, each production is to two symbols. So, S -> NT7 NT23 means each of these NTs will eventually become a string of terminals and non-terminals, each contributing one symbol at a time. So, the entire string is built by first expanding NT7 to some sequence, then NT23 to another.\n\nBut wait, in a context-free grammar, each production is applied to a single non-terminal, producing two symbols. So, when S is expanded into NT7 NT23, each of those NTs will then be expanded step by step, each time replacing a single NT with two symbols, either terminals or other NTs.\n\nWait, but in this structure, each symbol in the string corresponds to a single terminal, so each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one. For example, S (1 symbol) becomes NT7 NT23 (2 symbols), each of which may be expanded further until we get a string of terminals.\n\nBut with 35 symbols, which is an odd number, that suggests it can't be directly derived from S because S would produce two symbols, each of which would be part of the string. So, maybe the initial expansion of S would produce two parts, each of which itself is a sequence of symbols contributing to the total. So, the total number of symbols should be even because each NT production adds two symbols each time.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case because NTs can produce other NTs. Hmm, this might not hold because the number of symbols can vary depending on how the NTs are expanded. So, maybe 35 tokens are possible if the expansion process results in that number.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the order of terminals in the string and see if they can be generated by the NT structures.\n\nLooking at the string, let me list the first few and see:\n\n1. t51: NT53 -> t51.\n\n2. t71: NT40 -> t71.\n\n3. t90: NT99 -> t90.\n\n4. t32: NT8 -> t32.\n\n5. t32: NT8 -> t32.\n\n6. t96: NT96 or NT48 or NT99 or NT...

Wait no, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT84 -> 't84', 't4' etc., but t96 is produced by NT86 (NT86 -> t96). But t96 is also produced by NT86. Wait, but in the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT86 -> 't96' perhaps?\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar production rules, so let me check for 't96':\n\nLooking up the rules: I don't see NT86 directly producing 't96', but looking back, in the grammar, I see rules like NT96 -> t48, but perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT48 -> 't96', yes. So, NT48 can be 't96'.

The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. It's a way to structure context-free grammars such that every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol S is also a non-terminal, and the right-hand side of each rule has exactly two symbols. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that most of the rules are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTwv, which are A \u2192 BC. There are some exceptions where a rule produces a single terminal symbol, like NT54 \u2192 't12', which is a terminal. So this grammar seems to fit Chomsky normal form, except for the productions that have a terminal on the right-hand side. Wait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, productions can be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So it seems correct.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t62 t32 t71 t96 t36 t36 t71 t31 t71 t96 t4 t17 t19 t53 t99 t23 t31 t87 t12 t85 t10 t31 t66 t35 t86 t84 t32 t36 t4 t54 t85 t54 t33 t54 t57 t85 t84`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar uses non-terminals (abbreviated as NT followed by numbers), the string must be derived through a series of productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to parse the string step by step, replacing non-terminals with their possible terminal productions. Alternatively, I can look for possible productions that match parts of the string.\n\nFirst, let me list the terminal symbols present in the string and see if they match any productions.

So NT22 is mapped to t57.\n\nSimilarly, NT18 -> 't96'\n\nNT48 -> 't96'\n\nNT66 -> 't51'\n\nNT53 -> 't85'\n\nNT23 -> 't62'\n\nAnd others like:\n\nNT7 -> 't48' (from NT8 -> 't19', etc.)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's make a list of all NT mappings to token:\n\nFrom the provided rules:\n\nNT97 -> 't31' \u2192 Yes.\n\nNT57: Hmm, from where? Let me check the rules. Oh, in the rules, there's NT1 -> 't57', but I don't see NT57 being mapped anywhere else. So NT57 refers to NT1, which refers to 't57'? That seems cyclical. But in the string, it's 't57' appearing. So if we see 't57', it's from NT1.\n\nNT18 -> 't96'\n\nNT48: same as NT18.\n\nNT66: 't51'\n\nNT53: 't85'\n\nNT23: 't62'\n\nAnd other mappings:\n\nWait, what about NT28? NT28 -> 't36'\n\nYes, and NT28 is an NT that appears in some productions, like NT99 -> NT28 NT16, which would give 't36 t90'.\n\nSo now, the string can be broken down into tokens, each corresponding to an NT or terminal. Now, to see how the string can be built from S.\n\nThe first token is t36, which comes from NT28. So how do we get NT28? Looking at the grammar, NT28 is on the right-hand side of NT99 -> NT28 NT16.\n\nSo to get t36, we have to first get NT28, which is part of NT99. So the initial step is to expand S to NT99 NT23, but wait, looking back, the first production is S -> NT7 NT23. But how does S generate starting with NT28, which gives 't36'? That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, S can be expanded into two options: NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Let me see the first option: NT7 -> 't48' (from NT8 -> 't19'), but t36 is the first token, which is 't36', from NT28. So if we follow S -> NT7 NT23, that would generate 't48' followed by 't19' something, but the string starts with 't36 t33', which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the first alternative of S is the correct one, or perhaps not. Wait, no, S can be expanded either way, but if the first token is t36, which is from NT28, then to produce t36, we have to go through that route.\n\nBut looking at S -> NT7 NT23: NT7 leads to 't48', which is not 't36', so that's not matching. So maybe the first production is S -> NT97 NT54. Let's see: NT97 is 't31'. So if the first token is 't36', that can't come from S -> NT97 NT54 because that would give t31 first.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. So perhaps the initial expansion is wrong, or maybe the string isn't generated by this grammar. But that's just the first token, which is a problem because we can't get 't36' from S's initial productions as given.\n\nWait, let me check the starting productions of S. The grammar shows:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo S can be expanded into either of those. If we expand S into NT7 NT23, then NT7 and NT23 will be the next steps. But 't36' is the first token, so that doesn't fit. Similarly, if we expand S into NT97 NT54, the first token would be 't31' (from NT97) followed by 't12' (from NT54), which also doesn't match 't36' being first. \n\nWait, that's a contradiction.

{"custom_id":"request-719","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a way to structure grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar provided. It consists of a series of production rules starting from the start symbol S. The initial productions are S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, the string we're testing must start with either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54, followed by more symbols derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t31 t37 t10 t41 t96 t62 t17 t71 t66 t51 t31 t23 t32 t68 t35 t93 t87 t86 t99 t85 t62 t31 t36 t13 t23 t68 t57 t23 t90 t96 t87 t90 t12 t53 t86 t31 t31 t33`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't31', and looking at the grammar, I see that NT97 \u2192 't31'. So, the first part of the string could be the result of applying the production S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's tentatively assume that the string starts with NT97, which produces 't31', and then we have NT54 remaining.\n\nChecking the grammar, NT54 has a production NT54 \u2192 't12'. Wait, but the second token in the string is 't37', not 't12'. So, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe NT54 can produce more than one thing. Looking back, I see that NT54 is a terminal, as per the last rule: NT54 \u2192 't12'. So, that suggests that NT54 directly produces 't12'. But the string after S starts with 't31 t37', which would require the next NT after 't31' to be NT54, but NT54 is 't12', not 't37'. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's parse it step by step. If the first production is S \u2192 NT97 NT54, then NT97 produces 't31', and NT54 should produce the next part. But according to the grammar, NT54 \u2192 't12', so it produces 't12' directly. So the next token should be 't12', but in the string it's 't37'. That doesn't match. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S is producing another form. S has another production: S \u2192 NT99 NT23. Wait, but NT99 isn't directly connected to NT54. Hmm, no, that's a separate branch. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. The initial productions are S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, each S production starts with NT7 or NT97 followed by NT23 or NT54, respectively. So the first part of the string could be either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54.\n\nIf the string starts with 't31', which is produced by NT97, then the first part is NT97, which gives 't31', and then the next part should be NT54. But according to the grammar, NT54 is only 't12'. So the second token after 't31' should be 't12', but here it's 't37', which doesn't match. So perhaps the start symbol is producing a different path, but the initial S only has two productions, each starting with either NT7 or NT97.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with some other production. Let me see the structure of the grammar. It's a tree starting from S, which branches into two options. So the first part must be S \u2192 NT97 NT54 because that's the only production starting with NT97, and the other starts with NT7, which would produce 't' something else. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT7 being a terminal. Let me check the NT7 production.\n\nLooking back, I see NT79 might not be correct. Wait, let's list all the NTs. I see:\n\nFor example, NT7 is in the grammar: NT7 \u2192 't48'. So NT7 is a terminal, producing 't48'. Similarly, NT97 \u2192 't31'. So in the initial S production, S \u2192 NT7 NT23 would produce 't48' followed by NT23.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't31', which isn't produced by NT7 (which is 't48'). So that suggests that the string might not be starting with S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Alternatively, perhaps S is being used in some other way, but according to the given grammar, S only has those two initial productions.\n\nWait, that's confusing because if S starts as either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54, then the string must start with either 't48' (from NT7) and then NT23, or with 't31' (from NT97) followed by NT54. But the first token in the string is 't31', which comes from NT97, so the first part is NT97 \u2192 't31', and then the next part is NT54.\n\nWait, the second token is 't37', but NT54 is directly 't12'. So that's a problem. So perhaps this string is not generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-739","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar and string are quite long, so I need to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. So, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that most of the productions are of the form NTxy -> NTuv NTef or NTxy -> 'tyz'. So, each non-terminal either expands into two non-terminals or into a terminal symbol followed by another terminal symbol (but in some cases, it's just a single terminal, like NT54 -> 't12').\n\nThe string to check is: `t48 t87 t33 t12 t53 t62 t57 t51 t86 t48 t68 t17 t68 t71 t48 t57 t37 t4 t12 t48 t48 t12 t57 t12 t36 t32 t32 t71 t99 t32 t87 t36 t35 t53 t35 t33 t17 t12 t4`.\n\nI notice that to generate a string, the grammar must produce a sequence of terminal symbols, so every symbol in the string must eventually be part of a production path that ends in terminals.\n\nSince the start symbol is S, I'll start at S and try to see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, we have two initial options for the start symbol.\n\nLet's consider both possibilities:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23: So the first two symbols should be whatever NT7 and NT23 produce.\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54: The first two symbols would be what NT97 and NT54 produce.\n\nLet me check the string: the first word is t48. So I need either NT7 or NT97 to produce t48 when combined with NT23 or NT54 respectively.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nFor NT7, I see NT7 \u2192 t48. So if NT7 expands to t48, that's correct.\n\nFor NT23, let's see. NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. Both of these are non-terminals. NT45 is a non-terminal, so it needs to be expanded. NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95. Again, non-terminals. NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18, and NT95 \u2192 t41. So, NT99 expands to NT28 NT18, which then each need to be expanded further. NT28 \u2192 NT36, and NT18 \u2192 ... Wait, looking back, NT18 \u2192 t68. So, if NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18, then that would produce t51 and t68, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to look for each terminal in the string and check if it can be directly produced by any non-terminal, and then backtrack from there.\n\nAnother approach is to note that every production either stops the tree (with a terminal) or combines two non-terminals. Since this is a binary tree (each non-terminal replaces with two symbols), the length of the string should be 2^n - 1 for some n. Let's count the number of symbols in the string. Counting each 't':\n\nt48, t87, t33, t12, t53, t62, t57, t51, t86, t48, t68, t17, t68, t71, t48, t57, t37, t4, t12, t48, t48, t12, t57, t12, t36, t32, t32, t71, t99, t32, t87, t36, t35, t53, t35, t33, t17, t12, t4.\n\nThat's 37 symbols. 37 is not one more than a power of two: 32 (2^5) would give 31, 64 (2^6) would give 33, so no. Wait, actually, 2^6 - 1 is 63, which is more than 37. Hmm, that might be a problem because in a binary tree, the number of symbols is always 2^n -1. So unless the grammar can produce strings with less than 37 symbols, but 37 is not of that form. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, checking again: The string is 37 symbols. Let me count again step by step:\n\n1. t48\n2. t87\n3. t33\n4. t12\n5. t53\n6. t62\n7. t57\n8. t51\n9. t86\n10. t48\n11. t68\n12. t17\n13. t68\n14. t71\n15. t48\n16. t57\n17. t37\n18. t4\n19. t12\n20. t48\n21. t48\n22. t12\n23. t57\n24. t12\n25. t36\n26. t32\n27. t32\n28. t71\n29. t99\n30. t32\n31. t87\n32. t36\n33. t35\n34. t53\n35. t35\n36. t33\n37. t17\n38. t12\n39. t4\n\nWait, actually, 39 symbols now. So that's 39. Hmm, which also isn't of the form 2^n -1. So that's a problem because in a binary tree (Chomsky normal form), the number of terminals should be 2^n -1. But 39 is not one less than a power of two. Therefore, the string cannot be produced by this grammar because the length isn't compatible.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the user's string: it's written as a series of ts separated by spaces, each 't' starts with t48 t87 t33 t12... Let me count the number of elements:\n\n1. t48\n2. t87\n3. t33\n4. t12\n5. t53\n6. t62\n7. t57\n8. t51\n9. t86\n10. t48\n11. t68\n12. t17\n13. t68\n14. t71\n15. t48\n16. t57\n17. t37\n18. t4\n19. t12\n20. t48\n21. t48\n22. t12\n23. t57\n24. t12\n25. t36\n26. t32\n27. t32\n28. t71\n29. t99\n30. t32\n31. t87\n32. t36\n33. t35\n34. t53\n35. t35\n36. t33\n37. t17\n38. t12\n39. t4\n\nSo 39 terminals. Which suggests that the derivation would have to involve a tree that, when fully expanded, results in 39 terminals, which as I said before, doesn't fit the 2^n -1 pattern. 39 is not 2^n -1 for any integer n. Let's confirm:\n\nCalculate 2^6 =64, 64-1=63. 2^5=32, 32-1=31. 31 <39<63. So 39 is not possible.

{"custom_id":"request-745","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got to figure out if the string `t62 t51 t96 t12 t19 t84 t41 t96 t53 t10 t37 t99 t68 t90 t19 t54 t71 t48 t93 t90 t35 t54 t68 t23 t53 t10 t84 t90 t32 t25 t12 t10 t57 t17 t32 t87 t41 t4 t66` is generated by the given grammar. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar and see if there's a pattern or if I can recognize any known structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because each production directly leads to two smaller Non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that the starting symbol is S, which can produce two different NT sequences: NT99 NT62 and NT97 NT54. So S -> NT99 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. Wait, wait. The user wrote S->NT7 NT23 and S->NT97 NT54. Let me check: the original question had S->NT7 NT23, but in the grammar provided, I see S->NT99 NT23 and S->NT97 NT54. Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but for now, I'll proceed assuming the grammar is as given.\n\nThe next step is to parse the string to see if it can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use algorithms like CYK or a recursive descent parser. But doing CYK manually might be time-consuming, so perhaps a top-down approach could work.\n\nAlternatively, I can see if each token in the string can be derived from the starting symbol S by expanding the non-terminals. Each production in the grammar either leads to terminals or non-terminals that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nLet's look at the string token by token:\n\nThe first token is t62. Checking the grammar, NT23 has production NT23 -> 't62'. So starting with NT23 could lead to 't62'. But since the grammar's S can produce NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54, we might need to see if the string can be built by expanding these non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t62. So that would come from NT23. So perhaps the beginning of the string is produced by expanding NT23. Let's see: S can produce NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So each expansion of S involves two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the first token, t62 is from NT23. So to get t62, the first step is NT23. So how does S produce NT23? Well, S can produce either NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54. If the first token comes from NT23, then the second part must come from another NT that produces something else.\n\nWait, the first token is t62, which is from NT23. So in the expansion of S, we have [something] NT23 [something else]. But the first token is t62, so the first non-terminal must produce t62. Let's see which NT can produce t62.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 appears in two places: NT23 is a non-terminal, and it's also a terminal as 't23'. Wait, no, looking back: the grammar has NT23 productions. Let me recheck:\n\nThe grammar has several NT23 productions. For example, earlier in the user's grammar, NT23 -> NT45 NT53, and later, NT23 -> 't62'. So actually, NT23 can produce either NT45 NT53 or t62. So NT23 can be further divided into non-terminals or terminal.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t62, which is exactly the production NT23 -> 't62'. So for the first token, it must come from NT23, which is part of the S expansion.\n\nBut wait, S can either produce NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So to get the first t62, which is NT23 -> 't62', S must have expanded to NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54. But if the first token is t62, which comes from NT23, then the entire string must be built starting with that NT23. \n\nBut looking at the string, the first part is t62 followed by t51, t96, etc. So perhaps the string starts with t62, which is from NT23. Then the next token is t51. Let me see where 't51' comes from. Looking through the grammar, there's an NT66 -> 't51'. So 't51' is from NT66.\n\nSo now, the second token in the string is 't51', which is from NT66. So to have that, the second NT in S's expansion must be NT66, but looking back, S can only produce NT99 or NT97 or another NT that leads to those. Wait, no, S is the start symbol and can only expand into two NT combinations: either NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, S->NT99 NT23 and S->NT97 NT54. Those are the two options for S's expansion. So each S produces two parts: the first and second non-terminals.\n\nSo the first part of the string starts with t62, which is from NT23. So maybe the first part of S's expansion is NT23, which generates t62, but then the second part would have to be something else. Wait, no, because S is NT99 NT23, so if S expands to NT99 NT23, then the entire string must be generated by NT99 and NT23 in sequence.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal. So for S-> NT99 NT23, it means that S can be expanded by generating NT99 followed by NT23. So each step of the parse would involve substituting each NT with their productions, starting with S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to construct a parse tree from the string upwards.\n\nBut given that it's a long string, maybe a recursive approach is better. Let me see if the string can be broken down into the productions.\n\nThe string starts with t62, which comes from NT23. So the next part after NT23 must be another NT that starts with something else. But looking back, S can either produce NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So if the first non-terminal is NT23, which gives t62, then the second non-terminal must be producing the remaining string.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: When expanding S, it first expands into two non-terminals, and each of those can expand further until all terminals are reached. So the entire string is a sequence of terminals resulting from expanding the two non-terminals in S's production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to check whether the string can be divided into subsequences that match the productions of the grammar.\n\nEach production is of the form NT -> a or NT -> NT NT. So in the string, every step would involve replacing a non-terminal with its productions, leading to more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, let's try to decompose the string step by step.\n\nFirst token: t62. Looking up, t62 comes from NT23. So the first non-terminal must be NT23, which expands to t62.\n\nSo S must produce NT23 as its first non-terminal, leading to t62. The remaining string is t51 t96 t12 t19 t84 t41 t96 t53 t10 t37 t99 t68 t90 t19 t54 t71 t48 t93 t90 t35 t54 t68 t23 t53 t10 t84 t90 t32 t25 t12 t10 t57 t17 t32 t87 t41 t4 t66.\n\nBut wait, S can expand to either NT99 NT23 or NT97 NT54. The first part of the string is t62, which is from NT23. So in S's expansion, if the first non-terminal is NT23, then the second non-terminal must be whatever comes next. The second token is t51, which is from NT66. But where does NT66 come from in the grammar?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT28 is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-767","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar provided is a bit complex with a bunch of non-terminals on the left and various combinations on the right. The string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols starting with 't's and some numbers, ending with 't93'.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this structure because each rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal symbol followed by a number, which probably represents a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is: `t33 t36 t19 t36 t36 t19 t19 t35 t19 t54 t87 t68 t31 t25 t54 t12 t13 t37 t53 t48 t17 t86 t23 t85 t68 t23 t33 t4 t31 t66 t10 t32 t25 t53 t84 t86 t23 t86 t68 t93`.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar has S producing either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't33'. I need to find if there's a production of NT33, but scanning through the grammar rules, I don't see an NT33. Hmm, that's odd. Wait, maybe the NTs are numbered, and I need to check all possible starting points.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first see which rules produce terminals. Looking through all the grammar rules, I notice that some NTs produce 't's followed by numbers, like NT99 \u2192 't48' or similar. These are terminals, meaning they cannot be broken down further.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, every production either has two non-terminals or is a terminal. For example, NT99 \u2192 't86', which is a terminal. So, in the string, every time I see a 't', it must come from a terminal production.\n\nLet me check the start symbol S. It can be either NT7 NT23. If S produces NT7, then NT7 must be a non-terminal. From the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 't48'. So, if I have NT7, it produces 't48', a terminal. Similarly, NT23 has multiple productions, some of which produce terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't33'. Let me look for a production of NT33. Scanning the rules, I don't see NT33 directly. Maybe it's derived through other rules. Wait, perhaps NT33 is part of a production on the right-hand side of another NT. For example, an NT rule might produce NT33 followed by something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the NTs are actually terminals, but that seems unlikely since the grammar structure is for CNF which typically involves non-terminals. So, I think NTs are non-terminals that can be further broken down.\n\nWait, let me check the first few symbols. The string starts with t33, t36, t19, etc. Let me see if these t's are connected through the grammar.\n\nFor example, t33: Looking through the terminals in the grammar, one of the rules is NT41 \u2192 't68', another is NT33 \u2192 't54'? No, wait, looking at the provided rules:\n\nWait, the given rules have:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't96'\nNT41 \u2192 't68'\nNT28 \u2192 't36', etc.\n\nWait, let me look for 't33' in the rules. Hmm, I don't see 't33' listed as the result of any NT. Maybe it's a typo or I misread. Wait, looking through the rules again:\n\n- NT33 isn't a terminal; perhaps it's a non-terminal.\nWait, but in the given rules, all the terminals are like 't93', 't31', etc. But I don't see 't33' as a terminal. So maybe 't33' is part of a non-terminal's rule.\n\nWait, let me look through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16. NT66 \u2192 't51', NT16 \u2192 't90'. So, if I have NT99, it produces two non-terminals, which then produce more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I can trace backward from the start symbol S to see if the entire string can be derived.\n\nS can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Let's take NT7 first. NT7 \u2192 't48' is in the rules. But the string starts with 't33', not 't48'. So that would mean that the first symbol is 't33', which can't come from NT7 because NT7 produces 't48'. So maybe the first symbol comes from the other alternative of S, which is NT97 NT54.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Now, NT97 \u2192 't31' according to the rules. So NT97 is a terminal, producing 't31'. Then, NT54 \u2192 't12' (from the rules, 't12' is a terminal for NT54). So, combining these, S \u2192 't31' 't12'. But the string starts with 't33', which is not 't31' or 't12', so that doesn't match. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the NTs may have multiple productions leading to terminals, and I have to see if there's a way to combine them.\n\nWait, another angle: let me see if the entire string can be matched via the grammar rules, step by step.\n\nThe string is 48 symbols long, starting with 't33'. Let's see if any production of NT (from S) first symbol is 't33'.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT production:\n\nI don't see NT33 directly, but maybe it's produced as part of a larger production. For example, an NT rule might be something like NT33 \u2192 NTa NTb, and then those produce other NTs that eventually produce terminals.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward approach.\n\nWait, the first symbol is 't33'. Let me check if 't33' is a terminal in any of the rules. From the given rules, looking:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT84 \u2192 various entries, but none to 't33'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- Others: 't54' is also a terminal\n\nSo none of the rules directly produce 't33', which suggests that the first symbol 't33' can't come from any single NT production. That would imply that the string can't be derived from the grammar. But that can't be right because maybe it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps 't33' is part of a production on the right-hand side of a rule. For example, maybe a production rule like NTa \u2192 NT18 NT33, where NT18 \u2192 't96' and NT33 \u2192 something, but then the string starts with 't33', so unless NT33 is a terminal, it can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT18 \u2192 't96' and something else. But in that case, the first symbol in the string would be 't96', not 't33'. Let me check in the string, after 't33' comes 't36'. So maybe NT18 could be part of a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can find a way to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t33 t36 t19 t36 t36 t19 t19 t35 t19 t54 t87 t68 t31 t25 t54 t12 t13 t37 t53 t48 t17 t86 t23 t85 t68 t23 t33 t4 t31 t66 t10 t32 t25 t53 t84 t86 t23 t86 t68 t93\n\nThis is 48 symbols starting with t33 and ending with t93.\n\nWait, if the string is built starting with NT production, maybe the first NT is NT7, producing 't48', but the string starts with t33, so that doesn't fit.

{"custom_id":"request-759","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. My goal is to parse the string `t96 t10 t57 t84 t13 t13 t86 t33 t41 t41 t93 t62 t84 t19 t31 t17 t48 t33 t41 t4 t93 t23 t32 t66 t71 t57 t54 t54 t4 t12 t36 t12 t12 t12 t90 t32 t93 t90 t99 t4` and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI notice that all tokens in the string are terminals (they start with 't' or are numbers). The grammar's terminals include tokens like 't93', 't31', 't71', etc. Some non-terminals expand into these terminals, so I can use them to check the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has two options:\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nI'll analyze each option separately to see if either can generate the string.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nNT7: From the grammar, NT7 isn't directly defined. Wait, looking back, maybe I misread. The production rules are given, so I need to check if NT7 is a non-terminal. Scanning through, I don't see any production for NT7, which makes me think I might have misread the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23. If NT7 isn't defined anywhere, that would mean this production isn't valid because NT7 isn't a non-terminal. But that can't be right because the grammar should be valid. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLooking again, the grammar's right-hand sides are all either non-terminals or terminals. So, for S \u2192 NT7 NT23, if NT7 is not a non-terminal, perhaps it's a terminal. But NT7 is a string of three characters. Wait, no, the grammar's rules are written as NT followed by numbers or other NTs. Let me see. For example, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54, etc.\n\nWait, the string has tokens like 't96', 't10', etc. So, perhaps NT7 is actually 't7', but the way it's written, maybe NT7 is a different non-terminal. But in the given grammar, I don't see any rule that defines NT7 on the left-hand side, only on the right-hand side in the string. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing NT7 with NT7 as a production.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, the string has 't96', 't10', etc., so in the grammar, the non-terminals on the right side can be either other non-terminals or terminals. The string is built from these right-hand sides.\n\nBut looking at S's productions, S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. If NT7 and NT23 are non-terminals, but in the given grammar, they aren't defined. Wait, that can't be right because in the right-hand side rules, NTs are used, but they must be defined. For example, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, which is defined.\n\nSo maybe the left-hand side NT7 and NT23 are not defined in the grammar, meaning the production S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is invalid? Or perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23, where NT7 and NT23 are other non-terminals. Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided:\n\nI see rules like NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54, etc. So the non-terminals on the left are like NT99, NT97, NT59, etc. But there's no rule for NT7 or NT23. Wait, looking again, the left side of the grammar rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\n\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54\n\nNT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1\n\nNT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT56 NT53\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18\n\nNT90 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT55 NT1\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT40 NT96\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT22 NT8\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT40 NT90\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT88 NT53\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT59 NT46\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT7 NT40\n\nNT54 \u2192 't93'\n\nNT97 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't32'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't41'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't19'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT94 \u2192 't87'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't62'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't86'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT97 -> 't54'\n\nNT1 -> 't57'\n\nNT18 -> 't96'\n\nNT16 -> 't90'\n\nNT28 -> 't66'\n\nNT40 -> 't17'\n\nNT84 -> 't4'\n\nNT84 -> 't84'\n\nNT56 -> 't99'\n\nNT66 -> 't51'\n\nWait, so NT7 and NT23 are not defined in the grammar except possibly on the right-hand sides? No, on the right-hand sides of the production rules, we have NT7, but that's part of the production. For example, S \u2192 NT7 NT23, but NT7 and NT23 are non-terminals that aren't defined anywhere else.\n\nThat can't be because the grammar must be Chomsky Normal Form, which requires that all non-terminals appear on the left-hand sides of the productions. Therefore, maybe the initial S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is part of the production, but that would mean NT7 and NT23 are non-terminals that must be defined. But looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, where NT7 is a non-terminal that eventually expands into 't7' or something similar, but looking through the rules, I don't see any production for NT7 or NT23 except on the right-hand side. Wait, looking at the rules, is there any rule where NT7 is the left-hand side?\n\nNo, I don't see any production with NT7 on the left except in the right-hand sides, which would be part of a deeper production. For example, perhaps one of the rules like NT7 \u2192 something. But in the given grammar, all non-terminals are on the left-hand sides. For example, NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54, which makes sense. But there's no rule for NT7 or NT23.\n\nWait, let's look for 't7' in the grammar or any other right-hand side. I see NT40 \u2192 't71', so the string has 't71', but no 't7'. So maybe NT7 is not defined, meaning that production S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is invalid because NT7 can't be on the left if it's not defined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is a typo and it's supposed to be another non-terminal that is defined, but I don't see it. So perhaps the only valid option is S \u2192 NT97 NT54, which I can investigate.\n\nSo let's look at S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nFrom the grammar rules:\nNT97 \u2192 't31'\nNT54 \u2192 't93'\n\nSo S would expand into 't31' 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-788","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it.\n\nFirst, the grammar has a set of production rules. Each rule starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left and expands into other symbols on the right, and since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. That's helpful because it means each step of the derivation only replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, and the length of the string will be a power of two. But wait, the string I received has a length of... let me count.\n\nThe string is: t57 t33 t86 t54 t87 t85 t17 t99 t90 t33 t23 t90 t37 t41 t62 t41 t90 t66 t86 t86 t32 t32 t36 t35 t48 t86 t4 t54 t25 t86 t48 t87 t41 t71 t32 t12 t87 t68 t85 t51 t57. That's 47 tokens. 47 is not a power of two. Wait, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, so 47 isn't a power of two. Does that immediately disqualify it? I'm not sure because sometimes the string can have a mixture, but I think in Chomsky Normal Form, the length has to be 2^n, but maybe the initial step isn't the case because it can have multiple symbols. Wait no, in a typical derivation starting from S, each step doubles the length. So to get from S (which is one symbol) to a string of terminals, the length must be 2^k for some k. But our string is 47, which is not a power of two, so perhaps it's already invalid. Is that the case?\n\nWait, no. The grammar could have multiple productions, so maybe the string isn't the direct derivation from S but could have S involved in the middle. Let me think again. Each production rule either is a terminal or two non-terminals. So the initial expansion would create a string that's a concatenation of non-terminals and terminals. Each step adds a generation where each non-terminal is replaced, increasing the length as necessary.\n\nWait, actually, no. Starting with S, applying the first production, say S -> NT99 NT54, that would result in two symbols: NT99 and NT54. Applying each of those non-terminals would result in two more each, so after two expansions, you get four, then eight, and so on. So the total length is always 2^n. Our string length is 47, which is not a power of two. Therefore, the string cannot be a result of applying production rules starting from S because the length isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, but the string might be a mix of symbols where some non-terminals are expanded further. For example, maybe some of the NTs are expanded into terminals, and others are kept as NTs, but in that case, the number of non-terminals plus terminals would affect the length. Hmm, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule for a non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step of expansion doubles the number of symbols. So starting from S (1 symbol), after one step, 2 symbols, then 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. So the string length must be 2^k. 47 is not a power of two, so the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I'm confusing leftmost derivation with other types. Alternatively, perhaps the string was built with multiple non-terminals and terminals in a way that the length isn't a power of two. Let me check the given string length again.\n\nThe string is written as 47 tokens. Let's count the commas to see how many tokens there are. Here's the string: `t57 t33 t86 t54 t87 t85 t17 t99 t90 t33 t23 t90 t37 t41 t62 t41 t90 t66 t86 t86 t32 t32 t36 t35 t48 t86 t4 t54 t25 t86 t48 t87 t41 t71 t32 t12 t87 t68 t85 t51 t57`. Let me count each token as each comma-separated part. I'll count one by one:\n\n1. t57\n2. t33\n3. t86\n4. t54\n5. t87\n6. t85\n7. t17\n8. t99\n9. t90\n10. t33\n11. t23\n12. t90\n13. t37\n14. t41\n15. t62\n16. t41\n17. t90\n18. t66\n19. t86\n20. t86\n21. t32\n22. t32\n23. t36\n24. t35\n25. t48\n26. t86\n27. t4\n28. t54\n29. t25\n30. t86\n31. t48\n32. t87\n33. t41\n34. t71\n35. t32\n36. t12\n37. t87\n38. t68\n39. t85\n40. t51\n41. t57\n\nYes, that's 41 tokens. I must have miscounted earlier. So the string length is 41. Is 41 a power of two? 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So 41 is not a power of two. That would imply that the string can't be generated by a grammar that only allows derivation lengths that are powers of two, starting from S.\n\nBut wait, maybe the grammar has multiple non-terminals and terminals, and the production rules could create more tokens. Let me think again. Each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So each step of applying a production rule to a single non-terminal would replace it with two symbols (either two non-terminals, two terminals, or one of each). So, for example, if I have NT99 which can produce 't51' and NT51, then that's two symbols. But if I have NT99 which produces NT51 and NT66, then both are non-terminals, and each would need to be expanded further.\n\nWait, but let's clarify the starting point. The initial string is S. So the first expansion of S would produce either NT99 and NT54. Then, each of those would be further expanded until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. So the length would be 2^n, right? But even if some non-terminals are partially expanded into terminals and others not, the length would be a sum that could vary, but each expansion step only adds one to the count, not sure.\n\nWait, no. Each production step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. So the length could vary as follows:\n\n- Starting with S: 1 symbol.\n- After first replacement: 2 symbols.\n- Each subsequent replacement increases the count by 1 or 2, depending on whether the symbols are non-terminals or terminals. But the total length isn't necessarily a power of two. For example, if after two replacements, some non-terminals are expanded, the length could be more flexible. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that the minimal string from S would lead to a length that's a power of two, but longer strings could have more symbols if some non-terminals are expanded into more symbols. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the total number of terminal symbols in the string must be a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the right side has a specific expansion. Maybe we can count the number of terminals introduced.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the total number of terminals in the string. The string is 41 tokens, all of which are terminals except for some NTs in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-787","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky normal form restricts each production rule to either two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the left with two non-terminals on the right. That should make parsing easier, I guess.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. The grammar starts with S, which can transform into pairs of NTs or terminals. The string I need to evaluate starts with 't85', so perhaps the root S can directly derive the first symbol if there's a production starting with 't85'.\n\nLooking at the production rules, S can go to NT99 followed by NT97, or other similar rules. Let me check if there's a direct production that starts with a terminal. Looking through, I see that some NT's have direct terminals attached. For example, NT54 has 't12', but that might not be helpful yet.\n\nWait, the string starts with t85 t37 t87... Maybe t85 is derived from NT99. Oh, looking at the productions, I see NT99 can produce NT66 NT16. So that would give 't66' and 't16' in the string. The first term is t85, so that's not directly from NT99.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S itself is producing something else. S's productions are all starting with NT followed by another NT. So to get a terminal string, the entire tree must resolve to terminals. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t85. So maybe there's a production that directly goes to t85, but in the grammar, looking at NTs, I don't see a direct production that starts with t85. The first NT that seems relevant is NT54, but it's only derived from something like NT99 or others.\n\nWait, no. Let's look at each NT that can produce a terminal. For example, NT54 has a production to 't12'. But that's a leaf. The string starts with t85, so perhaps that's a different NT.\n\nWait, NT85: No, looking through, I don't see an NT85.

In the initial grammar list, each entry is either S -> something, NT99 -> something, etc. So looking through each NT production, I see NT54 has two productions: one to 't12' and another to 't53'? That can't be right; I must have misread.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the grammar entries are each individual production. So for NT54, I see two entries:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, no, that's not how it works. Each production for NT54 would be a separate rule. So perhaps I miscounted. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, starting from NT99 and others, I think each production is uniquely identified by the left-hand side (NT) and the first symbol on the right. For NT54, I see:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because NT54 is only on the left once, but under Chomsky normal form, it shouldn't have an epsilon production unless it's a single terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT productions and their terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n1.

That's allowed, but each production must have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, each rule must be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So having two terminals on the right is not allowed unless each step only produces one terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps line 36 is another production for NT54, which would be invalid because we can't have two different terminal symbols on the right. So maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement, but I think the list is correct as given, so perhaps NT54 has two productions to 't12' and 't53', each as separate rules, but that would make the grammar invalid because NT54 can't produce both unless one of them is a non-terminal, which they aren't.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

{"custom_id":"request-805","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are variables and a is a terminal. This structure should help me parse the string using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the CYK approach right now. Let me first look at the grammar and the string. The string consists of a bunch of 't' followed by numbers, which are likely terminals. The grammar's right-hand sides include both variables and terminals, some of which are single terminals like NT54 \u2192 't93'.\n\nI think I should try to parse the string step by step, maybe using a top-down approach or a recursive descent parser. Alternatively, perhaps I can break down the string into the non-terminals and see if they can derive the string.\n\nLet me list the productions again for clarity. Each production either combines two non-terminals or ends with a terminal:\n\nS -> NT7 | NT23\nS is the start symbol. But looking at the productions, S can only produce two options, both starting with NT. So S itself is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with t37, t57, etc. Let's see what terminals are present in the grammar. The string has t37, t57, t90, t66, t71, t51, t13, t54, t48, t25, t32, t68, t53, t23, t4, t31, t96, etc. So I'll need to check if each of these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, but the grammar only has some terminals as single characters? For example, NT54 \u2192 't93', which is a terminal followed by two digits, but in the string, each 't' is followed by a number, like t37. Hmm, but in the grammar, some productions have terminals that are two digits, like 't93' for NT54. That's confusing because each symbol in the string is a single 't' followed by a number, but in the grammar, some productions have two-character terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the productions:\nNT54 \u2192 't93' \u2013 that's a two-character terminal: 't' followed by '93'. Similarly, NT97 \u2192 't31', which is 't' and '31'. Oh, so the string provided has each symbol as a single 't' and then a digit, but in the grammar, some terminals have two digits.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. The string given has tokens like 't37', but the grammar's terminals include 't93' as part of NT54. So, perhaps the grammar allows for longer terminals, but in the string, each token is a single 't' followed by a single digit. So the string might be incorrect, or perhaps the grammar is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the string, each token is a single letter 't' followed by a single digit, like t37, t57, etc. So each term is two characters. But in the grammar, some right-hand sides have 't' followed by two digits, like 't93' for NT54.\n\nBut the string given is a series of symbols like t37, t57, which are single 't's followed by two digits. But in the grammar, the only two-character terminals are like 't93' (for NT54). So in the string, t93 would appear as t93, but the string has t37, t57, etc. So how can that be?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the grammar and the string. Let's break it down. The string is a sequence of tokens, each starting with 't', then a digit. The grammar's terminals include 't31', 't32', etc., which are two-character symbols: 't' followed by a digit. But the string given has tokens like t37, t57, etc., which would imply that the grammar can have two-character symbols, but the string provided is a sequence of single-character symbols, which might not align.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that in the string, each token is a single 't' followed by a single digit, like t37 is one token. But in the grammar, some terminals are two-character symbols, like NT54 \u2192 't93' which would be T93 as a single terminal symbol. So in the string, we have t37, which is a single token, but in the grammar, that corresponds to NT93? Or perhaps I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The grammar's RHS can have terminals, which may consist of multiple symbols. For example, NT54 \u2192 't93', which is two characters: 't' and '9', '3'? No, wait, in the grammar, it's written as NT54 \u2192 't93', which is a single terminal symbol consisting of 't93', i.e., a three-character string? Or perhaps each 't' is a character followed by a number, which is two characters. I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the way the grammar is written, when it says NT54 \u2192 't93', that means the production for NT54 results in a terminal symbol that is two characters: 't' followed by '93'? Or is it a two-character terminal like 't9' followed by '3' as another symbol? No, that doesn't seem right. Usually, each terminal in CFGs is a single symbol, which could be a single character. But here, some productions have two-character terminals.\n\nWait, I think the grammar might have been written with multi-character terminals, meaning that each terminal is a sequence of characters. For example, 't93' would be a three-character terminal, but perhaps each character is treated as a separate terminal or part of a multi-symbol terminal.\n\nBut in the given string, each token is a single 't' followed by a single digit, so 't37' is a single token (two characters). But the grammar's terminals can produce longer strings. So, for the string, each symbol is a 't' followed by a digit, but in the grammar, certain symbols can be multi-character. I'm a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is to look for the string's symbols as tokens and see if each can derive from the grammar's non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps each token in the string corresponds to a single non-terminal production or a terminal production.\n\nBut the string is a linear sequence of symbols, each being 't' followed by a digit. So the string is of length 37 (count the number of tokens? Let's see: t37, t57, t90, t66, t71, t51, t13, t54, t48, t25, t32, t68, t53, t23, t4, t31, t96, t96, t19, t23, t41, t36, t23, t36, t84, t53, t51, t93, t99, t35, t71, t57, t93, t54, t96, t13, t23, t33, t31, t37, t19, t41. That's 37 symbols.\n\nWait, that's a lot. So each symbol is 't' followed by a digit. Let me list them without the 't's: 37, 57, 90, 66, 71, 51, 13, 54, 48, 25, 32, 68, 53, 23, 4, 31, 96, 96, 19, 23, 41, 36, 23, 36, 84, 53, 51, 93, 99, 35, 71, 57, 93, 54, 96, 13, 23, 33, 31, 37, 19, 41. So each of these must correspond to some symbol in the grammar's terminals.\n\nBut wait, according to the grammar, some terminals are two characters. For example, NT54 \u2192 't93', which is 't' followed by '9'. Wait, but 't93' is three characters, but in the grammar, that's written as two characters. Hmm, perhaps each terminal in the grammar is a single character?

{"custom_id":"request-802","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is provided, and the grammar consists of a series of production rules. The challenge is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nFirst, I'll start by trying to parse the grammar and understand the structure. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S appears to be the start symbol, and the initial production for S is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, meaning S must be expanded into two non-terminals: NT7 and NT23. Then, each of those NT rules can lead to other productions until we get to terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers, like t99, t96, etc.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of these terminals: t99 t96 t86 t4 t84 t48 t10 t23 t19 t71 t57 t57 t90 t13 t84 t31 t86 t54 t12 t66 t53 t17 t12 t86 t12 t85 t36 t84 t23 t36 t31 t51 t85 t17 t84 t4 t4 t25 t10 t62 t57 t96.\n\nI think a good approach would be to build a parsing tree or try to reduce the string using the grammar. But since manually expanding everything might be time-consuming, I can look for patterns or key steps where certain terminals can only be derived in specific ways.\n\nI notice that the grammar has multiple rules starting with NT84. For example, NT84 can produce NT58 NT86 or NT84 NT84. This seems a bit concerning because it might lead to an infinite loop unless there's a terminal production. However, in the string, I see multiple 't84's. So I need to check if these can be derived from NT84.\n\nLooking at the string, I see 't84' appears several times. Let's see if any of the NT84 rules produce a terminal. Checking the grammar, I don't immediately see a production for NT84 that results in a single terminal; instead, it seems to split into two non-terminals. Wait, looking again, there's NT23 \u2192 't62', which gives a terminal. But for NT84, the productions are NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86 and NT84 \u2192 NT84 NT84. There's no direct production for NT84 to a terminal, but maybe through other rules.\n\nWait, let me check the provided rules again. I see NT84 has two rules: one is NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86, and another is NT84 \u2192 NT84 NT84. Hmm, none of these are terminal. Maybe I made a mistake because the user provided the grammar, which includes NT22, NT23, etc. I might have missed a rule for NT84.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT84, I don't see any rule that produces a terminal. So perhaps NT84 is an intermediate that never ends. If that's the case, having 't84's in the string might not be possible unless there's a way to derive it from a terminal, but it seems there's no direct path. That could be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the NT rules again. Wait, NT58 is a rule that can lead to NT94 NT54, which includes NT54 \u2192 't12'. So NT54 can produce a terminal. Maybe in the string, there's a path where NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86, and then NT58 produces NT94 and NT54. NT54 is 't12', which is a terminal. So in the string, there is a 't12' towards the end. That's promising.\n\nLet me try to see where 't12' comes from. It's a terminal, so it must come from NT54. So where does NT54 appear in the string? Looking at the string: towards the end, there's 't54' as a terminal. So maybe that's derived from some NT54.\n\nBut I'm getting sidetracked. Let me focus on the string. The first term is t99. Looking at the grammar, NT99 has two rules: NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16 and NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18. So t99 can come from either NT66 \u2192 't51' and NT16 \u2192 't90', or from NT28 \u2192 't36' and NT18 \u2192 't96'. So in the string, the first two terms are t99 and t96. So the first part t99 t96 could be from either option.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT23? Wait, no, NT99 has two rules as stated: NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16 and NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18. So the first production is NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, which would produce 't51' and 't90' respectively. The second is NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18, which would produce 't36' and 't96'. So the first two terms in the string are t99 t96, which matches the second production: NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18, since 't36' (from NT28) and 't96' (from NT18) would be the outputs.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first two terms are t99 followed by t96. So in the derivation, S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then NT7 must be expanded. Looking at the grammar under NT7, I see NT7 \u2192 't48'. So the first 't99' must come from NT99, which is part of S. Wait, no: the initial production for S is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, so the first part is NT7, which is 't48', but that's not matching the string's first term 't99'. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify: the initial production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So when S is expanded, it's into NT7 and NT23. Therefore, the string would start with the expansion of NT7 and then NT23. But the string given starts with t99, which suggests that the initial NT7 must produce t99. But looking at the grammar, under NT7, the production is NT7 \u2192 't48'. So NT7 does not produce t99. That can't be right because the initial S production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which would have to produce 't48' as the first term, which is not the case here.\n\nSo this suggests that the string cannot possibly start with t99 because the initial expansion of S must produce t48 as the first symbol. Therefore, the string given does not match the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The string is: t99 t96 t86 t4 t84 t48 t10 t23 t19 t71 t57 t57 t90 t13 t84 t31 t86 t54 t12 t66 t53 t17 t12 t86 t12 t85 t36 t84 t23 t36 t31 t51 t85 t17 t84 t4 t4 t25 t10 t62 t57 t96.\n\nSo the first term is 't99'. But according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which cannot produce 't99' as the first term because NT7 only produces 't48'. Therefore, the string must start with 't48' according to S's initial production. So the given string starts with 't99' which cannot be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-823","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is a bit complex with a lot of productions, and the string is a series of tokens separated by spaces. My goal is to parse this string through the grammar and see if it can be derived, which would mean the grammar accepts the string.\n\nFirst, I should understand what CNF entails. In CNF, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit this structure because all the rules on the left side are single non-terminals, and on the right, they consist of either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t71 t71 t35 t90 t99 t90 t36 t84 t53 t57 t31 t62 t96 t87 t86 t86 t10 t85 t86 t87 t19 t41 t57 t85 t31 t99 t90 t90 t90 t37 t85 t53 t96 t36 t4 t87 t23 t19 t62 t10 t13 t68 t54`.\n\nSince each token in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, I can try to map each token to the corresponding production rule. Each rule in the grammar either leads to a terminal or another non-terminal. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to reverse-engineer the string by starting from the top-level non-terminal, which is S. The start symbol S has two productions: \n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo the string must start with either NT7 followed by NT23 or NT97 followed by NT54. Let's check the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t71. I need to see which rule leads to t71. Scanning through the grammar rules, I see that NT40 \u2192 t71. So the first part of the string should come from NT40.\n\nWait, but S has to produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. If t71 is the first token, that would mean NT7 is producing t71. Let me check if NT7 can produce t71.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT7, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT7 NT7: that seems recursive. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me look back. The grammar rules for NT7, I think, might not be directly given, but maybe I need to see other rules leading to t71. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong way\u2014maybe each non-terminal NTx leads to certain rules.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the grammar has rules like NT40 \u2192 t71, NT8 \u2192 t32, etc. So each NTx is a non-terminal that can lead to either another NT or a terminal.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S, which leads to NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. So in the string, the first token should be either the result of NT7 or NT97, and the second token either NT23 or NT54.\n\nBut the first token is t71. So let's see if t71 is the terminal from NT7 or NT40, etc. Looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT40 \u2192 t71. So if the first part S \u2192 NT40, then maybe the first part is t71, but S can't directly produce NT40; S only produces NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54. So perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT40 [something], but that's not how the grammar is structured. Wait, no\u2014the grammar only has S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So the first symbol in the string must be the result of NT7 or NT97.\n\nBut t71 is a result of NT40, not NT7 or NT97. Does NT7 have a production rule that leads to t71? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT7, the rule is NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT7, which seems recursive. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me cross-reference each NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several non-terminals leading to terminals:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t71\n- NT16 \u2192 t90\n- NT96 \u2192 t48\n- NT23 \u2192 t62\n- NT46 \u2192 t37\n- NT53 \u2192 t85\n- NT28 \u2192 t13\n- NT97 \u2192 t31 (twice)\n- NT55 \u2192 t99\n- NT41 \u2192 t68\n- NT1 \u2192 t57\n- NT54 \u2192 t12 and t86 and t23\n- NT50 \u2192 various\n- NT85 \u2192 t85\n- and others leading to various terminals like t7, t32, t36, etc.\n\nWait, so I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So to parse the string, I can work backwards, building a parse tree from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that, I can try to see if the string can be broken down step by step according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens, each a terminal. Let's list them as a list:\n\nt71, t71, t35, t90, t99, t90, t36, t84, t53, t57, t31, t62, t96, t87, t86, t86, t10, t85, t86, t87, t19, t41, t57, t85, t31, t99, t90, t90, t90, t37, t85, t53, t96, t36, t4, t87, t23, t19, t62, t10, t13, t68, t54\n\nThat's 40 tokens. Each token must correspond to a step in the grammar.\n\nSince the string starts with t71, let's see if it's a direct terminal. From the grammar, t71 is the production of NT40 \u2192 t71. So the first token t71 is derived from NT40. So the leftmost symbol must come from NT40. But wait, S only produces NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54. So unless NT40 is somehow derived from S, which it can't because S's productions are two non-terminals, this seems confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. If the first token is t71, then that's the result of NT40. But how does the string start with NT40? Because S can only produce two non-terminals, so if S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then the first part is NT7 and the second is NT23. So the first token would be from NT7, which would have to be a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT7: the rule is NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT7. So that's an infinite recursion, meaning NT7 can't produce any terminal directly\u2014it can only produce more NT7s until, through further reductions, it reaches a terminal. Wait, but looking at the grammar, perhaps NT7 has another rule? I don't see any rule where NT7 directly produces a terminal, only recursively. So if NT7 can't produce a terminal, how can the first token be t71, which is derived from NT40, not NT7?\n\nThis seems contradictory. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the first token being NT40 is not directly possible because S can't produce NT40 on its own. That would mean the string can't be generated by S because the first symbol has to come from S's productions, but none of S's immediate productions can reach a terminal directly\u2014it only produces pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check S's productions again: both S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Now, if I look for a way for S to produce a string that starts with t71, perhaps the NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54 can, through some derivations, lead to t71.\n\nWait, let me think. For S \u2192 NT7 NT23, if NT7 can derive t71 and NT23 can derive something else, but I don't see NT7 directly producing t71.

{"custom_id":"request-828","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, first I'll look at both the grammar and the string to see how they might match. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. That should help because we can use a parsing method that works for that form, maybe something like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I remember that correctly.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe I can try to parse the string by hand. Let's see. The string is a sequence of t followed by numbers, which are the terminal symbols in the grammar. So the string is all terminals, so I need to see if the grammar can derive this string in sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see some rules. For example, S starts with either NT99 KT23 or NT97 KT54. Each of those NTs branches into other NTs and eventually terminals. So the start symbol S produces two parts, each starting with an NT and followed by another NT. Let me check each part.\n\nThe first rule is S -> NT99 KT23. So after the initial S, it's NT99 followed by KT23. Similarly, the second rule is S -> NT97 KT54, starting with NT97 followed by KT54. So the string must be a combination of expansions from either of these two initial paths.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t10 t35 t23... Let's see. Maybe I can try to see if each part of the string starts with t10, which is in the grammar as NT8 -> t32, but wait, the NTs are like NT84, NT56, etc., each leading to different terminals. Let me list all the terminal rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT8 -> t32, NT56 -> t10 (wait, no: NT56 -> 't10'? Let me check. Yes:\n\nNT56 -> 't10'\n\nSo in the string, there's a t10 which must come from NT56. Also, there's a t35, which I don't see in the terminal rules. Wait, let me check the grammar for 't35'. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through the provided grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT8 -> 't32', NT40 -> 't71', NT8 -> 't19', NT41 -> 't68', and so on. Wait, I don't see t35 in any rule. So that's a problem. The string has t35, but in the grammar, I don't see where that comes from. Maybe I made a mistake? Let me check the rules again.\n\nHmm, looking through each line, I don't see a terminal rule that produces 't35'. So that's red flags. If the string contains t35, and the grammar doesn't have a corresponding production, then the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see if any of the non-terminals can produce t35 through a chain. For example, does any NT produce another NT that leads to t35? Let's see the rules.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, let's take each NT and see what they expand into.\n\nFor example, NT56 -> 't10', so no, can't get t35. NT40 -> 't71'. NT8 -> 't32'. NT58 -> NT94 NT54. So NT58 expands to something else, but t35 isn't in there. Let me think if any NT eventually leads to t35.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT58 -> NT94 NT54\n- NT94 -> NT96 NT98\n- NT96 -> NT48 NT23\n- NT98 -> NT48 NT95\n- NT48 -> t96\n- NT95 -> t41\n- So NT94 expands to t96 t98, but t35 isn't here.\n\nWait, maybe looking deeper, for example, NT48 -> t96, which then might lead to other terminals. Let me see if any of the NTs produce t96, which is then used in the string.\n\nLooking back, NT48 -> 't96' (from the rule: NT48 -> 't96'), so t96 is a terminal. But I don't see t35 anywhere in the grammar. So that's a dead end.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the string. Let me re-examine the string. Oh, the string has t35 at position 2. So the second element is t35, which is problematic. Let me check the grammar again for any NT that can produce t35. But I don't see any. So this should immediately invalidate the string.\n\nTherefore, since t35 isn't in the grammar, the string can't be generated.

{"custom_id":"request-847","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all the given productions are either combining two non-terminals or producing a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it's a bit long, but I can see that the terminals are 't' followed by numbers, like 't93', 't86', etc., and some are mapped directly to these terminals, like 'NT54 \u2192 't12'. So, each production either breaks down into two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t93 t86 t57 t35 t93 t12 t57 t32 t90 t48 t85 t99 t48 t96 t90 t99 t37 t17 t32 t53 t23 t35 t93 t41 t71 t12 t35 t57 t53 t68 t71 t87 t62 t86 t12 t12 t32 t96 t96 t93 t51 t90 t53 t35`.\n\nTo check if this string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if there's a derivation sequence starting from the start symbol S that results in exactly this string, with each step following the grammar's productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces a single terminal or two non-terminals. That means during the derivation, the string will be built up by replacing non-terminals step by step.\n\nI'm thinking about using the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing in CNF. The CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell (i,j) represents whether the substring from position i to j can be generated by the start symbol or any non-terminal A that can produce the substring.\n\nBut since I'm a bit confused about the exact steps, maybe I can approach it more manually by trying to trace the string through the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So, the beginning of any derivation would involve NT7 and NT23. Either of these could be replaced by other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't93'. Let's see if any NT can produce 't93'. I scan through the rules and find:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12' (so no)\n- NT50 \u2192 't85' (no)\n- NT8 \u2192 't32' (no)\n- NT23 \u2192 sometimes 't62', but not directly 't93'.\nWait, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16. NT66 \u2192 't51', and NT16 \u2192 't90'. So 't51' 't90' is 't51t90', which isn't 't93'.\n\nLooking for NT that directly produce 't93':\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't31' (no)\n- NT7 \u2192 't48' (no)\nWait, the NT production for 7 is in NT7 \u2192 NT84 NT86? Let me check. Looking back, yes, NT7 \u2192 NT84 NT86.\n\nSo NT7 \u2192 NT84 NT86. So the initial step, S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which becomes NT84 NT86 NT23.\n\nNow, I need to see if the string starts with 't93'. So, let's see what comes after S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if 't93' can be derived from some NT. Looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16, which then resolves to 't36' 't90' \u2192 't36t90'.\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'.\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'.\n- NT90 \u2192 't48' 't95' \u2192 But wait, 't48' is NT48 \u2192 't40' 't96' \u2192 Maybe not.\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently.\n\nThe string starts with 't93', so I need to find an NT that can produce 't93'. Checking the rules again:\n\nLooking through all NT rules, I spot:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT50 \u2192 't85'\n- NT7 \u2192 NT84 NT86 (so it can't produce a terminal directly)\nWait, NT97 \u2192 't31' which is a terminal, and NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, which might eventually produce terminals, but not 't93'.\n\nIs there any NT that directly produces 't93'? Let me check all the terminal rules:\n\nLooking through the given, I see NT54 \u2192 't12', NT50 \u2192 't85', NT8 \u2192 't32', NT56 \u2192 't10', NT95 \u2192 't41', NT28 \u2192 't36', NT48 \u2192 't96', NT94 \u2192 't87', NT46 \u2192 't37', NT23 \u2192 't62', NT48 \u2192 't86', NT13 \u2192 't33', NT97 \u2192 't54'... Hmm, I don't see any NT directly producing 't93'. So how does the string start with 't93'?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let's list all the rules and see if any NT has 't93' as a terminal.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT50 \u2192 't85'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT97 \u2192 't54'\n- NT1 \u2192 't57'\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n- NT40 \u2192 't17'\n- NT84 \u2192 't4', 't84' (Wait, looking back, NT84 is defined in two places: once as NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86, and again as NT84 \u2192 't4'? Wait no, looking at the rules, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the given rules.\n\nIn the provided grammar, there's a rule: NT84 \u2192 't4', and another NT84 \u2192 't84'?

So all derivations must ultimately start with NT7 and NT23.\n\nLet me list out the grammar productions:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\nNT90 -> NT84 NT8\nNT50 -> NT55 NT1\nNT8 -> NT40 NT96\nNT58 -> NT22 NT8\nNT98 -> NT40 NT90\nNT1 -> NT88 NT53\nNT50 -> NT59 NT46\nNT88 -> NT7 NT40\nNT54 -> 't93'\nNT97 -> 't31'\nNT40 -> 't71'\nNT8 -> 't32'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT95 -> 't41'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nNT8 -> 't19'\nNT41 -> 't68'\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT46 -> 't13'\nNT48 -> 't96'\nNT94 -> 't87'\nNT46 -> 't37'\nNT23 -> 't62'\nNT48 -> 't86'\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT97 -> 't54'\nNT1 -> 't57'\nNT18 -> 't96'\nNT16 -> 't90'\nNT28 -> 't66'\nNT40 -> 't17'\nNT84 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't84'\nNT53 -> 't85'\nNT40 -> 't35'\nNT22 -> 't57'\nNT7 -> 't48'\nNT28 -> 't13'\nNT84 -> 't57'\nNT86 -> 't25'\nNT50 -> 't85'\nNT16 -> 't23'\n\nThe terminals are the 't' followed by a number. So, the string is a sequence of these 'tXYZ' tokens, except for the ones that are part of the grammar, like NT97, NT54, etc.\n\nSo, the string is:\n\nt71 t71 t35 t66 t41 t86 t36 t57 t12 t53 t71 t4 t33 t85 t66 t71 t4 t17 t32 t71 t68 t93 t99 t41 t68 t13 t54 t12 t68 t71 t66 t10 t13 t85 t23 t54 t68 t19 t71 t84 t25 t99 t51 t87\n\nI think a good starting point is to parse the string from the beginning, trying to match the grammar's rules.\n\nSo, the first step in the grammar is S -> NT7 NT23. So, the string should start with NT7 followed by NT23.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t71. Wait, but NT7 is 't71'. So the first part is NT7, which is 't71'. Then, the next token should be NT23, which is 't62'. Hmm, but in the string, after t71 comes t71 again. That's not t62. So does that mean the string cannot start with S? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding NT7 and NT23.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the grammar to see what NT7 and NT23 correspond to. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT7 is defined as 't48', and NT23 as 't62'. Wait, but the string starts with t71, which is NT7 because it's t71. So that's a problem because the first production is S -> NT7 NT23. So, the first two tokens should be NT7 and NT23, which are 't71' and 't62'. But in the string, after t71 comes another t71. So does that mean it's not the start symbol S?\n\nBut wait, perhaps the string can be derived in multiple ways. Maybe after some reductions. Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Perhaps I should look for the entire string being a sequence of rules from the grammar.\n\nWait, the entire string is supposed to be derived from S, so starting with S, which first splits into NT7 and NT23, which are 't71' and 't62'. So the first two tokens should be t71 and t62. But in the provided string, after t71 comes another t71, which would not be t62. So that suggests that the string does not start correctly with S.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check. The production S -> NT7 NT23 would mean that S starts as two NTs: first NT7, then NT23. So, the first two tokens must be NT7 (t71) followed by NT23 (t62). But the string starts with two t71s. That seems like a problem. Or perhaps the entire string can't be generated by this grammar because it doesn't fit the initial step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is built in some other way, but given that S must start with NT7 and NT23, I don't see how the string can proceed from there. Unless there's a way for the NTs to further break down into other NTs, but I'm not seeing any possibility for multiple S starts or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be divided in a way that isn't starting at the beginning. Let me try to see if the string can be split into segments that fit the grammar rules, perhaps somewhere in the middle. But since S is the start symbol, I think the entire string must be generated from S, so the entire string must be derived starting with S.\n\nSo the first two tokens are t71 (NT7) and t71. But according to the grammar, the second should be t62 (NT23), not t71 again. Therefore, the string does not start with S, which is required. Therefore, I think the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me check again. The grammar starts with S -> NT7 NT23, which is 't71' followed by 't62'. So the string must begin with these two. The given string starts with two 't71's. So that's a discrepancy. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar, right?\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed something in the grammar. Let me check all the productions again to see if there's another way to reach the string. For example, are there any other ways to produce 't71'? Looking at the grammar, 't71' is only produced by NT40, which is the direct terminal. So NT40 is 't71'. Looking at the productions, NT40 is used in S, as well as others.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with something that eventually breaks down into NT40 later. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the entire string is a series of steps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-862","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the starting symbol, which can produce terminals. Wait, no, actually, even the starting symbol can produce a terminal, but in the context of CNF, all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. Hmm, but looking at the grammar provided, I see rules like S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which are two non-terminals, and then other rules like NT54 \u2192 't93', which is a terminal. So it seems each rule either has two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string I need to check is: t53 t32 t17 t90 t85 t93 t68 t48 t86 t71 t33 t33 t17 t4 t99 t90 t37 t62 t19 t32 t23 t17 t99 t51 t4 t12 t41 t53 t32 t41 t13 t85 t51 t84 t12 t19 t31 t66 t71 t90 t10 t57 t84 t33 t35.\n\nI think the approach here is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols (non-terminals or a terminal). So, to parse the string, I can try to build a derivation tree from the bottom up or top down, but I'm not sure which is easier here.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to simulate the parsing process using a top-down approach, like the CYK algorithm. But I'm more comfortable with a bottom-up approach or using a parse tree.\n\nBut let's think about how the string is constructed. Each rule either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string should consist of a sequence where each element is either a terminal or derived from a combination of two rules.\n\nWait, but actually, the string is a flat sequence of terminals. So, for example, the string could be built by starting with the start symbol S and then replacing it step by step until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me try to map this out. The start symbol S produces NT7 and NT23. So S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Now, looking at the string, the first two terminals are t53 and t32. I need to check if any of the non-terminals NT7 or NT23 can derive into these.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT7 \u2192 't48'? Wait, no. Looking through the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 't71' from the provided list. Wait, no, let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nLooking back, under NT40, I see NT40 \u2192 't71'. So NT40 can produce t71. Also, under NT23, there are multiple rules: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, and also other variations like NT23 \u2192 NT84 NT23, and NT23 \u2192 NT28 NT23, etc. But the first occurrence is NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, so that might be a starting point.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t53. So, let's see what NT53 can produce. Looking at the grammar, under NT53 \u2192 't85', and under NT53 \u2192 ... Looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't85' (rule: NT53 -> 't85')\n- Also, NT53 \u2192 NT66 NT16 (rule: NT53 -> NT66 NT16)\n- Additionally, under NT28, there's NT28 \u2192 't36' (looking up the list), so NT28 can produce t36.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after t53 comes t32, which is 't32'. Looking at the grammar, under NT8 \u2192 't32', and under NT56 \u2192 't10', etc. Let me look for 't32's in the productions. Yes, multiple rules produce 't32':\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10' (Wait, no, under NT41 we have NT41 \u2192 't68', and under NT13 \u2192 't33'. Hmm, perhaps I should find all productions that produce a terminal. So in the grammar, rules like NT54 \u2192 't93', NT97 \u2192 't31', NT16 \u2192 't90', NT23 \u2192 ..., wait no.

{"custom_id":"request-863","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me see. First, I should probably understand what this grammar looks like and maybe simplify it if possible. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems that the start symbol is S, and S has two productions: S \u2192 NT7NT23 and S \u2192 NT97NT54. So any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT7NT23 or NT97NT54. But wait, the string given starts with 't71 t33...', so I should check which of these starting non-terminals can produce that.\n\nLet me break down the given string token by token because the grammar's productions seem to generate strings of tokens separated by spaces. The string is:\n\nt71 t33 t32 t25 t53 t33 t66 t68 t57 t25 t12 t99 t62 t71 t51 t4 t23 t25 t25 t99 t86 t10 t41 t17 t35 t96 t41 t66 t93 t32 t13 t68 t10 t48 t51 t37 t51 t13 t90 t31 t37 t19 t86 t85 t54.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Let's see if we can work backward from the start. Since S can derive either NT7NT23 or NT97NT54, let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's look at the production S \u2192 NT7NT23. So the first two non-terminals would be NT7 followed by NT23. But wait, the string doesn't have NT7; it starts with t71, which is 't71' \u2013 that's a terminal. So NT7 is a non-terminal that produces t71. Let me check if NT7 can produce t71.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't71', which is exactly the first token. So that checks out. So the first part is NT7.\n\nNow the next non-terminal is NT23. NT23 can produce either t13 or t62. The second token in the string is t33, not t13 or t62. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, NT23 can produce t62 because in the production NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 and then looking at the rules, maybe it can derive t62? Wait, no. Let me look at the productions for NT23.\n\nActually, looking at the grammar, NT23 has two productions: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 and NT23 \u2192 t62. So NT23 can produce either NT45 NT53 or t62. Now, the second token is t33, which isn't t62. Hmm, so that's a problem. So maybe the initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the other production for S, which is S \u2192 NT97NT54. Let's see: String starts with t71. Does NT97 produce t71? Looking through the grammar, I see NT97 \u2192 't31', so that's a terminal. So NT97 can only produce t31, but the first token is t71. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So both NT7 and NT97 are non-terminals, right? So S \u2192 NT7NT23 would produce something that starts with NT7's output, which is t71. But the string starts with t71, so that's possible. So the first part is NT7 \u2192 t71. Then the next part is NT23. But NT23 can't directly produce t33, so perhaps that path is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I got the order wrong. So after t71, maybe the next tokens are part of NT23. Wait, but NT23 can't produce t33 directly. So that suggests that maybe I should consider that the string is generated by the other production S \u2192 NT97NT54. But since NT97 produces t31, which is not the first token here, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering that the non-terminals might be part of a larger derivation. Maybe each non-terminal can produce multiple terminals through a series of steps. So perhaps I need to work through the derivations step by step.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their productions to see if I can find a path. Starting with S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nLet me focus on S \u2192 NT7 NT23 first. NT7 \u2192 t71. Then NT23 \u2192 either t62 or NT45 NT53. The string after t71 is t33, which doesn't match t62, so perhaps NT23 must be producing NT45 NT53, which then can derive more terminals.\n\nSo after NT7, we have NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. Now, let's look at NT45 and NT53. What can they produce?\n\nLooking at NT45: NT45 can produce t40. So NT45 \u2192 t40.\n\nThen NT53. Looking at NT53, it can produce either t85 or NT28 NT23. The next token after t33 is t32, which is not t85, so maybe NT53 is producing NT28 NT23.\n\nNow, NT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23. So let's look at NT28: NT28 can produce t66 or NT40 NT96. The next token is t32, which isn't t66 or t86, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's retrace. The string after t71 is t33. Maybe I should consider that the second part of S's production is NT23, which produces t62, but that doesn't fit here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the string is part of a derivation that involves multiple non-terminals. Let's start constructing the parse tree.\n\nThe string starts with t71. From NT7 \u2192 t71, so that's the root. Then we have NT23, which is the next non-terminal. NT23 can either be t62 or NT45 NT53. The next token is t33, so it's not t62, so it must be producing NT45 NT53.\n\nSo now, after t71, we have NT45 NT53. NT45 \u2192 t40. The next token is t33. Wait, that's a problem because after t40, the next token should be t33, but t40 is a terminal, and the string has t33. So that doesn't align. Therefore, this path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's see: NT97 \u2192 t31, but the first token is t71, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps the initial assumption that S starts with NT7 is correct, but then the next non-terminal after t71 is NT23, which must produce something.\n\nWait, perhaps NT23 can produce t62 or NT45 NT53, and t33 is part of NT45 or NT53's derivation. So let me explore that again.\n\nAfter t71, which is NT7, the next non-terminal is NT23 \u2192 t62 or NT45 NT53.\n\nIf NT23 produces t62, then the second token would be t62, but the string's second token is t33, which doesn't match. So that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, NT23 must be producing NT45 NT53, which means after t71, the next two non-terminals are NT45 and NT53. So, NT45 \u2192 t40, and then NT53 \u2192 something.\n\nAfter t40, the next token is t33. So NT53 must produce something that leads to t33. Let's see: NT53 can produce t85 or NT28 NT23.\n\nIf NT53 \u2192 t85, then the token would be t85, but the next token is t33. So that doesn't fit.\n\nIf NT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23, then after t40, we have NT28 and NT23. Looking at NT28, it can produce t66 or NT40 NT96.\n\nThe next token after t40 is t33.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is a good starting point because it simplifies the parsing process. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It seems like it's a set of productions where each non-terminal (like S, NT99, NT58, etc.) produces other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals here are 't' followed by numbers, and a few are actual digits like t7, t93, etc. The non-terminals are the NT something parts.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols. Let me list them out to get a clearer picture: \n\n`t10 t31 t37 t31 t85 t99 t35 t13 t57 t36 t86 t68 t4 t33 t12 t37 t37 t32 t90 t84 t17 t41 t41 t12 t66 t71 t66 t51 t48 t53 t85 t35 t93 t62 t87 t96 t32 t36 t96 t32 t86 t51 t96 t87 t13 t17`\n\nSo, the word starts with t10, ends with t17. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it according to the grammar rules.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol, S. The grammar has two productions for S:\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT97 NT54\n\nEach of these is a start, so I'll need to see if either can derive the string. Let's break down each possibility.\n\nFirst production: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. NT7 and NT23 are non-terminals. So, after applying this production, we have two non-terminals that need to be further expanded.\n\nSimilarly, the second production is S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Again, two non-terminals that need expansion.\n\nI need to check if either of these can lead to the entire string. Let's first consider the first production, S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nLooking up NT7 and NT23 in the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't48' according to one of the rules. So that's a terminal. Then NT23 can be either 't62' or 't86' based on the rules.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at NT23, the productions are:\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\nBut then, looking further down, NT23 has another production? No, seems like NT23 has two productions, each producing other non-terminals. Hmm, but in the given grammar, under NT23, there are two rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the grammar provided.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the lines are:\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nSo, I think the grammar has NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50. So, wait, is that all? Or is there another rule later? No, from the provided grammar, NT23 only expands to NT13 NT50. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, wait, let me recheck.

So when S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is applied, we have NT7 which is 't48', and NT23 needs to be expanded.\n\nSo NT7 \u2192 't48' (terminal). Then, the second symbol is NT23.\n\nExpanding NT23: either NT45 NT53 or NT13 NT50.\n\nEach of these non-terminals needs to be expanded further.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex. Maybe I should approach this more systematically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree from the string and see if it can be formed by the grammar.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to write down the string and see how the non-terminals can expand into it.\n\nThe string starts with 't10', which I believe comes from NT56 in the grammar. Let me look:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT56 \u2192 't10' as a terminal. So that must be produced from NT56.\n\nIn the grammar, S's productions lead to NT56 via:\n\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54 \u2192 NT97 is 't31', NT54 is 't12' (I think). Wait, no. Let's check:\n\nLooking back, in the grammar:\n\nThe S productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\n\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo when expanding S, NT7 is 't48', and NT23 is either 't45' and 't53' etc. Alternatively, S could also go via NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t10. So to have t10, perhaps the entire string's first part is somehow derived from NT56.\n\nWait, let's check where t10 comes from. In the grammar, NT56 \u2192 't10'.\n\nSo to produce t10, we need NT56 in the string.\n\nLooking at the given string: it starts with t10, so perhaps the parse starts with the S production that includes NT56. But which S production is that? Looking at the S rules:\n\nS can go to NT7 NT23, but in that case, NT7 is 't48', so the first token would be t48, not t10.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake.

I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check against it. The goal is to determine if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the given string using the grammar. I'll write down the string as a sequence of terminals and see if it can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nString: `t71 t96 t17 t31 t57 t66 t62 t33 t4 t31 t32 t35 t31 t53 t90 t84 t13 t41 t96 t19 t10 t87 t62 t35 t4 t93 t10 t25 t33 t86 t37 t25 t10 t12 t85 t54 t53 t31 t23 t57 t48 t53 t66 t85 t17 t23`\n\nI notice that each of these parts is a terminal symbol, so the string is a sequence of these terminals. The grammar has several productions, primarily consisting of non-terminals on the left and terminals on the right. Each production is in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI'll start by looking for the start symbol, which is S. The grammar starts with S producing either NT77 or NT99 (I think the first one was S \u2192 NT77 NT23, but looking back, the user wrote S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. Wait, need to confirm the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Actually, the user writes each production with the NT name followed by symbols. So S is rewritten into NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54, each with two NTs. But looking further down, it seems like the NTs are broken down further into other NTs or into terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't93', so NT54 is a terminal. Similarly, NT97 \u2192 't31', which is another terminal. S can be rewritten into NT97 NT54, so that would correspond to 't31' 't93' as part of the string. However, our string starts with 't71', which would come from NT40, as NT40 \u2192 't71'. So S must be rewritten through NT40 and NT7 something.\n\nWait, this might get complicated, but let me try step by step.\n\nI think the best approach is to perform a top-down or bottom-up parsing of the string using the given grammar. Alternatively, perhaps it's feasible to check each token to see if it can be generated by a sequence of productions leading to a terminal.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, maybe I should look for possible intermediate steps or patterns.\n\nAlternatively, I can write out the possible sequences of non-terminals and terminals and see if the string can be formed by following these productions.\n\nLet me list the possible productions and their corresponding terminals or further productions. For example, NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23, and then NT48 \u2192 't96', NT23 \u2192 't62', so that sequence would be t96 t62. Similarly, other NTs lead to specific terminals.\n\nI think I might get stuck with too many branches, so perhaps a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm or look for the string in the grammar by breaking it down step by step.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with 't71'. Looking at the terminals, where does 't71' come from? NT40 \u2192 't71'. So the first symbol is derived from NT40.\n\nSo let's replace 't71' with NT40. Now, what does NT40 produce? Looking at the productions:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't71'\n\nWait, that's the terminal. So NT40 is directly 't71'. So in the first step, the first symbol is NT40, which is 't71'.\n\nNow, moving to the next token, 't96'. Let's see how 't96' is generated. Looking at NT96 \u2192 't96', so 't96' comes from NT96. Alternatively, is there any other way? Maybe NT48 \u2192 't96' because NT48 \u2192 't96'. So 't96' could be from NT48 as well.\n\nNow, let's think about the grammar structure. The string starts with NT40, then 't96'. Since S can produce NT40 and NT7 or something else? Wait, S can be NT97 NT54 or NT7 NT23. Wait, looking back:\n\nActually, the first two productions of S are S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Wait, is that correct? Yes, from the user's grammar, it's:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo from S, you have two options:\n\n1. NT7 NT23\n2. NT97 NT54\n\nNow, the start is S, so the first step is either breaking down into NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nWe've consumed 't71', which is NT40, so maybe that's from one of the early steps.\n\nBut perhaps I should approach it as a parsing problem, trying to see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nLooking at the entire string, let's split it into tokens:\n\nt71, t96, t17, t31, t57, t66, t62, t33, t4, t31, t32, t35, t31, t53, t90, t84, t13, t41, t96, t19, t10, t87, t62, t35, t4, t93, t10, t25, t33, t86, t37, t25, t10, t12, t85, t54, t53, t31, t23, t57, t48, t53, t66, t85, t17, t23.\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let's see if each token corresponds to a production.\n\nStarting with t71: NT40 \u2192 t71, so that's straightforward. Then t96: that could be NT96 \u2192 t96, or NT48 \u2192 t96.\n\nLooking ahead, after t71, t96, comes t17. So if after t71 we have t96, then t17.\n\nWhat produces t17? Looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT84 \u2192 t4, t84;\n\nLooking at NT17: Does any NT produce t17? Let me check. Looking at all the productions, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions for NT:\n\nI see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 t93\n\nNT97 \u2192 t31\n\nNT23 \u2192 t62\n\nNT66 \u2192 t51\n\nNT23 appears in other places, such as:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t66\n\nWait, looking for t17 in the terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it means each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, but I need to parse them correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol of the grammar, which is S. The production rules for S are:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT7 followed by NT23 or NT97 followed by NT54. Looking at the string, the first token is 't33', which doesn't immediately match NT7 or NT97, since NT7 is 't48' and NT97 is 't31'. Hmm, wait, maybe I need to check each non-terminal step by step.\n\nWait, the first token is 't33', which corresponds to NT13. Let me make sure I'm aligning the tokens correctly with the non-terminals. Let's list each token and see what NT each corresponds to.\n\nThe string is:\nt33, t31, t4, t87, t19, t57, t31, t71, t4, t35, t35, t48, t93, t54, t41, t19, t48, t93, t99, t12, t99, t57, t53, t4, t57, t62, t36, t41, t19, t23, t99, t96, t36, t36, t53, t99, t10, t87, t41, t85, t85, t36, t4, t68, t4, t53, t17.\n\nNow, looking at the NT productions, each NT can produce multiple terminals or non-terminals. I'll need to build a parse tree to see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nStarting with S -> NT13 NT56. Wait, no, S has two options: first is NT7 NT23, second is NT97 NT54. So the string needs to start with either NT7 followed by NT23 or NT97 followed by NT54.\n\nWait, 't33' is NT13, which isn't directly part of S's production. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the NT productions again.\n\nLooking at the NT productions:\n\nNT50 -> NT59 NT46\nNT40 -> 't71' or 't35' etc.\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nEach NT can either produce a terminal or two NTs.

The first token is 't33', which is NT13. Let's see where NT13 can come from. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\n\nSo, NT13 can be broken down into NT41 and NT18. Let's see the next tokens after 't33' are 't31' and 't4'. So, the next step is to check if NT41 followed by NT18 can produce 't31' and 't4' or something else.\n\nWait, but after 't33' comes 't31', which is NT97, and then 't4', which is NT8.\n\nSo, the string is: t33 (NT13) -> t31 (NT97) and t4 (NT8)\n\nLooking at NT13's production: NT41 NT18. So, the two tokens after 't33' should be the result of NT41 and NT18.\n\nWait, but the string after 't33' is 't31', then 't4', so it's 't31' and 't4' following 't33'. But NT13's production is two non-terminals: NT41 and NT18. So the next two tokens should be the results of NT41 and NT18. But the next two tokens are 't31' and 't4', which are NT97 and NT8.\n\nSo, does NT41 produce 't31'? Looking at NT41's production rules. From the grammar, NT41 is followed by -> 't68'? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see NT41 on the left side except in NT13 -> NT41 NT18. So, NT41 can only produce a terminal or two non-terminals.

Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the NT productions, I see:\n\nNT41 -> NT68 NT?\n\nWait, no, looking at the list, I don't see NT41 being on the left except in NT13's production.

Let me check each NT.\n\nLooking through, the only NT that ends with 't68' is NT41?\n\nWait, no, looking at the list again:\n\nLooking for 't68' as an output, I see:\n\nNT22 -> 't57'\nNT7 -> 't48'\nNT28 -> 't13'\nNT84 -> 't57'\nWait, no, 't68' seems to be only in NT13 -> 't33' and the output may be elsewhere.

{"custom_id":"request-900","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. First, I need to understand what the grammar is saying. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first two productions are S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, from S, we can produce two different sequences: one starting with NT7 followed by NT23, and another starting with NT97 followed by NT54.\n\nNext, I notice a bunch of non-terminal productions. They all seem to break down into other non-terminals until they reach terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT40 \u2192 't71', meaning when NT40 is used, it expands to 't71'.\n\nThe string we're given is a sequence of these 't' terms: t36 t31 t99 t23 t87 t96 t53 t53 t62 t99 t87 t12 t87 t99 t54 t19 t17 t32 t10 t37 t25 t33 t68 t10 t53 t12 t41 t54 t41 t41 t86 t84 t66 t54 t33 t54 t54 t23 t87 t41 t48 t13 t51 t87 t51 t99 t48.\n\nI need to see if this string can be produced by any combination of the grammar rules.\n\nSince S starts with either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54, the first two elements of the string must match one of these initial productions. Looking at the string, the first token is t36. Let's check the NT7 and NT97 productions.\n\nLooking at NT7, wait, is there a rule for NT7? Scanning the rules: yeah, NT7 \u2192... Wait, no. Most rules are NT99, NT58, etc. Wait, I don't see a rule for NT7. Unless I missed it.\n\nWait, let me scan the rules again. Oh, yes, there's NT7 \u2192 't48'. Yes, so NT7 can produce 't48'. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 't32', NT56 \u2192 't10', etc.\n\nWait, let me check the initial productions again. S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, for the string to be generated, the first part should be either NT7 producing 't36' or NT97 producing 't31'? No, wait, NT7 \u2192 't48', so if the first part is NT7, then the first token should be 't48', but in the given string, the first token is 't36'. So that's a problem. Alternatively, if it starts with S\u2192NT97 NT54, then NT97 produces 't31', so the first token should be 't31'. But the string starts with 't36', which doesn't match either. So that's an issue.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the grammar. Oh, wait a second: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So the first two symbols are NT7 and NT23. If the string starts with 't36' for NT7, which produces 't48' or for NT23, let me see what NT23 does.\n\nLooking at the rules: NT23 can go to 't62' or to NT45 NT53. So if the first symbol is 't36' and the first production for S is NT7 NT23, which would expand to either 't48' and something else, but the first token is 't36', which is not 't48'.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, S produces two things: NT7 NT23 and NT97 NT54. So the string must start with either of these. The first part of the string is 't36', which doesn't match either NT7 leading to 't48' or NT97 leading to 't31'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting because sometimes the initial production could involve more steps. Let me think again: the initial step is S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nIf the string starts with 't36 t31', which would mean NT7 produces 't36' and NT97 produces 't31', but from the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't48', so 't36' can't come from NT7. Similarly, S\u2192NT97 NT54 would produce 't31' followed by something else, but the string starts with 't36' then 't31', so the second part is 't31', which might be NT97, but wait, S production would be NT97 followed by NT54. So the first part would be NT97 (t31) and the second NT54. But in the string, after 't36', the next is 't31', which might not align.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that maybe the initial production is not directly from S but from a deeper expansion. Let me see: perhaps the string starts with NT7 and NT23, which would produce 't48' and another part, but the string starts with 't36'. Then maybe the initial production is S\u2192NT97 NT54, which would result in 't31' followed by 't54' or another NT54 production.\n\nWait, let's look at the first few tokens: t36 t31 t99 t23 t87... Hmm.\n\nIf S is expanded via S\u2192NT7 NT23, then the first symbols should be 't48' and whatever NT23 expands to. But the string starts with 't36', which doesn't match 't48', so that path is impossible.\n\nIf S is expanded via S\u2192NT97 NT54, then the first symbol should be 't31' (from NT97) and the second should be whatever NT54 expands to. But in the string, the first symbol is 't36', which doesn't match. So neither initial production seems to match the string's start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the initial production. Wait, maybe I should consider that the S production branches further. Let me think: maybe the entire string is generated through a complex expansion where the first symbols are part of a deeper structure.\n\nWait, another approach: let me look at the string's first few tokens and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with 't36', which could be part of NT23 because NT23 can expand into 't62' or split into NT45 and NT53.\n\nWait, let's see. The first part is 't36', so perhaps the first symbols are from a production like NT23 \u2192 't62' or maybe NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. Let's see what NT45 and NT53 produce.\n\nLooking at the rules: NT45 \u2192 't59', and NT53 \u2192 't85', right? Wait, no: checking, NT45 \u2192't99' (from the given rules). Wait, no:\n\nWait, the rules: NT45 \u2192 't99' but what? Let me look. The rules are:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40\nNT28 \u2192 NT45 NT53\nNT90 \u2192 NT84 NT8\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16\nNT45 \u2192 't99'? Wait, let me find. Yes, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't99'\n\nWait, no. Looking for NT45: I don't see it in the given list. Wait, checking:\n\nWait the given rules are:\n\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nWait, so NT45 is \"NT99 NT95\"\n\nSimilarly, NT53 -> NT28 NT23\n\nNT23 can go to 't62' or to NT45 NT53.\n\nWait, so for example, if NT23 is split into NT45 and NT53, then NT45 becomes NT99 and NT95.\n\nWait, this could get complicated. Let me map some possible paths.\n\nBut overall, I think the first token is 't36'. Looking through the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't36'? Yes, NT41 \u2192 't68', NT28 \u2192't66', NT66 \u2192't51', etc. Wait, does any non-terminal directly produce 't36'?

{"custom_id":"request-923","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar is provided with production rules. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that the first production can have the start symbol (S) producing two terminals. Looking at the given grammar, the initial productions for S are S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Each of these starts with S and has two non-terminals as a result.\n\nNext, I see a bunch of other production rules, mostly of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which means a non-terminal NTx is replaced by two other non-terminals. Some of these non-terminals eventually produce terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers. The non-terminals are names like NT7, NT97, NT54, etc., and the terminals are the tokens we're given in the string.\n\nThe string I have to evaluate is: t62 t66 t68 t33 t33 t54 t66 t19 t35 t13 t13 t19 t17 t53 t53 t32 t12 t57 t90 t33 t51 t4 t13 t4 t48 t62 t93 t17 t68 t10 t31 t93 t93 t31 t68 t62 t31 t36 t32 t31 t99 t4 t71 t31 t48 t96 t33 t86.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the way the string is constructed is by expanding the non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nStarting with S, the first step is to produce one of the two initial productions: S \u2192 (either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54). So the starting string would be two non-terminals, which then expand further, etc., until the entire string is generated.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's a linear sequence of tokens. Now, in CNF, each production replaces only two non-terminals, which would mean that each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two others. Therefore, the entire string should correspond to a leftmost derivation where each step increases the number of non-terminals by one more than the number of terminals.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each production results in two symbols (two non-terminals can lead to more non-terminals). So each step of the derivation increases the length by one. For example, starting with S, which is a single non-terminal, after the first expansion, you have two non-terminals, and so on. So the total number of symbols in the derived string (counting non-terminals and terminals) is n+1, where n is the number of steps.\n\nBut wait, actually, the grammar in CNF allows for a parse tree where each production has two non-terminals, so the derived string in the end should consist of the terminals. The non-terminals must be expanded in such a way that the entire string is composed of terminals.\n\nSo, I need to check if the string can be broken down according to the given production rules, which are essentially the way non-terminals can split into other non-terminals or directly into terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string starting from the start symbol and see if it can be expanded step by step according to the grammar until the entire string is generated.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t62. So I need to find which production produces t62. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT28 \u2192 t36, NT84 \u2192 t23, NT52 (wait, no NT52, but NT53 \u2192 t85, and some others like NT53 \u2192 t85, but wait, in the productions, for example, NT23 appears in several productions. Let me check the productions more carefully.\n\nLooking at the productions for non-terminals that generate t62. Scanning through, here's what I find:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t36 (that's a terminal, but 36, not 62)\n- Wait, looking through the list, I see:\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I notice:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t57\n- NT23 \u2192 t62 (twice, once in NT23 \u2192 t62, another in NT23 \u2192 some rule)\nWait, looking again:\n\nFrom the productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 t62 appears twice:\n- NT23 \u2192 t62 (twice), once in \"S->NT23\", and then \"NT23 -> t62\" and another production?\nWait, no:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, let's list all the NTx \u2192 t... productions:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 t85\n- NT40 \u2192 t71\n- NT8 \u2192 t32\n- NT56 \u2192 t99\n- NT95 \u2192 t41\n- NT28 \u2192 t36\n- NT84 \u2192 t4 (but it's a terminal, not sure if that's right)\nWait, no, wait, in the productions, some have 't' followed by numbers.

{"custom_id":"request-927","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. Chomsky normal form means each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and I see the initial productions are S->NT7 NT23, which is broken down further into other NTs.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t32 t13 t93 t90 t96 t25 t68 t36 t35 t85 t53 t57 t53 t23 t96 t4 t32 t31 t53 t31 t62 t62 t41 t62 t53 t10 t10 t54 t41 t17 t84 t35 t84 t19 t4 t4 t51 t87 t19 t86 t53 t12 t54 t41 t90 t57 t85 t13`.\n\nI notice that each 't' is followed by a number, like t32, t13, etc. These are likely terminals, which means they need to be matched exactly by the grammar. So, I need to check if the string can be derived from S using the provided rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is a step expanding two symbols into two others. So, for the string, it should have a length of 2^k +1 for some k starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe initial S is a single symbol, so the first expansion would produce two symbols, then four, etc. Let me count the number of tokens in the string. The string has 37 tokens. Hmm, 2^5 is 32, which is less than 37, so maybe it's longer. Let me recount: Each rule expands into two, so if the string length is N, then log2(N-1) should be an integer. Let's see, 37 tokens. Hmm, 2^6 is 64, 37 is way less than 64, but maybe the string can be matched in steps.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Instead of the number of steps, perhaps I can see if the string can be derived by building up the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to just parse the string from left to right, using the grammar rules, replacing the first two symbols at each step with their productions until the string is fully parsed.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Maybe I can look at the grammar rules for each terminal to see how they can be formed.\n\nWait, the string consists of several t segments, each like t32, t13, etc. Let me see if these terminals appear on the right-hand side of any production.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, some of these are:\n\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n- NT55 -> NT90 NT1\n- NT16 -> NT56 NT40\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT94 -> NT96 NT98\n- NT23 -> several options, including some that end with t.\n\nWait, perhaps I can list each terminal and find the productions that produce them.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\nt32: NT8 -> 't32'\nt13: NT13 -> 't68'? Wait, no, looking back, I see NT13 -> NT41 NT18, and NT41 -> 't41', NT18 -> 't96'\n\nWait, let me clarify each terminal:\n\nt32: appears in NT8's production. So, NT8 -> 't32'\n\nt13: I see NT58 has NT58 -> NT94 NT54, and one of the rules for NT53 is NT53 -> NT28 NT23. Wait, perhaps it's better to make a comprehensive list.\n\nWait, maybe I should create a dictionary mapping from each terminal to its possible parent non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16. Let's see, if NT66 and NT16 can produce terminals.\n\nNT99 also appears in other rules, but focusing on the terminals:\n\n- NT8 -> 't32' (NT8)\n- NT41 -> 't41' (NT41)\n- NT54 -> 't12' (NT54)\n- NT7 -> 't48' (NT7)\n- NT23 appears in multiple rules, but the terminals are in some of its productions.\n- NT84 -> 't4' (NT84)\n- NT53 -> 't85' (NT53)\n- NT50 -> 't85' (NT50)\n- NT86 appears in NT84's production.\n- NT58 -> 't94' (NT58)\n- NT84 -> 't84' (NT84)\n- NT22 -> 't57' (NT22)\n- NT85: Check if any of the NTs have that.\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some.

{"custom_id":"request-940","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to understand the structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production rules are as follows:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, the initial expansion starts with S, which branches into either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. The string I need to evaluate starts with \"t32 t71 t23...\", which looks like each token is a terminal symbol. So I need to see how these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice there are several productions for NT followed by numbers. Each of these productions either splits into two NTs or a terminal and possibly other terms. \n\nFor example:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT40 NT96\n- NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- And so on.\n\nAlso, some NT rules directly produce a terminal:\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT7 \u2192 't48'\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n- Etc.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string from left to right, checking if it can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser might be suitable, or I can use memoization to track intermediate steps.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and terminals. The terminals in the string are all the 't' followed by numbers. They are: t32, t71, t23, t19, t99, t84, t37, t85, t33, t87, t68, t57, t84, t90, t23, t12, t54, t66, t37, t93, t87, t51, t35, t33, t84, t41, t99, t4, t54, t32, t33, t32, t66, t48, t54, t85, t86, t19, t48, t37, t31, t35, t87, t36, t32, t54, t99, t54, t86.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t32 t71 t23... \n\nI see that S can expand into NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So starting from S, let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT7 NT23:\n- NT7 \u2192 't48' (since NT7 \u2192 't48'), so the string starts with t48.\nBut in the given string, the first token is t32, which doesn't match. So this path is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT97 NT54:\n- NT97 \u2192 't31' (since NT97 \u2192 't31'), so the first token should be t31. But in the given string, the first token is t32. So this also doesn't match. Wait, that can't be right because the grammar might have other rules for NT97. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\nNT97 \u2192 't31', yes. So S expanding to NT97 NT54 would start with t31. But the given string starts with t32, which is another terminal from NT54. Hmm, that suggests that maybe I messed up. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the first production of S is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which produces 't48' (NT7 \u2192 t48), and the second is S \u2192 NT97 NT54, which produces 't31' (NT97 \u2192 t31). But the given string starts with t32. So neither of the initial expansions of S starts with t32. That suggests that the string might not be in the language, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look deeper. Maybe the NT97 can lead to another NT that produces t32. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT97 leading to NT that would produce t32 anywhere. NT97 only directly produces t31. So that probably means that the string cannot start with t32 because S can't directly produce a t32 in the first step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the initial productions. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the initial S rules. Let me see:\n\nThe S rules are:\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo S can split into NT7 (\u2192 t48) and NT23, or NT97 (\u2192 t31) and NT54. So the first token from S can only be t48 or t31. The given string starts with t32, which is not t48 or t31, so perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm looking at all the grammar correctly. Maybe there are other NT symbols that lead to t32 elsewhere. Let me check each NT production.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT54 \u2192 t12, NT56 \u2192 t10, NT8 \u2192 t40, NT58 \u2192 t94, etc. I don't see any NT productions leading to t32. So perhaps the initial analysis was correct.\n\nIn that case, since the string starts with t32, which is not possible from S's initial expansions, the entire string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Maybe the string has other parts that could be matched after a certain point. Let me think. Suppose S expands into NT97 NT54, which gives us 't31' as the first symbol. But the string starts with t32. So that means after t31, another NT is needed. But there's no production for NT97 beyond that, because NT97 only produces 't31'. So if the first token is t32, it can't be from S since S can't start with t32.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another path? I don't see any other way to start with t32. So perhaps the answer is 'No', because the string starts with a symbol that S can't produce.\n\nWait, but the string is quite long. Maybe there's a deeper expansion. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first token is t32, but the initial S can't directly produce t32, so that would mean the string can't be parsed. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the productions. Let me double-check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT54 -> 't12' (so can produce t12)\nNT56 -> 't10' (t10)\nNT94 -> 't87' (t87)\nNT97 -> 't31' (t31)\nNT58 -> 't94' etc.\n\nAll other NT symbols lead to t's with other numbers. So no NT rule leads to t32. Therefore, since the string starts with t32, it's impossible for it to be generated.\n\nSo my conclusion is that the string is not generated by the grammar because the first token doesn't match any initial production from S.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-947","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to context-free grammars and Chomsky normal form, so I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the given grammar is. It seems like it's in a specific form where each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left, except for the right-hand side, which can be two or more terminals or one non-terminal. Wait, Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. But looking at the grammar, some rules on the right have two non-terminals, like S -> NT7 NT23. Others have terminals, like NT40 -> 't71'. Hmm, maybe the grammar is in a slightly different form, but it's close to CNF.\n\nThe task is to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens like 't71', 't33', etc. I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nI think a good approach here is to create the parse tree for the string and see if it follows the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list the productions first:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nOther productions like NT99 -> NT66 NT16, NT58 -> NT94 NT54, etc.\n\nTerminals in productions are: 't71', 't33', 't53', 't87', 't31', 't31', 't10', 't90', 't54', 't25', 't32', 't23', 't93', 't62', 't68', 't36', 't93', 't53', 't36', 't66', 't84', 't62', 't25', 't68', 't53', 't87', 't4', 't68', 't23', 't35', 't33', 't19', 't87', 't32', 't51', 't4', 't32', '85', 't19', 't37', 't51', 't85', 't31', 't71', 't84', 't12', 't66', 't57', 't93'.\n\nWait, I see that sometimes there's a mix of non-terminals and terminals, so I might need to resolve each non-terminal step by step.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals. So, each S production will have two parts, each of which must be expanded until terminals are reached.\n\nLet me look at the string:\n\nThe string starts with 't71 t33 t53 t87 t31 t31 t10 t90 t54 t25 t32 t23 t93 t62 t68 t36 t93 t53 t36 t66 t84 t62 t25 t68 t53 t87 t4 t68 t23 t35 t33 t19 t87 t32 t51 t4 t32 t85 t19 t37 t51 t85 t31 t71 t84 t12 t66 t57 t93'.\n\nFirst, let me count the number of tokens: It looks like 45 tokens.\n\nS produces two parts, so the first step would split into two parts. Let's see if the string can be divided into two parts that each follow the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree from the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think in terms of the top-down approach using the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to map the string to the grammar by replacing each token from the string with the appropriate non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut to make it simpler, let's see if I can find a way.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see where certain terminals appear.\n\nLooking at the string: The first token is 't71'. Looking at the productions, where does 't71' come from? It's from NT40 -> 't71'. So, in the parse tree, when NT40 is expanded, it becomes 't71'.\n\nLooking at the string again: The last tokens are 't57' and 't93'. NT93 could be from NT84 which is 't84' and another from, say, NT93, but wait, looking at the productions, NT93 isn't listed as a production; instead, we have NT84 -> 't84' and NT93's origin is from NT84 -> 't84' and when combined with other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it step by step.\n\nLooking at S, which is the start symbol. S can produce either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nLet me consider the first option: S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nNow, each of these NTs must be expanded. NT7, when expanded, might go to NT28 or NT40, or maybe other options. Wait, looking back, the productions for NT7: I don't see any; maybe NT7 is only used in production S. So, in the grammar, NT7's definition isn't listed here. Similarly, NT23 has multiple definitions. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the list of productions is incomplete, but in any case, the user provided the productions up to certain points. So, I have to work with them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's best to look for a way to parse the string by matching the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to see each part of the string and see if it can be broken down according to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting from the beginning, the string starts with 't71', which we know is from NT40 -> 't71'. So, that suggests that part is derived from NT40.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT40 has two productions: NT40 -> 't71' and NT40 -> 't17' (Wait no, looking back, in the given productions, I see:\n\nNT40 -> 't71' (from line 6: NT40 -> 't71')\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nWait the list in the user message has multiple lines of productions. Let me list all of them as provided.\n\nThe productions are as follows (each line is a production rule):\n\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT97 NT54\n3. NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n4. NT58 -> NT94 NT54\n5.

But manually tracing a long string through the grammar might be tedious, but let's see if I can break it down.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT93 and NT53 (from S -> NT93 NT53). So the string must start with a sequence derived from NT93 and NT53. Let's see what each NT can produce.\n\nNT93: Looking at the rules, NT93 -> NT28 NT18.

So the first symbol must come from NT93, and the second from NT53. So 't93' would be from a production of NT93. What do we have for NT93?\n\nLooking above, I see NT93 -> NT28 NT18. Wait, but 't93' is a terminal. So perhaps there's a rule where NT93 is directly a terminal symbol. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT54 -> 't93'\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT8 -> 't19'\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n- NT94 -> 't87'\n- NT46 -> 't37'\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n- NT48 -> 't86'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT97 -> 't54'\n- NT1 -> 't57'\n- NT18 -> 't96'\n- NT16 -> 't90'\n- NT28 -> 't66'\n- NT40 -> 't17'\n- NT84 -> 't4'\n- NT84 -> 't84'\n- NT56 -> 't99'\n- NT66 -> 't51'\n- NT54 -> 't53'\n- NT23 -> 't86'\n- NT84 -> 't57'\n- NT53 -> 't85'\n- NT40 -> 't35'\n- NT22 -> 't57'\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT28 -> 't13'\n- NT84 -> 't57'\n- NT86 -> 't25'\n- NT50 -> 't85'\n- NT16 -> 't23'\n\nAh, I see that NT54 can produce 't93'. So perhaps the first symbol 't93' comes from NT54.\n\nWait, but in the initial production S -> NT93 NT53, so NT93 would produce the first symbol. Looking for NT93, in the production rules, NT93 isn't a terminal, but earlier it's broken down into NT28 NT18. But in the rules above, NT28 is a non-terminal, producing 't36' among others. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT93 with NT54. The S production starts with NT93 and NT53. Each of these non-terminals will generate parts of the string.\n\nLet me think: 't93' is the first symbol, so it must come from some NT production. Looking at the rules, NT54 can produce 't93'. So maybe NT93 is somehow a terminal, but in the rules, it's defined as a non-terminal that produces NT28 and NT18. So unless NT28 or NT18 can produce 't93', which I don't see.\n\nWait, NT28: NT28 -> 't36' is one of its productions. So if NT28 can produce t36, but to get t93, perhaps through another production.\n\nWait, maybe I need to see the entire breakdown.\n\nThe string is: t93 t53 t25 t71 t93 t62 t68 t19 t87 t17 t41 t4 t62 t53 t12 t54 t12 t93 t35 t68 t66 t25 t36 t19 t86 t86 t90 t41 t86 t36 t13 t93 t36 t17 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-965","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long, so I need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. It's a form where each production rule has at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. In this grammar, I notice that all the production rules either produce two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, which I think might actually not be strictly CNF. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions should have exactly two non-terminals, but looking at the given rules, some end up with a non-terminal followed by a terminal, like S -> NT93. That would actually be a single symbol on the right, which is allowed in some versions but not exactly standard CNF. Hmm, maybe the problem still considers it as CNF for the sake of the problem. I'll proceed assuming that the grammars are in CNF because all terminals are single letters, which makes parsing easier.\n\nThe string provided is: t90 t36 t19 t86 t12 t32 t23 t66 t37 t54 t57 t12 t31 t4 t53 t41 t96 t54 t71 t54 t33 t41 t17 t19 t84 t41 t12 t32 t84 t33 t48 t84 t96 t12 t93 t19 t35 t19 t41 t86 t19 t32 t17 t68 t17 t86 t62 t53 t32 t51.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do that, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is used to parse strings in CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell represents whether a certain substring can be derived from a particular non-terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the terminals present in the string to see which non-terminals they correspond to. Let me look through the grammar rules to see which symbols are terminals and what the rules are.\n\nFrom the grammar, some symbols are written as production rules ending with a terminal. For example, NT50 -> NT59 NT46 | NT85, but looking at the details, I see a mix. Wait, some symbols like S, NT99, etc., are non-terminals, and others are terminals. For example, NT54 -> 't93', so t93 is a terminal. Similarly, S -> NT7 NT23, so NT7 must be a non-terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's parse the grammar correctly.\n\nEach production rule is written as X -> Y Z, where Y and Z can be non-terminals or terminals. But in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has exactly two symbols on the right side. So, in this case, all productions are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, no, the grammar as written has some productions with a single terminal on the right side? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the top-level grammar rules:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\nNT90 -> NT84 NT8\nNT50 -> NT55 NT1\nNT8 -> NT40 NT96\nNT58 -> NT22 NT8\nNT98 -> NT40 NT90\nNT1 -> NT88 NT53\nNT50 -> NT59 NT46\nNT88 -> NT7 NT40\nNT54 -> 't93'\nNT97 -> 't31'\nNT40 -> 't71'\nNT8 -> 't32'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT95 -> 't41'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nNT8 -> 't19'\nNT41 -> 't68'\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT46 -> 't13'\nNT48 -> 't96'\nNT94 -> 't87'\nNT46 -> 't37'\nNT23 -> 't62'\nNT48 -> 't86'\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT97 -> 't54'\nNT1 -> 't57'\nNT18 -> 't96'\nNT16 -> 't90'\nNT28 -> 't66'\nNT40 -> 't17'\nNT84 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't84'\nNT56 -> 't99'\nNT66 -> 't51'\n\nWait a second, some rules end with a terminal immediately, like NT54 -> 't93', but that doesn't fit with the standard CNF because the production has a terminal as the only symbol on the right. In CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals, so having a single terminal on the right would mean that rule is of the form X -> a, where a is a terminal. That is allowed in some forms of CNF, sometimes referred to as a simplified or strict form. So I think it's acceptable.\n\nNow, I'll note which symbols are terminals. The terminals are the strings between the backticks, so the terminals in the string are: t90, t36, t19, t86, t12, t32, t23, t66, t37, t54, t57, t12, t31, t4, t53, t41, t96, t54, t71, t54, t33, t41, t17, t19, t84, t41, t12, t32, t84, t33, t48, t84, t96, t12, t93, t19, t35, t19, t41, t86, t19, t32, t17, t68, t17, t86, t62, t53, t32, t51.\n\nI need to check for each of these whether they can be derived by the grammar.\n\nTo apply the CYK algorithm, I'll list all non-terminals and terminals, and for each symbol in the string, check if it can be derived.\n\nBut since this is a long string, I need a plan. I'll try to parse the string step by step, seeing if I can find a way to split the string into parts that fit the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can build the parse table for the string using CYK.\n\nLet's list the length of the string: it's 64 symbols. So N=64.\n\nThe CYK algorithm will have a table of size (N+1)x(N+1). For each position i,j, we'll mark whether there's a non-terminal that can produce the substring from i to j.\n\nBut doing this step-by-step by hand would be tedious. Instead, perhaps I can look for patterns or find the non-terminals that can produce the terminals in the string, working backward.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see what terminals are at the beginning: t90, t36, etc.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT28 -> t36. So t36 comes from NT28.\n\nLooking at the string, the second symbol is t19. Let's see what NT19 can produce. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals directly named NT19. Looking through the rules, maybe that's not a non-terminal.\n\nWait, the only non-terminals I've seen are S, NT7, NT97, etc. So I don't think there's a NT19 in the grammar. That means that 't19' is a terminal, but since NT19 isn't a non-terminal in the grammar, this suggests that the string might not be derivable. But let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the only terminals are the t followed by numbers or the specific letters. So perhaps 't19' is a terminal symbol.\n\nSo in the string, the second symbol is 't1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar has various non-terminals (like S, NT, and specific strings) and the string to evaluate is `t31 t53`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like the top-level symbol is S, and S can be rewritten into two options: either NT7 followed by NT23, or NT97 followed by NT54.\n\nSo, the string `t31 t53` must be derived from one of these two production rules.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT7 NT23:\n\n1. The first part is NT7 \u2192 t31, according to the given rules. That part checks out.\n2. The second part is NT23 \u2192 t53, as per NT23's productions, since NT23 \u2192 NT45 and NT23 also \u2192 other options, but looking through the rules, there's an entry NT23 \u2192 t53. Wait, no\u2014I need to check. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT23 can go to NT45 NT53 or also can go directly to 't62' as per an earlier rule. Alternatively, looking at the rule list, there's NT23 -> 't62'. But the string we have is t53, but I need to see if any path leads NT23 directly to t53 or maybe through further productions.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the production rules. Looking at the list, I don't see NT23 directly going to 't53'. The rules for NT23 include NT45 NT53, or another option. Wait, checking all the rules:\n\nI see NT23 -> 't62' in one rule and another production like NT23 -> NT45 NT53. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe NT23 can be rewritten into t53 through some intermediate steps? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no. The string we have is t53. So, could NT23 directly produce t53?\n\nLooking back, none of the NT23 productions directly result in t53. Let me check all the NT23 productions:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- Also, looking through other rules, I see NT23 is also present as a terminal in several places. Wait, maybe I\u2019m missing something. Let me list all NT23 rules:\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- Also, in another rule: NT23 \u2192 't62'\n\nWait, but in the given string, I have t53 and t31, so if the second NT23 needs to be t53, that's a problem because the only way I see NT23 can produce t-something is through t53 or t62 or others. Wait, perhaps I'm not looking carefully.\n\nWait, no: in the production rules, I don't see NT23 directly translating to 't53'. The only 't's in NT23 are t62, t45, t13, etc., but 't53' might not be directly produced by NT23.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, the string is `t31 t53`. So, when S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is expanded, the first part is NT7 \u2192 t31, which is correct. Now, the second part is NT23 \u2192 t53. But in the grammar, does any production of NT23 lead directly to 't53'?\n\nLooking at all the NT23 rules, I don't see any that directly result in 't53'. For example:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 (but that would produce 't45' followed by, maybe, another t... but in the string it's t53 alone?)\nWait, but perhaps NT53 can go to t53.\n\nWait, no. The NT53 can produce t53 through a production, but wait: looking at the rules, yes, there's an NT53 \u2192 't53' as per this line: 'NT53 \u2192 t53' isn't directly listed, wait. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- I see NT53 \u2192 't57'? No, that's another NT28. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the letters. Let me check each line:\n\nLooking at the rules, for NT53: I don't see an explicit NT53 \u2192 t53. Instead, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n\nSo NT66 \u2192 't51' is present, NT54 \u2192 't12', etc. But for NT53, I don't see any direct production.

{"custom_id":"request-12","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t54 t93` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, but I still need to understand the rules thoroughly.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. The starting symbol is S, and the production rules for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must ultimately derive from one of these two rules. That means the string must have a structure that can be broken down into the appropriate symbols leading to these terminal symbols.\n\nThe string I'm given is `t54 t93`. Let's break it down. It has two tokens: t54 and t93. These are terminal symbols based on the grammar, as they are in the right-hand side of some productions or perhaps directly terminals in the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that:\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\nBut wait, in the given grammar, 't54' is a terminal because it's part of the production S \u2192 NT97 NT54, where 't54' is the terminal. Similarly, 't93' is a terminal as it's part of S's production.\n\nWait, but in the rules, I see:\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, no, that's for NT54. But wait, the string is t54 t93, so each of these is a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list out the terminal symbols as per the grammar.\n\nLooking at each rule, the right-hand side is either non-terminals (like NT97, NT54, etc.) or a 't' followed by two digits. So the terminals are:\n't54', 't93', 't31', 't40', 't71', 't48', etc., but each is a specific combination.\n\nSo, the string is two terminals: 't54' and 't93'.\n\nNow, the question is: can these two terminals appear in a derivation starting from S?\n\nLooking at S's rules, S can produce two possible initial steps:\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nLet's consider the first rule: NT7 and NT23. Then, each of these needs to derive into a terminal string.\n\nBut looking at the NT7 rule, I don't see a production for NT7 in the given grammar. Wait, the given rules only go so far. Let me check.\n\nLooking back, all the rules start with NT, like NT99, NT58, etc. So, for NT7, I don't see any production rule that has NT7 as the start. Instead, there are rules like:\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\nBut for NT7: Maybe NT7 is a terminal? Wait, in the grammar, I don't see any rule for NT7 except for one possibility: when I look through the list, I see:\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals and their productions, I notice that NT7 isn't present as a left-hand side (LHS) of any production. So, probably, NT7 is a terminal. Similarly, 't7' might not be in the terminals, but in this case, the string has 't54' and 't93', so perhaps NT7 is a terminal? Wait, no, because in the rules, NT7 isn't a LHS, so it's a terminal. So does that mean S \u2192 NT7 NT23 would produce two terminal symbols NT7 and NT23, but if both NT7 and NT23 are terminals, then the string would be a combination of their terminals. So if NT7 is 't54' and NT23 is 't93', then the string 't54 t93' would be generated.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, does S \u2192 NT7 NT23 lead to NT7 and NT23? So if NT7 is a terminal, say 't54', and NT23 is a terminal, say 't93', then the string would be 't54 t93' which is exactly what we have.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the second rule for S: S \u2192 NT97 NT54. NT97 would produce 't31' and NT54 would produce 't12', so the string would be 't31 t12', which isn't the given string.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get 't54 t93' is through the first production of S \u2192 NT7 NT23, where NT7 is 't54' and NT23 is 't93'.\n\nBut wait, does the grammar have NT7 as a terminal? Because in the list, the only terminal is when a non-terminal is on the RHS and isn't followed by another non-terminal. For example, look at the production NT55 \u2192 't99'\u2014so that's a terminal.\n\nBut looking through all the rules, the only other terminal is NT54 \u2192 't12' and other 't's with numbers. But I don't see any other terminals except the ones specified.\n\nWait, this suggests that NT7 is not a terminal, because in the grammar, it's on the LHS of a production. Wait, no, looking at the rules, I don't see NT7 being a LHS anywhere except perhaps in some other way.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, and the next level is NT7. But if NT7 is on the LHS of any production, it's a non-terminal, meaning it needs to be expanded. But if there's no rule for NT7, that would mean it's a terminal. Wait, in the given grammar, all the non-terminals that are in the RHS are as follows:\n\n- NT99, NT58, NT94, NT55, NT90, NT45, NT59, NT53, NT28, NT84, NT23, NT13, NT90, NT50, NT1, NT56, NT95, NT28, NT84, NT58, NT98, NT16, NT23, NT40, NT95, NT88, NT54, NT56, NT95, etc.\n\nWait, I don't see NT7 or NT23 except as the RHS of other produces. Wait, looking at the rules, there's an NT23 production:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\nAlso, later:\nNT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18\nNT23 also appears on the RHS of other rules, such as:\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16\nNT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\nWait, no, actually, that's NT45 on the left. Looking again:\n\nWait, the rules given are a list. Let me list the production for each LHS:\n\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n- NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n- NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54\n- NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98\n- NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1\n- ... and so on.\n\nLooking for NT7, I don't see any production where LHS is NT7. So NT7 is a terminal, because it's never a LHS in any production.\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT23: in the rules, I see that NT23 is on the RHS of NT40 (looking at the rules, \"NT40 \u2192 't71'\", but wait, more relevant is where NT23 is on LHS. Wait, in the rules, I don't see NT23 as a LHS anywhere. Wait, actually, looking through:\n\nLooking through the list of rules, I don't see any production with LHS = NT23. Wait, but then in the production rules, S \u2192 NT7 NT23 would imply that NT7 and NT23 are both terminals if they don't appear as LHS in any production.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe NT7 is a non-terminal because it appears on the LHS of some production. Let's check: in the list of rules, the only NT7 is on the RHS of a production. So if it's not on the LHS of any other production, maybe it's considered a terminal. Similarly, if NT23 is only on the RHS and not the LHS of any production, it's a terminal.\n\nWait, but I thought NT28 is on LHS of a production: looking through the rules, no\u2014NT28 is on the RHS (as per NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16). So if NT23 is not on the LHS of any production, it's a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure it this way: in Chomsky normal form, a production is A \u2192 BC, or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-28","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is \"t48 t33 t85\", and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific characteristics: each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit because all the productions either have two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is in CNF because both sides are non-terminals, and S \u2192 NT58 NT54 is also CNF because both are non-terminals. Similarly, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16 is CNF, and NT54 directly maps to 't12', which is a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to check is \"t48 t33 t85\", which has three tokens. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT...NT..., each start production will generate two non-terminals, each of which will eventually produce a terminal. So, for a string to be generated, it must be of length that's a power of 2. Wait, no, that's for derivations starting from S. Let me think: each application of a production rule splits a non-terminal into two, so starting from S, each step increases the number of symbols by 1 (since a single symbol becomes two). But for a string with three tokens, it's actually length 3, which is 2^1 +1? Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Because starting from S, the first step gives two symbols, then each of those could split again, so the number of symbols at each step is a power of 2? Or maybe not exactly. Let me clarify: \n\nIf you have S \u2192 A B, then in two steps, you can have four symbols, etc. But for a string like t48 t33 t85, it's three tokens. So how does that fit? Maybe it's a direct production where the starting symbol S directly produces the string in one step, but looking at the production rules, S is only defined as S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Neither of these directly map to 't' terms. So the starting production would branch into two non-terminals, each of which would eventually produce a single terminal. \n\nWait, but if S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and then each of those would need to be terminals. Let's check what NT7 can produce. Looking at the rules, NT7 goes to 't48'. So NT7 \u2192 't48'. Then NT23 can produce several things. Let's see, NT23 can go to 't62' or 't86' or 't28' or 't36', etc. Hmm, in the string, the first token is t48, which matches NT7. So the S production would have to split into NT7 (which is t48) and NT23. Then, the second token in the string is t33. So the NT23 must derive to 't33'. But looking at the production rules for NT23, let's see what it can produce.\n\nLooking through the NT23 rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 again\n- Others don't directly produce NT23.\n\nWait, let me check each possibility. \n\nSo, from NT23, the first rule is NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. Then each of these non-terminals, NT45 and NT53, need to produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT45: \n- NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\n\nAnd NT99: \n- NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n- NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18\n\nAnd NT95: \n- NT95 \u2192 NT90 NT95\n- NT90 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT90 \u2192 NT84 NT85\n\nWait, so when expanding NT95, which is part of the rule for NT45, and then each of those requires breaking down further.\n\nWait, the string I'm trying to match is t48 t33 t85. So let's track:\n\n- The first symbol is t48, which comes from NT7 \u2192 t48.\n\n- The second symbol is t33. That must come from NT23. So let's see what NT23 can derive. NT23's main production is NT45 NT53. So t33 would have to come from NT53 or NT45, but NT45 goes to more non-terminals, which would require more splits, leading to more tokens. Alternatively, if NT23 can produce a terminal directly, but looking at the rules, NT23 doesn't directly produce a terminal, only via multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check NT7 \u2192 t48, which is straightforward. Then for the second token, t33, which is generated by NT23. So looking at NT23's rules: it only has production to other non-terminals. That suggests that the second symbol would have to come from a chain of productions from NT23. \n\nBut let's try to see what NT23 can produce. It can go to NT45 NT53. Let's take NT45 first: NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95. \n\nNT99 can go to NT66 NT16 or NT28 NT18. Suppose we choose NT66 NT16. NT66 \u2192 t51. NT16 \u2192 t90. So NT99 \u2192 t51 t90. Then NT95: from NT95's rules, it can go to NT90 NT95. But NT90 is t84 (from NT90 \u2192 t84), but wait, in the rules, NT90 can also go to t84. Let me check: \n\nLooking at NT90: \n- NT90 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT90 \u2192 NT84 NT85\n- Also, NT90 \u2192 NT84 NT8 (wait, perhaps another rule?)\n\nWait, looking back: \n\n- NT90's production is NT90 \u2192 NT84 NT8 and NT90 \u2192 NT84 NT85.\n\nSo, for the NT90 part, it can produce t84 t8 or t84 t85.\n\nPutting this together, if we have NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, which gives t51 t90.\n\nAnd NT95 \u2192 NT90 NT95, but NT95 might go to itself, which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps NT53 branches into more non-terminals.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's look at the string t48 t33 t85.\n\nThe first token is t48, which comes from NT7. So the first production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Then, the next symbol is t33, which comes from NT23. Now, NT23 must produce a string that includes t33. Looking at the rules for NT23, it can't produce a single terminal directly. So the two symbols after S would be the results of NT7 and NT23. NT7 is t48, so the second symbol is from NT23. So NT23 must derive to t33 followed by something, but wait, the string is only t48 t33 t85, which is three terminals, so S must have produced a string of length 3. \n\nBut in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So each production step expands the non-terminals into more elements. Starting from S, which is two non-terminals (S \u2192 NT7 NT23), each of those would produce terminals. So the total number of terminals would be two, not three. But the given string has three, which suggests that perhaps S is part of a larger derivation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe S itself can produce a string that eventually leads to three terminals. Let's consider that S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and NT23 can produce multiple terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50. Then NT13 might produce something, and NT50 could produce t85. Let's check.\n\nLooking at NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18. Then, NT41 \u2192 t68, and NT18 \u2192 t96. So NT13 would produce t68 t96, which is two symbols. But our target string has t33 at the second position, so this seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT23 can produce more non-terminals. NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. So two more non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-39","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the productions. \n\nFirst off, I'll look at the grammar provided. Each production rule either has a non-terminal on the left and a pair of non-terminals on the right, or it directly produces a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t48 t68 t96 t85`. So, I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, the process would be to see if the string can be built by expanding either S option.\n\nLet's first check the first production: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So, we need to derive 't48', 't68', 't96', 't85' from NT7 and NT23.\n\nNT7 is a non-terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT7 \u2192 't48' directly. That's straightforward. So, the first part is 't48'.\n\nNext, NT23 has several productions. Let's list them out:\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT23 \u2192 NT99 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT84 NT86\n- NT23 \u2192 NT53 NT28\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT48\n- NT23 \u2192 NT48 NT95\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT23 \u2192 NT50 NT46\n- NT23 \u2192 ... (Others, but these are the first few)\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, the main production for NT23 is the first option: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. But I see other NT23 productions as well. So, I need to see which one can lead to the remaining string elements.\n\nThe string after NT7 is 't68', 't96', 't85'. Since the next symbol is 't68', let me see if any of the NT23 productions can produce 't68'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT23, one of them is NT23 \u2192 NT50 NT46, which further produces 't50' and 't46'. But wait, another production is NT23 \u2192 NT46 NT13, but that's not directly 't68'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace back the possibilities. Let's try expanding NT23 step by step.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to parse the string from left to right, choosing the correct productions at each step. Let's try that.\n\nGiven the string: t48 t68 t96 t85.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t48, which comes from NT7. So, after NT7 is consumed, we move to the next token, which is t68. Now, the remaining part is 't68 t96 t85'.\n\nWe need to see how to get 't68' from the second part of S's first production, which is NT23.\n\nSo, we focus on generating 't68' from NT23. Let's look at the productions of NT23:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the relevant production for NT23 that can lead to 't68' would be if any of the non-terminals can produce 't68' through some path.\n\nLooking at NT23 \u2192 NT50 NT46 (since NT46 \u2192 't46' directly, but that's not helpful). Another production: NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50, which leads to 't50' (NT13 \u2192 't33' or NT13 \u2192 NT28 NT18, etc.). Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each production of a non-terminal can only produce a terminal or another pair. So, I need a path from NT23 to the required terminal symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be parsed by looking at all possible productions and seeing if the string matches any expansion.\n\nWait, another approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which parses the string based on the grammar. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler path.\n\nWait, let's consider the second production of S: S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's see if that can generate the string.\n\nNT97 can produce 't31' directly, so the first symbol would be 't31', but the given string starts with 't48', so this production might not be useful. Unless there's a way to derive 't48' from NT97, but looking through the grammar, I don't see such a production.\n\nFor example, looking at NT97, it's only used in one production: NT97 \u2192 't31'. So the second production of S would lead to 't31' and then the next part would be NT54, which produces 't12'. So the string would start with t31 t12, but the given string starts with t48 t68, so this seems unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the first production of S is more promising, as NT7 produces t48, and then we have to generate the rest from NT23.\n\nSo, the string to derive from NT23 is t68, t96, t85.\n\nNow, looking at the productions of NT23:\n\n1. NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n2. NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n3. NT23 \u2192 NT99 NT53\n4. NT23 \u2192 NT84 NT86\n5. NT23 \u2192 NT53 NT28\n6. NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT48\n7. NT23 \u2192 NT48 NT95\n8. NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n9. NT23 \u2192 NT50 NT46\n\nWait, I think I might have miswritten the productions. Let me check again.\n\nThe grammar has:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT23 \u2192 NT99 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT84 NT86\n- NT23 \u2192 NT53 NT28\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT48\n- NT23 \u2192 NT48 NT95\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT23 \u2192 NT50 NT46\n\nWait, that's a lot of options. Now, I need to see if any of these can split into t68, t96, and t85.\n\nBut wait, each production for a non-terminal leads to two other symbols. So, after NT23, the next part of the string is t68 t96 t85.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each option and see if any path can produce t68.\n\nLet's take the first option: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53.\n\nNow, I need to see if NT45 and NT53 can produce 't68' and 't96' respectively, considering the next token is t68.\n\nBut wait, no. Because from S \u2192 NT7 NT23, after NT7 is t48, then after NT23, the next symbol is t68. So, the NT23 must produce t68 followed by t96 and t85. But since NT23\u2192 X Y, then X must produce t68 and Y must produce t96 t85.\n\nWait, that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is built as a concatenation of the two symbols from the S production.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 A B, then the resulting string is the concatenation of the strings generated by A and B.\n\nTherefore, in the case of S \u2192 NT7 NT23, the complete string is the concatenation of the string from NT7 and NT23.\n\nSo, the string is 't48' + <what NT23 generates> = t48 t68 t96 t85.\n\nTherefore, the first part is t48, and the second part is t68 t96 t85.\n\nSo, I need to have NT23 generate the string t68 t96 t85.\n\nSo, let's see if NT23 can generate that.\n\nStarting with NT23, how can it produce t68, t96, t85.\n\nWait, perhaps by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have to produce three symbols after NT23: t68, t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since it's a sequence of terminals, I'll need to see if each part of this string can be derived from the non-terminals starting from S.\n\nLooking at how the string is structured:\n- The string starts with \"t48\", so I need to see if any non-terminal produces \"t48\".\n- Moving forward, after \"t48\", we have \"t13\", then \"t96\", \"t41\", and finally \"t85\".\n\nLet me check each part step by step.\n\n1. \"t48\": Looking at the grammar rules, NT54 and NT23 both produce \"t48\":\n   - NT54 \u2192 t48\n   - NT23 \u2192 t48\n   So, either can be used to produce \"t48\".\n\n2. \"t13\": Checking the rules, NT56 \u2192 t17 doesn't help, but looking through the rules:\n   - Wait, NT56 doesn't produce \"t13\". Let me check again. Oh, perhaps I missed some rule. Looking through the rules, I see NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18, and NT41 \u2192 t68, NT18 \u2192 t96. That doesn't give me \"t13\". Hmm. Maybe I need to look elsewhere. Oh, wait, looking at NT23 \u2192 t62, which is another way to get \"t62\", but I'm looking for \"t13\". Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, NT22 \u2192 t57, but we have \"t13\". Hmm, maybe NT13 is the one that can produce \"t13\", but in the rules, I don't see NT13 directly producing a terminal. Wait, the rules given: Let me list all entries to see if any produce \"t13\":\nLooking through the rule list:\n- NT23 \u2192 t62\n- NT28 \u2192 t36\n- NT84 \u2192 t25\n- NT50 \u2192 t85 (twice, once with different left side)\n- NT56 \u2192 t99\n- NT48 \u2192 t96\n- NT94 \u2192 t87\n- NT66 \u2192 t51\n- NT54 \u2192 t53\n- NT53 \u2192 t85\n- NT40 \u2192 t35\n- NT22 \u2192 t57\n- NT16 \u2192 t90\n- NT7 \u2192 t48\n- NT8 \u2192 t32\n- NT5 \u2192 t?\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing \"t13\". Hmm, that's a problem. So unless I made a mistake in looking, it seems like \"t13\" isn't produced by any rule except maybe I overlooked a rule.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again:\nLooking through each production:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\nNT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\nNT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54\nNT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98\nNT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1\nNT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95\nNT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\nNT59 \u2192 NT56 NT53\nNT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23\nNT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\nNT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95\nNT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\nNT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\nAh! Wait, here's NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50, and NT13 isn't a terminal but a non-terminal. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT13 has a production NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18. So, to get \"t13\", we would need an NT13 that produces NT41 and NT18, which are both non-terminals, leading to \"t68\" and \"t96\". But that doesn't give us \"t13\". So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, looking at the production: NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50. If NT13 can produce some terminal, perhaps \"t13\", but according to the given rules, there's no production for NT13 that directly gives a terminal symbol. Hmm, so maybe \"t13\" can't be derived because it's not produced by any rule. That would mean the string is invalid because there's a \"t13\" that can't come from any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing. Let me check again. Looking through the rules, do any of the non-terminals produce \"t13\"? I don't see any. The rules either produce other non-terminals or specific t-strings. So \"t13\" seems missing.\n\nWait, but in the string, after \"t48\", it's \"t13\". So if \"t13\" isn't a terminal, then perhaps the grammar can't produce the string. But wait, the grammar's terminals are t followed by numbers, so \"t13\" would have to come from a non-terminal that can produce it. But I don't see any such rule in the given grammar.\n\nTherefore, that would mean the string \"t48 t13 t96 t41 t85\" can't be generated because \"t13\" isn't present in any production as a terminal.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the rules again to see if any of them can produce \"t13\". Looking through each line:\n\nNT23 \u2192 t62\nNT28 \u2192 t36\nNT84 \u2192 t25\nNT50 \u2192 t85\nNT56 \u2192 t99\nNT48 \u2192 t96\nNT94 \u2192 t87\nNT66 \u2192 t51\nNT54 \u2192 t53\nNT53 \u2192 t85\nNT40 \u2192 t35\nNT8 \u2192 t32\nNT41 \u2192 t68\nNT7 \u2192 t48\nNT5 \u2192 ... not in the list.\n\nWait a second, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces \"t13\". So \"t13\" can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the string includes a \"t13\", which isn't possible, so the entire string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed a rule. Let me read the rules again more carefully:\n\nLooking for any rules where the right-hand side is \"t13\" or produces it as part of a path. For example, NT13 might do something else, but looking at the rules, NT13 is used as the left side in some productions, but it's never directly yielding a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"t13\" comes from a non-terminal that is being generated via another production that isn't shown. But in this case, \"t13\" isn't present in any of the right-hand sides.\n\nSo, based on this, since \"t13\" isn't present as a derived terminal, it's impossible for the grammar to generate the given string. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but another thought: the string is \"t48 t13 t96 t41 t85\". Let me think if multiple production paths could combine to produce this. For example, maybe \"t48\" comes from one non-terminal, then \"t13\" from another, and so on. But since \"t13\" can't be produced directly, it must come from a non-terminal that itself is generated from others.\n\nBut let's consider:\n\nSuppose the first part is \"t48\", which could come from NT54 or NT23.\n\nThen, after that, we have \"t13\", which requires a non-terminal that can produce \"t13\" directly. But looking at the rules, there's no such non-terminal, so it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar provided seems to be in CNF because all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side, except for some that have multiple on the left, but looking again, I think the initial part was a bit confusing. Wait, actually, looking back, the grammar is indeed CNF because all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which splits into NT7 and NT23 (S \u2192 NT7 NT23). So to generate the string, the derivation must start with S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nLooking at the target string, it's `t48 t51 t90 t41 t85`. Let me think about each step.\n\nFirst, I need to see how the NT7 and NT23 can produce parts of the target string.\n\nStarting with NT7: Looking at the productions, NT7 \u2192 NT58 NT54, but NT54 has a rule NT54 \u2192 't53' (from the given grammar). So for NT7, we can get some parts. Wait, perhaps I should build out the derivation tree step by step, focusing on whether the string can be split into valid parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for the leftmost derivation or any order that can produce the target string, regardless of order, as long as all steps are valid.\n\nSo let's list the target string's components:\n\nt48, t51, t90, t41, t85.\n\nI need to see how each of these can be generated and then link them together.\n\nLooking at the grammar, terminals are only on the right-hand side of the productions, except for the initial S. So each step reduces a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, I need to see if the string can be built by breaking it into components that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me think about the NT7 production. NT7 \u2192 NT58 NT54. And NT54 \u2192 't53'. So if I have NT7, part of the string might come from NT58 and NT54, where the terminal 't53' is one element.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal produces two non-terminals or a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that structure. The start symbol is S, which immediately expands to either NT99 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. \n\nMy string to check is `t48 t13 t96 t41 t36 t86`, which translates to the sequence [t48, t13, t96, t41, t36, t86]. So, I need to see if this can be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me list the production rules relevant to terminals that are in the string:\n\nLooking through the rules, here are the direct terminal productions I can see:\n- NT54 -> 't93'\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT8 -> 't19'\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n- NT48 -> 't86'\n- NT94 -> 't87'\n- NT46 -> 't37'\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n- NT48 -> 't86'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT97 -> 't54'\n- NT1 -> 't57'\n- NT18 -> 't96'\n- NT16 -> 't90'\n- NT28 -> 't66'\n- NT40 -> 't17'\n- NT84 -> 't4'\n- NT84 -> 't84'\n- NT56 -> 't99'\n- NT66 -> 't51'\n- NT54 -> 't53'\n- NT23 -> 't86'\n- NT84 -> 't57'\n- NT53 -> 't85'\n- NT40 -> 't35'\n- NT22 -> 't57'\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT28 -> 't13'\n- NT84 -> 't57'\n- NT86 -> 't25'\n- NT50 -> 't85'\n- NT16 -> 't23'\n\nHmm, wait. I think I might have made a mistake in parsing. Let me correct that.\n\nLooking again, for example:\n- NT7 -> 't48' \u2192 So t48 comes from NT7.\n- NT13 -> 't33' \u2192 So t13 is from NT13.\n- NT96 -> 't86' (though I think I might have confused this; looking again, I see NT46 -> 't13' and NT48 -> 't86', etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is S -> NT99 NT23 or S -> NT97 NT54.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's take S -> NT97 NT54.\n\nNT97 -> 't31' (from the rules), and NT54 -> 't93' (from another rule). But wait, my string starts with t48, not t31 or t93. So this production likely won't work because the first token is t48, not t31 or t93. Therefore, this path might not be valid.\n\nNext, let's try S -> NT99 NT23.\n\nNT99 can be broken down into various non-terminals, like NT99 -> NT66 NT16. Then NT66 -> NT51 NT28, but wait, the terminal t51 isn't in our string. That might not help. Alternatively, NT99 could be expanded differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for ways to get t48. From the rules, I see NT7 -> 't48'. So, perhaps one of the non-terminals expands to NT7. Looking for where NT7 is used.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT7 is used in NT7 -> 't48', and also in NT40 -> 't40' and others. Wait, but in the given string, the expansion must come from a sequence that includes NT7 leading to t48.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, the non-terminals are written with uppercase NT followed by numbers, but each represents a single non-terminal. So, for example, NT7 is a single non-terminal symbol that can be replaced by 't48' or by something else.\n\nWait, but from the productions, I see that some of these NT symbols have production rules to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT8 -> 't32' and 't19'\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n- NT54 -> 't93' and also to NT12 (since NT54 -> NT53 NT52 or NT22 NT8?

Let me check again. For NT84, it's defined as -> NT58 NT86 and also as -> NT66 NT16. So a single non-terminal can have multiple productions. But typically in CNF, each non-terminal has only one production, but here NT84 is being defined with two different RHS. That's a bit confusing because each non-terminal should have a single production. Maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's input: I see 'NT84 -> NT58 NT86' and 'NT84 -> NT66 NT16' as separate productions. So, in the grammar, NT84 has two different productions. That's acceptable in CFG, but some algorithms might prefer it in CNF with single productions. Anyway, for parsing, it's just a matter of handling both.\n\nNow, the string to parse is `t48 t51 t10 t35 t41 t85`.\n\nLet me split this into individual symbols: ['t48', 't51', 't10', 't35', 't41', 't85'].\n\nI need to check if this can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the terminal string, it's all terminals, so each symbol must be generated directly by a production rule where the RHS includes that terminal.\n\nIn the productions, several NTs lead directly to a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT8 -> 't19'  (Wait, but NT8 goes to 't32' and also to NT58? Or no\u2014in the list above, NT8 is 't32' because the last production says NT8 -> 't32'.\nWait, for NT8, the production is NT8 -> 't32' under the given list. So, I think that's correct because all the other lines for NT8 are productions to other NTs, which can lead to other terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, NT8 has two productions:\n\n- NT8 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n\nBut no, in the list above, the NT8 production is given as NT8 -> 't32' (the last line before NT54 -> 't12'). So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for NT23, under the productions: NT23 -> 't62' because the last production is NT23 -> 't62'.\n\nWait, no: looking again, let's parse all the NT productions:\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nThen, for NT99:\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\n\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\n\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\n\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\n\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\n\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\n\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\n\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23 \u2192 53 \u2192 28 and 23\n\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23 \u2192 96 \u2192 48 and 23\n\nNT98 \u2192 48 and 95\n\nNT16 \u2192 56 and 40\nNT23 \u2192 45 and 53 OR 13 and 50\nNT99 \u2192 28 and 18\n\nNT13 \u219241 and 18\n\nNT90 \u219284 and 8\n\nNT50 \u219255 and 1 or 59 and 46\n\nNT8 \u219240 and 96\nNT58 \u219222 and 8\nNT98 \u219240 and 90\n\nNT1 \u219288 and 53\n\nNT50 \u219255 and1 or 59 and46\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-98","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, but the string is in a form of tokens separated by spaces, which I think are the individual symbols in the string.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like it's in a form where each non-terminal can expand into two other non-terminals, except for the ones that have terminals in their productions. Each production is separated by '->' and the terms on the right side are either other non-terminals or terminal symbols, which are prefixed with a 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string `t48 t66 t96 t41 t66 t33 t85` can be derived by the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nStarting with the start symbol, which is S. Looking at the productions for S, there are two:\n1. S \u2192 NT99 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSince both options are possible, I need to check both to see if either can lead to the given string.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I should see if I can parse the string by following the productions.\n\nLet me list the string tokens again: t48, t66, t96, t41, t66, t33, t85.\n\nTo parse, I think I'll try to break the string into parts that match the possible expansions of the grammar. But since this is a context-free grammar with Chomsky normal form, I'll use a parsing strategy like CYK or recursive descent, but since it's a single string, maybe I can simulate a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me look at the possible derivations from S.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT99 NT23.\n\nSo the first two symbols should be NT99 and NT23. But the string starts with t48, which is a terminal, and the first production for NT99 is 't85' according to the grammar rules. Wait, in the grammar, NT99 has a production that includes a terminal. Let me check: NT99 can produce a terminal or more non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT99, I see:\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16 | NT28 NT18.\n\nSo NT99 produces non-terminals, not terminals. Wait, but another production exists: NT99 -> 't85'. Hmm, no, looking back at the grammar, for NT99, the productions are:\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the grammar again. Looking through all the rules:\n\nAh, here's NT99: NT99 -> NT66 NT16 | NT28 NT18. So, it doesn't directly produce terminals. Wait, but another NT99 production is: NT99 -> NT28 NT18. Hmm, that's the same as the first one. Wait, maybe I misremembered. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, in the given grammar, I don't see any NT99 productions that directly produce terminals. So NT99 can only expand into other non-terminals. Similarly, the start symbol S is S \u2192 NT99 NT23, which would mean that to produce S, the string must be formed by NT99 expanding and then NT23 expanding.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t48. So t48 is the start of the string. So I need to see if the first symbol, t48, can be derived from one of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT99 rules, for NT99, the right-hand sides are combinations of other non-terminals, so the only way t48 can come from NT99 is if it's produced directly, but according to the grammar, NT99 doesn't produce t48. Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all NT99 productions. Let me check all NT99 rules. In the grammar, the productions for NT99 are:\n\n1. NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n2. NT99 -> NT28 NT18\n\nSo, both of these produce two non-terminals. So, t48 can't be produced directly by NT99. Therefore, S \u2192 NT99 NT23 cannot be the path because the first symbol is t48, which isn't the start of NT99's expansion. Therefore, that production path might not be possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the other production for S: S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nLooking at NT97: Its productions are NT97 -> NT66 NT16 | 't31'. Yes, here's a production that directly produces 't31'. So NT97 can either go to NT66 NT16 or produce 't31'.\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is t48, which is not 't31'. So S \u2192 NT97 NT54 might not be the starting path either because the first symbol is t48, and NT97's only terminal is t31.\n\nWait, but perhaps after NT97 expands to something else, maybe t48 appears later. Hmm, but in the leftmost derivation, the first symbols must come from the initial expansion. So perhaps this approach won't work. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check all the possible NT productions and see if any of them start with t48, t66, etc., matching the string.\n\nLet me list all the NT non-terminals and their productions. Maybe I can find which non-terminals can produce the starting symbols.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT97 -> 't31'.\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40.\nNT23 has several productions, one of which is 't66' (from NT23 -> 't66'), another 't41' (wait, checking):\n\nNT23 has productions:\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53 (repeated)\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50 (repeated)\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because each grammar rule produces exactly two non-terminals (or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in CNF, it's two non-terminals or a terminal as the right-hand side). Wait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where 'a' is a terminal. So in this grammar, there are both possibilities. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, some are like S -> NT7 NT23, which are two non-terminals. Others have the production ending with a terminal, like NT54 -> 't93' or NT8 -> 't32'. So the grammar allows for both two non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t48 t51 t10 t17 t41 t13 t86`, which is a sequence of seven tokens. Each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. I need to find a derivation that produces exactly this sequence.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from left to right, trying to find a way to split the tokens into a sequence of productions that cover all tokens. Since it's a context-free grammar, each step involves replacing a single symbol (in this case, a terminal) according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I can model this as a parsing problem, trying to find a sequence of productions that transform the start symbol S into the given string. Since the string must consist of exactly the terminals produced by the grammar, I'll check each token to see if it can be the right-hand side of some production.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't48'. I need to see which non-terminals have 't48' as their terminal. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT48 appears on the right-hand side, but 't48' itself is the terminal of NT48? Wait, let's check the rules:\n\nNT48's productions: Hmm, looking back at the grammar, I don't see a rule for NT48. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me scan through the left-hand sides. NT48 is mentioned in NT84->NT86, but not as a non-terminal. Oh, wait, the rules are listed as NT99 -> NT66 NT16, etc. Let me double-check the list:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT48 is on the left in NT98 -> NT48 NT23? No, wait, looking again: None of the NT98 or NT48 seem to have these as left-hand sides. Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up with the NT numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should organize the grammar rules more clearly. Let me list all the rules:\n\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT97 NT54\n3. NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n4. NT58 -> NT94 NT54\n5. NT94 -> NT96 NT98\n6. NT55 -> NT90 NT1\n7. NT90 -> NT94 NT95\n8. NT45 -> NT99 NT95\n9. NT59 -> NT56 NT53\n10. NT53 -> NT28 NT23\n11. NT96 -> NT48 NT23\n12.

NT8 -> 't19' (terminal)\n35. NT41 -> 't68' (terminal)\n36. NT54 -> 't12' (terminal) \u2014 Wait, this seems conflicting with rule 27 where NT54 -> 't93'. Oh, no, line 27 says NT54 -> 't93', line 36 says NT54-> 't12'. That's a problem because a non-terminal can't have two different productions. Wait, am I miscounting? Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLine 27: NT54 -> 't93'\n\nLine 36: NT54 -> 't12' \u2014 That can't be right. Each non-terminal should have unique productions. Probably, this is a mistake in the way the user presented the grammar, but perhaps it's correct. Let me check the original question again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the lines after NT8. Let me try to list them properly:\n\nLine 3: NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n\nLine 4: NT58 -> NT94 NT54\n\nLine 5: NT94 -> NT96 NT98\n\nLine 6: NT55 -> NT90 NT1\n\nLine 7: NT90 -> NT94 NT95\n\nLine 8: NT45 -> NT99 NT95\n\nLine 9: NT59 -> NT56 NT53\n\nLine 10: NT53 -> NT28 NT23\n\nLine 11: NT96 -> NT48 NT23\n\nLine 12: NT98 -> NT48 NT95\n\nLine 13: NT16 -> NT56 NT40\n\nLine 14: NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nLine 15: NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n\nLine 16: NT23 -> NT13 NT50 \u2014 Oh, wait, this seems like another production for NT23: previously, line 14 was another. So line 14 and 16 both have NT23 as left-hand side. Wait, that would make the grammar ambiguous and perhaps invalid because each non-terminal can only have unique productions. So this is a possible error in the question. Alternatively, perhaps line 16 is a different production.\n\nRegardless, for the purpose of solving the problem, let me assume that each non-terminal has unique productions. But the user's grammar has overlapping productions for NT23 and NT54, which is a problem. Wait, does NT54 have two different productions? Line 27 says NT54->'t93', line 36 says NT54->'t12'. That can't be correct because a non-terminal can only have one terminal production, unless it's being confused with another non-terminal. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed under the assumption that these are correct as given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT54 can produce either 't93' or 't12', but that would violate the uniqueness. Hmm, perhaps NT54 is part of two different productions, which might cause the grammar to be invalid. But I'll proceed.\n\nSo, given that, let's proceed. The string is 't48 t51 t10 t17 t41 t13 t86'. Let's list the tokens as [t48, t51, t10, t17, t41, t13, t86].\n\nI need to see if these tokens can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the terminals, each can be the right-hand side of a production. So, let's see:\n\n1. t48: Looking at the grammar, NT48 is on the RHS of some production?\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rules on the RHS can be terminals or non-terminals. So, for example, NT54 -> 't93' or 't12', but in our string, t48 is a terminal.\n\nSo, does any non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the problem.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. But wait, looking at the grammar, most of the rules are of the form NTxy -> NTzw. There are a few rules where the RHS is a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal, like NT54 -> 't93'. Wait, no, actually, that's not CNF. Because in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. So maybe some rules here are exceptions, perhaps for the initial and final steps?\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, most rules are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTzw (like S \u2192 NT7 NT23), but some have one terminal: for example, NT54 \u2192 't93'. That\u2019s a single terminal, which fits the second part of CNF (productions with a terminal on the RHS).\n\nSo now, to determine if the string is derived, I need to see if the string can be generated through the leftmost derivation or rightmost, etc. The string is eight tokens, all of which are terminals: t48, t33, t57, t71, t86, t62, t57, t57.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string according to the grammar, checking each step to see if the symbols can be derived correctly.\n\nLet me list the string: t48, t33, t57, t71, t86, t62, t57, t57.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S, and S can split into two non-terminals each time, but the initial step would produce two parts.\n\nWait, the start symbol S can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54, etc. Let me look at each option.\n\nFirst, let me see the left-hand side S. The two options are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nI need to see which of these could lead to the string.\n\nLet me consider each possibility.\n\nFirst, option 1: S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, after expanding S, we get NT7 NT23, which then need to produce the string.\n\nBut NT7 and NT23 each should expand into sequences of terminals.\n\nWait, but NT7 \u2192 't48' according to the grammar. Let me check: NT7 -> 't48' yes.\n\nSo the first part, NT7, would produce 't48'.\n\nNow, the second part is NT23. Looking at the grammar, NT23 can go to NT45 NT53. Then NT45 can go to NT99 NT95, and so on.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53.\n\nThen, NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18.\n\nWait, but in our string, the next token after t48 is t33, which is part of the second symbol after the initial NT23.\n\nWait, perhaps I should draw a tree or try to see the possible expansions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let me look at the string:\n\nt48 (from NT7), then t33.\n\nBut t33 is part of which NT?\n\nLooking through the grammar, what NT produces t33?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking for a production rule where a terminal is 't33'. Scanning all the rules: let's see.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16. No t33.\n- NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54. No.\n- NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98. No.\n- NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1.

Hmm, that could be relevant.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me see if any rule directly ends with t33 or has t33 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\nLooking for t33.

Let's scan more carefully.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT8 -> 't19'\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n- NT94 -> 't87'\n- NT46 -> 't37'\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n- NT48 -> 't86'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT97 -> 't54'\n- NT1 -> 't57'\n- NT18 -> 't96'\n- NT16 -> 't90'\n- NT28 -> 't66'\n- NT40 -> 't17'\n- NT84 -> 't4'\n- NT84 -> 't84'\n- NT56 -> 't99' (from S rule)\n- NT66 -> 't51'\n- NT54 -> 't53'\n- NT23 -> 't86' (wait, that's NT23 again)\n- NT84 -> 't23'\n- NT53 -> 't85'\n- NT40 -> 't35'\n- NT22 -> 't57'\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT28 -> 't13'\n- NT84 -> 't57'\n- NT86 -> 't25'\n- NT50 -> 't85'\n- NT16 -> 't23'\n\nLooking for 't33'\u2014I see that NT13 \u2192 't33'. So, in the grammar, NT13 produces 't33'.\n\nNow, in our string, after 't48' comes 't33'. So perhaps the second symbol in the initial expansion is NT13.\n\nWait, but the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So NT7 gives 't48', and NT23 needs to generate a sequence of symbols that includes 't33' followed by others.\n\nWait, but S is splitting into two non-terminals. The string after S's split is 8 tokens, so if each non-terminal breaks down into a certain number of tokens, we can see if their total equals 8.\n\nLet me think about the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t48, t33, t57, t71, t86, t62, t57, t57.\n\nLet me see, S \u2192 NT7 NT23 produces 't48' (t7) and the rest. But NT23 could split into more non-terminals, so perhaps the sequence is longer.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial split is S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT97 NT54, then NT97 produces 't31' according to the rules: NT97 \u2192 't31' (directly). NT54 can go to 't12' according to NT54 \u2192 't12'.\n\nSo combined, that would give 't31' from NT97 and 't12' from NT54, but that only gives two tokens, which doesn't match the input string of 8 tokens. So that can't be the right path.\n\nSo maybe the other option S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is the correct path because after S, it starts with 't48' which is in the string.\n\nSo let's take S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nNT7 \u2192 't48', and NT23 \u2192 something.\n\nNow, the remaining string after 't48' is t33 t57 t71 t86 t62 t57 t57. That's seven tokens, so the NT23 needs to generate seven tokens.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side. The grammar provided has all these rules, so that's good. The initial symbols are the non-terminals, and the leaves are the terminals, which in this case are strings like 't48', 't33', etc.\n\nThe string we're checking is composed of terminals. To see if the grammar can generate this string, I can try to construct a derivation starting from the start symbol S and see if it can produce the given string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the structure of the grammar, S directly produces two NT symbols: either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So the derivation will start with S -> NT... something. Each of these NT symbols may further produce other NT combinations or terminals.\n\nGiven the string has nine parts, I need to see if each part corresponds to a production rule or a terminal in the correct order.\n\nLet me write down the string as a sequence of symbols: t48, t33, t99, t13, t51, t90, t41, t85, t13.\n\nWait, that's 9 symbols, but since we're working with a derivation tree, each production replaces one symbol with two, so the number of terminal nodes would be 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating that. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how each terminal in the string is generated.\n\nSince each production either introduces more non-terminals or a terminal, the structure of the string must fit the way the grammar can replace non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me map each terminal to possible non-terminals. For instance, 't48' can come from NT48? Looking at the rules, NT48 appears in the productions:\n\nNT86 -> t25 (wait, no, that's a terminal t25, but in the rules provided: \n\nWait, actually, the rules are the other way around. Let me check the given grammar rules again. At the end, I see several lines where NT... -> 't...'. For example:\n\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT16 -> 't90'\nNT23 -> 't62'\nNT48 -> 't96'\nNT94 -> 't87'\nNT46 -> 't37'\nNT48 -> 't86' (I notice multiple NT48 rules? That can't be right, maybe a typo, but let's see.)\n\nWait, but looking through, NT54 can produce 't12' and 't53'. Similarly, NT23 can produce 't62' and others.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to map each terminal in the string to possible non-terminals that can directly produce it. Let me list each terminal and see where they appear as the right-hand side (RHS) in any production.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- 't48' appears in NT48 -> t96 and also in NT46 -> t37. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT40 -> 't71'\nNT8 -> 't32'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT95 -> 't41'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nNT8 -> 't19'\nNT41 -> 't68'\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT46 -> 't13'\nNT48 -> 't96' (multiple instances)\nNT94 -> 't87'\nNT46 -> 't37'\nNT23 -> 't62'\nNT48 -> 't86' (again, multiple)\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT97 -> 't54'\nNT1 -> 't57'\nNT18 -> 't96'\nNT16 -> 't90'\nNT28 -> 't66'\nNT40 -> 't17'\nNT84 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't84'\nNT56 -> 't99'\nNT66 -> 't51'\nNT54 -> 't53'\nNT23 -> 't86'\nNT84 -> 't57'\nNT53 -> 't85'\nNT40 -> 't35'\nNT22 -> 't57'\nNT7 -> 't48'\nWait, so NT7 can produce 't48', because in the rules, NT79-> 't48' or similar?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's reorganize the rules.\n\nI notice some rules under NT66, NT48, etc. Let me see:\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\nNT7 -> 't48' (appears once)\nNT13 -> 't33' (appears once)\nNT84 -> 't84' (twice)\nNT83? No, wait: looking again, let's check NT84's production. From the rules:\n\nNT84 -> NT84 NT86? No, check the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT84 -> NT53 NT7\n\nSo those are the production rules for NT84.

The task is to determine whether the string `t48 t33 t4 t32 t48 t35 t13 t86 t57` is generated by the given grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, or a single terminal. All non-terminals are terminals in this case, which is a bit unusual but manageable.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce two types of NT with 't's at the end:\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2.

Let me split the string into tokens: `t48 t33 t4 t32 t48 t35 t13 t86 t57`.\n\nSince the first symbol is 't48', I need to see which production could lead to it.

Let me make a list of all 't' productions:\n\n- T40: NT40 -> 't71'\n- T84: NT84 -> 't58' and 't4' (since NT84 can split into two options: NT58 NT86 and NT86 NT?) Wait, actually, in the given grammar, some NT84 produce more than two symbols, like NT84 -> NT58 NT86 or NT86 NT? Hmm, maybe it's better to create a list of all 't' productions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string has 9 tokens, which is an odd number, and the grammar seems to generate strings of even lengths because each production either goes to two tokens or, in the case of NT84, it's non-terminal but maybe can split further.

Let's check: the NT33 isn't in the rules, so maybe I missed something. Wait, in the grammar, is there any NT that produces t33? Looking through all the rules:\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nThe string is `t48 t33 t4 t32 t48 t35 t13 t86 t57`.\n\nWait, t33: the original grammar doesn't have any production where the right side includes t33. That might be a problem because 't33' isn't present as a terminal in any rules. Wait, did I misread the grammar? Let me scan the grammar again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, there is no NT that has a rule ending with 't33', except perhaps in the production S -> NT66 NT16 where 66 is NT66 -> t51. Wait, perhaps it's in NT something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Perhaps 't33' comes from NT90, or another NT.\n\nWait, in the grammar, does any NT produce t33? Looking through all the rules:\n\nS rules: S -> NT7 NT23, S -> NT97 NT54\n\nNT rules:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, none have 't33' as a terminal except maybe in the production NT13 -> 't33'? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking at NT13: NT13 -> 't33' and 't18'\n\nYes! So T33 comes from NT13.\n\nSo, parsing the string, the second token after 't48' is 't33', which must come from NT13.\n\nSo the first two symbols come from either S -> NT7 NT23 or S -> NT97 NT54. Wait, the first token is 't48', which comes from NT7 (since NT7 -> t48). So the first production is S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nWait, but wait: NT7's production is T7->T48, so the first symbol comes from NT7. So the first step is that S produces NT7 and NT23.\n\nBut in the string, after t48, we have t33, which comes from NT13.\n\nSo the first two symbols are from NT7 and NT23. Wait, no, because when S produces NT7 and NT23, they have to be processed in some order, but in the string, the second symbol comes from NT13, which might not directly relate.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this using a recursive descent parser, considering the structure.\n\nLet me define each rule and see how they build up the string.\n\nThe string is: t48 t33 t4 t32 t48 t35 t13 t86 t57\n\nThe length is 9, which is odd, but each production either produces two NTs or maybe something else. Wait, in the given grammar, each production on the right side is either two NTs or a single terminal. Hmm, actually, no, most are two NTs except some. Wait, the grammar was given in CNF, so each production is of the form A->BC or A-> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking back, I see that some rules have only two NTs, like NT46 -> `t13` or NT46 -> `t37`. Wait, no, that can't be right since each production should have exactly two symbols. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo S produces NT7 and NT23, which are both non-terminals.\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\n\nSo each production is two non-terminals, except when a terminal appears. For example:\n\nNT54 -> 't12' \u2014 wait, that's a rule where a non-terminal (NT54) produces a terminal. But in CNF, each rule should have exactly two non-terminals on the right. So maybe the initial problem statement was not entirely in CNF, or perhaps there's a mistake.\n\nWait, this is a bit conflicting. If some rules produce terminals, then the grammar is not in CNF. Because CNF requires right-hand sides to be two non-terminals only. So maybe the initial problem statement has a mistake, but I'll proceed as given.\n\nAssuming the grammar allows a non-terminal to produce a terminal, then some rules are a single symbol, but since the initial problem was presented as in CNF, perhaps I need to correct that.\n\nWait, perhaps 't's are"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which makes it easier to parse with something like the CYK algorithm. But before I jump into that, maybe I should look at the string and see if it makes sense in parts.\n\nLet me start by writing down the string: t48, t68, t96, t84, t19, t57, t48, t17, t13, t86.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So the first step is to see if the entire string can be derived from either of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t48. Let's see where t48 comes from. In the grammar, NT46->t37 and NT48->t96. Hmm, not directly. Wait, NT48 is a non-terminal that produces t96 because NT48->t96 is in the rules. So t96 corresponds to NT48.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t48. Wait no, looking back: NT46->t37, NT48->t96. Wait, maybe I confused NT48 with NT46. So t48 isn't directly represented in any non-terminal in the grammar. Wait, wait, looking again: the production rules\u2014oh, I see some production rules have the right-hand side as NT66 which is converted to t51 and NT54 which is t53, but t48 comes from NT48 which is 't96', so that symbol is t96.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The NT16 production is NT16->t90, NT13->t33, and so on. Wait, perhaps the symbols are lowercase like 't48', which is a specific string. So each production rule leads to a string that ends with certain 't' strings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to parse the entire string as if it's a series of terminal symbols. Let's see. So the string is ten symbols long. Let's list each symbol:\n\n1. t48\n2. t68\n3. t96\n4. t84\n5. t19\n6. t57\n7. t48\n8. t17\n9. t13\n10. t86\n\nWait, but wait. The first two options for S are:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT7 NT23\n\nOption 2: S -> NT97 NT54\n\nEach of these consists of two non-terminals. So the string should start with either NT7 followed by NT23, or NT97 followed by NT54. Let's check.\n\nThe string starts with t48, which comes from NT48->t96. Wait, no, because in the grammar, NT48 is a non-terminal that converts to 't96'. So t48 isn't directly present. Wait, looking back, the production rules: NT16->t90 is one, NT13->t33, NT54->t12, etc. I might have confused myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived from the left-hand side symbols. Wait, no, because the string is the entire output, so each symbol is a terminal derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if each part of the string corresponds to a derivation from the grammar. Let's see.\n\nStarting with S, which can be either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Let's try the first option: NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, the first production is NT7 NT23. Let's see if we can derive t48 as the first symbol from NT7. Looking at the grammar rules, NT7 isn't directly a terminal, but wait: looking through the rules, I don't see NT7 being a terminal. Wait, NT76 would be? Wait, checking the rules again: NT76 is present as NT76->t48. Wait, actually, looking back:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT77->... but no, wait, looking through the list:\n\nLooking for something that produces 't48', hmm. Looking through the production rules, I see:\n\nLooking for NTx where x is 48. Let's check the rules again:\n\nI see:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nWait, and NT45->t99, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider that each symbol in the string must be a terminal that comes from some production.\n\nLooking at the string symbols: t48, t68, t96, t84, t19, t57, t48, t17, t13, t86.\n\nEach of these are terminals, so they must be the results of some NT productions. Let's see:\n\nt48: I don't see any NT directly producing t48. Wait, checking:\n\nWait, I think I see NT46->t37 and NT48->t96. So t48 isn't a terminal; maybe it's a typo. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the user's question again. Wait, the string is provided as `t48 t68 t96 t84 t19 t57 t48 t17 t13 t86`. Hmm. So it's all t followed by numbers except t84 and t86. Wait, no, the commas separate the symbols, and all of them are t followed by two digits. So t48, t68, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each terminal is represented as 'tXY', where XY is two digits. So let's see if there are NT rules that produce these t symbols.\n\nCheck each rule:\n\n- NT23->NT45 NT53\n- NT45->NT99 NT95\n- NT99->NT66 NT16\n- NT66->t51\nWait, so NT99 produces NT66 and NT16, and then NT66 converts to t51, and NT16 converts to t90, etc.\n\nWait, let me parse the string step by step, trying to see if it can be built.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm. But I'm not an expert, so maybe a better approach is to look for a path from S to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the longest possible matches in the grammar to match the string.\n\nBut another approach: Since the string is 10 symbols long, and each production in the grammar is two non-terminals, the total number of non-terminals in the derivation would have to be such that it can fit into 10 symbols.\n\nWait, but the initial symbols only generate two non-terminals at the top, but each of those can split into more non-terminals, but since each is a string of two symbols, it might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each symbol in the string corresponds to a production.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken down into pairs that correspond to the S->... options.\n\nLet's consider option 1: S->NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, the first part of the string would be derived from NT7 and then NT23. The string starts with t48, so NT7 must produce a t symbol, say t48. But looking for NTx that produce t48, but I don't see any such production. Wait, no, I think in the grammar, all terminals are 'tXY' but I don't see any NT directly producing t48. So maybe option 1 is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, option 2: S->NT97 NT54.\n\nThe string starts with t48, which would come from NT97 or NT54. Looking at NT97: NT97->t31. So if the first symbol is t48, that would not match NT97. What about NT54? NT54->t12. So if the first symbol is t48, which is not t12, that also doesn't match.\n\nWait, that's confusing because the string starts with t48, but neither NT97 nor NT54 directly produce t48. So is there a way for NT7 or NT23 to produce t48?\n\nBut looking at the rules: NT23 is expanded into several NT symbols. Let's see.\n\nWait, according to the rules:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\n\nNT66 -> t51\n\nNT16 -> t90\n\nSo, NT23 eventually leads to NT45 NT53, then NT99 NT16, and then t51 and t90.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-153","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t48 t66 t96 t41 t66 t33 t10 t66 t86 t13`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols (variables), and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. The grammar provided seems to be in CNF because each rule on the left has a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if a derivation exists that produces this exact sequence.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules provided. The start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So the first two symbols in any derivation must be NT7 and NT23. Looking at the string, it starts with t48, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. However, the NT symbols are non-terminals, and from the given string, it starts with t48. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no\u2014the first production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which would be two non-terminals. But the string starts with t48, which is a terminal. That suggests that perhaps the initial production isn't S, or maybe there's a way to derive t48 from NT7 or NT23.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the grammar rules again. I see that NT7 is a production that produces NT53. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT7 can produce NT53, which then produces NT40, which produces NT35, which leads to t40. But wait, the string starts with t48. Let me check if any of the NTs can produce t48. Looking through the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 NT53, which then \u2192 NT40 \u2192 t35, and I don't see a direct path where NT7 leads to t48. Alternatively, I see NT28 \u2192 t36, which is 36, but the second symbol in the string is t66.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think about the string and see if the terminals can be matched step by step via the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t48, t66, t96, t41, t66, t33, t10, t66, t86, t13.\n\nI need to figure out if each terminal can be generated by the rules starting from S. Starting with S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo the initial production would give us two non-terminals: NT7 and NT23. Each of these will need to eventually produce a terminal.\n\nLet's see what NT7 produces:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT53 \u2192 NT40 \u2192 t35. So NT7 can ultimately produce t35, but not t48.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a step. Let me check the productions for NT7:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, NT7 is only defined once: NT7 \u2192 NT53. Then NT53 \u2192 NT40, which \u2192 NT35 \u2192 t40. So the sequence is 7 \u2192 53 \u2192 40 \u2192 35 \u2192 40. Hmm, but 40 is t40, not t48.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me look for any NT that can produce t48. Scanning the rules:\n\nI see NT28 \u2192 t36, and NT7 \u2192 NT53. Let me see if any other NT can lead to t48.\n\nLooking for a rule where a non-terminal X produces t48. But from the grammar, I don't see any such rule. Hmm, this seems confusing because the first symbol in the string is t48, but the initial productions from S go to NT7 and NT23, which don't produce t48 directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production can be S \u2192 NT58 NT54, which has another path. Wait, no, the initial production given is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Wait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo I need to check both of these. Let me see.\n\nFirst, S can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Let me consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT53 \u2192 NT40 \u2192 t35. So the first symbol would be t35, but the string starts with t48. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any of the NTs can produce t48.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t57\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t96\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t62\n\n- NT53 \u2192 t85\n\n- etc.\n\nWait, but in the rules provided, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't48'. For example, looking at the end symbols:\n\nNT97 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12' in one rule and 't84' in another.\n\nWait, looking closer:\n\nNT84 \u2192 't23' (from rule NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86? Or is it another rule?)\n\nWait, let me list all the end symbols (rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal):\n\nNT97 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12' and 't84'\n\nWait, actually, let me check the rules provided:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't96' in two places.\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n\nWait, so NT48 produces 't96' in some cases. But we need to produce 't48', which is not directly a terminal in any rule. So that's a problem because the terminals given do not include 't48', unless I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, no, the string starts with 't48', but in the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't48'. So that would suggest that the string is impossible because the grammar doesn't have a production for 't48'. But the string is provided, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back: the first production S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Let's see what NT23 can produce.\n\nFrom the rules, NT23 has several productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT50\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT28 NT23 (Wait, that's a recursive production: NT23 \u2192 NT28 NT23. Hmm, not sure, but perhaps it can produce t66 if NT28 can.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should trace a possible derivation.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT7 NT23, let's see what happens when we expand these.\n\nFirst, NT7 \u2192 NT53, then NT53 \u2192 NT40, then NT40 \u2192 t40.\n\nWait, so the first symbol would be t40, but the string starts with t48, so that's a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is S \u2192 NT97 NT54, and let's see what that leads to.\n\nNT97 \u2192 't31'\n\nSo that would start with 't31', but the string starts with 't48', so that's not it either.\n\nWait, so this is confusing. The string starts with t48, but none of the non-terminals directly produce t48. Therefore, unless there's a chain where some NT leads to t48, it's impossible.

The given grammar seems to be in CNF because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) consist of either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals, each separated by spaces. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the production rules for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce two different combinations. The first option is NT7 followed by NT23, and the second is NT97 followed by NT54. Therefore, the string must be built by expanding one of these options step by step.\n\nLet me analyze both cases separately.\n\nCase 1: The first production, S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nThis would generate a string starting with the expansion of NT7 followed by NT23. Let's see what NT7 and NT23 expand into.\n\nLooking at NT7's production: NT7 \u2192 't71' (since NT7's production is listed as NT79 t71). Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar, I see that NT7 isn't directly, but let me check. Wait, the productions are a bit confusing because of the numbering. Wait, actually, the grammar is a list of rules, so some lines have 'NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16', etc. So I need to parse each line correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT7 is not directly a rule; instead, looking for NTxxxx \u2192 a terminal. Let's check each line:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 't71' (from NT79 \u2192 't71'? Wait, looking back, the grammar list has, for example, \"NT7 \u2192 't48'\". Wait, no, it's not exactly clear.

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a grammar in Chomsky normal form has production rules where each non-terminal on the left side expands into two non-terminals on the right. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to check if a string is generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S. The first two productions are:\n\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo, S branches into either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. The string starts with t48, which I notice is a terminal. Let's see which non-terminal can produce a t48.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT40 -> 't71', NT8 -> 't32', etc. Wait, in the NT rules, I can find where terminals are produced. For example:\n\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n- NT94 -> 't87'\n- NT46 -> 't37'\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n- NT48 -> 't86'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, actually, some non-terminals have two terminals, like NT48 can produce both 't96' and 't86'. So, the string has a mixture of these. Let's see how this could happen.\n\nThe string is: t48, t66, t96, t41, t36, t66, t96, t41, t36, t33, t85.\n\nHmm, let's try to parse this string step by step, building a parse tree.\n\nFirst, S can be NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Let's try each option.\n\nFirst option: Start with NT7 and NT23.\n\nLooking for 't48' in NT7's production. Wait, in the rules, is there a non-terminal that produces 't48'? Let me check. Actually, the rules don't have a NT7 -> 't48' directly, but maybe through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, I need to check if any non-terminal can derive to 't48'. Looking at the rules, I see NT48 appears in two places:\n\n- NT48 can produce 't96' (from NT48 -> NT96 NT41) but wait, that's not directly t96, that's the production of NT48 as a combination. Wait no, no, in the grammar, NT48 has rules like NT48 -> 't96' and NT48 -> 't86'. Wait, let me check the given grammar:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT48: \n\nI see lines like:\n\nNT48 -> NT96 NT41\nNT48 -> NT86 NT53\n\nWait, but then under NT48, do they have terminal productions? Wait, in the given grammar, the lines starting with NT48 look like:\n\nNT86 -> NT57 NT41\n\nWait no, actually, I think I misremembered. Let me reread the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through the rules, the NT48's production is not directly a terminal. Wait, perhaps I need to look again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT56: NT56 -> 't10' and NT94 -> 't87', etc. Let me list all NT's and their productions:\n\nStarting from NT99:\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\nNT90 -> NT84 NT8\nNT50 -> NT55 NT1\nNT8 -> NT40 NT96\nNT58 -> NT22 NT8\nNT98 -> NT40 NT90\nNT1 -> NT88 NT53\nNT50 -> NT59 NT46\nNT88 -> NT7 NT40\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT97 -> 't31'\nNT40 -> 't71'\nNT8 -> 't32'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT95 -> 't41'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nNT84 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't84'\nNT53 -> 't85'\nNT40 -> 't35'\nNT22 -> 't57'\nNT7 -> 't48'\nNT28 -> 't13'\nNT84 -> 't57'\nNT50 -> 't85'\nNT16 -> 't23'\n\nWait, so for NT48, the productions are:\n\nNT48 isn't a starting non-terminal, but let me see if any rules produce 't48'. Scanning through, I see NT7 -> 't48' (line NT7 -> 't48'). So NT7 can produce 't48'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other terminals in the string:\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't48', which can come directly from NT7.\n\nSo, the first step would be to expand S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nNow, the next step is to see what NT23 can do. From the grammar, NT23 has two productions:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\n\nWe need to see if any of these lead to the next tokens in the string, which are 't66', etc.\n\nWait, first, the string after 't48' is 't66'. So, the production must be that after NT7, which produces 't48', the next part comes from NT23. So, for NT23, we have to find a sequence that leads to 't66'.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions:\n\nNT23 can go to NT45 NT53 or NT13 NT50.\n\nLet me see the possible derivations:\n\nFirst, NT45 can produce NT99 NT95, which could lead to more non-terminals, but maybe that's not the path.\n\nAlternatively, NT13 can produce NT41 NT18, which would lead to 't68' (from NT41's production) or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let's try to build this step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse the process: start from the last symbols and see if they can be reduced to the start symbol.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start with the start symbol S -> NT7 NT23, produce 't48' from NT7, then see how NT23 can produce the next symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another path is possible. For instance, S could be expanded as S -> NT97 NT54 instead.\n\nLet me check: if S -> NT97 NT54, then NT97 can produce 't31' (from NT97 -> 't31'), and NT54 can produce 't12' (from NT54 -> 't12').\n\nBut the string starts with 't48', which doesn't match 't31' or 't12', so this branch is invalid. So the first path S -> NT7 NT23 is the way to go.\n\nSo, now, after 't48', the next symbol is 't66', which comes from NT23. So, we need NT23 to produce 't66'.\n\nWait, but looking at NT23's productions, do they have any terminals?

{"custom_id":"request-194","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and try to understand everything I need to do. \n\nFirst, the problem involves a context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form, and a string that needs to be checked against this grammar. The goal is to determine if the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, the grammar has a start symbol S, and it's presented with some production rules. Each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT97, NT59, etc.) can be rewritten into other symbols based on these rules. The terminals are the actual characters like 't48', 't68', etc.\n\nThe string to check is: `t48 t68 t96 t4 t35 t96 t86 t57 t48 t71 t66 t62`.\n\nMy task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals or terminals. However, I notice that some rules have a terminal as the result or perhaps a mix? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most rules have two non-terminals on the right side, except for some like NT54 -> 't93' and NT54 -> 't12'. So, these are productions that directly produce terminals. So, the grammar includes both non-terminals and terminals on the right-hand side, meaning that the language can generate strings with mixed symbols.\n\nWait, Chomsky normal form usually requires each production to be A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So yes, this grammar is indeed in CNF, with some terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. So, to check if the string is in the language, I can try to see if the symbols correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me list the string: \n\nt48, t68, t96, t4, t35, t96, t86, t57, t48, t71, t66, t62.\n\nI think the approach is to try to parse the string according to the grammar, starting from the start symbol S and expanding using the rules to see if we can derive the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, S expands to two non-terminals, each of which is a two-symbol combination. So, the first step is to see if the string can start with either NT7 or NT97 followed by NT23 or NT54.\n\nBut wait, the entire string is 12 symbols long. Since each production splits S into two non-terminals, maybe the parsing will involve multiple splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each split corresponds to a part of the string. So, the string is built by first splitting into two parts, each of which can be further split, etc., recursively.\n\nLet me think about this. The string has 12 symbols, so perhaps each level of the parse tree corresponds to splitting the string into parts, each of which is a non-terminal.\n\nSo, starting with the entire string, perhaps it can be divided into two parts: the first part derived from NT7 and the second from NT23, or the first from NT97 and the second from NT54.\n\nBut I need to check if the first part can derive to the first half of the string and the second part to the second half, or vice versa.\n\nLet me try to see what each NT expands to.\n\nLooking at the productions, each NT is a non-terminal that can produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nNT7 -> NT97 NT95\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar is:\n\nNT99 -> NT99 NT66 NT16 ... Hmm, wait, actually, the grammar provided is a bit unclear. Let me list all the productions properly.\n\nWait, the grammar is given in a list with some lines, probably each line is a production. Let me parse it:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\n- S -> NT7 NT23\n- S -> NT97 NT54\n- NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n- NT58 -> NT94 NT54\n- NT94 -> NT96 NT98\n- NT55 -> NT90 NT1\n- NT90 -> NT94 NT95\n- NT45 -> NT99 NT95\n- NT59 -> NT56 NT53\n- NT53 -> NT28 NT23\n- NT96 -> NT48 NT23\n- NT98 -> NT48 NT95\n- NT16 -> NT56 NT40\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT99 -> NT28 NT18\n- NT13 -> NT41 NT18\n- NT90 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT50 -> NT55 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT40 NT96\n- NT58 -> NT22 NT8\n- NT98 -> NT40 NT90\n- NT1 -> NT88 NT53\n- NT50 -> NT59 NT46\n- NT88 -> NT7 NT40\n- NT54 -> 't93' (and maybe also 't12'? Wait, looking back, I see under NT54: 't12')\nWait, in the given grammar, there are multiple entries for NT54:\n\nLooking again, it says:\n\nNT54 -> 't93'\nNT54 -> 't12'\n\nSo, NT54 can produce either 't93' or 't12'. That's interesting. So, NT54 is a terminal itself, producing either of those two terminals.\n\nSimilarly, I notice that NT23 has two productions:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nand\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\n\nSo, NT23 can produce two different combinations.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs have multiple productions.\n\nSo, going back to the string, which is 12 tokens long.\n\nFirst, the entire string can be split in several ways. Let's think recursively. The start symbol S can produce two NTs, so the first part of the string corresponds to one NT, and the second part corresponds to another NT.\n\nSince the string is S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then the string is the concatenation of NT1-derived string and NT2-derived string.\n\nSo, I need to check if the string can be split into two parts: the first part matches one of NT's productions, and the second part matches another.\n\nAlternatively, each NT might have multiple possible productions, so I have to check all possibilities.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this as a parsing problem, trying to see if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can model this using a recursive or iterative approach, but since this is time-consuming, maybe I can find a way to see if the sequence can be broken down into the rules.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt48 t68 t96 t4 t35 t96 t86 t57 t48 t71 t66 t62\n\nI can try to see what each part could correspond to.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into two parts, each of which is generated by an NT.\n\nLet me first look at the entire string as two parts, perhaps the first half and the second half.\n\nWait, but the string is 12 tokens, so maybe it's easier to think of it as two parts of 6 tokens each or 5 and 7, but perhaps it's more practical to see how the NTs can generate the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated by expanding S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54 and then each NT can further expand.\n\nBut this seems complex, so maybe it's better to look for the start of the string and see which NT it can be generated from.\n\nFor example, the first symbol is t48. So, looking at the productions, which NTs produce t48?\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT98 -> NT40 NT96\n- NT98 -> NT48 NT95\n- NT48 -> 't96' (Wait, no, looking back: the grammar for NT48 is 't96')\nWait, no, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT48:\n\nNT48 is present in some productions.\n\nWait, no, I need to check each NT's productions.\n\nLooking for t48 as the terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, which NTs have a production that includes 't48'?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT48 -> 't96'?

First, I should recall what context-free grammars are. They consist of a start symbol and production rules that expand non-terminal symbols into other symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. The grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is a non-terminal producing two terminals or two non-terminals. That should make parsing easier.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t48 t33 t10 t66 t33 t23 t71 t96 t62 t57 t57 t13`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some of these tokens are terminals, like 't31', 't71', etc., while others are non-terminals, such as NT99, NT58, etc. Each production rule will help break down how to reach the string.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string step by step. Since the grammar is Chomsky normal form, each step in the derivation should involve replacing a non-terminal with exactly two symbols.\n\nLet me list the string as tokens for clarity:\n1. t48\n2. t33\n3. t10\n4. t66\n5. t33\n6. t23\n7. t71\n8. t96\n9. t62\n10. t57\n11. t57\n12. t13\n\nI need to see if these tokens can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- S -> NT7 NT23 (This is one production)\n- S -> NT97 NT54 (Another production)\n\nI'll consider each S production and see which one can generate the string.\n\nFirst, let's try S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nNT7 is a non-terminal. According to the grammar, what are the productions for NT7? Looking through the rules, I see NT7 -> 't48'. So NT7 can be directly replaced by t48. That gives me the first token, t48.\n\nNow, looking at NT23, what's its production? It seems NT23 can produce 't62' from one of the rules. Also, it has another production I need to check.

{"custom_id":"request-214","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means every production rule is either a single non-terminal or a pair of non-terminals. The string to evaluate is `t48 t36 t96 t41 t36 t68 t96 t87 t41 t48 t17 t85 t57`.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grammar rules for clarity. The grammar has rules like S -> NT7 NT23, and then a bunch of other rules for the non-terminals (NT99, NT58, etc.) until some of them become terminals like 't93' or 't32'. The terminals are the words in the string.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminals. Each production rule in the grammar will eventually produce a terminal string. For the string to be generated, each part of the string must correspond to the right-hand side of some production rule.\n\nStarting from S, which is the start symbol, it can be replaced by NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So each S can split into two non-terminals. The string I have has 13 tokens, so I need to see if this can be broken down into sequences that each match the productions.\n\nLooking at the first token 't48'. Let's see which rules produce 't48'. Checking the rules, NT98 and NT46 produce NT48 and also have a 48. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\n- NT98 -> NT48 NT95\n- NT48 -> NT96 NT23\n- NT46 -> NT37 (no, that's a terminal)\nWait, no, in the rules, I see NT48 is derived from NT98 (like NT98 -> NT48 NT95) and also NT48 might produce another form. Let me check: I seeNT88 is replaced by NT7 NT40, and NT48 is replaced by NT96 NT23. Hmm, perhaps I need to trace where 't48' comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each step. Let's look for 't48'.\n\nLooking at the terminal rules:\n\n- NT98 -> 't86' and 't87'? No, wait. Wait, let me list all the terminal rules:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT97 -> 't31' (I see that line),\nNT40 -> 't71',\nNT8 -> 't32',\nNT56 -> 't10',\nNT95 -> 't41',\nNT28 -> 't36',\nNT8->'t19',\nNT41-> 't68',\nNT54-> 't12',\nNT46-> 't13',\nNT48-> 't96',\nNT94 -> 't87',\nNT23-> 't62',\nNT86 is a non-terminal,\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT86 is only in 't86's rule, but I don't see NT86 appearing in any production, so NT86 must be a terminal? Wait, no. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23-> 't62'\n- NT54 -> 't53'\n- NT84-> 't4' and also 't84'\n- NT58-> 't22' and 't8'\n\nWait, I might need to identify how each terminal is derived.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't48'. Let's see why 't48' would come into being.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT48 -> NT96 NT23 and also NT48 appears in NT86 production? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIn the provided grammar, there's NT48-> NT96 NT23. So that's one production for NT48. Then, where else? Do other rules lead to NT48?\n\nLooking again, I don't think NT48 appears as a left-hand side except for one rule. So the only way to get 't48' is through NT48-> 't96' 't23'? Wait, let me double-check. NT48's production is NT96 and NT23. So when NT48 is expanded, it becomes NT96 NT23.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after the first 't48', we have 't36'. So let's see how much NT48 contributes. 't48' is produced by NT48, which expands to NT96 and NT23. So to get 't48' 't36', that would be:\n\nNT48 replaces to NT96 NT23. Now, the first part is 't48', which is 't96' and 't23', but wait, 't48' is a single terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. NT48 is a non-terminal that can only produce a certain pair of non-terminals. But in the string, 't48' is a single terminal. That suggests that NT48 must be able to directly produce 't48', but looking at the production rules, I don't see any rule where NT48 is replaced by 't48'. Therefore, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each production:\n\nLet me list the rules again for clarity. Let me go through each production and see if any non-terminals directly produce a terminal token.\n\nLooking at the lists:\n\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT58 -> 't22' and 't8'?\nWait, NT58 is replaced by NT94 and NT54, right? So the only way NT58 can produce a terminal is if either of those rules produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all the non-terminals and see which ones produce terminals:\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n1.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. All right, so let's look at the provided grammar. It has several productions, and some of them directly map to terminals, like `NT54 -> 't12'` or `NT97 -> 't31'`. Others have two non-terminals on the right side, which suggests that during parsing, these non-terminals will be expanded until we reach the terminal tokens.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminal symbols, so I need to see if the grammar can derive this string by expanding non-terminals according to the rules.\n\nLet me list out the string to visualize it better: `t48, t68, t96, t4, t32, t57, t48, t35, t36, t68, t96, t10, t85, t13`. That's 14 terms. So the derivation must start with the start symbol S and expand through a series of steps, each time replacing a non-terminal with its production until only terminals remain, forming the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo the first step would be to choose one of these two. Let's see which might fit.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t48`. Let me see if either of the S productions can lead to `t48`.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT7 and NT23:\n\n- NT7 -> NT56 NT40\n- NT23 has several productions, such as NT23 -> NT45 NT53, NT23 -> NT13 NT50, NT23 -> NT45 NT53, and also directly NT23 -> 't62', 't48', 't86', etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT23's productions:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT96 -> NT48 NT23\nNT23 -> NT84 -> t57\nWait, no, let me check the exact productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT23 -> NT45 NT53, also NT23 -> NT13 NT50, NT23 -> NT45 NT53, and also NT23 -> NT45 NT53, and other possibilities.

Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT23 -> something terminal.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- No direct production for NT23 except for:\n\nWait, let me list all NT23 productions:\n\nNT23: \n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53 (repeated)\n- NT23 -> NT96 -> NT48 NT23 (Wait, no, that's NT96, not NT23)\nWait, perhaps I misread.\n\nLooking back, the grammar for the non-terminals:\n\nWait, the given grammar lines are like:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\n\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\n\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\n\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\n\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\n\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\n\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\n\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\n\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\n\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\n\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nNT40 -> NT17\n\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\n\nWait, I see: looking for any NT23 that produce terminals.\n\nWait, I think I might have overlooked some productions. Let me check:\n\nWait, the line says:\n\n\"NT84 -> NT58 NT86\"\n\nSo NT84 leads to two non-terminals. But perhaps another line: \"NT96-> NT48 NT23\", which is N96, not N23.\n\nWait, perhaps NT53 can produce NT23, as in NT53->NT28 NT23, but that's non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, let me check each NT23 production:\n\n1. NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n2. NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n3. NT23 -> NT96-> something. Oh no, that's NT96 -> NT48 NT23, which is a production for N96, not N23.\nWait, perhaps NT23 can't directly produce a terminal symbol from the given rules. So the only way to get t48 is through other productions. Let me check other NTs that may have t48 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT48 has:\n\n- NT48 -> NT96 NT23\n- NT48 -> NT86\n\nWait, so NT48 can produce the terminal t86, but looking at t48, perhaps I'm looking for NT48 producing t96 and NT23.\n\nWait no, in the productions, NT96->NT48 NT23, which is a production for NT96. So t96 is followed by t48 and t23.\n\nWait, but in the string, the third element is t96, followed by t4, which is not present. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer than expected.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this constructively: let's try to build the string from the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t48 t68 t96 t4 t32 t57 t48 t35 t36 t68 t96 t10 t85 t13.\n\nLet's count the symbols: 14 symbols. So the derivation must be such that the start symbol S is expanded through 14 steps, each step producing one symbol.\n\nWait, in a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so each step increases the length of the string by one. Starting from S, which is one symbol, each step adds one, so to get a string of length 14, we need 13 steps, ending with 14 symbols.\n\nWait, wait, let me think. If we start with a single non-terminal, each production step replaces one non-terminal with two, so after k steps, the number of symbols is 1 + k.\n\nSo to get 14 symbols, we need k=13 steps.\n\nSo the total number of symbols is 14, and the number of steps needed is 13. So that's manageable.\n\nBut trying to see if the string can be generated this way might require some parsing approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can see if each symbol in the string can be matched to the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: t48. Which non-terminals can produce t48?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT56 -> 't10' (wait, wait, no, the productions are like NT56 -> 't10' and others. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT48 -> NT96 NT23: Wait, no, NT48's production is NT96 and NT23.\n\nWait, looking at each NT's productions and terminals:\n\n- NT7: not relevant here.\n\n- S can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, let me build a list of NTs that can produce each terminal:\n\n- t48: produced by NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and from the rules, I can see that S can produce two NT rules: NT99 NT72 or NT97 NT54. But wait, looking at the rules more carefully, I see S -> NT7 NT23. Wait, that's a typo in my initial thought. No, looking back, the grammar seems to have some inconsistencies.

Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will involve splitting the non-terminals into two parts at each step until all are terminals.\n\nStarting with S. The first production for S is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Let's see what NT7 and NT23 are. Wait, in the grammar, looking at the non-terminals, it seems like NT7 and NT23 are not present.

Now, looking back, the two main initial productions for S are NT7 NT23 and NT97 NT54. But in the list of non-terminals (NT99, NT58, etc.), I don't see NT7 or NT23 as head symbols. So perhaps S directly can produce these.\n\nWait, looking through, the NT production list starts with NT99, so maybe S can only produce those combinations. Wait, but according to the initial rules, S has two productions: S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. But in the grammar, the non-terminals like NT7 and NT23 are not present in the production rules. Wait, perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, the first line was \"Grammar: S -> NT7 NT23 S -> NT99 NT54 ...\" So S has two productions: S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and S \u2192 NT99 NT54. But looking through the rest of the rules, the non-terminals are all NT numbers like NT99, NT58, etc., but I don't see NT7 or NT23 as head symbols. That seems odd because in CNF, the only way to have a non-terminal symbol is if it's on the left-hand side of a production. So if S can produce NT7 NT23, then NT7 and NT23 must be non-terminals in the grammar. But in the given grammar, I don't see any rules for NT7 or NT23 except in the production S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which is supposed to be allowed, but that's a terminal and non-terminals combination.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a typo. Let me check again. The first line says:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT99 NT54\n\nBut then, looking through the NT rules, I don't see any production for NT7 or NT23. The next line in the NT rules is:\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\n... and so on.\n\nSo this is confusing. It seems like S can produce NT7 NT23, but these NT7 and NT23 are not defined anywhere else. So this would mean that NT7 and NT23 are considered non-terminals, but they don't have any further productions, meaning each of them results in a terminal.\n\nLooking at the list of NT rules, none of them produce NT7 or NT23, so perhaps NT7, NT23 are undefined or perhaps they each produce some terminal symbols. Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, all symbols except the terminals must have productions. So if S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then NT7 and NT23 must be non-terminals (since S is a non-terminal, and the productions must consist of non-terminals and terminals). But if NT7 and NT23 don't produce any terminals, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but looking further down, maybe NT7 and NT23 somehow produce terminals? Let me look for them.\n\nWait, towards the end of the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't62'\nNT46 \u2192 't13'\nNT48 \u2192 't96'\n... etc.\n\nWait, maybe I skipped some rules.

{"custom_id":"request-249","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a specific way of structuring CFGs where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string I'm given is: t48 t36 t96 t41 t36 t33 t87 t41 t48 t35 t36 t86 t48 t35 t85.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. From the production rules provided, I see that the start symbol is S, which initially produces NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54. Each of these non-terminals then further breaks down into other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string step by step, following the derivations in the grammar.\n\nLet's break down the string into tokens: [t48, t36, t96, t41, t36, t33, t87, t41, t48, t35, t36, t86, t48, t35, t85].\n\nI'll start by trying to match the string against the possible derivations from S.\n\n1. Starting with S:\n   S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\n   Let's consider both options.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT7 NT23\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT16. Let's see if this makes sense.\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT51. Wait, NT51 isn't a production in the given rules. Looking back, I see NT66-> 't51' is in the options provided. So I think I misread earlier.\n\nWait, the production rules include:\n\nNT66 \u2192 t51\n\nYes, so NT66 is a production that ends with t51. Similarly, NT51 must be a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal? Wait, in CNF, all productions have two non-terminals on the left, except for the terminal strings.\n\nLooking at the production rules, each rule on the left side is a non-terminal and the right side is either two non-terminals joined by an arrow or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, all productions are in CNF, meaning each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, any rule that ends with a terminal like 't51' is a terminal production.\n\nSo, let's go back.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n\nNT66 \u2192 t51 (so the token is t51). But in the string, after t48, the next token is t36, which is different. So perhaps this path is not correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I misassigned the non-terminals. Let me check all the possible derivations more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, let's try the other option from S: S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nNT97 \u2192 t31 (from the production NT97 \u2192 't31' which is a terminal production).\n\nSo, the first token in the string is t48, which doesn't match t31. Therefore, the path S \u2192 NT97 NT54 doesn't lead to the first token being t48. So I think Option 2 is incorrect.\n\nThat leaves Option 1 as the starting point, but earlier when I tried nt7, the first token would be t51, which isn't the case. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, let me list the production rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, starting with S, we need to produce a string that can begin with t48.\n\nBut in S's productions, the first step is choosing between producing NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Neither of these start with a terminal directly; they produce non-terminals which then can split further.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to see how the initial t48 can be generated.\n\nLooking back at the productions, let's see which production rules produce 't48'.\n\nSearching through the production rules, I find NT84 \u2192 't48', NT54 \u2192 't12', NT56 \u2192 't10', NT48 \u2192 't96', NT23 \u2192 't62', etc. So, where else?

{"custom_id":"request-269","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces: `t48 t68 t96 t4 t32 t48 t17 t66 t51 t23 t41 t66 t62 t48 t71 t85`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That makes the parsing easier because each step reduces the number of symbols by one, and the length of derivations is directly related to the string length.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it consists of multiple production rules. The top-level rules are S \u2192 NT7 NT23, S \u2192 NT97 NT54, and so on. Each non-terminal (like S, NT7, NT97, etc.) seems to expand into two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string starts with t48, t68, etc., which are terminals, so these must correspond to terminal symbols in the grammar. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI'll start by trying to find paths from the start symbols (S) to the string. Let's see:\n\n1. S can expand into NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: Starting with S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, the first two symbols should be the terminals derived from NT7 and NT23.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7 is a non-terminal. What does NT7 produce? From the grammar, I see:\n\nNT40 -> 't71'\nNT8 -> 't32'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT95 -> 't41'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nOthers like NT7 don't seem to have production rules; instead, NT40 is one of them with a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, I might have misread. Let's check NT7: from the top, I see NT7 -> 't48'. Yes, so NT7 leads directly to 't48'. Good, the first token is 't48', which matches NT7 \u2192 't48'.\n\nNow, after NT7 produces 't48', the next non-terminal is NT23. Looking at the grammar for NT23: multiple rules, such as NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50, etc. Also, I notice that some NT23 have a direct terminal: for example, NT23 \u2192 't62' via another rule. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, under NT23, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53,\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50,\nNT23 \u2192 't62'.\n\nYes, so one option for NT23 is to produce 't62'. The second token in the string is 't68', so that doesn't match 't62'.\n\nTherefore, the NT23 must have expanded into more non-terminals. Let's choose one of the rules. Perhaps, NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53.\n\nSo, NT45 and NT53 would now be the next non-terminals to expand.\n\nLooking at NT45: the grammar has NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95.\n\nThus, NT45 expands into NT99 and NT95.\n\nSimilarly, NT99 has production rules: for example, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16 and others, including NT99 \u2192 't85'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT99 has rules like:\n\nNT99 -> NT99? Wait, no, I think I'm misremembering. Let me look again. Oh, right, the grammar has:\n\nNT99 -> NT99 is not present. Let's see: looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16,\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18,\nNT99 -> NT90 NT95.\n\nAnd also, NT99 has a rule: NT99 \u2192 't85'?\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under NT99, I have:\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16,\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18,\nNT99 -> NT90 NT95,\nand NT99 \u2192 't85'?\n\nWait, looking back, in the initial grammar statement, I see:\n\n\"NT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\nNT90 -> NT84 NT8\nNT50 -> NT55 NT1\nNT8 -> NT40 NT96\nNT58 -> NT22 NT8\nNT98 -> NT40 NT90\nNT1 -> NT88 NT53\nNT50 -> NT59 NT46\nNT88 -> NT7 NT40\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT97 -> 't31'\nNT40 -> 't71'\nNT8 -> 't32'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT95 -> 't41'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nNT8 -> 't19'\nNT41 -> 't68'\nNT54 -> 't12' (again, same as before)\nNT46 -> 't13'\nNT48 -> 't96'\nNT94 -> 't87'\nNT46 -> 't37'\nNT23 -> 't62'\nNT48 -> 't86'\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT97 -> 't54'\nNT1 -> 't57'\nNT18 -> 't96'\nNT16 -> 't90'\nNT28 -> 't66'\nNT40 -> 't17'\nNT84 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't84'\nNT56 -> 't99'\nNT66 -> 't51'\nNT54 -> 't53'\nNT23 -> 't86'\n...\" and others.\n\nWait, I see that in the NT99 rules, the fourth option is NT99 \u2192 't85' (from \"NT99 -> NT95\"? No, wait, looking again, under NT99, the first rule is \"NT99 -> NT66 NT16\", the second is \"NT99-> NT28 NT18\", third is \"NT99-> NT90 NT95\", and the fourth is \"NT99-> 't85'\". So yes, NT99 can produce 't85'.\n\nBut in our current expansion, after NT45 (which is NT99 NT95), the first part is NT99, so it can expand into 't85', 't87', or other terminals. Wait, looking at NT99's rules:\n\nNT99 can produce 't85' as a terminal, for example in the rule \"NT99 \u2192 't85'\". Yes, under the grammar, there's a rule: NT99 \u2192 't85'. So that would mean NT99 can produce 't85' directly.\n\nGoing back, our current expansion is:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23 \u2192 't48' and then NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 \u2192 NT99 NT95.\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't48' (good), and the second is NT23, which expanded into NT45 NT53.\n\nNow, NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95.\n\nSo, the non-terminals are NT99 and NT95.\n\nNT99 can expand into 't85', 't87', etc., depending on the rules. Let's see:\n\nIn our case, we have the string starting with 't48 t68 t96 t4 ...', so after 't48', the next is 't68', not 't85' or 't87'.

{"custom_id":"request-270","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break down the steps I need to take to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. CNF has productions where each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal, and the start symbol can't be on the right side. Looking at the given grammar, all productions do fit this structure except maybe some. For example, S -> NT7 NT23, which is fine because it's two non-terminals. Some NTs lead into terminals, like NT54 -> 't12', so that's okay too. \n\nNow, the string I need to check is `t48 t33 t23 t35 t96 t33 t85 t48 t71 t36 t13 t96 t41 t66 t86 t57`. I notice it's a sequence of tokens, each starting with 't', so these must correspond to terminals in the grammar. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nTo tackle this, I think using the CYK algorithm might be the way to go, but since the grammar is provided, maybe I can find a more manual approach, especially since the string isn't too long.\n\nLet me list the string for clarity: t48, t33, t23, t35, t96, t33, t85, t48, t71, t36, t13, t96, t41, t66, t86, t57.\n\nI'll start by identifying which terminals can be produced by each non-terminal. For instance, NT54 -> 't12', NT97 -> 't31', and so on. Each of these gives a single terminal symbol.\n\nNext, I should look for possible ways the string can be split into parts that match the grammar productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production's right-hand side can consist of two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. This means that in the parsing process, each step appends two symbols or reduces two symbols.\n\nWait, actually, in a parse tree for CNF, each node has exactly two children. So the depth of the parse tree corresponds to the maximum number of symbols in the string when considering the number of steps needed to derive it.\n\nGiven that, the string has 16 tokens. Hmm, but in CNF, the maximum number of symbols in any intermediate string when deriving is two. But with multiple steps, perhaps the number of symbols can grow exponentially. However, I might need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can build the parse table or try to find a way to break down the string into a sequence of productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll try to see if any of the terminals appear in the productions as left-hand sides (LHS), and see how they can be combined.\n\nFor example, looking at the beginning: 't48' 't33' 't23'. Let me check if any of these are part of any productions as LHS.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT99 -> 't51'\n- NT53 -> 't51'?

Oh wait, NT84 has 't4' and 't84', and NT57: Wait, the 't48' is in NT84: NT84 -> 't4' (but I see NT84 -> 't84' in some cases). Wait, let me confirm.\n\nLooking back:\n\nLine 14: NT18 -> 't96'\n\nLine 21: NT50 -> 't85'\n\nLine 8: NT56 -> 't10'\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each NT and its production rules to see which produce which terminals.\n\nLet me make a list.\n\nNon-terminals (NTs) and their productions:\n\n1.

The string is `t48 t51 t90 t41 t66 t68 t96 t87 t41 t48 t35 t66 t62 t48 t17 t13 t86`. Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all the rules on the left side start with a single non-terminal, and the right side has either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions from S are NT99 and NT59. Wait, actually, S \u2192 NT7NT23? Wait, let me check again. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT23 and S \u2192 NT58 NT54. Oh, wait, no, looking again, it's S \u2192 NT99 NT23 and S \u2192 NT58 NT54. No, wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because S can't directly produce all those NTs. Wait, maybe I'm misreading it. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, actually, I see S \u2192 NT99 NT23 and S \u2192 NT58 NT54. So S can produce either NT99 NT23 or NT58 NT54. Then, each of these NTs have their own productions. For example, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, and so on. It looks like each non-terminal branches into more non-terminals until we get to the terminals, which are represented by strings like 't48', 't51', etc.\n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of terminals: t48, t51, t90, t41, t66, t68, t96, t87, t41, t48, t35, t66, t62, t48, t17, t13, t86. That's 17 terms. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So when we parse the string, each step either consumes a terminal or two non-terminals that together produce the terminal. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to see if we can parse the string step by step by breaking it down using the grammar rules. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t48. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT48 \u2192 t96. So how does t48 come into play? Wait, no, let me check the grammar rules. Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see any non-terminals directly producing 't48'. Wait, actually, looking through the list, I see NT48 appears on the right side of rules. Let me see:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 t48 NT23\n- NT86 \u2192 t25 NT50\n- NT40 \u2192 t32\n- NT56 \u2192 t10\n- NT95 \u2192 t41\n- NT28 \u2192 t36\n- NT8 \u2192 t19\n- NT41 \u2192 t68\n- NT54 \u2192 t12\n- NT46 \u2192 t13\n- NT48 \u2192 t96\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each production to see which ones end with terminals, which will be the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nFor example, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, so it's a production to two non-terminals. Another example: NT50 \u2192 NT59 NT46, which is two non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, the ones that end with 'a' (terminals) are rules like:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t62\n- NT48 \u2192 t96\n- NT13 \u2192 t33\n- NT7 \u2192 t48\n- NT40 \u2192 t71\n- NT8 \u2192 t32\n- NT8 \u2192 t19\n- NT41 \u2192 t68\n- NT54 \u2192 t53\nWait, no, let me look again. Let me list all terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are strings like 't48', 't51', etc. So the non-terminals must end up being replaced by these.\n\nWait, I see that in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t48\nNT23 \u2192 t62\nNT48 \u2192 t96 (but wait, NT48 is a non-terminal, but in some productions it's on the right side. Wait, no, actually NT48 is a non-terminal, and in some rules it's the left side. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree should be a binary tree where each leaf is a terminal generated by a non-terminal, and each internal node is a rule with two children until it reaches terminals.\n\nSo, to check if the string is generated, I can try to decompose it into the sequence of non-terminals and terminals, ensuring that each step follows the grammar.\n\nStarting with the full string: t48 t51 t90 t41 t66 t68 t96 t87 t41 t48 t35 t66 t62 t48 t17 t13 t86.\n\nThe first token is t48. Looking at the grammar, when does a NT produce t48 as a terminal? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the list, I don't immediately see any NT rule that produces 't48' as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I missed it.

Wait, but the grammar's non-terminals produce 't' followed by numbers, except for some of them like NT53->NT28 and NT16->NT56 etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: each production is a NT -> two NTs, except for the terminal productions. So, any production that ends with a terminal symbol is a rule for that NT. For example, NT8-> 't32' is a terminal, as NT23->'t68' is another.\n\nTherefore, to produce the string, each element needs to be derived either directly from a terminal or via production steps.\n\nSo, let's try to parse the string backward, from the end.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt48 t68 t96 t4 t32 t48 t17 t36 t62 t48 t17 t66 t66 t96 t41 t36 t86.\n\nWait, that's 18 tokens.

Each of those can produce more NTs until we get to terminals.\n\nWait, but to produce the string, each 't' must come from a terminal production, so let's check if the given string can be broken into parts that correspond to the NTs that produce 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the longest possible match at each step.

Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals (or a terminal in the case of the CNF, but looking here, it seems the grammar is strictly CNF with two non-terminals on the RHS because all productions are like S -> NTa NTb, and the others are similar). Wait, no, looking closely, some productions have a terminal immediately, like `NT54 -> 't93'`. So maybe this is almost CNF but a mix\u2014does that still count as CNF? Or perhaps the user made a mistake, but the question assumes it's CNF, so perhaps we can treat it as such, where a production can derive either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut regardless, the problem is to check if the string is generated by this grammar. Since all the productions have two non-terminals, except for the ones that go directly to terminals, the approach is to parse the string according to the grammar.\n\nI think the best way is to perform a recursive descent parsing or use a parsing table, but since the string is pretty long, maybe we can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the starting symbol is S, which in CNF can only have two non-terminals. So S must expand into two non-terminals, say A and B, such that A \u2192 some part and B \u2192 some part, and together they form the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first production for S is `S -> NT7 NT23`. Let's see what NT7 and NT23 expand to. Wait, NT's are non-terminals, right?\n\nWait, in the grammar, all the NT's are non-terminals, and each has their own productions. Let's look at NT7. Hmm, I don't see a production for NT7 in the given grammar. Wait, the user provided the grammar, so I should check if NT7 is a terminal or if it's defined. Looking through the grammar, I see each NT has a definition:\n\nLooking at the grammar list:\n\nNT54 -> 't93'\nNT97 -> 't31'\nNT40 -> 't71'\nNT8 -> 't32'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT95 -> 't41'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nNT8 -> 't19'\nNT41 -> 't68'\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT46 -> 't13'\nNT48 -> 't96'\nNT94 -> 't87'\nNT46 -> 't37'\nNT23 -> 't62'\nNT48 -> 't86'\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT97 -> 't54'\nNT1 -> 't57'\nNT18 -> 't96'\nNT16 -> 't90'\nNT28 -> 't66'\nNT40 -> 't17'\nNT84 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't84'\nNT56 -> 't99'\nNT66 -> 't51'\nNT54 -> 't53'\nNT23 -> 't86'\nNT84 -> 't23'\nNT53 -> 't85'\nNT40 -> 't35'\nNT22 -> 't57'\nNT7 -> 't48'  [Ah, so NT7 expands directly to 't48']\nNT28 -> 't13'\nNT84 -> 't57'\nNT86 -> 't25'\nNT50 -> 't85'\nNT16 -> 't23'\n\nSo, NT7 is 't48'. Now, what about NT23? Let's check. NT23 has multiple productions:\n- `NT23 -> NT45 NT53`\n- `NT23 -> NT13 NT50`\n- `NT23 -> NT45 NT53`\n- `NT23 -> NT84 NT23` \u2014 wait, that's a recursive production.\n\nSo, S can go to NT7 (t48) and NT23. So the string starts with t48 followed by NT23's expansion. Let's see what's next.\n\nThe string is: t48 t68 t96 t84 t71 t96 t51 t99 t17 t41 t36 t51 t10 t35 t41 t85 t57 t57.\n\nSo after t48, the next symbols are t68, t96, etc., which must come from NT23's expansion.\n\nSo let's focus on expanding NT23. The possible productions are:\n\n1. NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n2. NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n3. NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 (same as first)\n4. NT23 \u2192 NT84 NT23\n\nLet's see what these expand into.\n\nFirst, NT45: looking in the grammar, NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT66 NT18.\nNT66 \u2192 't51'.\nNT18 \u2192 't96'.\n\nSo NT45 expands to NT99 NT95, which is NT66 NT18 NT95 \u2192 t51 t96 NT95.\n\nBut NT95 has a production: NT95 \u2192 't41'. So full expansion of NT45: t51 t96 t41.\n\nNext, NT53: in grammar, NT53 \u2192 NT85.\n\nNT85 \u2192 't85'.\n\nSo NT53 \u2192 NT85 \u2192 t85.\n\nSo production 1: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 \u2192 (t51 t96 t41) (t85) \u2192 t51 t96 t41 t85.\n\nSo the expansion would be t51 t96 t41 t85.\n\nNow, the next part of the string after t48 is t68 t96 t84 t71 t96 t51 t99 t17 t41 t36 t51 t10 t35 t41 t85 t57 t57.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me reorganize.\n\nThe string is: [t48, t68, t96, t84, t71, t96, t51, t99, t17, t41, t36, t51, t10, t35, t41, t85, t57, t57]\n\nAfter the initial t48 (from NT7), the next part comes from NT23's expansion. So the expansion should match the rest of the string starting from t68.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me try to break down the string.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which is t48 NT23.\n\nSo the first word is t48, which matches.\n\nThen NT23 must expand into the rest of the string: t68 t96 ... up to the end.\n\nWait, the string is t48 followed by 16 more tokens, so 17 in total. But S \u2192 NT7 NT23, so the expansion would be the concatenation of NT7's expansion and NT23's expansion. Here, NT7 is 't48', so the string must start with t48 followed by what NT23 expands to.\n\nBut wait, the entire string is t48 t68 t96 t84 t71 t96 t51 t99 t17 t41 t36 t51 t10 t35 t41 t85 t57 t57. So that's 17 tokens, which aligns with S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which is two non-terminals, each expanding to sequences that may contain multiple tokens.\n\nSo the first part is t48, then the rest is what NT23 expands to.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because t48 is already the start, then the next part would be from NT23. But perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list the string again:\n\n1. t48\n2. t68\n3. t96\n4. t84\n5. t71\n6. t96\n7. t51\n8. t99\n9. t17\n10. t4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-315","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of production rules starting from the start symbol S. I notice that the grammar has non-terminals like S, NT97, NT58, etc., and terminals like 't48', 't68', etc. Each production either replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t48 t68 t96 t99 t13 t51 t23 t41 t13 t33 t10 t66 t13 t96 t41 t85 t37 t13.\n\nThis string is a sequence of terminal symbols, which suggests that the grammar should be able to derive this sequence by expanding the start symbol S and eventually reducing it to a sequence of these terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the derivation will consist of leftmost replacements, and each step will replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe key here is to check if this string can be formed by starting from S and applying the productions correctly until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nFirst step: Analyze the structure of the string. The string has 17 symbols, so the parse tree should have a height that would result in exactly 17 symbols. Since each non-terminal in the grammar expands into exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in CNF, it's either two non-terminals or a terminal). Wait, no, in CNF, the productions are A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each non-terminal can produce either a terminal or two non-terminals. So each non-terminal expansion contributes either one terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nBut in terms of the derivation length, each step increases the number of symbols. Starting from S, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. But sometimes, those two symbols can be terminals. So, the string length would be 2^k - 1 where k is the number of steps. However, 2^k - 1 must equal 17. Let's see: 2^5 -1=31, 2^4 -1=15, so 17 is between 15 and 31, which suggests that the string might not be possible because the number of symbols can only be of the form 2^k -1.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Let me calculate: for example, a string of length 17 would require k where 2^k -1 =17 \u2192 2^k=18 \u2192 but 18 is not a power of 2. Therefore, if this string has 17 symbols, it's impossible because each step adds one more symbol, so the number of symbols must be one less than a power of 2.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let\u2019s see how derivations work:\n\nThe initial symbol is S.\n\n- After 1 production: S \u2192 NT58 NT86 \u2192 2 symbols (if both are non-terminals, but in this case, NT86 is 't86', so it's a terminal. So the number of non-terminals and terminals after each step depends on which productions are used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each production can lead to an expansion that either adds one more symbol or splits into two. But to find the exact number of steps, perhaps it's better to use the fact that the number of symbols in the derived string must be 2^k -1. Since the string has 17 symbols, which is 17=16+1, but 16=2^4, so 2^5 -1=31. So 17 isn't a number of the form 2^k -1. Therefore, it's impossible for such a string to be derived because the grammar can only generate strings with lengths that are one less than a power of two (i.e., 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, etc.).\n\nWait, wait. Let me check:\n\nStarting from S, it's 1 symbol.\n\nEach production step can expand a non-terminal into two symbols, but the total number of symbols increases by 1 each time a non-terminal is replaced with two symbols because it was 1 and becomes 2, so the total increases by 1.\n\nSo, for example, the first step: starting with 1 symbol, replace it with 2, so length becomes 2. Then, if you replace both non-terminals, you get 4, etc. Alternatively, you can replace one non-terminal each time, so the number of symbols increases one by one each time you replace a single non-terminal.\n\nSo, the length can be any number that's possible through this process. However, in a CFG, the number of symbols in the derived string must be of the form 2^k -1, but that's only if every replacement step is replacing a single non-terminal until all are terminals. But in this case, the string length is 17, which doesn't fit 2^k -1 because 2^5 -1=31, which is way larger. So, perhaps 17 is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's try a different approach: count the number of productions needed to derive a string of length n. Each production increases the number of symbols by 1. So starting from 1 (S), to reach 17, we need 16 productions, because each production adds 1 symbol each time. So, 17 symbols after 16 steps.\n\nBut in a CFG, each step can expand one non-terminal into two symbols, potentially. So it's possible to get strings of any length that is at least the number of symbols in the start symbol. Wait, but in this case, the start symbol S is a single symbol. So the minimum number of steps is 1, leading to 2 symbols. Then perhaps more.\n\nBut perhaps the key point is that in the given grammar, each non-terminal is either expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal. So the parse tree could have varying depths, but the challenge is whether 17 symbols can be formed.\n\nWait, another way: the string has 17 symbols. Each symbol must be derived from a terminal production, meaning that each of the 17 symbols must be the result of replacing a non-terminal with a terminal, which requires that each of these non-terminals in the parse tree eventually results in one terminal.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which comes from a non-terminal that has been fully expanded.\n\nNow, to check if this string is possible, we might need to see if each terminal can be derived correctly from their respective non-terminals.\n\nLooking at each symbol in the string and checking their productions.\n\nLet me list each symbol in the string with their positions:\n\n1. t48\n2. t68\n3. t96\n4. t99\n5. t13\n6. t51\n7. t23\n8. t41\n9. t13\n10. t33\n11. t10\n12. t66\n13. t13\n14. t96\n15. t41\n16. t85\n17. t37\n18. t13 (Wait, counting again, the user's string is 17 symbols long, so my count up to 17 is correct.)\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt48, t68, t96, t99, t13, t51, t23, t41, t13, t33, t10, t66, t13, t96, t41, t85, t37, t13.\n\nWait, that's actually 18 symbols. Wait, let me recount the user's string:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nt48 t68 t96 t99 t13 t51 t23 t41 t13 t33 t10 t66 t13 t96 t41 t85 t37 t13.\n\nYes, that's 18 symbols. So 18 is 2^something? 2^5=32, 32-1=31, which is more than 18. 2^4=16, 16-1=15, which is less than 18. So 18-1=17, which isn't a power of 2. Therefore, as per earlier logic, such a string length can't be generated by the grammar because each step adds 1, starting at 1, leading to lengths like 2,3,4,5,6, etc., but not necessarily only 2^k -1.\n\nWait, but wait, that's not necessarily the case. Because you can have different numbers of symbols depending on which productions you use.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which simplifies things a bit because each production is either A -> BC or A -> a. \n\nThe string to check is: `t48 t33 t99 t36 t33 t4 t35 t86 t62 t48 t71 t36 t51 t90 t41 t66 t62 t57 t37`.\n\nFirst, I should probably parse the string into tokens since each production seems to produce symbols (like 't48') or non-terminals (like NT...). The grammar has rules for each non-terminal, so I'll need to see how the string can be reduced step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't48', which I need to see if any production directly produces 't48'. Looking through the grammar, I find `NT56 -> 't10'`, `NT54 -> 't12'`, `NT46 -> 't37'`, and `NT48 -> 't96'`. So 't48' doesn't directly correspond to any of these NT productions. Hmm, wait, wait, I see `NT48 -> 't96'` but that's for NT48, so maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, maybe the string is a sequence of symbols derived from the grammar's productions. So I should build a parse tree starting from S, using the grammar rules to see if I can reach the string.\n\nLet's start by looking at the start symbol S. The grammar has two productions for S:\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo the first step is to choose one of these. Let's pick S -> NT7 NT23 for the first step. Then, I need to see if NT7 and NT23 can produce the corresponding tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at NT7, in the grammar, it's not present directly. Wait, looking through the list, there's `NT28 -> 't36'`, but NT7 is not listed as a terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, wait, perhaps the NT7 is part of NT96 -> 't96', but that doesn't directly correspond. Alternatively, maybe NT23 has production rules that can produce the symbols. Wait, NT23 has `NT23 -> NT45 NT53` and so on. Let me try to see if I can break it down further.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to match the string step by step. Let's see, the string starts with t48, so maybe I need to find a path where some NT rule produces t48. Looking through the NTs, I see `NT48 -> 't96'` so that's out. `NT46 -> 't37'`, which is another option. `NT56 -> 't10'`. Hmm, none of these directly produce t48. So perhaps the string isn't directly generated by a single NT rule. Maybe t48 comes from a non-terminal that's part of a production rule.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any of the non-terminals produce t48. Looking for `NTx -> 't48'`, but I don't see that in the grammar. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the list again. Oh, looking at `NT84 -> 't4'` and `NT84 -> 't84'`. So t84 can come from NT84. But how does that relate to t48?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to see if the entire string can be reduced by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to use a recursive descent parser or simulate the parsing process. Given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be constructed by combining the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for the start symbol S and see what tokens it can produce. For example, S can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Each of these are non-terminals that need to be replaced.\n\nLet's take S -> NT97 NT54. Then NT97 produces 't31' according to `NT97 -> 't31'` and NT54 produces 't12' or possibly other symbols, but let's check. Wait, `NT54 -> 't12'` and also `NT23 -> 't62'` but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo the first two symbols from S would be 't31' and 't12', which don't match the string given. The string starts with t48, which isn't 't31' or 't12'. So maybe choosing S -> NT97 NT54 is not the right path. Let's try the other S production: S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nNow, NT7 and NT23. But wait, looking at the grammar, there's no production for NT7 except perhaps in the body of NT28: `NT28 -> 't36'` but NT7 isn't defined. Wait, no, looking back, I think I might have missed that NT7 is a terminal or is part of a larger non-terminal. Or perhaps NT7 is part of NT28's production, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the grammar rules. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT7 appearing as a non-terminal; perhaps it's a typo, or I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps NT7 is a terminal because none of the rules define it further.\n\nWait, if NT7 is a terminal, then it would produce the symbol 't7' if such a token exists. But in the string, the first token is 't48', so maybe that's not relevant. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to parse this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the grammar includes all the NT productions and the terminals as given. So, for each non-terminal, they can produce other non-terminals or terminals. So, for the string to be generated, each non-terminal should expand to the appropriate symbols, including the possibility of leaving some symbols as non-terminals to be expanded later.\n\nGiven the string length, it's 19 tokens, which is a bit long. So perhaps I should look for a way to split the string into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be effective here. But given the time constraints, maybe a better approach is to consider potential expansion sequences.\n\nWait, but given the grammar and the string, let's try to find a way to split the string into the rules given. Let's see:\n\nThe string is: t48 t33 t99 t36 t33 t4 t35 t86 t62 t48 t71 t36 t51 t90 t41 t66 t62 t57 t37.\n\nLet me try to split this into chunks that could match the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first step is to split into two parts, each being an NT. Let's say we have two groups: [t48 t33 t99 t36 t33 t4 t35 t86 t62 t48] and [t71 t36 t51 t90 t41 t66 t62 t57 t37]. Wait, that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe it's better to try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since S can be NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54, and the string starts with t48, perhaps NT23 is in the second position. Let's try to see how t48 can fit.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can produce t48. But in the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that produces t48 directly. So perhaps t48 is a terminal, but I don't see 't48' in any of the grammar's terminals as a direct symbol. All the terminals are like t31, t54, etc. So maybe that means the string has a symbol that isn't generated by any production, which would mean the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the grammar. Is there any NT production that results in 't48'? Looking through all the rules, I don't see any production that directly or indirectly results in 't48'. So if 't48' can't be generated by any of the non-terminals, then the string starts with a symbol that's not in the language, making the entire string invalid.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first token 't48' isn't present in any production.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the terminals. The start symbol is S, and the productions are:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nThen there are a bunch of other productions from NTxxx to other NTyyy and terminals. The terminals are things like 't48', 't17', etc., and some non-terminals like NT50, NT46, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t68 t96 t96 t68 t96 t85 t17 t4 t35 t86 t68 t96 t99 t85 t13 t41 t57 t57`.\n\nHmm. I think I should parse this string step by step using the grammar. Parsing is like retracing the steps of how the grammar would derive the string.\n\nStarting with S, each S can split into either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So the first two symbols in the string should come from one of these options.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t48. Let's see which production could lead to t48. Looking at NT productions, I see NT40 -> t71, but that's not it. Wait, other NT productions:\n\nLooking through all NT productions, I spot NT7 -> t48. So the first symbol t48 comes from NT7.\n\nSo the first part is NT7. Now, in the grammar, NT7 only has one production: NT7 -> t48. So that's done. So now, the next step is to take the second part, which is NT23.\n\nWait, but no, each S production produces two non-terminals, so both need to be derived. So the first step is S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo after handling NT7, the next non-terminal is NT23. So the next two symbols must come from this NT23 production. Looking at NT23's productions:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT23 -> NT48 NT53\nNT23 -> NT22 NT8\nNT23 -> NT7 -> t48 (but that's a terminal)\nWait no, NT23 can go to NT48 NT53, which would produce two more non-terminals. Wait no, NT48 is a non-terminal, so it needs to be expanded.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to consider each production for NT23 and see which one can generate two symbols that match the next tokens.\n\nThe string starts with t48, then comes t68. So after NT7 (t48), the next NT is NT23. Let's see the possible productions of NT23 and what they produce:\n\n1. NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n   This would need to produce two symbols. So after t48, the next is t68, then t96, etc.\n\nBut let's think step by step. Let's first split S into NT7 and NT23, generating t48, and then we need to process NT23.\n\nBut wait, is that the only way? Yes, because S can split into either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. The first symbol is t48, which only matches NT7. So we take S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nNow, after processing NT7 (which gives t48), the next part is NT23.\n\nLooking at NT23, we need to find a production that, when fully expanded, would give the next symbols in the string. The remaining string after t48 is t68, t96, t96, t68, t96, t85, t17, t4, t35, t86, t68, t96, t99, t85, t13, t41, t57, t57.\n\nSo after t48, the next symbols are t68.\n\nSo for NT23, we have several options:\n\n1. NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53: So we'd need to generate two more non-terminals. But we have t68 as the next symbol, which is a terminal. So NT45 would need to produce t68? Let's check NT45's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT45 hasn't been mentioned yet. Wait, no, the grammar does have other NT productions. Wait, the user provided a long list, so perhaps I need to look for NT45. Let me scan:\n\nYes, I see `NT45 -> NT99 NT95`.\n\nHmm, so NT45 doesn't produce any terminal directly. So NT45 would have to be further expanded, which starts with more non-terminals, which would require more expansions. But our current token is t68, which is a terminal. So maybe this is not the correct path.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to see which NT23 production leads to the correct next symbols. Let's try the other options for NT23.\n\n2. NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50: Similarly, both are non-terminals, so we would need both of them to generate the next two symbols. But the next symbol is t68, which would come from the first part, so we need NT13 to expand into t68. Looking at NT13's productions: `NT13 -> NT41 NT18`, so no terminal there. So this path would produce non-terminals, which don't match t68 immediately. So this can't be the right path.\n\n3. NT23 \u2192 NT48 NT53: Let's see. NT48 is a non-terminal, so it would expand into... Looking through the grammar, NT48's productions are `NT48 -> NT56 NT23`, `NT48 -> NT22 NT8`. So NT48 can't directly produce a terminal. The next symbol is t68, so this might not work either.\n\n4. NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT8: Here, NT22 is `-> t57`? Let me check: Yes, `NT22 -> t57`. So this could work because NT22 produces t57. Then the next part is NT8.\n\nSo in this case, if we choose NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT8, then NT22 gives us t57. But our next symbol is t68, so this doesn't match. So that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think: the string starts with t48, then t68. So after t48 (from NT7), the next non-terminal is NT23, which should produce t68 as its next symbol. So we need NT23 to eventually produce t68. Let's look at all NT23 productions and see which one can start with a path that leads to t68.\n\nNT23 productions:\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53: Both are non-terminals. So no.\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50: Both are non-terminals. No.\n- NT23 \u2192 NT48 NT53: Both non-terminals. No.\n- NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT8: NT22 -> t57, which is t57, not t68.\n- NT23 \u2192 NT7 -> t48 (we already used this).\n\nWait, I'm missing something. Are there other NT23 productions I might have missed? Let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\n`NT23 -> NT45 NT53`\n`NT23 -> NT13 NT50`\n`NT23 -> NT48 NT53`\n`NT23 -> NT22 NT8`\n\nIs that all? Yes. So none of NT23's productions start with a terminal beyond the non-terminals. That's a problem because after t48 (from NT7), the next symbol is t68, which is a terminal.\n\nSo perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I need to consider that after t48, the next part comes from NT23. But in the grammar, NT23 can't directly produce a terminal. So maybe the first symbol is wrong.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t48. That comes from NT7, which only has one production: NT7 -> t48. So that's correct. But then the next part is NT23, which has to produce the next symbols.\n\nThe next symbols are t68, t96, etc. So how can NT23 produce t68?\n\nLooking back, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT23's productions again:\n\nDoes any of NT23's productions have a terminal in the sequence?

{"custom_id":"request-349","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'm going to look at the grammar structure. From what I recall, a CNF grammar has productions where each right-hand side is either a single terminal or exactly two non-terminals. Let me check the given grammar to confirm.\n\nLooking at the production rules, yeah, every production on the left side, like S -> NT7 NT23, has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for some that end with terminals, like NT54 -> 't93'. So, that's consistent with CNF because the terminals can be at the bottom.\n\nNext, the given string is: t48 t68 t96 t57 t19 t25 t71 t96 t66 t96 t41 t36 t51 t90 t41 t85 t48 t71 t85 t57.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived by the grammar. One common approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for context-free grammars in CNF. But since I might not remember the exact steps, I'll try to manually parse the string.\n\nLet me list the steps I'd take to try to parse the string.\n\nFirst, identify the start symbol, which is S. The start production is S -> NT7 NT23 and another S -> NT97 NT54. So, the first two symbols should come from one of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t48. Let's see what non-terminals can produce t48.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT7 can produce t48 because NT7 -> 't48'. Similarly, NT23 can produce t48 because NT23 -> 't62' or wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT23 is part of a production: NT28 -> 't13', but wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, let me check the left-hand side. NT23 appears in a production like S -> NT97 NT54, but I need to see if any NT23 appears as a terminal or non-terminal. From the productions, NT23 is on the right side of some productions, but does it ever produce a terminal? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT23 has two productions:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nand\nNT23 -> NT48 NT28\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, looking at the given productions, for example, NT23 -> NT53 NT28 and also elsewhere. Wait, but perhaps I'm missing whether any NT23 directly goes to a terminal.\n\nWait, the given productions have NT23 on the left side, but no production for NT23 that produces a terminal. For example, looking through the list:\n\n- NT45 -> NT99 NT95\n- NT53 -> NT28 NT23\n- NT28 -> 't36' and also NT28 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT23 -> ... but wait, in the given list, I see NT28 is a terminal on two productions. Wait, perhaps I misread earlier.\n\nWait, looking through the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT28 -> 't36'\nand\nNT28 -> NT45 NT53.\n\nSo, NT28 can produce t36, or two NTs.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 -> NT28 NT23.\n\nSo, non-terminals can sometimes produce terminals.\n\nSo, coming back to the start. The string begins with t48.\n\nSo, S can produce either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the possible first symbols to match.\n\nBut since the string starts with t48, let's see which of the start productions can produce a t48.\n\nLooking at S -> NT7 NT23: if NT7 can produce t48 (yes, because NT7 -> 't48'), then the first symbol t48 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, S -> NT97 NT54: does NT97 or NT54 produce t48?\n\nLooking at NT97, it's defined as NT97 -> 't31'.\n\nNT54 has a production NT54 -> 't93' and also NT54 -> 't12'. Wait, wait, no, looking back, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the productions. The user provided a list of productions, each starting with something like S -> NT7 NT23, then NT99 -> NT66 NT16, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the given productions:\n\n- NT54 -> 't93'\n- Also, I see NT56 -> 't53'\n- And NT45 -> 't48'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking more carefully: NT45 is defined as NT45 -> NT99 NT95, which then eventually produce terminals. But in the later productions, I see:\n\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n- NT55 -> 't90 NT1\n- etc.\n\nWait, I need to clarify which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT16 -> 't90'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n- NT51 -> 't51' (is that a terminal? No, wait, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, no, let me check. I think I'm getting confused. The productions are each starting with a non-terminal and then producing a series of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT45 -> NT99 NT95.\n\nBut at the end, we have some non-terminals that directly produce terminals, like NT19 -> 't19' \u2013 wait, no, let's see:\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see any terminals with a leading NT except those that are defined as such. Wait, the NT's that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n- NT55 -> 't90'\n- NT16 -> 't90' (but wait, NT16 is defined as NT16 -> NT56 NT40, which then produce 't56' and 't71'. Hmm, not directly producing terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should make a list of all non-terminals that directly produce terminals. Let me check each production:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48' (produces terminal 't48')\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT23 -> some productions, but looking at NT23: NT23 -> NT45 NT53. So, no terminal.\n- NT28 -> 't36' and also NT45 NT53.\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT51 -> 't51' (is 't51' a terminal? Yes, I think so. So NT51 produces t51.\n- NT53 -> NT28 NT23.\n- NT66 -> 't51'\n- Wait, no, looking at the productions, I think NT66 -> 't51' is a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the list, I see NT66 -> 't51' as a terminal. So, NT66 can produce 't51'.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 -> 't96' as per some productions.\n\nLooking through, for example, NT86 -> 't25' (a terminal), and NT78 -> 't...' Wait, looking through the list:\n\n- NT54 -> 't93' (terminal, so NT54 produces 't93')\n- NT45 -> 't48' (since NT45 ends up with 't48' as in NT46 -> 't13', etc., but wait, NT45 -> NT99 NT95, which in turn have their own productions, but wait, perhaps NT45 can somehow produce a terminal. Alternatively, maybe NT45 is broken down further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to list each non-terminal and see if it can produce any terminals, directly or indirectly.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- NT45: eventually ends up with NT48 -> 't96', so NT45 doesn't directly produce a terminal, but through a chain.\n\nSimilarly, NT23: it's unclear if it can produce a terminal because it's in a chain.\n\nBut let's focus on the terminals present in the string: t4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, but they're quite lengthy, so I'll have to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this structure since all the productions either expand non-terminals to two non-terminals or to terminals (like 't93', 't31', etc.).\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t36 t96 t41 t13 t33 t84 t17 t96 t68 t96 t4 t19 t57 t48 t71 t66 t86 t57 t57`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be produced by the grammar. One approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S and working towards the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Let's consider the given string:\n\nIt starts with t48, which is a terminal. I need to see if any production starts with t48. Looking through the productions, I see NT40 \u2192 't71', NT8 \u2192 't32', NT56 \u2192 't10', etc. Wait, I need to look for the left-hand side (LHS) of the productions that result in a terminal character. Each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo, the first token is t48. Is there any production where the left-hand side leads to 't48'? Looking through, I see NT40 \u2192 't71', NT56 \u2192 't10', NT28 \u2192 't66', NT8 \u2192 't32', NT58 \u2192 't22', NT18 \u2192 't96', etc. Hmm, I don't see a production that directly gives 't48'. Wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, looking back, NT40 \u2192 't71', and then NT16 \u2192 't23', but that's not related. Let me check again. Oh, wait, I see NT8 \u2192 't32' and NT7 \u2192 't66'. But none of the productions directly produce t48. So maybe the first part of the string doesn't come from the direct start symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the start symbol's possible productions and see if they can lead to the string. The start symbol S can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Let's look at what NT7 and NT23 produce.\n\nNT7 is in the grammar as NT7 \u2192 't71' (from one production) or NT7 \u2192 what? Wait, looking at the productions, I see NT7 \u2192 't66' and NT7 \u2192 't48'? Wait, no. Let me list all the NT7 productions.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT79:\n- NT794 \u2192 't41'\n- NT78 \u2192 't32'\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should create a mapping of each non-terminal to its productions.\n\nWait, the user provided the entire grammar. Let me parse it correctly. Each line starts with the non-terminal on the left, then the productions.\n\nSo, for example, the first line is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Then next is S \u2192 NT97 NT54, etc.\n\nBut actually, each line is a production, so each rule is a mapping from a non-terminal to multiple possible right-hand sides (RHS). So for each non-terminal, all the RHSs are possible.\n\nTherefore, for NT7, looking through the productions, I can list all the rules where the LHS is NT7.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nNT7 has:\n- NT7 \u2192 't71' (from the rule NT79 \u2192 't71'?)\nWait, no. The user's grammar has lines like:\nNT7 \u2192 't71' under NT8's production. Wait no, let's list each line:\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n3.

Each production's LHS is a single non-terminal, and the RHS can be multiple symbols. So, for example, the first production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So, to get the string starting with NT7, perhaps.\n\nBut I need to find the initial symbols that correspond to the string tokens.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-377","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, the grammar looks a bit complex with all those production rules. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. Each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and is followed by two non-terminals on the right. That's typical for Chomsky Normal Form. The terminals are the strings made up of 't' followed by a number. For example, I see rules like NT54 \u2192 't93' and NT46 \u2192 't37'. So, each terminal is a single token like that.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, and the grammar has two production rules for S directly:\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nThat means the start symbol S can only produce two different initial sequences of two non-terminals each. Let me note those down:\n1. S can start with NT7 followed by NT23.\n2. S can start with NT97 followed by NT54.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t48 t68 t96 t86 t33 t85 t96 t41 t41 t48 t17 t85 t48 t35 t13 t51 t90 t41 t36 t33 t85`\n\nSo, the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, each in their own parentheses. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar, starting from S and applying the production rules until I reach all terminals.\n\nLet me think about how the derivation might proceed. Since S has two rules, each starting with two non-terminals, the string should start with either NT7 followed by NT23 or NT97 followed by NT54.\n\nFor the given string, let's look at the first token: t48. So, the first node in the derivation tree is a terminal 't48'. Looking at the grammar's terminal productions, I can check where 't48' occurs. Scanning through, I find NT48 appears in a couple of places as a terminal, but looking closer: Oh wait, the grammar has 't48' in a couple of places. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT48 again in another rule: Wait, checking the list, I see multiple 't' terminals. Specifically, in NT48 \u2192 't96' and NT48 \u2192 't86', and others like NT54 is 't12', etc. Wait, in the grammar provided, I think there are multiple 't' rules for some non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, perhaps I misread. Let me list the terminals again carefully. The grammar has the following terminals:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't93'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT46 \u2192 't13'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT97 \u2192 't54' (Wait, this is the same as before? Or is it different? Because NT97 had another production earlier, maybe this is a different one. Wait, no, maybe it's a duplicate or a typo. Let me check.)\n\nWait, the grammar is written as a series of rules. Let's parse each line carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can list out the terminal rules:\n\n- NT97 appears twice: once as 't31' and once as 't54'. So perhaps the first NT97 \u2192 't31' and the second NT97 \u2192 't54'? That would be possible if it's in different contexts, but in Chomsky Normal Form, a non-terminal can have multiple production rules, so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19' (so same NT8, two different productions to 't32' and 't19')\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT46 \u2192 't13'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96' and 't86'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62' and 't86'\n- NT48 \u2192 't86' again (duplicate)\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT97 \u2192 't54' (same as before, perhaps a typo)\n- NT1 \u2192 't57'\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n- NT40 \u2192 't17'\n- NT84 \u2192 't4' and 't84' (duplicate)\n- NT53 \u2192 't85'\n- NT40 \u2192 't35'\n- NT22 \u2192 't57'\n- NT7 \u2192 't48'\n- NT28 \u2192 't13'\n- NT84 \u2192 't57'\n- NT86 \u2192 't25'\n- NT50 \u2192 't85'\n- NT16 \u2192 't23'\n- NT23 \u2192 't86'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals have multiple entries, or maybe I made a mistake while copying them. But regardless, the key is that certain non-terminals can produce specific 't' tokens.\n\nNow, the given string starts with t48. Let's see where that can come from. Looking through the grammar, t48 can come from NT48 as 't96' or 't86'? Wait, no, wait. Wait, checking:\n\nWait, for NT48, the productions are:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't96' and 't86' (I think I saw that multiple times). So, NT48 can produce 't96' or 't86'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t48, which is not 96 or 86. Hmm, that seems confusing. Or perhaps I misread. Wait, is it t48 or something else? Let me check the string again.\n\nWait, the string is: `t48 t68 t96 t86 t33 t85 t96 t41 t41 t48 t17 t85 t48 t35 t13 t51 t90 t41 t36 t33 t85`\n\nYes, the first token is 't48'. But from the grammar, I don't see any NT that can directly produce 't48'. Let me check the grammar again to confirm.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT with a production to 't48'. Wait, but in the grammar, I think there's a rule for NT7 \u2192 't48' because earlier I saw 'NT797' or something? Wait, let me check again. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it's NT7 \u2192 't48'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, the lines:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't48' Yes, definitely. Wait, in the initial grammar provided, the first line is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and one of the rules is NT797 \u2192 't31'. No, wait, no, that's another NT.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under 'Production Rules':\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT46 \u2192 't13'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96' and also 't86'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62' and 't86"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-389","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the initial symbol which can go to a terminal. However, looking at the provided grammar, I notice that the right-hand sides are either one terminal or two non-terminals, except for the initial rule. Wait, let me check the grammar again. The initial rules are S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. The other rules have either two non-terminals or sometimes a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait no, in CNF, the right-hand side must be two non-terminals. So maybe some rules are allowed to have a single terminal as their right-hand side, which would mean this grammar isn't strictly in CNF. Hmm, but the user said it's in CNF, so perhaps the productions with single terminals are considered part of the grammar despite seeming to not fit CNF.\n\nSo the string to evaluate is: `t48 t68 t96 t10 t66 t33 t99 t13 t33 t96 t86 t96 t41 t41 t48 t71 t85 t48 t17 t85 t37 t37`.\n\nI need to check if this string is possible to derive from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the grammar is context-free, but the user provided productions are a bit mixed with some terminals, I think the approach is to use reverse engineering, building a parse tree from the given string, ensuring each terminal matches the rules, and that the structure can be formed by the non-terminals' expansions.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the production rules for reference:\n\n- S -> NT7 NT23\n- S -> NT97 NT54\n- NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n- NT58 -> NT94 NT54\n- NT94 -> NT96 NT98\n- NT55 -> NT90 NT1\n- NT90 -> NT94 NT95\n- NT45 -> NT99 NT95\n- NT59 -> NT56 NT53\n- NT53 -> NT28 NT23\n- NT96 -> NT48 NT23\n- NT98 -> NT48 NT95\n- NT16 -> NT56 NT40\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT99 -> NT28 NT18\n- NT13 -> NT41 NT18\n- NT90 -> NT84 NT8\n- NT50 -> NT55 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT40 NT96\n- NT58 -> NT22 NT8\n- NT98 -> NT40 NT90\n- NT1 -> NT88 NT53\n- NT50 -> NT59 NT46\n- NT88 -> NT7 NT40\n- NT54 -> 't93'\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT8 -> 't19'\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n- NT94 -> 't87'\n- NT46 -> 't37'\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n- NT48 -> 't86'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT97 -> 't54'\n- NT1 -> 't57'\n- NT18 -> 't96'\n- NT16 -> 't90'\n- NT28 -> 't66'\n- NT40 -> 't17'\n- NT84 -> 't4'\n- NT84 -> 't84'\n- NT56 -> 't99'\n- NT66 -> 't51'\n- NT54 -> 't53'\n- NT23 -> 't86'\n- NT84 -> 't57'\n- NT53 -> 't85'\n- NT40 -> 't35'\n- NT22 -> 't57'\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n\nAlright, so the string starts with t48. Let's see which non-terminals produce t48.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT96 -> 't96' (which is 96, but matches t96, not t48)\n- NT48 -> 't48'\n- NT56 -> 't10' (no), NT40 -> 't71' (no), NT95 -> 't41' (no), NT23 -> 't62' (no), NT8 -> 't32' or 't19'\nSo, t48 is directly produced by NT48.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see that NT48 has multiple productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT48 -> 't96' and also another production? Wait no, in the given rules, NT48 is not present except when looking at other non-terminals. Wait no, looking at the production rules, only NT46 and NT48 are listed with two options, but in the initial list provided, the user listed NT94 -> 't87' and others, but it's a bit complicated. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, I don't see NT48 as a non-terminal with a production. Let me look:\n\nYes, the rules include:\n\nNT48 -> 't96' (from S rules) and wait, in the rules above, under other NTs:\n\nWait, the rule for NT53 -> 't85' is one of the productions.\n\nBut for NT48, I see in the production list:\n\n- NT96 -> NT48 NT23\n- NT98 -> NT48 NT95\n- NT48 -> 't96'\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe the user made a typo in the rules, but for the purpose of solving, I have to stick to what's provided.\n\nWait, looking at the given rules, under NT96, it's produced by NT48 and NT23, and under NT98, it's produced by NT48 and NT95, and also, NT48 is a terminal ('t96'). So NT48 can derive both NT48 NT23 and NT98, and also 't96'?\n\nWait, no, in the given rules, for NT96, it's a production to NT48 NT23, and for NT48, it's a production to 't96'. So, does that mean NT48 can be a terminal or also part of another production? Hmm, but in CNF, non-terminals can only produce other non-terminals, not terminals. So perhaps in this grammar, the initial part allows some non-terminals to produce terminals, which is allowed in CNF if the non-terminals are at the top level, but in this case, we have S -> NT... which are non-terminals, but perhaps NT48 is a non-terminal that can produce a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed by assuming that NT48 can only produce 't96' and not the other options, but given that in the rules, NT96 can produce NT48 NT23 and also 't96', which is a mix, but perhaps it's a mistake, or I'm misreading the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules are structured in a way where some non-terminals can produce a terminal or two non-terminals. So, for example:\n\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\nSo NT96 can be split into NT48 and NT23, which in turn might produce terminals.\n\nSimilarly, S -> NT7 NT23. So S breaks down into two non-terminals, each of which needs to be resolved.\n\nSo, back to the string. The first token is t48. So, starting with S, which must split into two non-terminals. So, perhaps S -> NT7 NT23, or S -> NT97 NT54.\n\nLet me see what non-terminals can produce t48.\n\nLooking at the rules, only NT48 directly produces 't96', but that's not t48. Hmm, wait no, I think I'm confused.\n\nWait, in the given rules, there is NT46 -> 't13' and NT48 -> 't96', but is there any rule for NT48 that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That's a lot of tokens, but each symbol is a terminal or non-terminal, I guess.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in CNF, so each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, right? Let me check the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\nSo S can derive two different sequences of non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals then breaks down further.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, it should be possible to use a recursive descent parser or something similar. Let me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, each symbol is either a terminal or a non-terminal. For example, 't7' seems like a terminal, but in the grammar, many NT symbols are mapped to terminals.

For example, NT54 \u2192 't12', NT97 \u2192 't31', etc. So each production can either produce a terminal or a combination of non-terminals.\n\nSo I need to see what's the starting point.

The start symbol is S, and I see S has two productions leading directly to NT combinations, which then further break down into more NTs. \n\nLooking closer, the grammar has a lot of NT nodes connected through production rules, and many of these rules lead directly to terminal symbols represented by 't' followed by numbers. So, it's likely that each of these terminals are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminal symbols. Each symbol here starts with 't' and has a number, so according to the grammar, these must be the terminal parts of the productions. \n\nThe idea is that the string should be generated by the grammar, meaning it can be broken down into the start symbol S through a series of productions. Each step in the parse would involve replacing symbols with their productions, ultimately leading to the entire string being derived.\n\nTo approach this, I need to see if the string can be parsed through the grammar. Maybe the most straightforward way is to try to parse the string using the grammar rules. Alternatively, I can map the string back through the possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each rule seems to produce two symbols. So the string has an even number of symbols, 22 in total, which makes sense because each production replaces one symbol with two, starting from S which is one symbol. So 21 splittings would give 22 symbols. That matches, so the length is correct.\n\nLet me list the string in order: t48, t33, t96, t62, t96, t41, t41, t48, t71, t36, t68, t96, t10, t36, t51, t99, t17, t41, t13, t33, t85, t37, t57. \n\nI can try to work backward, starting from the end of the string to see if it can be produced by the grammar. Let's check if the last symbol, t57, has a parent production from the grammar. Looking at the NT57 production: Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT57. Instead, the closest is NT18 -> t96, but that's for NT18. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe NT57 comes from NT57 -> something, but I don't see it in the provided rules. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, I see NT7-> t48. So t48 is NT7. Then t37 is produced by NT46, as per NT46->t37. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT46->t37? No, I think I saw NT46->t13 and NT48->t86. Wait, no, in the given rules, let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT88-> NT7 t40\nNT54-> 't93'\nNT97-> 't31'\n... etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to see the last symbol, t57. I don't immediately see an NT rule generating t57. Looking at the rules, the closest is NT41->t68 (yes, NT41 has t68), and others like NT17->t54, but t57 isn't present. Oh wait, no production ends with t57. That's a problem. Because if the string ends with t57, but in the grammar, no NT produces t57, it's not possible. So the string should be No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm looking at the wrong NT. Let me check each rule step by step.\n\nLooking at the last symbol: t57. It must be the terminal symbol of some NT. So, checking all the NTs, see if any NT production ends with t57.\n\nI'll go through the list:\n\n- NT41->t68, NT48->t86, NT13->t33, NT40->t17, NT84->t4, NT84->t84, NT56->t99, NT66->t51, NT54->t53, NT23->t62, etc.\n\nI don't see any NT production with t57 as a terminal. Therefore, the symbol t57 can't be derived, meaning the string can't be in the language.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the grammar because the last symbol, t57, is not a terminal of any NT production in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me first understand the components involved.\n\nThe grammar is given in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. The string I need to check is a sequence of terminals: `t48 t68 t96 t96 t86 t86 t41 t41 t48 t35 t66 t62 t48 t17 t66 t33 t10 t36 t36 t96 t41 t66 t62 t13`.\n\nFirst, I should look at the start symbol, which seems to be S. The two productions of S are:\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT93 NT54\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT54 \u2192 't12', which is the terminal for NT54. Similarly, NT93 becomes 't31'. So from S, the initial step is to produce either 't31' 't12' or other variants, but looking at the string, the first symbol is t48, which doesn't match t31.

NT88 is 't57' and NT53 could be other options. Wait, I see NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT52? Or perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should build the parse tree step by step. The string starts with t48, t68, t96, etc. Let me see if I can find a way to derive the string using the given productions.\n\nStarting from S, as per the string starting with t48, perhaps I should look for which production of S gives a t48.\n\nLooking at all the productions, I see NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT53, and NT88 is 't57' according to the given terminals. Wait, that's t57, not t48. Hmm, maybe another path.\n\nWait, looking at NT56: NT56 \u2192 't10' according to the terminals. Also, NT23 has two productions: one is NT45 NT53, which leads to various sequences ending in t62 or other t's. Alternatively, another NT23 production is 't62'. So perhaps the string starts with certain NT23 productions.\n\nWait, the first token is t48. Let's see where t48 comes from.

Wait, no, looking back, NT46 is 't37', and NT48 are 't96' in some places and not in others.\n\nWait, no, the terminals are specific.

No, wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit complicated. Let me list all the productions and their corresponding terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't48'\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT45 \u2192 't57'\n- NT53 \u2192 't86'\n- NT99 \u2192 't51'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31' (Wait, but in the given grammar, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16; NT66 \u2192 NT48 NT23; NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86; and so on.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should reverse-engineer the parse tree starting from the string.\n\nThe string is: t48 t68 t96 t96 t86 t86 t41 t41 t48 t35 t66 t62 t48 t17 t66 t33 t10 t36 t36 t96 t41 t66 t62 t13.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t48. Possible origins are NT7, since NT7 \u2192 't48'. So the first part of the string comes from NT7.\n\nNT7's production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So, the first two symbols must be t48 (from NT7) followed by something from NT23. Let's see the second symbol is t68.\n\nLooking for what NT23 can produce: one of its productions is t62, but the second symbol is t68, so that's not it. Another production for NT23 is: NT45 NT53. Let's see what NT45 and NT53 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar: NT45 \u2192 't57', NT53 \u2192 't86'. So NT45 NT53 becomes 't57' 't86'. But the second symbol is t68, so maybe this isn't the correct pathway.\n\nWait, perhaps NT23 has another production. Let me check: in the given grammar, there's a production NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 and also NT23 \u2192 't62'. Neither produces t68.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if any other production from NT23 can produce t68, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any such production. The only terminals from NT23 are t62, so perhaps the second symbol being t68 requires a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let me check if the first symbol t48 comes from a different NT.\n\nLooking at all NTs: NT56 \u2192 't10', NT7 \u2192 't48', NT23 \u2192 t62 or other non-terminals. So only NT7 produces t48.\n\nBut in the string, the second symbol is t68, which is a terminal that must come from NT* production.\n\nLooking at NT41: NT41 \u2192 't68'. So if the second symbol is t68, that would come from NT41. But how do NT7 and NT23 produce a t68.\n\nWait, unless NT7's production is different. Wait, no, NT7 only produces 't48' directly.\n\nSo perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT23 NT54, as in the second production. Let me consider that.\n\nWait, if S \u2192 NT23 NT54, then the first part would be symbols from NT23, then NT54.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t48, which is from NT7, so that suggests that the first production of S is being used (S \u2192 NT7 NT23). But then the second symbol should be from NT23, but the second symbol is t68, which doesn't match any NT23 terminal.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's consider whether the string has a structure that can be built using the given productions.\n\nThe string length is 24 symbols. Let's see if we can split it into segments that correspond to the productions.\n\nLooking for sequences that match NT7 production, which is 't48' followed by something from NT23.\n\nLooking at the string, the first is t48, then t68, which doesn't match NT23's terminals (it's t62 or others). So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived from S \u2192 NT23 NT54, as in the second production. Let's see:\n\nIf the first symbol comes from NT23, which could be t62, then the string starts with t48, which isn't t62. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the NT wrong.

The string is `t48 t68 t96 t84 t17 t86 t36 t96 t41 t13 t33 t10 t13 t62 t37 t48 t17 t85 t48 t17 t36 t68 t96 t85`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form means. It requires each production rule to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided seems to fit this structure since each production starts with a non-terminal on the left and either another non-terminal and a non-terminal or a non-terminal and a terminal, or a single terminal on the right.\n\nThe string is a series of terminals: t, followed by numbers, so each token is a terminal. So, the string can be broken down into individual tokens. Each token corresponds to a production rule where the non-terminal on the left side of the rule produces that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The productions for S are `S -> NT7 NT23` and `S -> NT97 NT54`. These seem to be the top-level options. So, the string must be derived from either of these.\n\nEach option for S produces a combination of two non-terminals. So, the string must be a sequence of symbols derived from these, eventually ending in terminals. Since S is at the top, the start, the entire string must be built from expanding S down to the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t48 t68 t96 t84 t17 t86 t36 t96 t41 t13 t33 t10 t13 t62 t37 t48 t17 t85 t48 t17 t36 t68 t96 t85.\n\nLet me list them as tokens:\n\n1. t48\n2. t68\n3. t96\n4. t84\n5. t17\n6. t86\n7. t36\n8. t96\n9. t41\n10. t13\n11. t33\n12. t10\n13. t13\n14. t62\n15. t37\n16. t48\n17. t17\n18. t85\n19. t48\n20. t17\n21. t36\n22. t68\n23. t96\n24. t85.\n\nHmm, I notice that the first token is t48.

The string is: t48 t33 t87 t41 t48 t35 t66 t33 t87 t41 t48 t17 t66 t33 t87 t41 t48 t35 t85 t57 t57 t48 t17 t36 t62.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two symbols on the right, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can go to NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So the entire string must be built starting with either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Then, each of these NTs will have their own productions.\n\nI notice that the first step in the string starts with t48. So I should check what symbols derive to t48. Looking at the production rules, t48 is a terminal, and it appears in multiple NTs. Specifically, NT48 is used in several places: NT8, NT98, NT46, NT48, etc. Each of these NTs can derive to t48.\n\nBut since the first symbol is t48, I need to see which NTs have t48 as an option. So NT48 \u2192 t48, but also NT8, NT98, NT46, and NT48 \u2192 t48. Hmm, but wait, looking at the rules, NT48 directly produces t48, so that's a possibility. But wait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t96 (grammar line: NT48 -> 't96')\nWait, no, looking again: The grammar rules include NT8 \u2192 't32', NT56 \u2192 't10', NT95 \u2192 't41', NT23 \u2192 't62', etc. But I don't see NT48 directly producing 't48' as a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, looking at the lines:\n\nNT54 -> 't12'\n\nNT8 -> 't32'\n\nNT56 -> 't10'\n\nNT95 -> 't41'\n\nNT23 -> 't62'\n\nNT48 -> 't96'\n\nWait, so NT48 directly produces t96, not t48. So how does t48 come into play?\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t48. So perhaps I need to trace back the possible derivations that lead to t48.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NTs can produce t48? Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, t48 is a terminal in the right-hand side of several rules. For example, NT40 \u2192 't71', NT8 \u2192 't32', etc. Wait, but in the rules, I think I'm only seeing 't' followed by a number, but some of these may be part of the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each rule to see if any produce t48.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT48 -> 't96' (line: NT48 -> 't96')\n\nNT94 -> 't87'\n\nNT46 -> 't37'\n\nNT23 -> 't62'\n\nNT84 -> 't4' (Wait, that would produce 't4', not t84 as a number? Or maybe 't84' is NT84 as a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each production line.\n\nWait, the lines are like:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nAnd then many NT rules, each specifying production.\n\nLooking for where 't48' appears as a terminal:\n\nLooking through each production rule:\n\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n\n- NT8 -> 't19'\n\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n\n- NT94 -> 't87'\n\n- NT55 -> 't99'\n\n- NT23 -> 't86'\n\n- NT84 -> 't23'\n\n- NT53 -> 't85'\n\n- NT40 -> 't17'\n\n- NT22 -> 't57'\n\nWait, I realize now that 't48' can come via NT7, as per NT7 -> 't48', and also NT48 can go to 't96', but that's not t48. Similarly, looking for any NTs that produce t48.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some lines. Let me go through all lines again:\n\nWait, line by line:\n\nNT40 -> 't71'\n\nNT8 -> 't32'\n\nNT56 -> 't10'\n\nNT95 -> 't41'\n\nNT23 -> 't62'\n\nNT48 -> 't96'\n\nNT94 -> 't87'\n\nNT55 -> 't99'\n\nNT23 -> 't86'\n\nNT84 -> 't23'\n\nNT53 -> 't85'\n\nNT40 -> 't17'\n\nNT22 -> 't57'\n\nNT7 -> 't48'\n\nWait, so NT7 -> 't48'. That's where t48 comes from. So in the string, the first symbol is t48, which must come from NT7, right? So S must derive a string that starts with NT7.\n\nLooking at S, it can be NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So let's see, from S, to get t48, it must choose the rule S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nSo the first part is NT7, which produces t48, then NT23, which can produce various things.\n\nSo the first two tokens are t48 and then whatever NT23 can produce. Looking at the string, the second token is t33. So after t48, we have t33.\n\nSo let's see what NT23 can produce t33. Looking at the rules for NT23:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53 and also NT84 NT86 (based on lines NT23 -> NT45 NT53 and NT23 -> NT84 NT86).\n\nSo NT23 can be either NT45 NT53 or NT84 NT86.\n\nLooking at the second token, t33. So which of these options can produce t33?\n\nLooking at NT45: Let's see what NT45 can produce. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95. Both of these are non-terminals. So NT45 would have to derive further.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT53: NT53 -> NT28 NT23.\n\nAlternatively, for NT84: NT84 can be NT58 NT86. NT86 is a production as well. So NT84 can go to NT58 NT86 or... Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT84 -> 't84' (line: NT84 -> 't84')\n\nWait, that's an option where NT84 can directly produce 't84' (without any non-terminals). So if NT23 is expanding to NT84, then the second part is NT84 which can produce t84. But in the string, after t48, the next token is t33, not t84. So perhaps NT23 is expanding to NT45 NT53, leading to more non-terminals.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t48, which comes from NT7 in the S rule. So S is expanding to NT7 NT23. The first token is t48 from NT7, then the second token is t33 which must come from NT23.\n\nSo NT23 needs to derive to a symbol that can produce t33. Let's see: looking at NT23's productions, both are in terms of other non-terminals. But wait, does NT23 have any other productions beyond what's listed?\n\nLooking through the grammar, the lines for NT23 are:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT86 (since line says NT23 -> NT84 NT86)\n\nAnd perhaps the line NT23 -> NT7 -> t48 is not correct because according to the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-450","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t48 t68 t96 t4 t35 t96 t68 t96 t57 t19 t25 t35 t96 t51 t99 t71 t41 t85 t57 t57 t48 t17 t66 t86 t57`. The grammar is provided with a list of production rules, most of which seem to involve non-terminals (like S, NT99, NT56, etc.) producing other non-terminals or terminals ending with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can be parsed using methods like the CYK algorithm, but since this is a bit complex with a large number of rules, I might need a different approach. Alternatively, I can try to trace through possible derivations step by step to see if the string can be generated.\n\nBut wait, let's see. The string is a sequence of tokens starting with 't48', etc. None of the rules seem to directly produce terminals except 't'. For example, the first rule is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, but S is a non-terminal and typically would expand further unless it directly produces terminals. However, looking through the rules, the right-hand sides (RHS) of the production rules mostly consist of non-terminals except for a few that directly end with 't' and numbers, like NT54 \u2192 't12', NT97 \u2192 't31', etc.\n\nWait, so the start symbol is S, which is the first rule, and S breaks down into NT7 and NT23. Neither NT7 nor NT23 are in the initial production rules as a start point, but let's look: S is defined as NT7 and NT23, which are non-terminals. Each of those must be expanded into other non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, I need to see if the string can be broken down into such a sequence of expansions. The string is a series of tokens that are all 't' plus two numbers, like t48, t68, etc. Each of these must correspond to a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the terminal rules to see what's available:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT46 \u2192 't13'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT97 \u2192 't54'\n- NT1 \u2192 't57'\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n- NT40 \u2192 't17'\n- NT84 \u2192 't4'\n- NT84 \u2192 't84'\n- NT56 \u2192 't99'\n- NT66 \u2192 't51'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n- NT23 \u2192 't86'\n- NT84 \u2192 't57'\n- NT53 \u2192 't85'\n- NT40 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, this is confusing. There are multiple '\u2192' for some NTs. For example, NT97 appears in multiple places, with different RHSs. So, for NT97, it can go to 't31' or to something else like 't54'. Similarly, NT54 can go to 't12' or 't53'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with 't48', which is produced by NT48 \u2192 't96' or 't86' as per the rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT48 has two options:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't48', which doesn't match 't96' or 't86'.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me double-check. Oh no, I think I misread the string. The string is `t48 t68 t96 t4 t35 t96 t68 t96 t57 t19 t25 t35 t96 t51 t99 t71 t41 t85 t57 t57 t48 t17 t66 t86 t57`.\n\nWait, so the first symbol is 't48', but looking at the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't48'. Let's check all terminals:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- t1, t10, t12, t13, t17, t19, t23, t25, t31, t32, t33, t35, t36, t37, t40, t41, t46, t48, t51, t53, t54, t57, t62, t66, t71, t84, t85, t86, t94, t95, t96, etc.\n\nWait, t48 is an option, because looking at NT48:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n\nWait, but 't48' is not listed as a terminal. So, in the string, the first symbol is 't48'. But none of the NTs directly produce 't48'. So, that's a problem. Because according to the grammar, all terminals are the ones listed, so the parser can't start with 't48' unless it's produced by some NT, but that's not there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misread the production rules. Let me check again.\n\nIn the list of grammar rules:\n\nLooking specifically for where RHS is a terminal:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT46 \u2192 't13'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT97 \u2192 't54'\n- NT1 \u2192 't57'\n- NT18 \u2192 't96'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n- NT40 \u2192 't17'\n- NT84 \u2192 't4'\n- NT84 \u2192 't84'\n- NT56 \u2192 't99'\n- NT66 \u2192 't51'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n- NT23 \u2192 't86'\n- NT84 \u2192 't57'\n- NT53 \u2192 't85'\n- NT40 \u2192 't35'\n\nSo, none of the NTs directly produce 't48' except possibly if I made a mistake. Wait, do any of them have 't48' as a terminal?\n\nLooking through the RHS, I don't see any 't48'. The closest is NT48, but it goes to 't96' or 't86', not 't48'. So, the first symbol 't48' can't be generated from the grammar because there's no rule that produces 't48' as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first symbol is 't48', which is not a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. Does NT48 ever have 't48' as a terminal? No. Looking at all the production rules, including NT23, NT28, etc., none of them produce 't48'. So, yes, 't48' is not present in the grammar's terminals, which means the string can't be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string begins with 't48', but"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-472","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, or a terminal. This form is useful for parsing algorithms, but here I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to check is: `t48 t68 t96 t10 t66 t51 t90 t41 t66 t68 t96 t99 t36 t33 t87 t41 t48 t35 t36 t51 t90 t41 t85 t57 t37 t13`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S can produce two options: NT57 and NT7 followed by NT23. Wait, no, looking again, the grammar provided has S in the rules, but actually, S doesn't appear as the start on the left-hand side of any production. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT93 and maybe others? Wait no, in the given grammar, S seems to only appear on the left of those two rules: S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. So, the start symbol S can only produce these two options. So, the string must start with the concatenation of the symbols resulting from either of these two expansions.\n\nWait, but looking at the provided string, the first part is `t48 t68 t96 t10...`, and I see that in the grammar, some of these terminals are assigned specific rules. For example, earlier I saw that NT56 -> 't10', and there's a production where NT85 -> t48 and t35, etc.\n\nSo to break it down, I think I should build a parse tree or try to match the string step by step.\n\nFirst, let's see if the string starts with one of the initial options for S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce either S1: NT7 NT23 or S2: NT97 NT54. So the string must start with the symbols produced by either S1 or S2.\n\nLet's look at S1: NT7 produces 't48' (from NT7 -> 't48'), and NT23 can produce 't62' or 't99'. Hmm, but in the string, after t48, the next is t68. So maybe NT23 in S1 can't produce t68. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at NT23, it can produce NT45 NT53, and then those NTs can produce terminals. For example, NT45 can go to NT99 NT95, and then NT99 can go to NT28 NT18, which then can lead to 't66' and other things. Similarly, NT84 can produce 't58' and 't86', but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to parse the string step by step, seeing if each terminal can be matched by applying the grammar rules correctly.\n\nAnother approach could be to represent the string as a list and try to reduce it down step by step using the productions, replacing two non-terminals at a time with their productions.\n\nBut given that the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into exactly two symbols. So each step either adds a terminal or keeps the number of non-terminals the same.\n\nWait, but here, we need to process the entire string. So perhaps I should think of the string as a series of terminals, and try to see if they can be derived by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string again: t48, t68, t96, t10, t66, t51, t90, t41, t66, t68, t96, t99, t36, t33, t87, t41, t48, t35, t36, t51, t90, t41, t85, t57, t37, t13.\n\nThat's 27 tokens.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, which means each production (except for terminals) splits into two symbols. So the minimal derivation tree has the number of symbols as the depth, but in this case, the string can have both terminals and non-terminals, but I think since all the NTs in the grammar eventually end up producing terminals, the entire string should consist of terminals only.\n\nNow, the first step is to see how the string could be generated from S. Since S can produce either S1: NT7 NT23 or S2: NT97 NT54, we can check both options.\n\nWait, looking at the string, it starts with 't48 t68...'. From the grammar, the first production S can be either leading to NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nLooking at NT7, in the rules, NT7 -> 't48' is present, so that's the first symbol. So S can produce S1 leading to 't48' and NT23.\n\nSo the string starts with 't48' followed by 't68'. So after 't48', the next symbol should be generated from NT23.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions: let's see.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT23 can go to NT45 NT53. Then, NT45 can go to NT99 NT95, which then can go to NT28 NT18, and so on, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, NT23 can also go to other things, but maybe looking more carefully, the rules for NT23:\n\nWait, looking again, NT23 is defined as:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86 (not relevant here).\n\nAnother production: I don't see NT23 being expanded directly into anything else except NT45 and NT53, then those can expand further.\n\nWait, but in the string after 't48' comes 't68'. So, after 't48', the next symbol is 't68', which must come from NT23.\n\nLooking at NT23's rules, the next possible symbols come from its expansion. So, if NT23 is being used to produce 't68', we need to see if any production of NT23 leads to 't68' or, more accurately, leads to a sequence that includes 't68'.\n\nLooking again, perhaps in the grammar, the production might generate 't68' via some chain.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules for NT23. Wait, is there a production for NT23 that directly leads to a terminal? Looking through the provided rules:\n\nNo, all the productions involving NT23 are either toNT45 NT53 or through other Nts. So, to get 't68', we need to trace back through the production chain.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be parsed correctly.\n\nFirst element is 't48' from NT7, which is S's production S1. So the remaining string is 't68 t96 t10 ...'.\n\nNow, the next element is 't68', which must come from NT23. Let's look at what NT23 can produce. NT23's rules are to produce NT45 and NT53. So the 't68' must come from one of the terminal symbols in NT45 or NT53's production chains.\n\nLooking at NT45: NT45 -> NT99 NT95.\n\nLooking at NT99: NT99 -> NT28 NT18.\n\nThen NT28 -> NT66 (since in the grammar, NT28 can produce 't66') and NT18. Wait, NT28 is also defined as NT28 -> NT66 NT18, and NT66 can produce 't51' (rule NT66 -> 't51').\n\nWait, then from NT28, if it produces NT66, which can produce 't51', then perhaps that's where 't66' comes from?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let's try to map the possible production steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nStarting with t48: that must come from NT7, which is the first part of S's production.\n\nSo S -> NT7 NT23\n\nSo, the string must start as t48 followed by the expansion of NT23.\n\nNext in the string is t68. So, NT23 must expand to t68 and something else.\n\nWait, but NT23's production only goes to NT45 NT53, not directly to a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-489","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go directly to a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the start symbol is S, and from the given grammar, S can produce either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Since S is at the top level, the string will be built by expanding S.\n\nLooking at the string: `t48 t33 t86 t62 t17 t86 t68 t96 t57 t35 t86 t86 t57 t48 t71 t36 t66 t96 t41 t85 t71 t87 t41 t41 t41 t57 t57`.\n\nAll these tokens are terminals, so the string must be derived from S by expanding all non-terminals into terminals following the grammar rules.\n\nI'll try to break down the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if each terminal can be matched by the productions.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t48. Let's see if t48 can come from NT7 or NT23.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT7's production rules:\n- NT7 -> NT40 NT96\n- NT7 doesn't appear in any other rule, except in NT23 as NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, and then those may lead back. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT7 only appears on the left side of one production, which is NT7 \u2192 NT40 NT96.\n\nSo, NT7 can only produce NT40 NT96. Let's see if t48 can be part of that. Looking at NT40's productions: NT40 \u2192 't71', so NT40 produces t71, which is t71. Then, NT7 \u2192 NT40 NT96 would expand to 't71' followed by whatever NT96 produces.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t48. So that doesn't match. Let's check if t48 can come from another non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, t48 appears in NT7: since NT7 can only be NT40 NT96, which would make the first part t40. But our string starts with t48. So perhaps the first part of S is NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, S can be NT97 NT54. Let me check NT97's productions. From the rules, NT97 \u2192 't31'. So NT97 is a terminal 't31'. So the first part of the string must be 't31', but the string starts with 't48'. That's a problem because S \u2192 NT97 NT54 would start the string with 't31', which doesn't match the given string's first token 't48'.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the entire string starts with NT7, which goes to NT40 NT96. NT40 is 't71', so the first two tokens would be t71 followed by NT96.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t48 t33. If S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then the first token should be from NT7, but NT7 produces t71, which is t71, not t48. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure. Let me try to reconstruct the structure step by step.\n\nPerhaps the string is built in a certain order. Let's try to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. The string starts with t48, which might match if NT7 produces t48 somehow. Wait, looking at NT7's rules: NT7 \u2192 NT40 NT96. NT40 is 't71', and NT96 is 't86'. So S \u2192 NT7 NT23 would expand to t71 t86 ... which doesn't match the string starting with t48.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is NT97, but NT97 is 't31', which doesn't match the first token.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong starting point. Wait, no\u2014the string starts with t48, so if S is NT7 NT23, then NT7 must expand to t48. But looking at NT7's rules again, NT7 only expands to 't71' via NT40 \u2192 't71', so t48 can't come from NT7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a non-terminal that produces t48. Let me check all the productions to see if any non-terminal can produce 't48'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT54 \u2192 't12' and NT55 \u2192 't53', NT50 \u2192 't55' but that's from NT50 \u2192 NT45 NT1, which doesn't directly lead to t48.\n\nWait, looking further down, NT50 is used in other rules, but I don't see a production for a non-terminal directly producing t48 except possibly NT40, which produces t71, as in NT7 \u2192 NT40 NT96, which would then be 't71 t86'.\n\nWait, but in the initial part of the string, we have t48, which isn't produced by any rule I can see. So maybe the string isn't in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check if any rule directly produces t48. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't48' as a terminal. So any production that would require t48 must come from a chain of non-terminals that eventually produces t48 as a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, each production for a non-terminal on the left has two non-terminals on the right, except for some terminals like NT97 \u2192 't31', NT40 \u2192 't71', etc.\n\nSo any non-terminal that's part of the string must be expanded into two terminals, using their production rules, except when they directly go to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t48. So where can t48 come from? It must come from a non-terminal that has a production rule that eventually leads to t48. But looking at the rules, no non-terminal directly produces t48. So unless t48 can be produced by a chain of non-terminals, but that's not how it works in Chomsky Normal Form. Each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until you reach terminals.\n\nWait, but all non-terminals either produce other non-terminals or terminals. So for a production like A \u2192 BC, each B and C must be terminals or expanded further.\n\nIn this case, for the string to have t48, there must be a non-terminal that can derive t48 through a series of productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t48. So unless the string starts with a non-terminal that can produce t48 after expanding, which seems impossible because none of the non-terminals directly produce it.\n\nTherefore, the string must not be in the language because none of the non-terminals derive t48 directly or indirectly.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT40 \u2192 't71', NT28 \u2192 't36', NT84 \u2192 't57', etc. There's no rule that produces 't48' anywhere on the right-hand side except as a component of another rule.\n\nWait, let's see: for example, NT8 \u2192 't32' and 't19'. Does any rule produce t48? It seems not. So t48 can't be part of any expansion, so the string containing t48 cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the string is expanded. Maybe S can produce another non-terminal that eventually produces t48. But looking at all the productions starting with S, it can only produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Neither of these directly produce t48. The first would expand to t71 t86, as NT7 \u2192 NT40 NT96 (t71 t86) and NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, etc., which might lead to other terminals, but the first token is t48, which isn't among them.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, NT54 \u2192 't93' and others like that.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t48 t36 t96 t41 t36 t33 t84 t35 t96 t51 t10 t17 t41 t13 t13 t96 t41 t13 t51 t99 t17 t41 t66 t33 t85 t57 t57`. I notice that it's a sequence of terminals. My job is to see if this sequence can be derived starting from S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation produces a string of two terminals or two non-terminals. I need to see if the string can be built up in such a way, possibly by splitting the string into pairs and checking if each pair can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the string as a sequence of pairs. Since it's 27 elements long, which is odd, that might be a problem because each step in a CNF grammar splits non-terminals into two, leading to a string of even length. But maybe the initial S can produce a string that's broken down into smaller parts, so perhaps the overall string is a combination that allows for this odd number. Hmm, but wait, each step in the derivation from S would have to double the length, so starting from S which is a single non-terminal, the first step would create two non-terminals, then each of those could split again, so the length would grow by a power of two. But here, the string has 27 elements, which isn't a power of two. That might be a hint that it's not generated by this grammar, but I can't be sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a concatenation of several productions that can be fit together. Let me look for the first few tokens and see if they correspond to any grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is 't48'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't48'. Scanning through the grammar rules, I see NT48 \u2192 't96' and sometimes other rules, but not directly 't48'. Wait, looking again, NT46 \u2192 't37' and NT48 \u2192 't96' and 't86'. So 't48' doesn't directly appear as a terminal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the NT48 rules. I see NT48 \u2192 't96' and also another rule: NT48 \u2192 't96'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me list the NT48 rules again. From the grammar:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT96 NT23\nNT98 \u2192 NT48 NT54\nSo wait, perhaps I might be looking at NT48 in a wrong way. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at the full list of NT rules, I see:\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86\nNT86 is another rule, but not directly leading to t48. Let me go through each NT rule to find which non-terminals can produce 't48' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed that NT40 \u2192 't71', NT41 \u2192 't68', NT22 \u2192 't57', and others. But 't48' isn't listed as a terminal in the provided grammar. Wait, but maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me see again: the grammar has productions where some non-terminals are set to a single terminal.\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT54 -> 't93'\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT8 -> 't19' (but wait, there's a NT8 rule that says NT8 \u2192 't32' and another rule where NT8 is on the left. Let me clarify: NT8 is a non-terminal, and its rules are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't40' NT96\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT53 \u2192 't85'\n- Other NT rules I may have missed.\n\nWait, let me look again to find which non-terminals produce 't48'. I just went through all the rules, and it seems none of the non-terminals directly produce 't48'. The closest is NT46 \u2192 't37' and NT48 \u2192 't96' and NT48 maybe elsewhere. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't85'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96' and 't86'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37' again\n- So, I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't48' directly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Perhaps 't48' comes from a different production. Let me check all non-terminals that might have 't48' in their expansion.\n\nLooking at NT96: NT96 \u2192 't48'?\n\nWait, let me go through each rule step by step.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86\n- NT86 \u2192 NT58 NT54\n- NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54\n- NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98\n- NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1\n- NT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95\n- NT7 \u2192 't48' (Here! Oh, wait, NT7 \u2192 't48'.)\n\nYes, I see now. So NT7 \u2192 't48'. So that's the first token. So the first part of the string is 't48', which comes from NT7.\n\nSo the first step in the derivation must involve expanding S into something that includes NT7 and NT23, based on the start rule S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo the initial S can produce something like NT7 followed by NT23. Each of these non-terminals can then be expanded further.\n\nLet's track the string step by step:\n\nThe string starts with 't48 t36 t96 t41 t36 t33 t84 t35 t96 t51 t10 t17 t41 t13 t13 t96 t41 t13 t51 t99 t17 t41 t66 t33 t85 t57 t57'\n\nSince S is a non-terminal, the first step is to split S into NT7 and NT23.\n\nSo after S, we have NT7 and NT23 as the first two symbols. Then, each of these can be expanded into their respective rules.\n\nFirst, NT7 \u2192 't48'\n\nNext, NT23. Looking at NT23's rules:\n\nHT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 or NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 or NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50.\n\nSo which one is it? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the string, the second token is 't36'. So after NT7, which is 't48', the next is 't36'. Let's check what can produce 't36'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't36' comes from NT28 \u2192 't36'.\n\nHmm, so I need to see if the NT23 can produce something that leads to 't36' in the next step.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me build the string step by step.\n\nAfter S, we have NT7 and NT23.\n\nAfter deriving NT7, 't48' is emitted.\n\nNow, we need to handle NT23. Let's see if we can derive 't36' from NT23.\n\nNT23's productions are:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-511","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine whether a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means that every production rule has a non-terminal on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The string I need to check is a series of tokens separated by spaces, so it's essentially a sequence of symbols.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided to understand its structure. The grammar starts with S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. So the start symbol S directly produces combinations of other non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals then further breaks down into more symbols, ultimately leading to terminals like 't48', 't68', etc. Some of these non-terminals have productions that lead directly to terminals, indicating the end of a derivation path.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t48 t68 t96 t86 t33 t99 t13 t13 t96 t41 t85 t13 t71 t23 t35 t86 t62 t41 t48 t17 t36 t66 t96 t41 t85 t48 t71 t85`. \n\nLooking at this string, it's a sequence of 27 tokens, all of which are terminals because none of them are non-terminals (like NT99 or NT57). Each token seems to correspond to a specific symbol produced by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation process is such that each step splits a single non-terminal into two, and each terminal is an atomic unit that can't be split further. To prove that the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a way to derive it step by step through the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach here is to model the string as a parse tree in reverse. Instead of starting from the start symbol S and expanding it, I can start from the entire string and see if it can be contracted down to S by replacing pairs of symbols with the left-hand side of the applicable productions.\n\nLet me list out the rules that produce terminals. For example, NT7 -> 't48', so NT7 can be replaced by t48. Similarly, NT54 -> 't12' and 't53', depending on which rule is applicable. Wait, looking back, the grammar has some rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, like:\n\n- NT54 -> 't12' and 't53' depending on which production it is.\n\nActually, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT54 has two rules: NT54 -> 't12' and NT54 -> 't53'. So when I see 't12' or 't53', I can replace them with NT54.\n\nSimilarly, NT97 -> 't31', so 't31' can be replaced with NT97.\n\nAnother example: NT8 -> 't32' and also appears in other rules, like NT8 being part of larger productions.\n\nEach terminal in the string corresponds to some non-terminal, so I can work backwards by grouping the string into pairs that match the left-hand sides of the productions, replacing them with corresponding non-terminals, and then checking if the resulting string can be further reduced in the same way until I reach S.\n\nLet me start. The string is:\n\nt48 t68 t96 t86 t33 t99 t13 t13 t96 t41 t85 t13 t71 t23 t35 t86 t62 t41 t48 t17 t36 t66 t96 t41 t85 t48 t71 t85\n\nI need to parse this from left to right, grouping into pairs and seeing if each pair can be matched by a left-hand side of a production, possibly breaking into smaller chunks.\n\nAn alternative method is to build the parse tree by checking if the string can be divided into parts that correspond to each production's right-hand side, considering each terminal as a leaf node.\n\nStarting the process in reverse: look for possible groupings towards the start.\n\n1. The first token is 't48'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't48'? Let's see the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT94 -> 't87', NT46 -> 't37', NT23 -> 't62', and others. Wait, directly:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT48's productions: Looking back, is there a NT48? Checking the rules above, I see:\n\nNT48: 't96' and another production (I think it's NT48 -> 't96' in multiple places, like NT48 -> 't86' might be part of a larger production, or are these separate?)\n\nWait, the grammar as given has entries like:\n\nNT48 -> 't96'\n\nand others like NT18 -> 't96' and NT54 -> 't53' perhaps. Wait, maybe I need to check all the rules again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT94 -> 't87' (from lines: NT94 -> NT96 NT98; another production? No, I think NT94 only has this and another: NT94 -> NT96 NT98, perhaps that's the only rule.

{"custom_id":"request-514","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol does not appear on the right-hand side of any production. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing, especially for algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the rules are of the form NT followed by two other NTs, and some are terminal symbols. For example, NT97 \u2192 't31' seems like a terminal production. Other rules, like S \u2192 NT7 NT23, are non-terminals splitting into other non-terminals. So this fits the CNF structure: non-terminals on the left, and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t51 t90 t41 t36 t33 t96 t62 t17 t86 t62 t17 t4 t32 t41 t41 t48 t35 t13 t36 t96 t41 t85 t57`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived by the given grammar. To do this, I can approach the problem by trying to parse the string using the grammar's rules, making sure that each token (each 't' followed by a number) is either a terminal that matches a right-hand side of a production or is generated by a sequence of non-terminals that eventually produce the required terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose. However, I might not remember all the details of CYK, so perhaps an alternative approach is to check if each symbol in the string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree bottom-up, ensuring each step follows the grammar rules. Let me try to see if I can match the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t48. I need to find a production that starts with t48. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t96 (so that's t96, not t48)\nNT28 \u2192 t36 (so t36)\nNT56 \u2192 t99\nNT23 \u2192 t62 (so t62)\nNT7 \u2192 t48 (yes, so NT7 \u2192 't48').\n\nSo the string starts with t48, which is produced by NT7. Therefore, the first part of the string is matched.\n\nNow, after t48 comes t51. So after NT7, what follows? Looking at the rules, NT7's production isn't given here; it only says NT7 \u2192 't48'. So the next non-terminal must be a child of NT7, but from the rules, NT7 only has a terminal production, so the next token must be t48. But the next token in the string is t51, which comes after t48. That suggests that after NT7, we have another non-terminal that produces t51. But looking at the NT rules, NT51 isn't present. Wait, in the rules, I don't see NT51 as a starting symbol. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps NT7 is part of a larger production. Let me think. The S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is a production; so S splits into NT7 and NT23. So the first split could be S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So the string starts with whatever is produced by NT7 and followed by whatever is produced by NT23.\n\nBut in this case, our string is a long sequence of t symbols. It might be a linear derivation starting from S.\n\nSo, the string starts with t48. To get t48, that's from NT7 \u2192 t48. Then, since S \u2192 NT7 NT23, the next token should come from NT23, which is t23. But the second token is t51, which isn't t23. Hmm, that suggests a problem.\n\nWait, no, if S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then the string should go t48 followed by the production of NT23. But NT23's production isn't given as a terminal, so it must be processed further. Let's see, in the NT23 rules, we have:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\nNT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16 (from the provided grammar)\nWait, no, looking at the rules, NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95.\nWait, but the number of non-terminals increases, so it's best to think about what produces t23.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the terminals are only single t followed by numbers. So any production that ends with a terminal is either a non-terminal that directly produces that terminal or a step in which a non-terminal eventually produces that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can list all the terminals:\n\n' t48 ', ' t51 ', ' t90 ', ' t41 ', ' t36 ', ' t33 ', ' t96 ', ' t62 ', ' t17 ', ' t86 ', ' t62 ', ' t17 ', ' t4 ', ' t32 ', ' t41 ', ' t41 ', ' t48 ', ' t35 ', ' t13 ', ' t36 ', ' t96 ', ' t41 ', ' t85 ', ' t57 '.\n\nSo the terminals are these t followed by numbers. Now, I need to see if the grammar can produce a string that starts with t48, then t51, and so on.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT97 \u2192 t31, NT99 \u2192 t..., etc. So, to get a long sequence, the parsing must involve multiple non-terminals deriving into other non-terminals until we get to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the leftmost derivation approach. Let's try building the string step by step starting from S.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The grammar for S is either S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT99 NT54. Since the string starts with t48, let's check which of these can produce that.\n\nFrom the rules, looking for NT7's production: NT7 \u2192 t48. So S can split into NT7 and NT23. Then, the string starts with t48, which matches NT7. Then, the next symbol should come from NT23.\n\nNow, what does NT23 produce? From the grammar, NT23 has several productions:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 (again)\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50 (again)\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT23 has two productions: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 and NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50.\n\nSo NT23 can produce two types of sequences. Let's see what each would yield.\n\nFirst, NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53.\n\nNow, NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95 (from the rules).\nThen, NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16.\nAnd NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18 (from different rules, I think).\n\nWait, let me list all the NT99 rules:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18\n\nWait, yes, from the grammar:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16\nNT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40\nNT28 \u2192 NT36 NT33\nNT56 \u2192 t99 (Wait, no, I think there's a mix here.)\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the NT rules might have NT28 \u2192 't36' or something else. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I can find:\n\nNT28 \u2192 't36'. So NT28 produces t36.\n\nSimilarly, NT40 \u2192 't40' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT40 \u2192 't71'?)\n\nWait, let me go through each rule step by step to find the terminals, as that's essential.\n\nFrom the provided grammar, the rules are:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT99 NT54\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\n\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, but let's break this down step by step to figure out the answer.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in CNF has each production rule on the left side of the arrow having exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right. Also, all rules are productions of two non-terminals, except maybe the start symbol. But looking at the provided grammar, I see that all rules are two non-terminals on the right, so that checks out.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t33 t96 t66 t96 t41 t36 t33 t85 t35 t86 t86 t86 t41 t41 t12 t25 t19 t48 t35 t66 t51 t23 t41 t13 t62 t48 t17 t85`.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do this, I think I should work backwards, starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string by expanding the symbols step by step, making sure that each expansion uses the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The given grammar has two productions for S:\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT93 NT54\n\nSo the initial expansion from S could be either NT7 NT23 or NT93 NT54. Let's consider both possibilities separately because the string we have doesn't have any symbols that obviously point to one or the other directly.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't48'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't48' when expanded.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that several non-terminals have 't' as their terminals.

The grammar is a bit extensive with various productions and terminals, mostly letters like t followed by numbers. The string provided is a sequence of these terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar consists of. It looks like the non-terminals are things like S, NT99, NT58, etc., each of which can produce other strings of non-terminals or eventually terminals like 't' followed by numbers. The string to evaluate is a series of t followed by numbers, so it's all terminals.\n\nThe approach I should take is to try to derive the given string using the provided grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means that any derivation from the start symbol S must be such that each step replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. \n\nGiven that, I might need to build a parse tree or track the steps using the productions until I reach the given string. Alternatively, I can represent the string as an abstract syntax tree (AST) and see if the grammar allows for that structure.\n\nBut, manually doing this for a long string would be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for the structure of the string and see which non-terminals could produce that substring.\n\nLooking at the string: t48 t66 t96 t41 t66 t68 t96 t86 t66 t96 t41 t85 t35 t96 t66 t96 t41 t85 t35 t87 t41 t41 t41 t48 t35 t85 t48 t17 t85.\n\nLet me see if I can find patterns or repeated sequences that correspond to the productions.\n\nI notice that t48 appears multiple times, as does t66, t96, t41, t85, etc. So perhaps each of these is a terminal result of some production.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\n\nSo S is a top-level production that splits into NT7 and NT23.

So maybe S starts with NT96, which produces 't48' as part of the breakdown.\n\nWait, let me see the first part of the string: t48. So if the first part is from NT96, which can produce 't48' when it's a terminal, then perhaps that's a starting point.\n\nWait, but NT96 \u2192 't48' is a rule. So in the string, the first symbol is t48. So that could be a production from NT96. So perhaps the start could be:\n\nS \u2192 NT96 NT23\n\nThen, NT96 could be 't48', and NT23 would produce the rest. But let me check the rest of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t48, then t66, t96, etc. So after t48, we have t66, which is t66. Let me see if I can find a production that matches this.\n\nLooking for t66 as a terminal: from the rules, NT28 \u2192 't66'. So perhaps NT28 is the source of t66. So in the next production after t48, we could have NT28.\n\nSo maybe after NT96 produces t48, NT23 (from S \u2192 NT96 NT23) needs to produce the rest, but wait that would require NT23 to produce two parts. Wait no: S is NT96 NT23, so when both produce terms, the entire string is two terms. So the string would start as t48 followed by whatever NT23 produces.\n\nBut the string after t48 is t66 t96 t41 t66 t68 t96 t86 t66 t96 t41 t85 t35 t96 t66 t96 t41 t85 t35 t87 t41 t41 t41 t48 t35 t85 t48 t17 t85.\n\nWait, that's a long string, so perhaps it's impossible for S to produce just t48 and the rest, unless NT23 produces the entire remaining string, but NT23's production is either terminals or as per other rules.\n\nWait, let me get this straight: S \u2192 NT96 NT23\n\nIf NT96 is 't48', then NT23 needs to produce the rest of the string. Let me check the production for NT23. Looking through, I see NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. So NT23 is broken down into NT45 and NT53. Each of these can further produce other symbols.\n\nAlternatively, NT23 could produce 't66' if it has a terminal rule, but looking back, NT23's rules don't have a terminal production. So for NT23, I need to see all possible productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18\n\nWait, but NT23 is being used, so perhaps it breaks further.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to model the string as a tree.\n\nLet me start from the root S and see if the string can result from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT96 NT23\n\nSo in the string, the first part is t48, which would be NT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given with production rules, most of which are non-terminals (like S, NT99, NT58, etc.) on the left side and combinations of non-terminals and terminals on the right. The terminals seem to be the letters 't' followed by numbers (like t31, t40) and some are directly mapped to specific numbers (like NT23 -> 't62').\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t68 t96 t96 t33 t84 t32 t48 t17 t85 t48 t71 t85 t35 t96 t36 t96 t41 t85 t71 t23 t35 t96 t86 t93 t25 t19 t41 t57 t57`.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be produced by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means that the derivation tree will be such that each step replaces a single non-terminal with two others or with a terminal.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should look for a way to break down the string into parts that correspond to the terminal symbols in the grammar. Since the grammar can be followed by two symbols at a time, except where a non-terminal expands to a single terminal.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and their productions to see if I can work backwards or find a path.\n\nFirst, the top-level symbol is S, which according to the grammar can be rewritten as either NT99 and NT7, or NT97 and NT54. So, the start is S \u2192 NT99 NT7 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's analyze each possibility.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it starts with t48 t68. Now, t68 is a terminal. Looking at the productions, t68 appears in several NT productions. For example, NT68 isn't a rule I see; wait, perhaps I confused the numbers. Wait, let me check the production rules again. I think I need to list all the production rules to see which ones result in t68.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 t48 and t68 (as seen in the rules, NT84 \u2192 't48' 't68' appears twice: once in two productions for NT84). Also, NT66 \u2192 t51, which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, looking again, I see:\n\nIn the rules, NT84 can produce 't48' and another 't68' in one of its productions (wait, when I look, I see:\n\nNT84 -> 't58' 't86' (from the given rules: NT84 \u2192 t84, also NT84 appears in other productions).

So, for example, NT54 -> 't12', which would mean that the non-terminal NT54 can be replaced by the terminal t12.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the way the string is constructed is by following the rules step by step, each time replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nSince the string is quite long, I might need a systematic approach. Perhaps I should work backwards from the string, trying to find if each terminal can be matched by the corresponding rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to split the string into parts that can be matched by the terminal parts of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals have rules that include two terminals as the last two symbols. For example, S -> NT7 NT23. NT7 is 't48' according to the rule NT7 -> 't48'? Wait, let me check the grammar. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT77 isn't mentioned. Wait, perhaps I need to confirm which non-terminals map to which terminals.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar rules:\n\nI see that NT54 -> 't12', NT97 -> 't31', NT40 -> 't71', etc. So whenever a non-terminal appears in a production, its expansion might include a terminal. But in many cases, the rules are combinations of non-terminals, unless a rule directly ends in a terminal.\n\nSo, I think the strategy is to process the string from right, trying to see if we can match the grammar derivations.\n\nBut considering that I might get stuck, perhaps I should model this as a parsing problem and try to apply the given grammar to parse the string.\n\nLet me start by writing out the string again:\n\nt48 t51 t90 t41 t66 t13 t96 t41 t36 t33 t96 t62 t71 t96 t13 t96 t41 t85 t96 t41 t41 t41 t57 t48 t71 t66 t13 t96 t41 t85.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 33 tokens long.

{"custom_id":"request-576","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is \"t48 t33 t57 t17 t96 t33 t99 t36 t68 t96 t87 t41 t57 t48 t17 t66 t51 t99 t35 t41 t13 t68 t96 t85 t37 t25 t19 t48 t17 t85 t57\". \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form requires all productions to be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Wait, but looking at the grammar, some productions end with terminals, like NT54 -> 't12' or NT50 -> 't85'. So it seems that after the initial steps, the grammar eventually transitions into terminals.\n\nSince the string is a series of terminals, I think the approach should be to see if we can parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing in CNF can be done using the CYK algorithm, which is efficient but requires the grammar to be in CNF. Alternatively, I could try to manually trace the derivation steps or see if the string can be broken down into the productions.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their productions in the grammar to get a better overview.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, S starts the derivation with either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54.\n\nLet's consider the first option, S \u2192 NT7 NT23. NT7 can produce 't48' because one of the productions is NT75? Wait, looking back, I see that NT75 isn't there. Wait, looking at the rules, I see that NT7 has the production NT7 \u2192 't48'. So NT7 can directly produce 't48'.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then the first part of the string 't48' is matched by NT7. Then we have NT23, which can produce 't62', according to the production NT23 \u2192 't62'. So so far, the string starts with 't48 t62...', but in the given string, after 't48' we have 't33'. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe this path is not the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the second option S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So NT97 \u2192 't31' according to the productions. So the first part would be 't31', but the string starts with 't48', so that doesn't match. Wait a minute, did I miss any production for NT97 or NT7?\n\nWait, looking back, yes, NT97 can produce 't31' as per the production NT97 \u2192 't31'. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't48'. So S \u2192 NT7 NT23 would start with 't48 t62...', but the actual string starts with 't48 t33...', which is different. So that means this path is not applicable. Therefore, perhaps S must go through another production.\n\nWait, but let me check the string again. The string is \"t48 t33 t57 t17 t96 t33 t99 t36 t68 t96 t87 t41 t57 t48 t17 t66 t51 t99 t35 t41 t13 t68 t96 t85 t37 t25 t19 t48 t17 t85 t57\". So the first token is 't48', which could come from NT7 or NT1. Looking back at the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't48' and NT1 \u2192 't57'. Wait, but the grammar also has NT5 \u2192 't32' and others, but the initial productions are S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, but if S cannot start with 't31' or 't48' because its productions are S \u2192 NT97 NT54 or S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then both NT7 and NT97 can produce terminals on their own. Wait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps in the initial step, S can produce two non-terminals, each of which might produce a terminal later.\n\nWait, for example, the first token is 't48', which could be from NT7, so then we need to produce 't48' via NT7. Then what comes after 't48'? The next token is 't33'. Let me see where 't33' comes from. Looking through the productions, I don't immediately see a production where a non-terminal leads to 't33'. Wait, maybe it's part of a production chain.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I see that NT33 isn't directly a non-terminal. Let me look for 't33'. Looking through all the rules, I see NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18, which could eventually produce 't66' from NT28 \u2192 't66'. Hmm, but 't33' isn't appearing there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe instead of trying to follow each production step-by-step, I should parse the string and see if each terminal can be generated by some non-terminal and the non-terminals can be derived from each other in a way that matches the string.\n\nGiven that, let me split the string into individual terminals:\nt48, t33, t57, t17, t96, t33, t99, t36, t68, t96, t87, t41, t57, t48, t17, t66, t51, t99, t35, t41, t13, t68, t96, t85, t37, t25, t19, t48, t17, t85, t57.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of terminals. It might help to see if each terminal is produced by some non-terminal, and then check if the structure of the string can be matched.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production either combines non-terminals or produces a terminal. So each non-terminal should be able to derive some sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me try to go step by step:\n\n1. The first terminal is 't48'. Looking at the grammar, 't48' is the production for NT7 and for NT98. Also, looking for other non-terminals that have 't48' in their productions: Looking, I don't see any other non-terminals besides NT7 and NT98. So the first non-terminal must be either NT7 or NT98.\n\nIf it's NT7, then it can produce 't48', and the rest of the string would need to be generated from NT23 because the first production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So after 't48', the next part would be generated by NT23.\n\nLooking at 't33' next. Let's see if NT23 can produce 't33'. Looking at the productions of NT23:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT23 \u2192 't68' (Production 13), NT23 \u2192 't19' (Production 24), and NT23 \u2192 NT48 NT53 or others. Hmm, no 't33' so far. Alternatively, perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider possible transitions.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the string and see how it can be broken down.\n\nThe string starts with 't48'. The next is 't33'.\n\nBut let me see: NT7 produces 't48', so after that, NT23 must produce some part. Now, looking at the production for NT23: in the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 NT48 NT53 (Production 14) and another NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50 (Production 21) and another NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 (Production 26) and another NT23 \u2192 NT66 NT51 (Production 29) and another (Production 2) which is the initial S \u2192 NT23... Wait, no, that's the terminal.\n\nWait, no, the productions for NT23 are in the list. Let me list them:\n\nLooking at NT23:\n- NT23 \u2192 NT48 NT53 (Produced from NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT23 appears in several productions. Wait, the list provided includes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-573","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding what each part of the problem entails.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. This should make the parsing a bit easier because I don't have to worry about more complex forms. The start symbol is S, and it can produce two different options: NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So any string derived from this grammar will start with one of these two options. The string given starts with 't48', which I guess corresponds to one of the terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some of the symbols like NT7, NT23, etc., are non-terminals that can further produce other symbols. The string we're evaluating has a long sequence of 't' followed by numbers. I think each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal symbol that we get directly from the grammar.\n\nSo, the first thing I notice is that the string starts with 't48'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT50 can produce 't50' or 't99' in some cases. But wait, in the initial productions, S produces either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Let me check those:\n\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23: The first part could derive into 't48' because there's a rule NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1, but I'm not sure. Wait, looking at the rules, I see that NT54 is directly mapped to 't12' and also appears in other productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's break down the string and see if I can trace a derivation path.\n\nThe string is: t48 t68 t96 t96 t51 t99 t17 t41 t85 t35 t96 t66 t96 t41 t85 t35 t96 t62 t86 t41 t41 t41 t41 t57 t48 t17 t66 t66 t96 t41 t85.\n\nEach of these terminals is part of some production. Let's see:\n\n- t48: Looking at the grammar, NT98 can become 't68', but where does 't48' come from? Wait, some of these might be derived from non-terminals. For example, NT46 \u2192 't13' and NT48 \u2192 't96', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe some non-terminals expand into multiple terminals.\n\nWait, another approach: let's look up each terminal to see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't51'\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't85'\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't4' or 't84'\n\n- NT86 \u2192 't25'\n\n- NT57 comes from NT1 \u2192 't57'\n\n- Wait, looking back, NT1 is a non-terminal. So for example, NT1 can produce 't57'.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try parsing the string step by step, trying to apply the grammar's rules to see if the string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think recursively. Each part of the string must come from a production starting from S, and each non-terminal step should produce the next part.\n\nLet me start by seeing if the string can be broken down into two parts as per the initial S productions.\n\nThe string starts with 't48 t68'.\n\nLooking at NT48 \u2192 't96', so that's not 't48'. Wait, maybe 't48' is part of another non-terminal's production. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT56 \u2192 't10', but where does 't48' come from?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check all the rules to see which ones produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't96' (from NT98)\n- NT46 \u2192 't13' and 't37'\n\nWait, no, NT46's production is either 't13' or 't37'.

Maybe it's easier to work from the start symbol and see what sequences we can get.\n\nS can produce either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nLooking at NT7, but I don't see any rule for NT7. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that most non-terminals on the left appear multiple times. Wait, the initial S rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\n\nBut is NT7 defined elsewhere? Looking through the rules, I don't see any production for NT7. That means NT7 must be a terminal or undefined. Since the string starts with t48, maybe NT7 isn't involved here.

{"custom_id":"request-590","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let me start by understanding what each part of the grammar and the string represents.\n\nFirst, the grammar. It's in CNF, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, I see that the start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So, S generates two options: a combination of NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54. NT stands for non-terminals, so these are the nodes that eventually get expanded into terminals.\n\nNext, each non-terminal is further broken down into other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT99 can be split into NT66 and NT16, which in turn can produce more NTs or terminals. I notice that some non-terminals directly expand into a single terminal, like NT54 \u2192 't12' or NT40 \u2192 't71'. So these are the leaves of the grammar's tree.\n\nThe string to check is: t48 t68 t96 t57 t35 t86 t51 t90 t41 t13 t51 t23 t41 t66 t68 t96 t99 t66 t62 t37 t25 t35 t96 t86 t48 t71 t13 t86 t48 t71 t36 t62.\n\nSo, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of expansions. Let me break down the string and see if I can map it back to the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure. The string starts with t48, which I know is produced by NT7 \u2192 t48 (from the grammar: NT7 \u2192 't48'). So, the first two symbols must be part of NT7 and NT23, as S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Alternatively, it could be the other production S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, no, the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals, either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. So, the first part of the string could be the expansion of either NT7 or NT97. Let me check the first part.\n\nThe first token is t48, which is NT7 \u2192 t48. So that suggests that the first non-terminal is NT7. Therefore, the string must start with the expansion of NT7 followed by NT23. So the sequence would be t48 followed by something from NT23.\n\nLooking at the string: t48 is first, next is t68. Let me check what NT23 expands into. From the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. Then, NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95, and NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16. So, the expansion might involve multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct a parse tree from the string and see if it can be generated by the grammar. Alternatively, check if the string can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me see: Starting with S \u2192 NT7 NT23. NT7 \u2192 t48. So first token is t48. Then, NT23 needs to expand. From the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. So, after t48, we have t68, which might come from NT45 or NT53.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95. Also, NT53 \u2192 NT85. NT85 \u2192 NT40 NT25. Wait, no, wait, let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, let me make a list of the non-terminals and their possible expansions:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n- NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54\n- NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98\n- NT66 \u2192 NT51 (since NT66 \u2192 NT51 in one production)\n- NT58 \u2192 NT86 NT23\nWait, actually, looking at the given grammar, I see that some have multiple options, which might complicate things.

{"custom_id":"request-592","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what I have.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see a bunch of rules, each starting with something like S -> NT7 NT23, which are all non-terminals. Each non-terminal eventually resolves into a terminal symbol, like 't93' or just 't93' as in NT54.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: `t48 t36 t96 t41 t66 t51 t90 t41 t13 t68 t96 t86 t68 t96 t96 t86 t86 t41 t41 t57 t57 t71 t23 t71 t96 t51 t90 t41 t85 t41 t57 t57`.\n\nFirst, I'll map out the string as a list of tokens for clarity. The string has 33 tokens.\n\nNow, I'll try to parse this string using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or a simple approach of checking if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nBut another approach is to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules step by step. Each production starts with S, and S seems to be the main start symbol. Looking at the initial production rules, I see:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo the string starts with either S that becomes NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54. Let me check the string:\n\nThe string starts with t48, t36, etc. Looking at the initial production, for S->NT7 NT23, I need to see if the string can start with the symbols derived from NT7 and NT23.\n\nAlternatively, if it starts with S->NT97 NT54, I'll check that path.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT97 production is 't31', which doesn't match t48 as the first token. So, S -> NT97... can be eliminated since the string starts with t48. So I must consider S->NT7 NT23.\n\nNow, NT7 is a non-terminal. From the grammar, NT7 has a production -> 't48'. So the first symbol t48 matches NT7. So the next symbol must match NT23.\n\nWhat is NT23's production? Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\n... and so on. Wait, that's a bit complex. Let me list all the possible productions for NT23.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT23 has two rules:\n1. NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n2. NT23 -> NT13 NT50\nSo, initially, I need to see if the second symbol can be derived from either of these.\n\nThe second symbol after t48 is t36. So does t36 match the production of NT23? Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT23's first option: NT45 and NT53. I need to see if the next part can be derived as NT45 -> something and NT53 -> something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, the next token after t48 is t36, so we need to see if t36 is in any of NT23's productions. But from the given grammar, I don't see NT23 directly being a terminal, so t36 must be the result of some intermediate derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for a way to derive the given string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can map the string into a derivation path.\n\nLet me start the parsing:\n\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n   So first token is NT7, which is t48.\n   Next token is NT23, so second token is t36. So we need to see if NT23 can produce t36 in some way.\n\nBut looking at the productions for NT23 again:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nor\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\n\nSo, to produce the second symbol t36, which is a terminal, we need to look for any production for NT23 that can directly produce t36. But in the grammar, NT23 doesn't directly produce t36. Instead, it produces combinations of non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the first production is S->NT97 NT54, but looking back, NT97's production is 't31', which doesn't match the first token t48.\n\nSo S must be using S->NT7 NT23, and the first symbol t48 matches NT7. The second symbol must be the result of NT23's production.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT23 can't produce a terminal directly; it only produces combinations of non-terminals. So unless NT23 can derive into a string that starts with a terminal, this approach seems tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the derivation involves multiple steps, breaking down each non-terminal until terminals are reached.\n\nLet me outline the string as a sequence of terminals:\n\nt48, t36, t96, t41, t66, t51, t90, t41, t13, t68, t96, t86, t68, t96, t96, t86, t86, t41, t41, t57, t57, t71, t23, t71, t96, t51, t90, t41, t85, t41, t57, t57.\n\nThere are 33 tokens.\n\nGiven that the initial production is S->NT7 NT23, which becomes t48 (from NT7) and whatever NT23 can produce.\n\nSo the first two tokens are t48 and t36. So after t48, we have t36, which should be the first terminal of NT23's expansion.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the only ways to produce NT23 are as:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\n... etc.\n\nSo each of these rules will produce a chain of NTs until a terminal is reached.\n\nLet me see if, from NT23, can we reach t36. Let's simulate the expansion:\n\nStarting with NT23, let's see:\n\nProduction 1: NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nNow, we have NT45 NT53.\n\nNT45 has production -> NT99 NT95. So NT45 becomes NT99 and NT95.\n\nSo now, NT99 NT95 NT53.\n\nNT99 has production -> NT28 NT18.\n\nSo, NT99 becomes NT28 and NT18.\n\nNow, the string so far: NT28, NT18, NT95, NT53.\n\nNT28 has production -> NT36, which is a terminal (from production NT28 -> 't36').\n\nWait, yes, looking back at the grammar, NT28 is defined as:\n\nNT28 -> 't36'\n\nSo the expansion would be:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18\nSo now, we have NT28, NT18, NT95, NT53.\n\nNT28 is 't36'. So that matches the second token.\n\nSo from NT23, expanding step by step, we get t36 as the second token.

{"custom_id":"request-614","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols. \n\nFirst, I should understand what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that all production rules be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. This form is useful for parsing algorithms because it simplifies the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that it starts with a start symbol S, which can produce NT7 T23 or NT97 T54. Also, I see that many non-terminals (NTs) have production rules that break down into further non-terminals, which in turn resolve into terminals. Some non-terminals directly produce terminals, which are given at the end of the production rules. For example, NT54 \u2192 't12' and NT55 \u2192 't1'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: `t48 t68 t96 t96 t86 t17 t87 t41 t53 t25 t35 t96 t36 t96 t41 t66 t68 t96 t96 t62 t96 t41 t12 t25 t32 t57 t48 t35 t85 t57 t48 t71 t85`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do this, I think I can approach it by working backwards from the string, trying to see if each part can be produced by the grammar. Alternatively, I could model this as a parsing problem, using the grammar to parse the string step by step.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual tokens. Each token in the string is a terminal symbol, which must match a production in the grammar. So I should first check if each terminal in the string is directly produced by some non-terminal, i.e., if there's a production rule for that NT which ends with that terminal.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I need to find which NTs produce each terminal in the string. Let's list out the terminals in the string: t48, t68, t96, t96, t86, t17, t87, t41, t53, t25, t35, t96, t36, t96, t41, t66, t68, t96, t96, t62, t96, t41, t12, t25, t32, t57, t48, t35, t85, t57, t48, t71, t85.\n\nWait, I think I misread the string. Let me recheck. The string is: \n\n`t48 t68 t96 t96 t86 t17 t87 t41 t53 t25 t35 t96 t36 t96 t41 t66 t68 t96 t96 t62 t96 t41 t12 t25 t32 t57 t48 t35 t85 t57 t48 t71 t85`.\n\nSo, each of these is a terminal, and I need to see if each of these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI'll start from the beginning. The string starts with t48.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that NT54 \u2192 't12' and NT86 \u2192 't25' (I think). Wait, looking through the rules, NT46 \u2192 't13' and NT23 \u2192 't62', but t48 is not directly a terminal; it must be derived from a non-terminal. Wait, perhaps t48 comes from NT48 \u2192 't96'? Or perhaps another way.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals in the string and see which NTs can produce them.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n- NT7 \u2192 't48' (because NT7 \u2192 't7'), right? Wait, looking at the production rules: I don't see NT7 \u2192 't48' directly. Let me check. Wait, for NT7 \u2192 't48'\u2014yes, that's an option.\n\nWait, let me go through each production and see which NTs produce the terminals in the string.\n\nFor t48: Looking at all the production rules, I see that NT7 \u2192 't48' is an option. So NT7 can produce t48.\n\nSo the first part: t48 would come from NT7. Now, the next terminal is t68.\n\nLooking at the productions, is there an NT that produces t68? Yes, NT41 \u2192 't68' because in the production rules, I see NT41 \u2192 't68'.\n\nSo t68 comes from NT41.\n\nNext, t96: which NT produces t96? Looking through, for example, NT54 \u2192 't12' is a terminal, but I need to find if any NT can produce t96. Let me check: NT96 \u2192 't96' (since one of the productions is NT96 \u2192 't96').\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking back: the production for NT96 shows that it's used in NT48 \u2192 't96' and NT16 \u2192 't90', etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I spot NT96: 'NT96 \u2192 't96''. So yes, NT96 itself can produce t96. So the next terminal, t96, comes from NT96.\n\nWait, but in my previous step, I had t96 after t68. So let's see: The string after t48, t68 is t96, t96. So let's see:\n\nt48 comes from NT7.\n\nt68 comes from NT41.\n\nThen the next two t96s: let's see if we can get them from NT96, or perhaps from some other NT.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this by looking for the leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me think: the string is t48 t68 t96 t96 t86 t17 t... So let's see.\n\nThe first symbol is t48, which comes from NT7. So the start symbol S must derive a production that includes NT7 on the left. Looking at the grammar, S can produce NT7 NT23. So S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So after S, we have NT7 and NT23.\n\nNow, NT7 produces t48. So that accounts for the first symbol. Now, the next part is NT23. Let's see what NT23 can produce.\n\nIn the production rules, I see NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 and also NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50. So NT23 can produce either of these. Let's see which path is needed here.\n\nLooking at the next symbol after t48 is t68, which comes from NT41. So after NT23, which can produce NT45 or NT13, and then the next symbol is t68, I need to see if either NT45 or NT13 can contribute to that.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT7 NT23, we have:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t48\n- NT23 \u2192 ?\n\nThe next symbol is t68, which must come from NT23 after some transformation. So perhaps NT23 can produce another sequence that leads to t68.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions:\n\n1. NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n2. NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nLet's explore both.\n\nOption 1: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53.\n\nNow, we have to see if NT45 and NT53 can produce t68 and then other parts.\n\nNT45: Let's look at its production rules. NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95. So NT45 would split into NT99 and NT95.\n\nThen, NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16. So NT99 becomes NT66 and NT16.\n\nNT66 \u2192 't51', and NT16 \u2192 't90'.\n\nSo NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95 \u2192 NT66 NT16.\n\nSo after NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, which splits into NT45 and NT53.\n\nNT45: NT99 NT95 \u2192 't51' and 't90'.\n\nSo the first symbols would be t51 and t90 from"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see it's a set of productions. For example, S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, and so on. The grammar is not expanded much, but I can see that each production is split into two parts, some non-terminals and some terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals (like t48, t33, etc.), so each terminal in the string must be matched by a production step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation produces two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. Since the string is long, I think the derivation tree would have a structure that allows each part of the string to be broken down into these steps.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t48. I should check if any production has t48 on the right-hand side. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT48 \u2192 t96. Wait, that's a terminal. So NT48 produces t96. But in the string, the first token is t48, which isn't produced directly by any NT.\n\nWait, that can't be right because t48 isn't a terminal in any production except NT48 \u2192 t96. So perhaps t48 is part of a non-terminal's production. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT48 is a non-terminal, and it produces t96, not t48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Looking through, I see NT48 doesn't appear, but looking at the productions:\n\nWait, the production NT40 \u2192 't71' and NT8 \u2192 't32', and NT56 \u2192 't10', etc. Also, I see NT94 \u2192 't87', NT55 \u2192 't53', etc.\n\nWait, is there any production where a non-terminal directly produces t48? Let me search through all productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't immediately see a production for NT48 \u2192 t48. Wait, but I see NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86, and NT48 is on the right side, but not as a terminal. So t48 must be part of a longer production. For example, NT8 \u2192 't32', which is a terminal, and NT56 \u2192 't10'.\n\nWait, the string starts with t48, t33, t23, etc. I need to see if there's a way to derive this sequence.\n\nLet me think about the structure: Each production produces two symbols. So, to derive the string, it must be split into units that can be produced by the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me try to break the string into parts that can correspond to the right-hand sides of the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t48 t33 t23 t35 t86 t68 t96 t86 t68 t96 t10 t13 t86 t13 t17 t86 t51 t10 t17 t41 t85 t71 t87 t41 t41 t41 t48 t17 t66 t86 t57 t57 t57.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to see in segments. Let's try to see if each pair of tokens can be matched by a production.\n\nStarting with t48: I need a production where t48 is either the left terminal or part of a two-symbol production.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial string is built from larger non-terminals that are split into smaller parts. Maybe I should start from the beginning and see if the first token can be generated.\n\nt48: Is there any production that starts with t48 as a terminal? From the grammar, I don't see a production where any NT directly produces t48. However, perhaps t48 is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, maybe the first two tokens, t48 t33, come from a single NT's production. Let's check if any NT \u2192 t48 t33 exists in the grammar. Looking through, I don't see such a production. Alternatively, perhaps t48 is part of a non-terminal's production as a terminal, and t33 is another part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t48 t33 comes from a production where the non-terminal splits into t48 and something else, which then leads to t33. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t48 is part of a longer expansion. Let's think recursively.\n\nBut this might take too long. Another approach is to see if the string can be split into segments that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list some key terminals and possible productions.\n\nLooking at t48, possible NT productions that include t48 as part of the right-hand side. Wait, but in the grammar, the only terminals are single letters after t, like t48, t33, etc. So, if any production in the grammar has a right-hand side that includes t48 as one of the symbols, that could be a starting point.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t32\n- NT56 \u2192 t10\n- NT94 \u2192 t87\n- NT40 \u2192 t71\n- NT8 \u2192 t32 (duplicate)\n- NT56 \u2192 t10 (duplicate)\n- NT98 \u2192 t40 NT90 (Wait, no, it's t40 followed by NT90, so 't40' is a terminal and NT90 is another symbol?

{"custom_id":"request-632","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate whether it can be generated by the grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens, each of which seems to correspond to production rules in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Each non-terminal (like S, NT99, NT58, etc.) has productions that split into two other non-terminals or a terminal. Some of these terminals are actual strings like 't93', 't31', etc. Others are non-terminals that further produce more tokens.\n\nThe given string is: t48 t33 t86 t68 t96 t10 t13 t68 t96 t23 t19 t48 t35 t85 t48 t71 t66 t62 t13 t35 t84 t19 t41 t48 t35 t66 t86 t48 t71 t36 t66 t96 t41 t85.\n\nI notice that each token is separated, so I need to see if each token in the string corresponds to a production path starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol S, the productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo the string should start with either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. Let's check the first two tokens of the string: t48 and t33.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT23 has productions that include some terminals. Let me check the NT23 rules. For example, NT23 \u2192 't62', 't66', etc. But looking at the grammar, NT23 actually has several production rules, including ones that produce 't62' or 't66' directly. But in the string, the first token is t48, which doesn't correspond directly to NT23. That seems off.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me check the NT23 production rules.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n- NT23 \u2192 't66' (I think I might have missed that earlier)\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\nBut the string starts with t48. None of the productions for NT23 start with t48. That suggests that the initial part of the string may not be derivable from NT23.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check the NT23 productions again. Oh, wait, the user provided a lot of production rules. Let me scan through them.\n\nI see that NT23 has several productions, including those that lead to terminals like 't66', 't62', and 't35'. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, looking at NT23's productions:\n\nYes, NT23 \u2192 't66' (from one of the rules), NT23 \u2192 't62', NT23 \u2192 't45' \u2192 't86', etc. But none of these directly produce 't48' as a terminal. So, if the string starts with t48, perhaps the first part of the string doesn't align with any of the NT23's terminals. That would mean the string might not be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. The string is a sequence of tokens produced by the grammar, so each token is either a terminal or non-terminal that recursively produces tokens.\n\nWait, another approach: the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each non-terminal must expand into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So the string should start with the terminals generated by NT7 and NT23, or by NT97 and NT54.\n\nLet me check NT7 first. Looking for NT7 in the grammar: I see the production NT7 \u2192 't48'. So when NT7 is derived, it directly produces t48.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 also has another production: NT7 \u2192 NT18 \u2192 ... Looking at NT18, it has NT18 \u2192 't48' among others. Wait, maybe NT18 \u2192 't48' is a production. So NT18 can produce t48.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't57' (a terminal production)\nNT18 \u2192 't48' (another terminal)\nNT28 \u2192 't66' (another terminal)\nAnd others.\n\nBut in the string, after the first t48, we have t33, which is a terminal. So perhaps after NT7 (which gives t48), the next is NT23. Let's check NT23's productions.\n\nDo any of the NT23 productions directly produce t33? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT23 production that ends with t33. So this would mean that t33 cannot be produced by NT23.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each production of NT23 again:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't66'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 \u2192 NT56 \u2192 NT53 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 't66'\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 \u2192 NT99 \u2192 NT66 \u2192 NT16 \u2192 ... and so on. Maybe somewhere along this chain, t33 appears, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, the string after t48 is t33. If the grammar cannot produce t33 from any of NT23's expansions, then the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the string isn't starting with S, but let me consider the string as a whole. Each token in the string is a result of the grammar's productions, so the string is a leftmost derivation.\n\nBut let's try to build a possible derivation. Let's consider the start symbol S, which can produce S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nThen NT7 \u2192 t48.\n\nThen NT23 needs to produce t33. But NT23's terminals don't include t33. So this path seems invalid.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT97 NT54.\n\nNT97 \u2192 t31. But the string starts with t48, so this option is also invalid.\n\nWait, that can't be, because the string starts with t48, which is from NT7 \u2192 t48. So the initial expansion must be S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nAfter that, NT7 gives t48, and NT23 starts expanding. But NT23 must produce the next token, which is t33, but NT23 can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another path. Maybe NT23 can be expanded into a series of non-terminals that eventually produce t33. Let's see.\n\nNT23 expands into:\n\nLet me check step by step:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT45.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT56.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT53.\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT28.\n\nNT28 \u2192 't66' or NT8 \u2192 ... and so on. Wait, but the only terminal for NT28 is t66.\n\nWait, is there a way for NT23 to reach t33? Let me look through the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at the start, NT23 is at the beginning. Possible paths:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't66' (terminal, which is 't66')\nNT23 \u2192 't62' (terminal, which is 't62')\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 \u2192 NT56 \u2192 NT53 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 't66'\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 \u2192 NT99 \u2192 NT66 \u2192 NT16 \u2192 ... leading to 't48'?\nWait, looking further:\n\nNT23 via NT45:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 \u2192 NT56 \u2192 NT53 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 't66'\n\nAlternatively, NT23 \u2192 NT45 \u2192 NT99 \u2192 NT66 \u2192 NT16 \u2192 NT... Let's follow this:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT66 \u2192 't51' (from NT66 \u2192 't51').\n\nWait, no, NT66 is another non-terminal. NT66 \u2192 't51'?\n\nYes, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT66 \u2192 't51'\n\nWait, no, no, looking at the grammar again, the rule is:\n\nNT66 \u2192 't51'\n\nSo, for NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT66 \u2192 't51'\n\nThen, from NT16: NT16 \u2192 't90'\n\nSo, the path is NT23 \u2192 NT45 \u2192 NT99 \u2192 NT66 \u2192 t51 \u2192 ... but the string after t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-635","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: t48 t33 t96 t33 t57 t35 t96 t62 t25 t35 t96 t51 t90 t41 t85 t48 t17 t13 t68 t96 t85 t48 t35 t13 t68 t96 t99 t85 t13 t86 t41 t41 t57 t57.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have each production rule producing two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. So, I need to parse the string using this grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the productions have terminals on the right. For example, S -> NT54 't93', which means NT54 can derive a terminal string. Similarly, other NTs have terminal strings, like NT97 -> 't31'.\n\nSo, the plan is to parse the string from the start symbol, S, and see if it can reach this string by expanding all non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe string consists of 36 tokens. Let's list their indices for reference:\n\n1. t48\n2. t33\n3. t96\n4. t33\n5. t57\n6. t35\n7. t96\n8. t62\n9. t25\n10. t35\n11. t96\n12. t51\n13. t90\n14. t41\n15. t85\n16. t48\n17. t17\n18. t13\n19. t68\n20. t96\n21. t85\n22. t48\n23. t35\n24. t13\n25. t68\n26. t96\n27. t99\n28. t85\n29. t13\n30. t86\n31. t41\n32. t41\n33. t57\n34. t57\n\nNow, I'll try to map these tokens to the grammar. Starting with S.\n\nLooking at the top-level productions for S:\n\n- S -> NT7 NT23\n- S -> NT97 NT54\n\nBut from the terminal string, the first token is t48. Let's check which NTs can start with t48.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT7: 't48', NT66: 't51', NT58: 't54', etc.\n\nSo, NT7 starts with t48. So, S must expand as S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, the first token t48 comes from NT7. Now, let's look at the second token, t33.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT23 is in the production S -> NT23. Let me check NT23's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 has multiple productions. One of them is NT23 -> 't62'. Another is NT23 -> NT45 NT53. Let's see which expansions fit.\n\nBut in the string, the second token is t33, which is a terminal. Looking into NT23's terminals, I don't see t33. So, maybe NT23 is being expanded into another NT.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check. The second token is t33, which is a terminal. So, if S is expanding as NT7 (t48) and NT23, then the second token comes from NT23. But in the grammar, NT23 has some direct terminal productions, but looking through:\n\nNT23 -> 't62', 't62' is token 6 in the string, so that's not the second token. Hmm, but in the grammar, are there any NT23 -> ... where it can produce a terminal?\n\nWait, looking back: yes, NT23 has the production NT23 -> NT45 NT53. But both are non-terminals. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53,\n\nBut also:\n\nNT23 -> 't62'.\n\nWait, no, is that the case? Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT23: \n\nIn the given grammar, after NT28, it's NT84, etc. It seems like NT23 has a production 't62'.\n\nWait no, I think in the grammar, look for NT23.\n\nYes, here's 'NT23 -> 't62'', which is token 8 in the string. So wait, but the second token is t33, which is not t62. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look through the grammar again.\n\nIn the provided context, under NT23: \"NT23 -> NT45 NT53 NT84\" \u2014 no, wait, looking back:\n\nWait the grammar as given:\n\nLine 10: NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nLine 24: NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n\nLine 25: NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n\nLine 32: NT23 -> 't62'\n\nWait, no, looking in the initial grammar, there is a line: \"NT23 -> 't62'\". So NT23 can be a terminal 't62'. So in the grammar, NT23 can produce t62.\n\nBut in the string, the second token is t33. So S expands as:\n\nS -> NT7 (t48) NT23.\n\nThe next step is to expand NT23. Since the next token is t33, but NT23 can produce t62, so that's a problem. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the second token comes from a different NT. Alternatively, perhaps S -> NT97 NT54 is involved.\n\nWait, but the first token is t48, which comes from NT7, so maybe that's correct.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to look for the entire string parsing.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a tree. The root is S, which is either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. But let's see.\n\nWait, S's first production is NT7 NT23. Since the first token is t48, which is NT7's production, then S must choose the first production: S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nSo now, the string becomes [t48, ... ] and we need to generate t33 t96 etc. from NT23.\n\nBut as per the grammar, NT23 can either expand to another NTs or be a terminal.\n\nWait, from the grammar, NT23 can become 't62', which isn't t33. So that's a problem. So maybe S cannot produce t48 followed by t33 because NT23 can't produce t33.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking through all NT23's productions:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n\nSo no, NT23 doesn't have a production to t33.\n\nWait, but I might have missed. Let me check again.\n\nNo, in the provided grammar, NT23 is:\n\nLine 10: NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n\nLine 24: NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n\nLine 32: NT23 -> 't62'\n\nSo, no t33 in NT23.\n\nSo, the second token is t33, but the only production of NT23 is either t62 or combining NT45 and NT53. So, that would mean that the second token would have to be t62, but it's t33.\n\nThat suggests that the string can't be generated by the grammar because the second token can't be produced by NT23.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider that perhaps the NT23 is non-terminal, so maybe I'm allowed to expand it, but I might have to take a different branch in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up which NT produces which tokens. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the first production of S is correct, but maybe the second step is S -> NT97 NT54. Let's see what NT97 and NT54 can produce.\n\nLooking at S: S has two options. The first is NT7 NT23, which gives t48 and then something else. Since the second token is t33, not t48, that branch isn't possible.\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-650","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this task where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. All productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe given grammar starts with S and then branches into several production rules. For example, S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. There are many more productions for NT symbols ending with 99, 58, etc., down to some terminals like 't93', 't31', 't71', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t48 t68 t96 t4 t32 t48 t71 t36 t51 t23 t41 t66 t33 t99 t36 t13 t96 t41 t66 t51 t99 t17 t41 t66 t66 t96 t41 t85 t13 t57`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar starting from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the method of analyzing step counts based on the number of non-terminals in the initial symbol.\n\nLooking at the string, it has 35 tokens. The key here is to figure out how many production steps are needed to derive this and see if the number of non-terminals plus some base makes sense.\n\nEach production either results in two non-terminals (expanding to two) or a terminal (reducing by one). I think we can model the number of symbols as a binary tree where each non-terminal split increases the nodes by one, and terminals reduce them.\n\nIn CNF, for a string of length n, the number of production steps should allow for n symbols to be generated from the start symbol, considering each step either splits or terminates.\n\nIn this case, the initial symbol S is a single non-terminal. Each expansion from S will either keep the number of non-terminals the same (if it produces two non-terminals) or decrease it by one (if it produces a terminal).\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal must eventually produce a terminal to end the chain. The string has 35 symbols, so the number of steps should be such that the initial expansion can account for 35.\n\nI think one approach is to count how many times the non-terminals split. Each split doubles the number of non-terminals, similar to a binary tree. So starting from S, each split branches into two, and the number grows exponentially until it reaches the terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is 35 symbols long, which is one less than 36, which is 2^6, I suspect that the maximum number of splits would be around 6, but that might not directly apply here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the depth of the tree needs to be sufficient, with each split increasing the depth by one. If the maximum depth is 6, that would give us 2^6 = 64 possible leaves, which is more than 35. So maybe it's possible.\n\nAnother thought: the Chomsky Normal Form production rules for a context-free grammar allow each step to double the length. So starting from one non-terminal, after n steps, you can get up to 2^n symbols. But since this grammar isn't a simple doubling, but rather has specific production rules, maybe the count is different.\n\nWait, but the string length is 35, so I can think of it as needing at least 6 splits because 2^6 is 64, which is larger than 35. But the grammar might not use all possible splits, so it's possible.\n\nLooking back at the production rules, the left-hand sides are S and various NT symbols. The right-hand sides often go to two NT symbols, so each step can split into two until all NTs are expanded into terminals.\n\nI also need to look at the specific string to see if the terminals fit the rules. For example, the string starts with t48, which must come from a production rule that ends with t48.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, '54' produces 't12' via NT54 \u2192 't12'. But there's also NT54 \u2192 NT94 NT54? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the productions include NT54 \u2192 't12' and also NT54 \u2192 NT94 NT54. Hmm, but in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12' \u2013 which is a terminal production.\n\nBut I also need to check other rules. For example, NT7 \u2192 't48', NT28 \u2192 't36', etc. Each of the t's comes from specific terminals in the productions.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, S \u2192 NT7 NT23, so each expansion would generate two NT symbols, and each step can be thought of as the start of a binary tree.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to model this as a parsing problem, trying to see if the string can be broken down into the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of NT symbols and see if it's compatible with the step counts.\n\nEach production either increases the number of symbols by 1 (from one NT to two) or doesn't change it.\n\nWait, maybe it's helpful to model this as a stack or to count the number of NTs needed.\n\nLooking back, S starts with two NTs: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So the first expansion is two NTs. Each of these can expand further.\n\nBut the string is 35 symbols, so each step could lead to more NTs until all are terminals. To have 35 terminals, the number of NTs must have been split into 35 terminals.\n\nIn a binary tree structure, the number of leaves is equal to the number of NT splits.\n\nWait, for a binary tree, the number of leaves is 2^k where k is the maximum depth. Here, 2^5 = 32, 2^6=64. So 35 is between these. That suggests the grammar tree's maximum depth is 6, but you can't have exactly 35 leaves because 2^5=32, 2^6=64. 35 isn't a power of two.\n\nHmm, that might be a problem. Because in a perfect binary tree, it's 2^k leaves, but sometimes you have incomplete trees.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's not a perfect tree because some leaves might not split further and become terminals. So maybe we have a tree that starts as 1 (S), then splits to 2, then 4, then 8, etc., but if some nodes split fewer times, the total could be 35.\n\nBut how do I know for sure?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that each non-terminal expansion adds more NTs, the number of NTs in the string (looking at how many NT tokens are before the first terminal and so on) can help.\n\nWait, maybe I should construct a parse tree for the string to see if it fits any of the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can count the number of each non-terminal token in the string and see if they are feasible.\n\nBut let's look at the string:\n\nt48 t68 t96 t4 t32 t48 t71 t36 t51 t23 t41 t66 t33 t99 t36 t13 t96 t41 t66 t51 t99 t17 t41 t66 t66 t96 t41 t85 t13 t57\n\nSo, the first token is t48. Looking back at the grammar, which NTs produce 't48'?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT48 appears in a few rules, e.g., NT48 \u2192 't96' in the provided grammar? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the given grammar (some of which are):\n\nNT96 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT48 \u2192 is there any rule? Looking through, I don't see an NT48 \u2192 'something' directly. However, looking further:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18, etc. But looking for any 't48' in the right-hand sides.\n\nWait, searching through, I see:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, but no terminals here.\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't85'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't48'\n\nAh, there's NT7 \u2192 't48'. So first token is t48, which is from NT7. So the production must have started with NT7 \u2192 't48', meaning that in the initial expansion,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That helps because each production can produce at most two symbols in the derivation, which might make parsing easier.

{"custom_id":"request-670","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and from there, the strings are formed recursively based on these rules. The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, so I'll list them out:\n\nt48, t51, t90, t41, t13, t33, t57, t32, t57, t48, t35, t66, t33, t96, t62, t17, t86, t62, t35, t87, t41, t93, t25, t19, t41, t48, t71, t66, t33, t57, t19, t57, t57, t48, t17, t85.\n\nNow, I'll map each token to the non-terminals that can produce it. Looking at the production rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals ending with 't' and numbers, like 't48' is produced by NT48. Others produce by combining two non-terminals.\n\nI'll try to build the parse tree starting from S. The top-level starts with S -> NT99 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. I'll pick one that seems to fit the tokens. Let's start with S -> NT99 NT23.\n\nNT99 can produce NT28 NT18 (from looking at the rules: NT99 -> NT28 NT18). NT28 can produce NT36, which is 't36', but wait, looking back, NT28 -> 't36', so t36 would be from NT28.\n\nWait, but the string has t51 as the second token. Hmm, maybe I should check the rules again. NT99 can also produce NT28 NT18. Wait, looking at the rules, NT99 -> NT28 NT18, which leads to t36 and something else. So that might not fit t51.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start with another production of S. Let's check S -> NT97 NT54. NT97 -> 't31', which is t31, but the string starts with t48. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed something up. Let me check the production rules again for S and NT97.\n\nLooking at the rules: S is NT99 NT23 and NT97 NT54. Also, NT97 -> 't31' according to the production rules? Or is it? Wait, let me find where NT97 appears in the rules. Yes, under NT97: NT97 -> 't31'. So that would generate t31, but the first token is t48, so perhaps S -> NT99 NT23 is more likely.\n\nSo S -> NT99 NT23. Let's see what's in NT99. Looking up, NT99 can go to NT28 NT18. NT28's production is 't36', which is t36. But the first token is t48, which doesn't match. So maybe NT99 can be another production. Wait, NT99 also has -> NT66 NT16. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, in the provided rules, I don't see NT99 being split into NT66 NT16. Let me check the rules again. Oh, under NT99: \"NT99 -> NT66 NT16\" is not present. Wait, looking back, the rules are provided, and under NT99, I see \"NT99 -> NT28 NT18\", yeah. So maybe that's the only production for NT99.\n\nHmm, that's a problem because the first token is t48, which would have to come from a non-terminal that can generate t48. Let me check the rules to see what non-terminals produce t48.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT16 -> 't90', NT28 -> 't36', NT53 -> 't85', NT56 -> 't10', NT58 -> 't22', NT48 -> 't96', NT46 -> 't37', NT23 can produce 't62', NT66 -> 't51', NT84 -> 't4', NT40 -> 't17', etc. Also, NT50 -> 't85', NT13 -> 't68', etc. So where does 't48' come from?\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I see NT86 -> 't25', NT66 -> 't51', NT53 -> 't85', and others. Wait, is there a non-terminal that directly produces 't48'? Looking back, I see NT84-> 't4' and 't84', and NT48->'t96', but no NT directly produces 't48'. So maybe t48 is produced by a concatenation of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps t48 is produced by the combination of two non-terminals that each produce 't48' as a result of their concatenation. But that seems impossible because in the rules, if a non-terminal is on the left side of a production, it must be replaced by the right side, which is a concatenation of other non-terminals, not terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at the rules for NT50: \"NT50 -> NT85 NT46\". And \"NT46 -> t37\" and \"NT85\" perhaps goes to something else? Wait, no, looking back, NT50-> 't85' is under NT13: \"NT13 -> NT41 NT18\" and \"NT41->t68\", \"NT18->t96\", but I think I'm getting confused. Let me take a step back.\n\nI need to produce t48 t51 t90 t41 t13 t33 t57 t32 t57 t48 t35 t66 t33 t96 t62 t17 t86 t62 t35 t87 t41 t93 t25 t19 t41 t48 t71 t66 t33 t57 t19 t57 t57 t48 t17 t85.\n\nEach token in the string is a terminal word. I need to find a parse tree where each production step correctly produces each terminal in the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t48, t51, t90, t41, t13, t33, t57, t32, t57, t48, t35, t66, t33, t96, t62, t17, t86, t62, t35, t87, t41, t93, t25, t19, t41, t48, t71, t66, t33, t57, t19, t57, t57, t48, t17, t85.\n\nLooking at the first token, t48. Which non-terminals produce t48? From the rules:\n\nLooking for NT->'t48':\n\n- None of the non-terminals directly produce t48 except if some production has t48 as the right side. Let me check each production:\n\nNT40 -> 't17'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nNT53 -> 't85'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT58 -> 't22'\nNT48 -> 't96'\nNT96 -> 't48'? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT96 -> 't96' is under NT48, so perhaps NT48 can go to 't96', but that's the production for NT48.\n\nWait, another option: perhaps a non-terminal produces t48 as part of a concatenation.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t48, so we need a production where two non-terminals produce 't48' as their combined result. But that would require a non-terminal A -> BC, where B and C produce 't48' somehow, which is not possible since each production rule replaces a non-terminal with other non-terminals, not terminals.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake and should see if any non-terminals can produce t48 when combined.\n\nWait, maybe I've missed a rule where a non-terminal can produce 't48' as a terminal.\n\nLooking again, I see NT48 -> 't96'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-677","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar. Hmm, okay, first, I should understand the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it mostly consists of non-terminals on the left side of the arrows. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT7 NT23 and other similar productions. Each production seems to break down non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals. At the bottom, some non-terminals are defined as terminals: NT54 becomes 't12', NT97 becomes 't31', and so on.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of these 't' followed by numbers. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the grammar's rules.\n\nFirst, I'll note the structure of the grammar:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23  \nS can also go to other non-terminals, but this is one of the main branches.\n\nEach of these non-terminals has productions that either go further down or end with a terminal.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production has two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nGiven that, the string should be a sequence of terminals that can be generated by expanding the start symbol.\n\nNow, the string is:\n\nt48 t68 t96 t96 t68 t96 t57 t19 t48 t71 t85 t48 t35 t85 t71 t96 t33 t10 t13 t51 t90 t41 t85 t13 t96 t41 t41 t93 t25 t35 t86 t86 t48 t17 t85 t57.\n\nThat's a long string. Let me start by looking for the top-level productions of S. S can produce NT7 NT23 or other non-terminals, but the key ones are NT7 and NT23. Looking at the string, the first symbol is t48. Let's see if t48 is the result of either NT7 or NT23.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT7: NT7 -> NT66 NT16. Both are non-terminals, so t48 must come from one of these. Wait, let me check: NT66 -> NT51 NT54. NT54 is a terminal. Wait, but NT54 is 't53' because looking at the rules, NT54 -> 't12'. Wait, no: Oh no, actually, the grammar has multiple rules where NT54 is defined as 't12' (from NT54 -> 't12'). So, NT66 -> NT51 NT54 would be NT51 and 't12'.\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is t48. Let me see if any of the non-terminals expand directly to t48.\n\nLooking through all the terminal rules, I see:\n\n- NT66 -> 't51'\n- NT48 -> ?\nWait, actually, I think I might be confusing which non-terminals produce which terminals. Let me list all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT8 -> 't19'\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n- NT54 -> 't12'\n- NT46 -> 't13'\n- NT48 -> 't96'\n- NT94 -> 't87'\n- NT46 -> 't37'\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n- NT48 -> 't86'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT97 -> 't54'\n- NT1 -> 't57'\n- NT18 -> 't96'\n- NT16 -> 't90'\n- NT28 -> 't66'\n- NT40 -> 't17'\n- NT84 -> 't23'\n- NT56 -> 't99'\n- NT66 -> 't51'\n- NT54 -> 't53'\n- NT23 -> 't86'\n- NT84 -> 't57'\n- NT53 -> 't85'\n- NT40 -> 't35'\n- NT22 -> 't57'\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT28 -> 't13'\n- NT84 -> 't57'\n- NT86 -> 't25'\n- NT50 -> 't85'\n- NT16 -> 't23'\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check because NT54 can go to 't12' or another rule? No, looking back, it's only NT54 -> 't12'.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, the non-terminals NT54, NT97, etc., have one rule each defining them as a terminal:\n\n- NT54: 't12'\n- NT97: 't31'\n- NT40: 't71'\n- NT8: 't32'\n- NT56: 't10'\n- NT95: 't41'\n- NT28: 't36'\n- NT8: 't19'\n- NT41: 't68'\n- NT54: 't12' (multiple rules, but all point to 't12')\n- NT46: 't13'\n- NT48: 't96'\n- NT94: 't87'\n- NT46: 't37' (another rule for NT46 giving 't37'? Or is it the same NT46?)\nWait, no, maybe each non-terminal can have multiple productions. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking again, NT54 has two productions? Wait no, I think I misread earlier. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nThe grammar is presented with each non-terminal followed by the productions. So, for example:\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16  \nNT58 -> NT94 NT54  \nNT94 -> NT96 NT98  \n... etc.\n\nBut for terminals, they have single productions. For example, NT54 -> 't12'; but then there might be another production NT54 -> something else. Wait, no. Looking at the grammar:\n\nI see:\n\nNT54 -> 't12' \u2013 only that rule.\n\nSimilarly, NT84 has NT84 -> 't23' (from a production? Wait, looking again, actually, the grammar rules are as follows:\n\nLooking through, I see NT84 has:\n\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86  \n- NT84 -> NT53 NT85  \n- etc., wait, no. Actually, it's only in the rules for NT23, NT28, etc. Wait, maybe I need to go through all the non-terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar is presented as a list of productions, each starting with a non-terminal followed by arrows.

The string we need to evaluate starts with 't48 t33 t96 ...' which suggests that the string is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. \n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production produces two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. However, since the string consists only of terminal symbols, we can assume that the derivation must reduce all non-terminals to terminals.\n\nLooking at the initial productions of S, each production starts with two non-terminals. So, the string must be generated by expanding these non-terminals down to terminals. Let's consider the provided string and see if it can be formed by the grammar.\n\nI'll start by mapping the string to possible non-terminals. The string starts with 't48', which corresponds to NT7 (from S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and NT7's production is NT7 \u2192 't48'). So, the first rule S \u2192 NT7 NT23 would be the start.\n\nNext, after 't48', the string has 't33'. Wait, that doesn't fit directly because NT23 in the first rule leads to NT23 \u2192 't62', which is not 't33'. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the NT productions and their terminal mappings to see which transitions are possible.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT7 \u2192 't48'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT23 has several productions:\n  - 't62'\n  - 't66'\n  - 't57'\n  - 't86'\n- NT33 exists via NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT96 \u2192 't96' (as terminal?)\nWait, looking back at the rules:\n\nWait, some of the rules are actually terminal symbols, for example, NT54 \u2192 't12', NT50 \u2192 't85', etc. So, each rule's right-hand side can produce either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, but in our case, each production only has two symbols.\n\nBut the string has only terminal symbols, so each step in the derivation must reduce a non-terminal to a terminal.\n\nLet me try to see how the string can be built. The string starts with 't48', which is produced by NT7. So, S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which starts with NT7 \u2192 't48'.\n\nThen, the next part is 't33', which suggests the next symbol is from NT23. But looking at NT23's productions: NT23 can produce 't62', 't66', 't57', or 't86'. None of these are 't33', so perhaps this path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is not generated by this grammar. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see if any other NT can produce 't33'. Looking through the rules, NT13 \u2192 't33'. But does any NT23 production lead to NT13?\n\nLooking at NT23's production rules: I don't see any production where NT23 directly leads to NT13. So, NT23 can't produce 't33' directly. That suggests that the second symbol 't33' can't come from NT23, which means this string might not be generated by the grammar starting from S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting with S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's see: NT97 \u2192 't31', which doesn't match the first 't48'. So that rule can't be used either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the string can be derived through a series of steps where non-terminals are expanded, and somewhere in the expansion, the terminals appear.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, checking for possible NT productions.\n\nThe string is: t48 t33 t96 t68 t96 t96 t68 t96 t57 t17 t86 t51 t90 t41 t85 t25 t17 t96 t68 t96 t85 t57 t57 t96 t41 t41 t48 t35 t36 t86 t57 t35 t4 t19 t41 t57 t57\n\nFirst symbol: t48 \u2192 this is NT7, so that's from S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, after NT7 \u2192 't48', we have NT23. What does NT23 produce? From the rules, NT23 can produce 't62', 't66', 't57', or 't86'. None of these is t33, so this path is invalid. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the given grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe there's a way to expand NT23 to include other symbols that lead to t33. Let me see. For example, NT23 can produce 't57', which is NT7 \u2192 t48, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, if NT23 can produce NT23 NT23, but looking at the rules, NT23's productions are all two-terminals, no two non-terminals. So, NT23 can't go further. Therefore, 't33' cannot be produced from NT23, which is required after 't48'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial derivation is wrong. Let me check if S can produce a string starting with 't48 t33...'.\n\nAnother possibility is that the string starts with 't31', which is NT97. So, maybe S \u2192 NT97 NT54. But then the first symbol would be 't31', not 't48', which doesn't match the string. So that can't be.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which starts with 't48', but then the next symbol can't be 't33' because NT23 doesn't produce 't33'. Hence, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-690","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky normal form is a specific way of structuring the production rules of a grammar, which makes it easier for certain types of parsers. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so let me think this through.\n\nFirst, let me recall the structure of the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are all of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for some rules where A is a terminal. Oh, right, the terminals are the ones without further productions; they just produce themselves or something else like a string ending.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many of the non-terminals have productions that eventually lead down to terminals like 't...' or numbers. For example, some of them directly produce terminals, like NT54 -> 't12', or NT97 -> 't31'. So, these are the leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is 't48 t66 t96 t41 t66 t33 t86 t68 t96 t57 t32 t48 t17 t85 t48 t35 t36 t86 t17 t86 t62 t71 t86 t33 t99 t85 t37 t17 t57 t19 t41 t41 t41 t57 t48 t71 t85'. It's a sequence of terminal symbols, so the question is whether this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, the derivation starts with S and each step doubles the number of symbols until we get to the terminals. This suggests that the length of the string should be a power of two. Let me check the length of the string provided.\n\nCounting the tokens in the string: t48, t66, t96, t41, t66, t33, t86, t68, t96, t57, t32, t48, t17, t85, t48, t35, t36, t86, t17, t86, t62, t71, t86, t33, t99, t85, t37, t17, t57, t19, t41, t41, t41, t57, t48, t71, t85. Let me count them: 34 symbols. 34 is not a power of two; the nearest powers of two are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). So, that immediately raises a red flag. But wait, maybe my counting is off. Let me recount the string:\n\n1. t48\n2. t66\n3. t96\n4. t41\n5. t66\n6. t33\n7. t86\n8. t68\n9. t96\n10. t57\n11. t32\n12. t48\n13. t17\n14. t85\n15. t48\n16. t35\n17. t36\n18. t86\n19. t17\n20. t86\n21. t62\n22. t71\n23. t86\n24. t33\n25. t99\n26. t85\n27. t37\n28. t17\n29. t57\n30. t19\n31. t41\n32. t41\n33. t41\n34. t57\n35. t48\n36. t71\n37. t85\n\nWait, that's 37 tokens, not 34. Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier. Anyway, regardless of that, the key point is whether the number of symbols is a power of two. Since 37 is not a power of two (the closest being 32 and 64), it's impossible for this string to be generated by the grammar because each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols, starting from 1, so the lengths are 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. Since 37 isn't even a multiple that allows it to be derived from starting with length 1 and doubling each time, this string can't be generated. So, I can conclude immediately that the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me make sure. The grammar's starting symbol S produces NT7 NT23, each of which then produce other non-terminals or terminals. So, S can be written as NT7 NT23, which are then broken down further. Each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two, so the initial length is 2 after the first step, then 4, 8, etc. So, the final string's length must be 2^n. \n\nIn this case, the string has 37 symbols, which is not a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar. So, I can confidently say 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out the answer step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the given grammar. It looks like each production rule on the left side is non-terminal, and the right side consists of two non-terminals (since it's in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals except for the terminals). The terminals are represented by 't' followed by numbers, except for some like 'NT7', 'NT23', etc. Wait, no, actually, the terminals are those that end in a number without 'NT' or whatnot.

{"custom_id":"request-712","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has production rules where each non-terminal (A) produces two non-terminals (BC) or a terminal (a). So, the grammar is set up that way, which should make parsing easier, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S is the start symbol and it has two options: NT7 and NT97 NT23. Each of these NTs then break down further, with NTs having productions that either produce two NTs or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t48 t33 t86 t86 t17 t86 t33 t96 t86 t17 t96 t62 t71 t84 t71 t96 t68 t96 t87 t41 t57 t48 t71 t85 t41 t41 t57 t57 t17 t57 t32 t41 t41 t48 t71 t36 t62 t57`.\n\nI need to figure out if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, the string should be a derivation where each step replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols, leading down to the terminals.\n\nI think the first thing is to parse the string from left to right. Starting with S, which can be NT7 or NT97 NT23. But looking at the string, the first terminal is t48. Let's see where t48 appears in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT40 \u2192 't71', NT28 \u2192 't36', NT8 \u2192 't32', etc. Wait, but in the grammar, some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT54 \u2192 't12', NT7 \u2192 't48', NT97 \u2192 't31', etc.\n\nWait, let me check: NT54 is one of the rules. Oh, yes, in the grammar, NT54 \u2192 't12', and in the initial S, when it's S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So if I can get t48, t33, etc., perhaps starting with NT7.\n\nLet me see: NT7 is a production that I don't see here. Oh, wait, in the NT40 \u2192 't71' and other rules, but looking back, actually, in the grammar provided, NT7 is one of the productions? Wait, no, in the grammar provided, I don't see NT7 being any non-terminal; instead, I see S \u2192 NT7 NT23, so NT7 is a production of S. Wait, but looking deeper, do any of the other NTs produce t7?\n\nWait, checking the grammar again:\n\nLooking for t48: in the rules, NT40 \u2192 't71', but wait, there's an NT40 rule: NT40 \u2192 't71' and NT40 \u2192 't17'. Also, in the string, t48 is present. So when does t48 come from? Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't96' appears multiple times, but in the string, the first term is t48. Wait, where does t48 come from in the grammar? Checking the production rules, I see NT48 appears as a left-hand side in some productions, like NT48 \u2192 't96' (twice), but I don't see any rule where NT48 produces a terminal. So if the string starts with t48, there must be a production for NT48 that produces t48 as a terminal. But looking through the rules, I don't see an NT48 \u2192 't48' production. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nNo, looking back through the grammar, I don't see any NT48 that produces a terminal, except as part of another NT's production. Wait, maybe the string isn't going to work because t48 can only come from a higher-level NT.\n\nWait, that can't be right because t48 is in the string, so maybe the grammar has a rule that I overlooked. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I see NT7 \u2192 't48' and NT7 also has other rules. Oh wait, wait, in the rules provided, it's written as:\n\nNT7 appears in S \u2192 NT7 NT23, but also, elsewhere, looking back through the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT7: \"NT7973\". Wait, no, let me scan the given grammar again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the first line is:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nThen, looking for NT7:\n\nWell, looking through the rules, I don't see an NT7 rule except in the first line S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So NT7 is a symbol that's part of the production with S. So NT7 is on the left side of S. But in the grammar, is there a rule where NT7 produces anything else?\n\nLooking through all the productions after S, I see that NT99, NT55, etc., are all defined, but I don't see any rule where NT7 is on the left-hand side except it appears in S.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because in the grammar, every non-terminal must have productions. So did I make a mistake in transcription? Let me check the original grammar again.\n\nThe grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\nNT90 -> NT84 NT8\nNT50 -> NT55 NT1\nNT8 -> NT40 NT96\nNT58 -> NT22 NT8\nNT98 -> NT40 NT90\nNT1 -> NT88 NT53\nNT50 -> NT59 NT46\nNT88 -> NT7 NT40\nNT54 -> 't93'\nNT97 -> 't31'\nNT40 -> 't71'\nNT8 -> 't32'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT95 -> 't41'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nNT8 -> 't19'\nNT41 -> 't68'\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT46 -> 't13'\nNT48 -> 't96'\nNT94 -> 't87'\nNT46 -> 't37'\nNT23 -> 't62'\nNT48 -> 't86'\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT97 -> 't54'\nNT1 -> 't57'\nNT18 -> 't96'\nNT16 -> 't90'\nNT28 -> 't66'\nNT40 -> 't17'\nNT84 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't84'\nNT56 -> 't99'\nNT66 -> 't51'\nNT54 -> 't53'\nNT23 -> 't86'\nNT84 -> 't23'\nNT53 -> 't85'\nNT40 -> 't35'\nNT22 -> 't57'\nNT7 -> 't48'\nNT28 -> 't13'\nNT84 -> 't57'\nNT86 -> 't25'\nNT50 -> 't85'\nNT16 -> 't23'\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong. Let me scan the rules again. Oh! I see now:\n\nNT7 is on the left side only in S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Wait, no, in the given grammar, all the rules except S and the ones I listed have NT7 as a product? Wait no, looking again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 is only in S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So only S refers to NT7.

{"custom_id":"request-736","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has either two terminals and nothing else or two non-terminals. So, it's a context-free grammar.\n\nFirst, the string we're evaluating is: `t48 t68 t96 t86 t13 t96 t41 t13 t68 t96 t96 t62 t71 t96 t51 t23 t41 t85 t96 t41 t41 t41 t57 t48 t17 t85 t35 t87 t41 t53 t25 t19 t48 t17 t85`\n\nLet me list out the steps to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S. The first production is S -> NT7 NT23, which must be the first two symbols of the string. Wait, looking at the string, it starts with t48, but according to S, it should be either 't48' or 't93' because NT7 produces 't71' and NT23 produces 't62', so their combination would lead to the first symbol being 't71' or 't62', neither of which is 't48'.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The NT7 and NT23 productions:\n\nLooking at NT7: NT7 -> NT57 -> ... -> 't48'?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe rules for NT7:\nNT7 -> NT57\nNT57 -> 't48'\n\nSo NT7 produces t48 when expanded. And NT23:\nNT23 -> NT48 or NT86?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT23 has:\n\nNT23 -> NT48 NT23\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nAnd also, from the rules, NT8 -> 't32', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar given, for NT23 there is a production NT23 -> NT48 NT23 and also NT23 -> NT13 NT50. Also, looking at the list, NT23 is present in multiple places, but more importantly, looking at the NT23 production in the rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, S can go to NT7 NT23, and NT7 can be NT57 which is t48, and NT23 can have various options.\n\nLooking back at the string: the first symbol is t48. So for the first part of the string to start with t48, let's see which non-terminals can produce t48.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals are things like t48, t68, etc. So how do we get t48? Looking at the NT rules, we can see NT57 -> 't48', as per the grammar. But NT57 only appears in NT7's rules.\n\nWait, let me check the NT7 production:\n\nNT79 -> NT57 (Wait, no, looking at the NT7 options, the first one is NT7 -> NT57, but I don't see NT79 in the grammar. Wait, perhaps I got the numbering wrong. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT99, NT98, etc., but for NT7, I need to see if there's any production for NT7. Wait, looking at the rules, the grammar starts with S->NT7 NT23. So NT7 must be a non-terminal. Where is NT7 defined? Let me scan through all the rules:\n\nLooking for 'NT7', it's not immediately obvious, but in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for NT7, I don't see it in the provided grammar. Wait, that's a problem because the first production is S->NT7 NT23, but NT7 isn't defined anywhere. So S can't start with NT7, which would mean that the string can't be generated because the initial production is undefined.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me make sure. The user provided the grammar as:\n\n```\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n...\nSo yes, S can produce NT7 NT23. But in the grammar, where is NT7 defined? I don't see it. Let me check each line:\n\nWait, I'm looking through the provided NT rules:\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\nNT90 -> NT84 NT8\nNT50 -> NT55 NT1\nNT8 -> NT40 NT96\nNT58 -> NT22 NT8\nNT98 -> NT40 NT90\nNT1 -> NT88 NT53\nNT50 -> NT59 NT46\nNT88 -> NT7 NT40\n...\nSo, I don't see NT7 anywhere. So in fact, S->NT7 NT23 is invalid because NT7 is not a defined non-terminal.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. If the grammar doesn't have a rule for NT7, then S->NT7 NT23 is invalid. So the grammar as given is incomplete because NT7 isn't defined. Therefore, S cannot produce any strings because one of its productions is invalid. Hence, the string given cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, let's check if I missed NT7 in the rules. I'll go through each rule thoroughly:\n\nLooking for NT7:\n- NT99: no\n- NT58: no\n- NT94: no\n- NT55: no\n- NT90: no\n- NT45: no\n- NT59: no\n- NT53: rule is NT53->NT28 NT23, so NT28->... but no NT53 producing NT7.\n- NT96: no\n- NT98: no\n- NT16: no\n- NT23: rule is NT23->NT45 NT53, etc., but again no NT7.\n- NT84: rule NT84->NT58 NT86, no\n- NT23: another rule NT23->NT13 NT50, no\n- NT99: another rule NT99->NT28 NT18, no\n- NT13: rule NT13->NT41 NT18, no\n- NT90: NT90->NT84 NT8, no\n- NT50: rule NT50->NT55 NT1, no\n- NT8: NT8->NT40 NT96, no\n- NT58: NT58->NT22 NT8, no\n- NT98: NT98->NT40 NT90, no\n- NT1: NT1->NT88 NT53, no\n- NT50: another production NT50->NT59 NT46, no\n- NT88: NT88->NT7 NT40, yes! Wait, here's NT88->NT7 NT40.\n\nWait, that's different. NT88 can produce NT7. So the grammar does have a production for NT7, but only as part of another non-terminal's production.\n\nSo S can be expanded to NT88 NT40, because in the first production, it's S->NT7 NT23, which is invalid, but wait, how? Because earlier I thought that NT7 is undefined, but now, looking again, the production S->NT7 NT23 is present, but NT7 is not a defined non-terminal anywhere else. However, I see that NT88 can produce NT7 because of NT88->NT7 NT40.\n\nSo perhaps S is initially being considered as S->NT7 NT23, which would require NT7 to be expanded, but since NT7 isn't defined, that would be invalid. Alternatively, perhaps the S->NT7 NT23 is actually a typo and should be S->NT88 NT40, given that NT88 can expand to NT7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the grammar, and the S productions are meant to be S->NT88 NT40, which would fit better because NT88 can then expand to NT7 as part of it.\n\nAlternatively"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-732","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check whether it's generated by this grammar. I need to figure out if the string is in the language of the grammar. The string is: `t48 t68 t96 t4 t19 t48 t71 t66 t33 t99 t66 t13 t96 t41 t13 t33 t87 t12 t25 t19 t48 t35 t36 t68 t96 t23 t32 t48 t35 t85 t48 t71 t36 t62 t57 t13 t48 t35 t85`.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has certain properties. Each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, I need to check that all the production rules in the given grammar fit this structure. Let me quickly scan through the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions, most of them are either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side, except some look a bit off. For example, I see a rule like NT8 \u2192 't32', which is a terminal. That's fine, but are all the other productions in the form of two non-terminals?\n\nWait, I'm thinking about the question. The task isn't to check the grammar's correctness but whether it generates the given string. But perhaps it's necessary to ensure the grammar is in CNF for the analysis. But the main point is to determine if the string is generated.\n\nAssuming the grammar is in CNF, the next step is to use a parsing method suitable for CNF. The most straightforward way is to use the CYK algorithm, but that might be complicated for this string. Alternatively, I can construct derivation trees step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is small, maybe I can trace the string through the productions. Each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal in the grammar, so first, let me list all the terminals in the string and the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are: t48, t68, t96, t4, t19, t48, t71, t66, t33, t99, t66, t13, t96, t41, t13, t33, t87, t12, t25, t19, t48, t35, t36, t68, t96, t23, t32, t48, t35, t85, t48, t71, t36, t62, t57, t13, t48, t35, t85.\n\nSo, that's the terminal string, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nNow, in CNF, the only terminals in the grammar are those that appear as standalone symbols in the productions. Wait, no, in CNF, the productions can be terminals or non-terminals, but each production in CNF has at most two non-terminals. So, in the given grammar, some rules, like NT54 \u2192 't12', are direct terminals, which is allowed.\n\nSo, the first production from S is S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, S starts as NT7 and NT23. Each of these is a non-terminal, so each must be expanded into the correct sequence of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nSo, I need to derive the string starting from S, which splits into NT7 and NT23.\n\nLet me map out the structure:\n\n- NT7 must derive to t48. Let's look at the rule for NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT54 NT53. But NT54 is 't12' (from NT54 \u2192 't12') and NT53 is 't85' (from NT53 \u2192 't85'). Wait, no, looking back: NT54 \u2192 't12' and NT53 \u2192 't85'. But wait, in the string, the first symbol is t48. Hmm, something doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps I misread the NT54 and NT53 rules.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't12'.\n\nNT53 \u2192 't85'.\n\nSo, how does NT7 derive to t48? If NT7 \u2192 NT54 NT53, and NT54 is 't12' and NT53 is 't85', that would give t12 t85, but the string starts with t48. So that doesn't make sense. Did I misread the rules?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check NT7's definition. The user provided the grammar, and under NT7, it's defined as NT7 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Let me verify:\n\nYes, in the user's input, under NT7, it's written as NT7->NT54 NT53. And NT54 is 't12', NT53 is 't85'. So, how does NT7 expand? It must become 't12 t85', which is 't12t85', but the string starts with t48.\n\nHmm, that's a problem because the string starts with 't48' but according to the grammar, the only way to get to a terminal starts with 't48' is from production like NT48, but where is NT48 defined?\n\nLooking in the grammar, what is NT48? Hmm, I need to check all the non-terminals:\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all non-terminals and their productions.\n\nList of non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16\nNT58 -> NT94 NT54\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1\nNT90 -> NT94 NT95\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95\nNT59 -> NT56 NT53\nNT53 -> NT28 NT23\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23\nNT98 -> NT48 NT95\nNT16 -> NT56 NT40\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT99 -> NT28 NT18\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18\nNT90 -> NT84 NT8\nNT50 -> NT55 NT1\nNT8 -> NT40 NT96\nNT58 -> NT22 NT8\nNT98 -> NT40 NT90\nNT1 -> NT88 NT53\nNT50 -> NT59 NT46\nNT88 -> NT7 NT40\nNT54 -> 't93' \nNT97 -> 't31'\nNT40 -> 't71'\nNT8 -> 't32'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT95 -> 't41'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nNT8 -> 't19'\nNT41 -> 't68'\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT46 -> 't13'\nNT48 -> 't96'\nNT94 -> 't87'\nNT46 -> 't37'\nNT23 -> 't62'\nNT48 -> 't86'\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT97 -> 't54'\nNT1 -> 't57'\nNT18 -> 't96'\nNT16 -> 't90'\nNT28 -> 't66'\nNT40 -> 't17'\nNT84 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't84'\nNT56 -> 't99'\nNT66 -> 't51'\nNT54 -> 't53'\nNT23 -> 't86'\nNT84 -> 't57'\nNT86 -> 't25'\nNT50 -> 't85'\nNT16 -> 't23'\n\nWait, I notice that some non-terminals have the same production. For example, NT54 appears in two places, once as 't93' and once as 't12'. That would be a problem because each production should be unique. But the user's grammar allows for that, which can cause confusion.\n\nBut proceeding, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine NT7's production. It's S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT54 NT53, and NT54 is 't54' or wait, no. Wait, let me check NT54 again.

So, I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The goal is to determine whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are of the form A -> BC, which means each production splits a non-terminal into two other non-terminals until they become terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- S can produce NT7NT23 or NT97NT54.\n- Each NT symbol seems to have its own production rules, ultimately leading to terminal symbols (t followed by a number) or other NT symbols.\n\nSo, the idea is to parse the string starting from S and see if it can be derived using the production rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the parsing can be done using a method like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just thinking through it, maybe I can approach it step by step.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\nt48 t66 t96 t41 t13 t33 t57 t17 t96 t68 t96 t84 t19 t48 t17 t13 t68 t96 t86 t68 t96 t4 t19 t57 t57 t71 t57 t19 t41 t57 t57 t57 t48 t71 t13 t51 t23 t41 t85 t57.\n\nThat's a long string, 36 tokens. Let's think about how the grammar can generate this. The start symbol S branches into NT7NT23 or NT97NT54, so any valid string must start with the symbols derived from either NT7NT23 or NT97NT54.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT7 has production NT7 -> 't48', right? Because in the rules, NT7 is defined as 't48'. Similarly, NT23 has multiple productions, but one of them is 't62'. So, the production NT7NT23 would start with 't48' followed by the result of NT23.\n\nIf S -> NT7NT23, then the string starts with 't48', and the next part comes from NT23. Alternatively, if S -> NT97NT54, then the string starts with the symbols from NT97 and NT54.\n\nLooking at the first token of the given string: t48. That matches NT7->'t48'. So the first step is using the production S->NT7NT23.\n\nSo after the first production, we have NT7 (t48) and NT23 remaining. Now, NT23 has several productions. Let me check the NT23 rules:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53 or NT45 NT53 (since I see NT23 -> NT45 NT53 appears twice). Also, NT23 has another rule: -> NT13 NT50, and another: -> 't62'.\n\nSo, the second token needs to come from the second part of the split, which is NT23. So after t48, the next token should be one of the possible tokens from NT23.\n\nLooking at the string, the second token is t66. Wait, does any production of NT23 lead to t66? Let me check the NT23 rules again. I don't see any production that directly gives 't66'. The rules for NT23 are:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT13 NT50\n't62'\n\nHmm, none of these produce t66. So t66 might come from another NT symbol that can produce it. Let's check which NT symbols have 't66' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, there's NT66 -> 't51' but that's not directly; I need to see if any NT rules produce 't66'.\n\nLooking back, I see NT23 is in the string as the second token, which is t66, but NT23 cannot directly produce t66. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the NT23 is not directly producing t66, but perhaps another step.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t48, which comes from NT7, so the first part is consumed. The remaining part is NT23. So, the second token must come from the expansion of NT23.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions:\n1. NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n2. NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n3. NT23 -> 't62'\n\nThe second token is t66. None of these directly produce t66. So, that suggests that maybe the production is incorrect, and the answer would be No. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, could it be that there's a step in the production of NT23 that leads to t66? Let's check NT45 and NT53's rules to see if they can produce t66 or parts leading to it.\n\nLooking at NT45 rules:\nNT45 -> NT99 NT95, NT40 NT95, 't53', or 't37'.\n\nWait, 't53' is from NT45. So, perhaps in some step, NT45 can produce 't53' and then something else. But how does that help with t66?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any NT can produce t66. Let's check each NT symbol.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT50 -> 't71' or 't46' or 't59' or 't57' or 't85' or 't53' or 't13' or 't68'.\n- Wait, none of those directly produce 't66'.\n\nLooking for an NT that can derive 't66', perhaps through its productions.\n\nWait, looking at NT45: NT45 can produce 't53' and then perhaps another step. But 't53' is a terminal, so NT53 can produce 't85' (from NT53 -> 't85'), or other things. Let me check NT53's rules.\n\nNT53 -> 't85' or 't86'.\n\nSo if NT45 can produce 't53', and then NT53 can produce 't85' or 't86'. But how does that help us get t66?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.\n\nMaybe the initial step is correct: S->NT7NT23 leads to t48, and then we have to produce t66 from NT23. But NT23 doesn't directly produce t66, so perhaps that's a dead end, and the string is not possible. So the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Maybe the NT23 can split further. Let me check.\n\nIf NT23 expands to NT45 NT53, then the next symbols after t48 would be t66, which would need to come from NT45 or NT53. But NT45 can only produce t53, t99, etc., not t66. Similarly, NT53 can produce t85 or t86, not t66.\n\nAlternatively, if NT23 expands to NT13 NT50, then the next symbols would have to be from NT13 and NT50. But the next token is t66, and neither NT13 nor NT50 produce t66. So that still doesn't help.\n\nSo it seems like the second token t66 cannot come from any of the possible expansions of NT23, given the current grammar rules. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each of these NTs will be expanded further.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from the start and see if it can be constructed step by step using the productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a simple left-to-right parsing approach can work, but I might need to look for possible expansions.\n\nLet me first jot down the string and its structure to see if I can find any patterns or possible splits based on the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t tokens. Each t token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, such as 't48', 't66', etc. Each of these t tokens must be matched exactly by a production rule that ends with a terminal.\n\nI'll note that each production either produces one terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, when parsing, each step will either consume a single terminal or two non-terminals, each of which needs to be expanded further.\n\nBut manually parsing this could be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a way to split the string into parts that correspond to the possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, perhaps I can find that it's built from a sequence of the start symbol S expanding into a chain that eventually produces all the t tokens.\n\nAnother approach is to observe that in CNF, all productions lead to terminals directly or through a chain of non-terminals. So, each t token in the string must correspond to the end of a production that directly expands to a t, possibly through a chain.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, I see 't57' appearing multiple times. Let me check what rules might produce 't57'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't57'\n\nSo, 't57' is produced by NT1.\n\nThat means, somewhere in the string, there must be a NT1 production that eventually generates 't57'.\n\nSimilarly, the string starts with 't48'. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't10' and 't99' \u2192 't48', wait, looking back: NT56 has \u2192 't10' and another production? Let me check.\n\nWait, let me look for each 'tX' and find which non-terminal produces it.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't57' \u2192 NT1\n- 't48' \u2192 Looking through the productions, I see NT56 \u2192 't10', but that doesn't help. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53' and 't12' (twice)\n- NT56 \u2192 't99' and 't10' (twice)\n- NT97 \u2192 't31' and 't54'\n- NT58 \u2192 't94' and 't54'\n- NT94 \u2192 't96' and 't98'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90' and 't40' (twice)\n- NT23 \u2192 't62' and 't86' (twice)\n- NT84 \u2192 't58' and 't86' (twice)\n- NT28 \u2192 't36' and 't13' (twice)\n- NT41 \u2192 't68' and 't66' (twice)\n- NT86 \u2192 't25' and 't35' (twice)\n- NT46 \u2192 't13' and 't37' (twice)\n- NT22 \u2192 't57' (I think this is incorrect earlier; let me check the start I have here)\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at the start, I see NT22 \u2192 't57'?\n\nWait, in the original rules, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't57'\n\nYes, in the given grammar, NT22 is a non-terminal, and it directly produces 't57'.\n\nSo, 't57' can be generated by NT22 \u2192 't57'.\n\nAlso, 't66' is generated by NT28 \u2192 't66', because one of NT28's rules is NT28 \u2192 't66'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for each 't' token in the string and seeing how they are produced.\n\nLet me list out all the t terms in the string and see their productions:\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt48, t66, t96, t41, t66, t68, t96, t57, t17, t86, t68, t96, t86, t51, t10, t17, t41, t36, t86, t96, t41, t41, t57, t48, t17, t36, t68, t96, t87, t41, t48, t35, t13, t86, t48, t35, t13, t62, t57, t57.\n\nNow, for each t term, let's note which non-terminal produces it:\n\n- t48: From the given rules, NT46 \u2192 't37' and 't13' (twice) \u2013 no, wait, looking again. Wait, in the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't48'? Let me see:\n\nWait, earlier when I checked, I thought NT46 produces 't13' and 't37', and NT22 \u2192 't57', but that's incorrect. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided at the beginning, the only non-terminal that directly produces 't48' is NT56 \u2192 't10' and 't99'. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for the production rules:\n\nLooking for 't48', I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces it. Wait, that can't be because the string has t48, so it must be generated by some rule. Maybe it's produced indirectly via other non-terminals. Let me check all rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53' and 't12'\n- NT56 \u2192 't99' and 't10'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31' and 't54'\n- NT58 \u2192 't94' and 't54'\n- NT94 \u2192 't96' and 't98'\n- NT45 \u2192 't99' and 't95'\n- NT59 \u2192 't56' and 't53'\n- NT53 \u2192 't28' and 't23'\n- NT96 \u2192 't48' and '23'\n- Oh! Here it is: NT96 \u2192 't48' and 't23'.\n\nYes, looking back: The rule NT96 \u2192 't48' and 't23' is present.\n\nSo, NT96 directly produces 't48'.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 \u2192 't94' and 't54' (twice), but that doesn't help for 't58' \u2013 no, wait, 't58' is the token in the string. So NT58 might be getting split into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, 't58' is a terminal; so which non-terminals produce 't58'?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which usually makes parsing easier, but I need to figure out if the string is part of the language it generates.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the grammar. Each production is on the left side of the arrow (e.g., S -> NT7 NT23), and each variable expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. This is standard for CNF, which simplifies the parsing process since each step reduces the number of symbols by one.\n\nThe given string is: `t48 t68 t96 t86 t86 t17 t57 t17 t86 t68 t96 t99 t13 t51 t90 t41 t13 t13 t96 t41 t66 t68 t96 t86 t86 t71 t87 t93 t25 t32 t41 t48 t35 t85 t48 t35 t85 t13 t41 t57 t57`.\n\nEach symbol in the string is either a terminal or part of a production. Since the grammar is in CNF, the entire derivation starts from the start symbol S and each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nI'll need to look for a series of productions that can produce this string. Maybe I can start from the end and see if the string can be broken down into the right components.\n\nLet me note down the grammar production rules for reference:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23  \nS \u2192 NT97 NT54  \n\nNT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16  \nNT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54  \nNT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98  \nNT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1  \nNT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95  \nNT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95  \nNT59 \u2192 NT56 NT53  \nNT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23  \nNT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23  \nNT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95  \nNT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40  \nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53  \nNT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86  \nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50  \nNT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18  \nNT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18  \nNT90 \u2192 NT84 NT8  \nNT50 \u2192 NT55 NT1  \nNT8 \u2192 NT40 NT96  \nNT58 \u2192 NT22 NT8  \nNT98 \u2192 NT40 NT90  \nNT1 \u2192 NT88 NT53  \nNT50 \u2192 NT59 NT46  \nNT88 \u2192 NT7 NT40  \nNT54 \u2192 't93'  \nNT97 \u2192 't31'  \nNT40 \u2192 't71'  \nNT8 \u2192 't32'  \nNT56 \u2192 't10'  \nNT95 \u2192 't41'  \nNT28 \u2192 't36'  \nNT8 \u2192 't19'  \nNT41 \u2192 't68'  \nNT54 \u2192 't12'  \nNT46 \u2192 't13'  \nNT48 \u2192 't96'  \nNT94 \u2192 't87'  \nNT46 \u2192 't37'  \nNT23 \u2192 't62'  \nNT48 \u2192 't86'  \nNT13 \u2192 't33'  \nNT97 \u2192 't54'  \nNT1 \u2192 't57'  \nNT18 \u2192 't96'  \nNT16 \u2192 't90'  \nNT28 \u2192 't66'  \nNT40 \u2192 't17'  \nNT84 \u2192 't4'  \nNT84 \u2192 't84'  \nNT56 \u2192 't99'  \nNT66 \u2192 't51'  \nNT54 \u2192 't53'  \nNT23 \u2192 't86'  \nNT84 \u2192 't23'  \nNT53 \u2192 't85'  \nNT40 \u2192 't35'  \nNT22 \u2192 't57'  \nNT7 \u2192 't48'  \nNT28 \u2192 't13'  \nNT84 \u2192 't57'  \nNT86 \u2192 't25'  \nNT50 \u2192 't85'  \nNT16 \u2192 't23'  \n\nWait, this is a lot! Each NT (non-terminal) can expand into two other non-terminals or terminals. The right-hand sides of these productions consist of either both non-terminals, both terminals, or one of each.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. These could either be terminal symbols or intermediate steps. Since the start symbol is S, which expands into two non-terminals, S \u2192 NT7 NT23 or S \u2192 NT97 NT54, and each of these will need to eventually resolve to the start of the string.\n\nLet me see: The string starts with 't48'. Looking back at the grammar, I can check which non-terminals expand into 't48'. Scanning the productions, I notice NT48 isn't listed on the left as a source, but in the productions, I see NT46 \u2192 't37' and NT48 isn't a non-terminal, so perhaps NT48 is an intermediate step that may be a non-terminal that I'm missing. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT48 is not a non-terminal\u2014it's on the right side. So, actually, the only 't's are terminal, and non-terminals are the NTs and S.\n\nWait, maybe S starts the chain. Let me try to trace the string step by step.\n\nLooking for the string: t48, t68, t96, t86,...\n\nLet me think of the possible production chains.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t48. Let's find where 't48' comes from. From the production rules, NT41 \u2192 t68, but where does t48 come from? Looking through, I see that NT96 \u2192 t96 is one option for NT96: NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23. So, if NT96 expands into t96, that's possible. But does NT96 expand into a terminal 't96'?\n\nWait, NT96 \u2192 't96' is not listed as a production. Let me check: Looking through all production rules, I don't see any NT96 \u2192 't96'. Instead, NT48 is on the right side, but NT48 isn't a non-terminal; in fact, NT48 is part of some productions. Wait, the productions I provided include:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't96'  \nNT96 \u2192 't48'  \nWait, no. Let me correct that. Looking back at the productions, I think I might have miscounted. Scanning:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't96'  \nYes, line 20: NT48 \u2192 't96'. So NT48 is a non-terminal that can produce 't96' or split into other non-terminals. Similarly, NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23. So if NT48 ends up as 't96', then NT96 can produce 't96' along with NT23, which could produce another symbol.\n\nBut let's get back to the beginning. The first token is t48. How does that come about? If we're starting from S, which expands into NT7 and NT23, or NT97 and NT54.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT7 NT23: If NT7 can produce 't48' and NT23 can produce another symbol. Or S \u2192 NT97 NT54: NT97 can produce 't31' (from NT97 \u2192 't31'), and NT54 is 't12' or another NT.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- If we use S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then NT7 could produce 't48', which is terminal, as per rule line 1: NT7 \u2192 't48'.\n\nYes, so NT7 can be 't48'. Then NT23 must produce the next symbol in the string.\n\nThe string after 't48' is 't68' t96 t86...\n\nSo, let's consider the next non-terminal after NT7 is used to produce 't48': Now, the second part is NT23. We need NT23 to expand into 't68' or the next part.\n\nLooking at production rules for NT23: From line 3 and line 4 of the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 or NT13 NT50 or NT45 NT53 again (line 16 and 17).

{"custom_id":"request-773","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by it. Let me see how I can approach this. I'm not very confident about this, but I'll try breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the start symbol S, it has two productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nSo, S can generate two different non-terminals. I'll need to explore both possibilities.\n\nNext, let's look at the string: `t48 t68 t96 t23 t35 t96 t13 t96 t41 t66 t86 t48 t35 t66 t86 t48 t35 t36 t68 t96 t96 t33 t99 t85 t37 t71 t57 t71 t86 t51 t10 t71 t41 t85 t41 t48 t35 t85 t48 t71 t85`. It's a series of t followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals.\n\nNow, each step in the derivation must produce a terminal or non-terminal. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, we'll need to consume all of them step by step, ensuring that each part of the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best way is to try to parse the string step by step, looking for possible productions that match the next part of the string.\n\nStarting with S. The string starts with t48. Looking at the S productions:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT7 NT23\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT97 NT54\n\nI need to see which of the NT7, NT23, NT97, or NT54 can derive t48.\n\nLooking at the NT productions:\n\nLooking up NT7 in the rules. Wait, in the grammar provided, do I see NT7? Let me scan. Yes, there's a rule NT7 \u2192 t48. Yep.\n\nSo, S can produce NT7 which immediately becomes t48. So, the first t48 matches NT7 \u2192 t48. So, we've consumed the first part.\n\nNow, after t48, the next token is t68. Wait, but according to the S option, it's NT7 and NT23. So, after t48 (from NT7), the next part is NT23, which must produce t68. Let's see what NT23 can derive.\n\nLooking at NT23 rules:\n\nNT23 \u2192 t66, because one of the rules says NT23 \u2192 t66, but another rule says NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, but it depends on the context. Wait, but since NT23 can be a non-terminal, we need to see if it can produce t68 directly or through other productions.\n\nWait, looking at the NT23 productions:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t66\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n\nSo, can NT23 derive t68? It doesn't seem so. Because the direct production for NT23 only gives t66. The other production splits into two non-terminals. So, to get t68, the production must come from another path.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let's look again.\n\nLooking through the NT23 rules:\n\nYes, there's only two productions: NT23 \u2192 t66 and NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. So, perhaps NT23 can't directly produce t68. But then, how do we get t68? Maybe there's another NT node that can produce t68.\n\nLooking for NT tokens with t68.\n\nLooking through the provided NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT33: does it produce anything with t68? Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT33, it seems to have NT96 \u2192 t96 and so on. Wait, no, there's an NT33 \u2192 t33 NT7? No, wait. Let me check: the provided grammar has:\n\nLooking for NT33: I don't see it in the list. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT productions and see where t68 comes from. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe I should approach this by trying to build the parse tree from the start symbol, ensuring that each part of the string is matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting with S \u2192 NT97 NT54 would be better. Let's try that.\n\nS \u2192 NT97 NT54. The first part is NT97. Looking at the grammar, what does NT97 produce? Checking the provided rules, I see NT97 \u2192 t31. So, NT97 \u2192 t31. But the string starts with t48, which doesn't match. So, that production would not help. Hence, the initial assumption that S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is correct because NT7 produces t48.\n\nSo, after t48, we have NT23. Now, NT23 can generate t66 or split into NT45 and NT53. So, to get t68, perhaps the next step is to look at NT45 or NT53.\n\nWait, but the current part of the string is t68. So, the next token after t48 is t68, which must come from NT23. But if NT23 can only produce t66 directly, then how do we get t68? That doesn't seem possible. This suggests that maybe the starting production isn't S \u2192 NT7 NT23, but perhaps something else is wrong with my approach.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. The string is a sequence of t followed by numbers, so each step in the derivation must correspond to a production that either introduces a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a parser, keeping track of the stack or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar by seeing if each terminal in the string corresponds to a direct production rule of some NT, and the structure aligns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built from a series of non-terminals that can be substituted step by step.\n\nLet me try to list the grammar rules again and see which terminals correspond to which NTs.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are the NT rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t48\nNT10 \u2192 t10\nNT16 \u2192 t90\nNT18 \u2192 t96\nNT23 \u2192 t66, or splits into NT45 and NT53\nNT28 \u2192 t36 or NT45 and NT53\nNT31 \u2192 t97\nNT33 \u2192 t33 (which is another terminal), or maybe more?\nNT35: looking at the grammar, I don't see NT35 directly. Wait, I need to check the NT35 rule.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT35 is not listed as a terminal. Looking back, perhaps I should list all terminal steps in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the NT entries, any that have a \"\u2192 a\" where a is a terminal:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t48\nNT10 \u2192 t10\nNT16 \u2192 t90\nNT23 \u2192 t66\nNT28 \u2192 t36\nNT33 \u2192 t33\nNT40 \u2192 t17\nNT41 \u2192 t68\nNT48 \u2192 t86\nNT53 \u2192 t85\nNT66 \u2192 t51\nNT96 \u2192 t48\nNT97 \u2192 t31\nNT98 \u2192 t86?\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nLooking for NT \u2192 a where a is a terminal:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t48\n- NT10 \u2192 t10\n- NT16 \u2192 t90\n- NT23 \u2192 t66\n- NT28 \u2192 t36\n- NT33: no, in the provided rules, NT33 is more complicated.\nWait, in the given grammar, do any other NTs produce terminals?\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t48\n- NT97 \u2192 t31\n- NT98 \u2192 t48\n- NT10 \u2192 t10\n- NT16 \u2192 t90\n- NT23 \u2192 t66, or splits into NT45 NT53\n- NT28 \u2192 t36, or splits into NT45 NT53\n- NT35 appears as a non-terminal in multiple places but not as a terminal.\nWait, let's check NT53:\n\nLooking at NT53: NT53 \u2192 t85\nAnd NT53 also appears in other productions.\n\nYes, so NT53 \u2192 t85.\n\nSimilarly, NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-797","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. But wait, actually, in CNF, it's either two non-terminals or a terminal. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some of the rules have a terminal on the right, like NT54 -> 't93' and NT1 -> 't57', etc. So each production is either A->BC or A->a.\n\nFirst, let's parse the string. The string given is a sequence of t-commands, which must be generated from the non-terminals through the productions.\n\nThe string is: t48 t33 t86 t68 t96 t57 t71 t96 t68 t96 t86 t68 t96 t87 t41 t48 t71 t66 t51 t90 t41 t85 t48 t71 t85 t86 t41 t41 t57 t57 t48 t17 t36 t62 t57 t86 t41 t41 t57 t48 t35 t85.\n\nSo, step 1: I need to find a way to parse this string using the given grammar. But manually expanding all possibilities is going to be time-consuming. Maybe it's easier to approach this as an ambiguous grammar, but the question is just about existence.\n\nAnother approach: Since the grammar is context-free and in CNF, we can check if the string can be generated by the grammar by analyzing the structure.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the start symbol is S, which produces NT97 NT23 or NT99 NT54, etc. The initial expansions would be from S to two non-terminals, each of which further expand.\n\nBut given the length of the string (which is 50 tokens), I'm thinking the string must be quite long in terms of steps. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be decomposed into parts that match the productions.\n\nFirst, let me note that some non-terminals produce terminals directly, such as NT1 -> 't57', NT46 -> 't13', NT28 -> 't36', etc. So perhaps some parts of the string can be directly matched to these productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be built up by combining the non-terminals through the given productions.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to check the structure of the string, perhaps looking for the top-down expansions.\n\nBut perhaps I can think of the string as a series of tokens that must fit into the production tree. Let's list the tokens again for clarity:\n\nt48, t33, t86, t68, t96, t57, t71, t96, t68, t96, t86, t68, t96, t87, t41, t48, t71, t66, t51, t90, t41, t85, t48, t71, t85, t86, t41, t41, t57, t57, t48, t17, t36, t62, t57, t86, t41, t41, t57, t48, t35, t85.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should see if this string can be created by combining the rules step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to see if the tokens match any of the direct productions or can be built by combining smaller sequences.\n\nLet me think about the terminal symbols:\n\n- t71 appears in NT40 -> 't71'\n\n- t33 is NT13 -> 't33' (since NT13 -> NT41 NT18, which then becomes t68 t96)\n\n- t86 can be from NT23 -> 't86' (check if NT23 has any rule with t86 on the right. Looking back: NT23 has multiple rules, but one of them is NT23 -> 't86' if I'm looking correctly. Wait, yes: looking at the productions, NT23 appears in some rules where it's a terminal, like NT84 -> NT23? Or wait, let me check the grammar properly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production NT23 can be either:\n\nNT84 -> NT23 \u2192 Not sure. Wait, in the initial part, some S productions are given, but after that, it's a list of non-terminals with their productions. I need to parse each line correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this differently. Let me outline the approach:\n\n1. Break down the string into tokens and see if they can be matched to any productions or combinations.\n\n2. Since it's a context-free grammar, perhaps we can use the parse tree approach, starting from the top symbol and seeing how it can be broken down.\n\nBut considering the length, maybe I can look for patterns or repeated sequences.\n\nFirst, notice that the string starts with t48. Let's see which non-terminals produce t48.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\nNT7 -> 't48' \u2192 So if a non-terminal is NT7, it can be replaced with t48.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, is there any production that produces t48?\n\nYes, NT48 is used elsewhere, but does any non-terminal produce t48 directly? Yes:\n\nNT7 -> 't48'\n\nSo, the first token, t48, must come from NT7.\n\nLooking at NT7's production rules:\n\nNT7 isn't shown in the initial part; let me check all the lines carefully.\n\nLooking through the list, no NT7 has a production listed except for the line: NT7 -> 't48'. Wait, but looking more carefully, the line is:\n\n\"NT7 -> 't48'\"\n\nWait, so actually, NT7 is a terminal. Or is it? Hmm, in the given grammar, NT7 is a non-terminal because it has a production rule, even though it's a terminal in this case. Wait, but in the list, NT7 is only used once. So perhaps NT7 is 't48', meaning that any occurrence of NT7 can be replaced by t48.\n\nSo the first token is t48, which can only come from NT7.\n\nNow, how do we get NT7 into the parse tree? Because the start symbol is S. So we need to see how S can produce something that includes NT7.\n\nLooking at the S productions:\n\nS -> NT97 NT23\n\nS -> NT99 NT54\n\nSo, starting with S, the first expansion would produce NT97 and NT23. Or other combinations.\n\nIf I can derive NT7 from one of these, but NT97 and NT23 are both non-terminals. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT97: one of the productions is NT97 -> 't31'.\n\nSo NT97 can be replaced with t31. Not NT7.\n\nNT23 has a production NT23 -> 't86' as well. So perhaps if one of these can be transformed into NT7, but looking at their productions, not directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT97 and NT23 can be replaced further, and somehow that produces NT7.\n\nWait, maybe another production rule produces NT7 or is derived from NT7.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT7 being produced by other non-terminals. It's only a production for NT7 itself. So perhaps to get NT7, we need to replace another non-terminal into it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a path where another non-terminal can be expanded to NT7. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT40 -> 't71' so it's a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT28 -> 't36', NT84 -> 't4', etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the path through the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe it's helpful to think about the first token, t48 (NT7). So, S must produce something that includes NT7 as one of the non-terminals. So, from S, the first expansion is either NT97 and NT23, but we can only get t48 from NT7. So, how can NT7 be a part of NT97 or NT23?\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nNo, S is the start symbol and produces two non-terminals, say A and B. So, after expanding A and B, perhaps one of them can be further expanded to produce t48.\n\nLooking again: S can produce NT97 NT23 or other combinations. Let me see if any of these two can produce t48.\n\nNT97 -> 't31' and other rules. So NT97 can't produce t48.\n\nWhat about NT23?

So S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which would generate t48 followed by whatever NT23 generates.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT97 NT54, which would generate t31 followed by whatever NT54 generates. But in the string, we start with t48, so the first production must be S \u2192 NT7 NT23, generating t48 followed by NT23's production.\n\nSo the first step is to generate t48, then we need to generate the remaining string starting from NT23.\n\nNow, NT23 can produce either another pair of non-terminals or, from the grammar, something like \"NT23 -> t62\" or similar. Looking at the grammar rules, let's check NT23's productions.\n\nFrom the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT84 \u2192 NT86, which is part of the 'something' but NT23 isn't directly producing t62. Wait, no: wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, the production for NT23 is either:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n\nor\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nLooking through the provided rules, for NT23, I can see:\n\n\"NT23 -> NT45 NT53\"\n\n\"NT23 -> NT13 NT50\"\n\nSo, NT23 must be transformed into two non-terminals. However, in the string, after t48, the next token is t68, so the next production must produce t68.\n\nBut wait, the production for NT23 is either of those two, so we need to see if from the production chain, we can generate t68.\n\nLet me consider the first production: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53.\n\nSo now, after t48, we need to generate from NT45 followed by NT53.\n\nFirst, NT45 can generate a 't' and a number. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT45 being terminal, but I do see:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't54'\n\nYes, line: NT45 \u2192 't54'\n\nSo NT45 produces t54. So the first part is t48, then t54 from NT45.\n\nNow, we have to generate the next token after t54, which is t68. But the next production is NT53.\n\nWait, no\u2014the string is t48 t68 t96 ..., so after t48 comes t68, then t96, and so on.\n\nWait, wait a second: the initial production is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, so after t48 comes whatever NT23 produces. NT23's first production is NT45 NT53. So we use NT45 and NT53.\n\nFrom the string, after t48, the next token is t68, which is at position 2, so we need to generate t68 from NT23's production. But according to the first production, NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53. Then NT45 gives t54, so after t48 comes t54, but in the string, after t48, it's t68. That's a mismatch. Therefore, perhaps the first production for NT23 isn't the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check the second production for NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50.\n\nSo, if we take NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50, then after t48, we have to produce t68 from NT13 NT50.\n\nSo let's see: NT13 can produce either 't33' or something else.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT13 \u2192 't68'?\n\nWait, no: let me check.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n\"NT13 -> 't33'\" and \"NT33 is something else?\" Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT13 having another production. Wait, no\u2014NT13 is directly producing 't33', so that's a terminal. That means, if we choose NT13, we get 't33"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-817","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is pretty complex with a bunch of productions, and the string is a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers. My job is to figure out whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars in CNF have productions of the form A -> BC or A -> t, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and t is a terminal symbol. The fact that it's in CNF means that the parse trees will be binary and each production is either a pair of non-terminals or a terminal. This makes parsing deterministic if I can build a CYK table.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT23 in the first production. So the first step is to see if the entire string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to NT99 and NT23 respectively. Because in the first production, S splits into NT99 and NT23, each of which needs to generate a part of the string.\n\nSo, the string is divided into two parts: the first half from t48 to t68 and the second half from t96 to the end. Wait, actually, that might not be accurate because I don't know the exact splitting. Maybe I should think in terms of the number of symbols. The string has 30 symbols, which is even, so perhaps it splits into two equal parts of 15 each. But before getting into CYK, maybe I can trace through the grammar.\n\nWait, let's look at the productions to see how the terminals come into play. For example, NT97 -> 't31' and NT16 -> 't90'. So some non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols. The goal is to see if each part of the string can be mapped recursively using the productions.\n\nLet me see the structure:\n\n1. S -> NT99 NT23. So the string is split into two parts: the first part generated by NT99 and the second by NT23.\n\nFor NT99, looking at the productions:\nNT99 -> NT66 NT16.\n\nThen NT66 -> NT51, which is a terminal 't51', which matches the 9th token in the string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't48'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the order wrong. Let me list the string again:\n\nt48, t68, t96, t84, t32, t48, t35, t66, t68, t96, t96, t51, t10, t17, t41, t85, t71, t86, t36, t96, t41, t13, t33, t10, t85, t37, t71, t57, t19, t41, t41, t48, t71, t13, t13, t96, t41, t85, t48, t35, t13, t62, t57.\n\nWait, wait, no\u2014the string provided is the second one, let me count them.

{"custom_id":"request-813","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether a specific string is in the language defined by this grammar. Hmm, let me see. \n\nFirst, I remember Chomsky normal form has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. That's helpful because it means each production expands a non-terminal into two parts, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, the first rule is S -> NT7 NT23. Wait, but in the provided grammar, S is a starting symbol, and each rule produces two NT parts except for the ones where the right-hand side might have a terminal. Wait, no, actually, most of them are non-terminals until some point. For example, NT54 is defined as -> 't12', which is a terminal. So, each production from a non-terminal can eventually produce terminals, either directly or through other productions.\n\nThe string to analyze is: `t48 t51 t90 t41 t36 t68 t96 t86 t62 t35 t86 t86 t35 t86 t33 t4 t32 t57 t48 t71 t66 t68 t96 t10 t36 t86 t37 t17 t57 t71 t96 t62 t25 t32 t41 t41 t12 t25 t19 t57 t48 t71 t85`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the derivation tree for any string will have a height proportional to log(n), where n is the length of the string. Each step doubles the number of symbols, so the number of steps needed to derive a string of length m is O(log m). Let me check the length of the string: it's 68 tokens long. So, log2(68) is about 6. So, the derivation will have around 6 layers.\n\nBut with a context-free grammar, top-down parsing can be done with the CYK algorithm. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step by matching the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for possible leftmost or rightmost derivations. But given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to approach this by starting from the initial symbol S and see if it can derive this string.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, I might need to break it down. Let me see. The starting symbol is S, which initially splits into NT7 and NT23. So, the string must begin with whatever NT7 can produce followed by whatever NT23 can produce. Similarly, at each step, any non-terminal can be replaced by the two parts of one of its productions.\n\nWait, but to parse the string, maybe it's better to think in reverse, but perhaps working from the root down.\n\nAlternatively, we can attempt to find a sequence of productions that leads to the given string. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nLet me see what each part of the string corresponds to.\n\nThe string starts with t48. Let me see which non-terminals produce t48.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the terminals (since they are produced by NTs), I see that some NTs produce t48:\n\nNT48 is defined in one place as NT53 NT48 (wait, no, I think I need to check the productions again.\n\nWait, the productions given include NT54 -> 't12' ?

Wait, no, I think it's 't68' as a terminal.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, let's see:\n\nNT48 is defined as -> 't96'\n\nAlso, NT18 is defined as -> 't96'\n\nAlternatively, perhaps other NTs produce 't48':\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT7 -> 't48' and NT18 -> 't96', so perhaps 't48' comes only from NT7.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t48, which must come from NT7. So, in the initial split, S-> NT7 NT23, or S-> NT97 NT54.\n\nWait, if S splits into NT7 and NT23, then that would match the first token t48 from NT7. Then, the next token is t51.

{"custom_id":"request-831","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me see. I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, but the string is quite long with a bunch of 't's followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. CNF is a way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that structure because all the rules have two non-terminals on the right side except for those that end with a terminal like 't48' etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols (like 't48', 't68', etc.) followed by 't's and numbers. My task is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nSince the string is long, I'll need an efficient way to approach this. One method is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse strings according to a grammar in CNF. CYK builds a table where each cell represents whether a non-terminal can derive a substring of the string. \n\nHere's how the process might work:\n\n1. **Initialize the Table**: The table has rows and columns corresponding to the length of the string. The first step is to mark which non-terminals can derive each single character in the string.\n\n2. **Fill the Table**: Starting from the second row (since the first row is just individual characters), for each substring of increasing length, check if there\u2019s a production rule that can generate that substring. For substrings of length more than one, we look for non-terminals that can split the substring into two parts, each derivable by some rule.\n\n3. **Check for the Start Symbol**: If by the end, the entire string can be derived by the start symbol S, then the string is accepted.\n\nBut setting up the CYK table manually for such a long string would be time-consuming. Perhaps there's a pattern or a way to see if the string can be broken down using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t48 t68 t96 t99 t66 t68 t96 t86 t86 t71 t86 t86 t35 t86 t33 t84 t71 t96 t86 t48 t71 t85 t57 t71 t86 t62 t35 t96 t68 t96 t85 t17 t57 t19 t41 t41 t41 t41 t41 t57 t48 t17 t85 t37`\n\nI notice a lot of repeated 't86's, 't96's, and several 't's with numbers. So perhaps the string is a concatenation of several productions that produce these terminals.\n\nLet me check the grammar rules to see which terminals are directly defined. For example, the rule S \u2192 NT7 NT23 would produce 't48' and 't32' (since NT7 is 't48' and NT23 is 't32'). Similarly, other rules produce specific terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar's initial rule is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which directly leads to 't48 t32' when derived. But the string starts with 't48 t68 t96', so maybe multiple productions are being applied in sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to parse the string into segments that match the grammar. For instance, each segment could correspond to a production rule that has non-terminals, which in turn are replaced by other terms.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be divided into parts that each correspond to a production in the grammar. For example, looking at the string:\n\n- 't48' is produced by NT7 (S \u2192 NT7 NT23 gives 't48' and 't32')\n- 't68' is an NT something. Looking at the grammar, there's a rule NT68? Wait, no\u2014let me check the grammar. Oh, in the grammar, for example, NT66 \u2192 NT51 NT16, which leads to terms with t51 and t16. I don't see a direct rule for NT68. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should map which terminals are produced by each non-terminal. Let's go through the rules:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16 \u2192 t51 and t16\nNT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54 \u2192 t87 and t12\nNT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98 \u2192 t96 and t98 (both are terminals)\nNT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1 \u2192 t94 and t48\nNT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95 \u2192 t96 and t95\nNT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95 \u2192 t51 and t95\nNT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23 \u2192 t36 and t32\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 \u2192 t33 and t68 (because NT45 is 't33' and NT53 is 't68')\nNT48 \u2192 t96\nNT98 \u2192 t40 and t90 \u2192 t40 (from NT8) and 't40 NT8' etc.\n\nWait, looking back, for example, NT23 can produce 't32' (since NT23 \u2192 't62' according to the rules? Wait, let me check: in the given grammar, NT23 appears in the production NT22 \u2192 NT35 NT96 (I think I might have misread earlier). Wait, the rules are:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules again, for example:\n\n- NT99 -> NT66 NT16\n- NT16 -> NT56 NT40\n- NT56 -> t10\n- NT40 -> t71\nSo NT16 \u2192 't71' and 't10' \u2192 't71 t10'\n\nSimilarly, NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 \u2192 t33 and t68.\n\nWait, so each NT rule ends with producing specific 't's and numbers.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 't's with numbers, each step being a production from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed into a sequence of non-terminals that expand according to the grammar.\n\nAnother thought is to see if the string can be split into parts where each part is generated by the rules in the grammar. For example:\n\nThe string starts with t48. Looking for rules that produce t48. From the grammar, there's a production where NT77 \u2192 t48 or?\n\nWait, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which would produce t48 (from NT7) and t32 (from NT23). But looking at the string, the first token is t48, so perhaps after S expands, one of the NTs has to produce t48, and the other has to produce the second token t68.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t48, t68, t96, t99, t66, etc. So the first two tokens t48 and t68 may correspond to NTs expanding from the first two non-terminals in S's expansion.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT7 NT23. NT7 produces t48, and NT23 produces t32. But the string starts with t48, t68, not t48, t32. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is built from a single expansion starting from S, with multiple recursive steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of the grammar. Let's see the start symbol is S. When S is expanded, it's split into NT7 and NT23, each of which then expand further.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT7 NT23 \u2192 (some expansion of NT7) (some expansion of NT23)\n\nFrom the grammar, NT7 has production rules. For example, looking at the grammar, NT7's production rules: Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see a NT7 rule except where NT97 becomes t31. Wait, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rules are: \n\nLooking for NT7, I see:\n\n- NT23 appears in the production NT22 \u2192 NT35 NT96. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because the grammar is a bit intertwined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by checking if the string can be broken down into a series of terminals that correspond to the allowed expansions.\n\nAnother approach is to start parsing the string step by step, keeping track of possible non-terminals that can generate each part.\n\nGiven the string: t48 t68 t96 t99 t66 t68 t96 t86 t86 t71 t86 t86 t35 t86 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar provided is in CNF since all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by two non-terminals.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if there's a derivation path from the start symbol S to this string by expanding the non-terminals step by step, each time replacing a non-terminal with two symbols (which could be terminals or non-terminals) until all symbols are terminals forming the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t48`, so I check which non-terminals can produce `t48`. Looking through the productions, I see that:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT28 -> 't66' but that's not `t48`.\n- NT8 -> 't32' and 't19', so not `t48`.\n- NT56 -> 't99' and 't40'; no.\n- NT86 -> 't25' but that's a terminal, not `t48`.\n- NT66 -> 't51' and 't16' (where `t16` is a terminal).\n- NT54 -> 't53' and 't1' (both terminals).\n- NT94 -> 't87' and 't98' (both are non-terminals that eventually produce terminals).\n- NT23 -> 't62' and 't86' (non-terminals leading to terminals).\n\nHmm, let me check ND7's rules. Oh, looking back, the production S -> NT7 NT23. Wait, no, the initial productions of S are S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe initial grammar is:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nWait, but looking at the provided grammar, actually S is split into two: S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. So the start symbol S can split into either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54.\n\nNow, looking at the first token is t48, which is produced by NT7. So I'll consider the branch starting with S -> NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, NT7 produces t48 and possibly other terminals or non-terminals. Let me see what NT7 can do.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT7:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48' (so that's one option)\n- Also, looking at the production rules, do I see any that start with NT7? No, looking through all the productions, the only rule for NT7 is NT7 -> 't48'. Wait, no, let's double-check the grammar provided. Oh wait, in the list above, the rules are:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48' \u2192 yes, that's the rule.\n\nSo, NT7 can only produce 't48'. Therefore, the first symbol in the string must come from NT7 -> 't48'. So that's the first step.\n\nNow, the next part of the string after t48 is t51. So after NT7 produces t48, the other part of S is NT23. So NT23 must generate the rest of the string after t48.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions:\n\n- NT23 -> NT56 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT53 NT86\n\nWait, the actual productions from the grammar are:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, the production for NT23 is:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT53 NT86\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided productions:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT53 NT86\n\nWait, no, my mistake. Let me list all NT23's rules:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53 (same as above)\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86 (wait, no, NT23)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all NT23 rules:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, the NT23 productions are:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT53 NT86\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53 (same as first)\n- Also, looking further, NT99 -> NT28 NT18, etc., but wait, no. NT23's rules are only four:\n\n1. NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n2. NT23 -> NT45 NT53 (duplicate)\n3. NT23 -> NT84 NT23\n4. NT23 -> NT84 NT53\n5. NT23 -> NT53 NT86\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted, but as per the provided data:\n\nNT23 has:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT53 NT86\n- Also, looking at the rules for other non-terminals, that's all.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's list them correctly:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar rules:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT84 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT53 NT86\n\nWait, but that's all the NT23 rules. So, each time a NT23 appears, it can be replaced by one of these four options.\n\nOur goal is to derive \"t51 t23 t41...\" after the initial t48, so the next symbol after t48 is t51.\n\nWait, no. The string is a sequence of t symbols, but according to the grammar, the string must be generated as a sequence of non-terminals expanding into terminals. So the initial S -> NT7 NT23 would produce t48 and then NT23 must produce the rest of the string, one symbol at a time.\n\nWait, no, because each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nIn a CNF grammar, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So, starting from S, which is at the top level as NT7 and NT23, when you expand NT7, it becomes t48. Then you have to expand NT23 until you get all terminals.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of all terminals, so each non-terminal in the derivation must eventually be expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, after S -> NT7 NT23, NT7 becomes t48, which is a terminal. Then we need to expand NT23 to produce the rest of the string, which starts with t51.\n\nBut wait, in a derivation, when you expand a non-terminal, you replace it with two symbols. So after S becomes NT7 NT23, the initial expansion is:\n\nt48 NT23\n\nNow, to get the next symbol, which is t51, the NT23 must expand to produce t51 as the next symbol. Wait, but NT23's rules produce two non-terminals. For example, one rule is NT23 -> NT45 NT53.

{"custom_id":"request-849","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of symbols starting with 't's and some numbers, and the grammar has a bunch of productions from non-terminals to other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, I'm trying to recall what CNF means. CNF is a form where every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, most of the productions follow this structure, like S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Each non-terminal on the left produces two other non-terminals, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal symbol, like NT54 \u2192 't12' or NT23 \u2192 't48' etc. So the grammar seems to be in CNF, which is good because it might make parsing easier.\n\nNow, the string we need to check is a sequence of tokens: `t48 t33 t86 t13 t96 t41 t85 t71 t96 t51 t10 t17 t41 t85 t35 t86 t51 t90 t41 t36 t68 t96 t57 t19 t48 t17 t36 t66 t96 t41 t13 t62 t48 t71 t85 t71 t87 t41 t41 t41 t41 t48 t71 t85 t57`.\n\nI'm thinking that since the grammar is in CNF, we might be able to use the CYK algorithm to determine if the string is in the language. But I'm not super familiar with CYK, so maybe I can approach this by trying to break down the string into possible parse trees.\n\nEach production in the grammar starts with a non-terminal and produces two other symbols. So each step of the derivation produces a tree where each node is a non-terminal with two children. Since the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each node in the parse tree should correspond to one of these.\n\nI should start by looking at the start symbol, S, and see which production it has. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. So S can produce either of these two pairs.\n\nLet me consider the first production: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. That would mean the string would start with NT7 producing 't48' and NT23 producing 't62', as per the given rules. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't48' (from NT7 -> 't48'), and NT23 \u2192 't62' (from NT23 -> 't62'). So the string starts with 't48 t62', but the first token is 't48'. So in this case, the first production would produce 't48 t62', but our string starts with 't48', so maybe that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the grammar again. The start symbol S has two productions:\n\n1. NT7 -> NT 7 (in the grammar, I see NT7 -> 't48')\n   And NT23 -> 't62', as per the given rules.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT7 NT23, then S would derive 't48' followed by 't62'. But the string starts with 't48', followed by 't33'. So that wouldn't match because S would require 't48' followed by 't62', not 't33'.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the other production: S \u2192 NT97 NT54. From the grammar, NT97 \u2192 't31' and NT54 \u2192 't12'. So that would produce 't31 t12' as the start of the string, which is not our case because our string starts with 't48 t33'.\n\nHmm. Wait a second, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe when the non-terminals are expanded, they might produce other non-terminals, so it's not just a direct production to terminal symbols.\n\nFor example, let's take S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Then NT7 \u2192 't48', yes. But NT23 might expand into more non-terminals. So let's see what NT23 does.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 has several productions. One of them is NT23 \u2192 't62'. Another is NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, and other more complex productions.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, each production must consist of exactly two non-terminals. So NT23 can either produce a terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, yes, I see NT23 \u2192 't62' (a terminal) and NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, which are non-terminals. So NT23 can be 't62' or split into two non-terminals.\n\nIn our case, S \u2192 NT7 NT23: if NT7 is 't48', then NT23 must be 't33' according to the string. But in the grammar, NT23 can produce 't62' or other non-terminals. 't33' is not one of the terminals directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but the grammar's terminals include 't93', 't31', 't48', 't19', etc. Let me check if 't33' is a terminal in the grammar. Looking at the given productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't33'. So maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not in the language because one of the terminals doesn't appear in the grammar as a production. Let me check all the tokens in the string: all of them are 't' followed by a two-digit number, like 't48', 't33', etc. So I need to check if every token in the string is among the terminals defined in the grammar.\n\nFrom looking at the grammar's production rules, I can see that NT99 \u2192 't51', NT48 \u2192 't96', NT86 \u2192 't25', etc. I need to list all terminals present in the grammar.\n\nLet me go through each production that ends with a terminal symbol:\n\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23: terminals 't48', 't62'\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54: 't31', 't12'\n- NT99 \u2192 't51'\n- NT58 \u2192 't94', 't54'\n- NT94 \u2192 't96', 't98'\n- NT55 \u2192 't90', 't1'\n- NT90 \u2192 't94', 't95'\n- NT45 \u2192 't99', 't95'\n- NT59 \u2192 't56', 't53'\n- NT53 \u2192 't28', 't23'\n- NT96 \u2192 't48', 't23'\n- NT98 \u2192 't48', 't95'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90', 't40'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62'\n- NT84 \u2192 't58', 't86'\n- NT23 \u2192 't13', 't50'\n- NT99 \u2192 't28', 't18'\n- NT13 \u2192 't41', 't18'\n- NT90 \u2192 't84', 't8'\n- NT50 \u2192 't55', 't1'\n- NT8 \u2192 't40', 't96'\n- NT58 \u2192 't22', 't8'\n- NT98 \u2192 't40', 't90'\n- NT1 \u2192 't88', 't53'\n- NT50 \u2192 't59', 't46'\n- NT88 \u2192 't7', 't40'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12' (multiple times)\n- NT97 \u2192 't31' (multiple times)\n- NT40 \u2192 't71' (multiple times)\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT41 \u2192 't68'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12' (also appears as a production)\n- NT46 \u2192 't13'\n- NT48 \u2192 't96'\n- NT94 \u2192 't87'\n- NT46 \u2192 't37'\n- NT23 \u2192 't62' (multiple times)\n- NT48 \u2192 't86'\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT97 \u2192 't5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-850","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is provided as a sequence of symbols: `t48 t68 t96 t84 t35 t96 t68 t96 t99 t13 t68 t96 t85 t37 t48 t35 t36 t13 t96 t41 t66 t68 t96 t86 t66 t96 t41 t85 t71 t87 t41 t41 t48 t71 t36 t86 t57 t48 t17 t66 t33 t57 t32 t57 t57`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. Since it's in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The grammar provided has these rules. I notice that many non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals, for example, NT54 \u2192 't12', so 't12' is a terminal, and similar with others. \n\nThe string starts with 't48', which is a terminal. I need to see which non-terminals can produce 't48'. Looking at the grammar, NT40 \u2192 't71', NT46 \u2192 't37', and NT23 \u2192 't62'. Also, NT50 \u2192 't85' via NT59 \u2192 't56' and so on. But the string starts with 't48', which I need to see if there's a non-terminal that produces 't48'. Checking the rules, I see NT58 \u2192 't22' (wait, no, NT58 \u2192 't22' isn't 't48'. Hmm, looking again, NT86 \u2192 't25', so maybe 't48' comes from a different path.\n\nWait, let's look at NT7 \u2192 't48'. So NT7 directly produces 't48'. That's one option. But how do I reach NT7 in the derivation? Let's see the start symbol: S \u2192 NT7 NT23. So S produces two non-terminals: NT7 and NT23. Then, each of those can be expanded as per the rules.\n\nSo, for the string to start with 't48', NG7 must be expanded. Since NT7 \u2192 't48', that part is fine. Then, the next symbols are connected by the next part of the string.\n\nLooking at the next symbol after 't48' is 't68'. So after NT7 is 't48', the next is 't68'. That would come from expanding NT23, right? Because S \u2192 NT7 NT23, and then each is expanded: NT7 gives 't48', NT23 is 't68'. So the first two symbols are covered.\n\nNow, the third part is the third symbol, which is 't96'. Let's look at NT23's expansion. In the grammar, NT23 can be expanded into NT48, NT57, or maybe others. Wait, the rules for NT23 include:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT48 NT23\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\nNT23 \u2192 NT84 NT23\nNT23 \u2192 NT16 NT40\nNT23 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 but that's 't48'.\n\nWait, but looking at the provided rules, for NT23, from the given list, it's expanding into other non-terminals. Specifically, NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, and others. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking at NT23's rules:\n\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\nNT23 -> NT45 NT53 again\nNT23 -> NT84 NT23\nNT23 -> NT16 NT40\nNT23 -> NT7 (which is 't48')\n\nWait, the first part of the string after 't48 t68' is 't96', which is the third symbol. So after 't48 t68', the next is 't96'.\n\nSo I think the 't96' comes from NT23's expansion. Let me see which rules can produce 't96'. Looking at NT23, possible expansions:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT48 NT23: so NT48 produces 't48' (from NT40 \u2192 't71' and so on), but wait, NT48: looking at the rules, NT48 can expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack. Let me reconstruct the possible path.\n\nThe initial expansion is S \u2192 NT7 NT23, so first non-terminal is NT7, which becomes 't48'. The next is NT23, which needs to become 't68', so what does NT23 expand into?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23's productions include NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 and NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50, which might expand into 't68' via NT13 or NT50. Let's check:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18 and so on. Wait, I think I might be getting confused here. Let me approach this differently.\n\nI'll try to parse the string step by step, starting from S, and see if I can derive it.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n   - NT7 \u2192 't48' (third symbol is 't48')\n   - NT23 \u2192 ?\n\n2. After NT7 becomes 't48', the next symbol is 't68'. So NT23 must derive 't68'. Looking at the rules for NT23, possible immediate derivations are:\n\n   - NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50: So 't68' would mean NT13 \u2192 't68'?\n   - Or NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53, but neither NT45 nor NT53 produce 't68' immediately. Wait, maybe I should check which non-terminals produce 't68'.\n\nLooking at the terminal symbols, 't68' is produced by NT23 and maybe others. Let me check:\n\nFrom the provided rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't68' indirectly? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT45 \u2192 't99', so no. NT53 \u2192 't85', so no. NT40 \u2192 't71', no. NT86 \u2192 't25', no. Oh, but looking at NT84 \u2192 't84' but that would produce 't84'. Wait, maybe 't68' is directly produced by some non-terminal?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again. Are there any non-terminals that directly produce 't68'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only non-terminals that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53 (no terminal yet)\n- NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18 (no terminal)\n- NT95 \u2192 't41' (Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT95 \u2192 't41'? Let me check.\n\nWait, no: NT95 \u2192 't41' is written as \"NT95 -> 't41'\". Yes, so NT95 directly produces 't41'. Similarly:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't48'\n- NT23 \u2192 't68'\n- NT16 \u2192 't90'\n- NT28 \u2192 't66'\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT84 \u2192 't57'\n- NT84 \u2192 't84' (Wait, earlier I thought that, but looking back, the grammar for NT84 is: NT84 -> 't4' and NT84 -> 't84'. Wait, the productions for NT84 are:\n\nFrom the rule list:\n\nNT84 -> 't4' \u2192 that's a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the input string, after 't48 t68', the third symbol is 't96'. So perhaps I'm getting stuck here.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nNT7 \u2192 't48' (so first symbol is 't48').\n\nNT23 must become 't68' (second symbol). But looking at NT23's expansions:\n\nIs there a way for NT23 to produce 't68'? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\nNT23 has several productions:\n\n1. NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-871","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that CNF has specific rules where each non-terminal can only produce two terminals or another non-terminal. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. The starting symbol is S, and its productions are S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. So S splits into two non-terminals, each of which then splits into further non-terminals until we get down to terminals, which are the 't' strings with numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' terms. It looks like a long list of them: t48, t36, t96, etc., all the way to the end. My task is to see if these terms can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production generates exactly two symbols. So the string has to be a series of these steps where each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, until only the terminals remain. The length of the string should match the number of productions needed to reach a terminal string, which should be 2^n, where n is the number of splits from S.\n\nWait, let me check the length. The string has... let me count: starting with 28 terms. Wait, no, let's recount:\n\nLooking at the string: t48 t36 t96 t41 t36 t51 t23 t41 t36 t33 t86 t68 t96 t96 t13 t96 t41 t85 t96 t41 t41 t48 t17 t13 t13 t96 t41 t36 t62 t48 t71 t66 t68 t96 t99 t85 t37 t86 t41 t41 t48 t35 t85 t48 t71 t85.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens. I'll start from the beginning:\n\n1. t48\n2. t36\n3. t96\n4. t41\n5. t36\n6. t51\n7. t23\n8. t41\n9. t36\n10. t33\n11. t86\n12. t68\n13. t96\n14. t96\n15. t13\n16. t96\n17. t41\n18. t85\n19. t96\n20. t41\n21. t41\n22. t48\n23. t17\n24. t13\n25. t13\n26. t96\n27. t41\n28. t36\n29. t62\n30. t48\n31. t71\n32. t66\n33. t68\n34. t96\n35. t99\n36. t85\n37. t37\n38. t86\n39. t41\n40. t41\n41. t48\n42. t35\n43. t85\n44. t48\n45. t71\n46. t85.\n\nWait, that's 46 terms. Hmm, that's an even number, but I need to check if it's a possible length for a derivation starting from S. Let's see: S starts and each step splits each non-terminal into two, so the number of symbols grows exponentially. For example, S (1) -> two NTs (2). Each of those can split into two each, leading to 4, then 8, 16, etc. So the length should be 2^k, where k is the number of steps from S.\n\nBut 46 is not a power of two. The nearest powers are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). So if the string has 46 symbols, that's in between, which suggests it's not a valid length for any derivation starting from S. Because each step doubles the count. So starting from S (1), after 1 step (S -> NTs) we have 2. After next step (those NTs split again), we have 4, then 8, etc. So 46 is not a power of two, meaning it can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe some non-terminals produce terminals and others produce non-terminals, so the count isn't necessarily 2^k. Let me think again.\n\nIn CNF, each production is two symbols, either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. But wait, no: in CNF, each production on the left is a single non-terminal, and the production is replaced by either a terminal (the string is done) or two non-terminals. Wait, no: in CNF, each production is A -> BC, where B and C are terminals or non-terminals. So each production step increases the number of symbols by 1, because replacing a non-terminal with two symbols increases the count by one.\n\nWait no, that's incorrect. When you replace a non-terminal with two symbols, it's replacing one symbol with two, so the length increases by one each time that non-terminal is replaced. So starting from S, after the first replacement (S produces two NTs), length is 2. Then each NT can produce two more symbols, so if all of them arent producing terminals yet, the length increases by one each time. But if a NT produces a terminal, then that part stops branching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's approach it differently. Let's see what the initial S produces. S can produce either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. So each S replacement has two non-terminals. Then each of those can themselves split into two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nIf a non-terminal is a terminal, it can't be split further. So for the string to end, every non-terminal in the derivation must eventually produce terminals.\n\nBut back to the string length. The string has 46 symbols, which is an even number but not a power of two. So that suggests it can't be produced because the correct count after n steps should be 2^n. For example, S split into two: 2. Each of those split: 4. Each split again: 8, etc. So after 5 steps, we have 32, and after 6, we have 64. 46 isn't either.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is No because the length doesn't match.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me think: each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by 1, not by 2. Because when you replace a single non-terminal with two symbols, the length increases by 1 each time you substitute that non-terminal. Wait, no. For example, S: 1 symbol. Replacing S with two non-terminals: 2 symbols. Then if both non-terminals are replaced, you get 4, etc. But if one is a terminal and the other is a non-terminal, then after replacement, you have 3 symbols. So the count can be variable. Therefore, the length of the string can vary.\n\nSo, the length 46 might be possible. But then, without constructing the entire derivation tree, it's difficult to confirm. But since the grammar is provided, perhaps I can find if all the tokens in the string correspond to the possible productions.\n\nWait, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the starting symbols and see if the string can be segmented according to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar's productions correspond to a specific structure, like arithmetic operations or something else. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: check for the presence of certain terminals that might not be in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, non-terminals eventually produce terminals, but I can check if all the tokens in the string are present in the grammar's terminal list.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the grammar, the non-terminals with -> 't' followed by numbers eventually end up as 't' strings with numbers. For example:\n\nNT7 -> 't48'\nNT23 -> 't62'\nNT84 -> 't23'\nAnd so on, down to terminals like 't48', 't36', etc.\n\nSo each of the tokens in the string should be a terminal in the grammar. Looking at the string, all tokens are t followed by numbers between 8 and 99, which are covered in the grammar's terminal productions.\n\nSo the next step is to see if each production step can generate the required sequence.\n\nBut this might take a long time. Alternatively, since the string length is 46, which is not a power of two, and since at each step the number of symbols increases by"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-878","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side has two non-terminals or a terminal. So, I should look at all the productions to see which ones are possible to use.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. S has two productions:\n1. S -> NT7 NT23\n2. S -> NT97 NT54\n\nI need to see if the string starts with NT7 or NT97. Wait, the string starts with 't48', which is a terminal. So, I have to check which productions end with the starting symbols of those NTs.\n\nWait, I think the NTs correspond to non-terminals that eventually derive into sequences of terminals. Each NT is a non-terminal, and the string is a sequence of terminals. So, the first step is to see how 't48' can come from an NT.\n\nLet me look at the productions for NTs and see if any produce 't48'. Looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n- NT7 -> 't48' (from NT7: NT40 NT96, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, actually, looking back, there's a production NT40 -> 't71' and NT7 -> 't48'... Wait, no, looking again, I think NT7's production is listed under NT7: -> 't48'? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\nNT40 -> 't71'\nNT8 -> 't32'\nNT56 -> 't10'\nNT95 -> 't41'\nNT28 -> 't36'\nNT8 -> 't19'\nNT41 -> 't68'\nNT54 -> 't12'\nNT46 -> 't13'\nNT48 -> 't96'\nNT94 -> 't87'\nNT46 -> 't37'\nNT23 -> 't62'\nNT48 -> 't86'\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT97 -> 't54'\nNT1 -> 't57'\nNT18 -> 't96'\nNT16 -> 't90'\nNT28 -> 't66'\nNT40 -> 't17'\nNT84 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't84'\nNT56 -> 't99'\nNT66 -> 't51'\nNT54 -> 't53'\nNT23 -> 't86'\nNT84 -> 't57'\nNT53 -> 't85'\nNT22 -> 't57'\nNT7 -> 't48'\nAh, so NT7 -> 't48'. That means in the string, 't48' corresponds to NT7.\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT7 NT23. Now, we need to see if the rest of the string can be derived from NT7 and NT23.\n\nNT7's production is fixed as 't48', so that's the first token in the string. Then, the next part is NT23. Let's look at NT23's productions. In the grammar:\n\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53 (duplicate)\n- ... wait, more precisely:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nNT23 has the following productions:\n\n1. NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n2. NT23 -> NT13 NT50\n3. NT23 -> NT45 NT53 (same as first)\n4. NT23 -> NT13 NT50 (same as second)\n5. NT23 -> NT28 NT23 (this is recursive and not helpful for derivation)\n6. NT23 -> NT45 NT53\n7. etc. So, main ones are 1 and 2.\n\nSo, NT23 can go to NT45 NT53 or NT13 NT50.\n\nIn our string, after the initial 't48' (NT7) comes 't33'. Let me see if 't33' can come from NT23.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions, the end symbols derived from NT23 are:\n\nIf NT23 -> NT45 NT53, then the terminal symbols from NT45 and NT53. Similarly for NT13 NT50.\n\nSo, I need to find what terminals NT45, NT53, NT13, NT50 derive into.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nStarting with NT45: NT45 -> NT99 NT95. Then, each of these needs to be broken down.\n\nNT99 -> NT66 NT18\nNT66 -> 't51'\nNT18 -> 't96'\n\nSo, NT99 -> t51 t96.\n\nSimilarly, NT95 -> NT96 NT98\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23, which we already know NT48 is 't48' and NT23 is the same problem again, which we can't go further unless we make decisions.\n\nWait, this seems like a loop. Maybe I should try expanding NT45 and NT53.\n\nWait, let's stop and think. The initial step is S -> NT7 NT23, which produces 't48' followed by the expansion of NT23.\n\nAfter 't48', the next token is 't33'. So, we need to see how 't33' can come from NT23.\n\nLooking at NT23, if we take the production NT23 -> NT13 NT50.\n\nSo, let's see what NT13 and NT50 derive into.\n\nNT13 -> NT41 NT18.\n\nNT41 -> NT68 (from NT68: NT41 -> 't68')\n\nAnd NT18 -> 't96'.\n\nSo, NT13 -> 't68' 't96' = 't68 t96'.\n\nNow, NT50: NT50 has two productions.\n\n1. NT50 -> NT55 NT1\n2. NT50 -> NT59 NT46\n\nSo, let's choose one. Let's pick NT50 -> NT55 NT1.\n\nNT55 -> NT90 NT1.\n\nNT90 can branch into NT94 NT95 or NT84 NT8.\n\nFirst, NT90 -> NT94 NT95.\n\nNT94 -> NT96 NT98.\n\nNT96 -> NT48 NT23. Wait, that's where we started. This seems to loop.\n\nAlternatively, NT90 -> NT84 NT8.\n\nNT84 -> NT58 NT86.\n\nWait, NT84 also has another production: NT84 -> 't4' or NT84 -> 't84'.\n\nBut in our string, after 't33', we have 't33 t99 t13...'\n\nWait, let me backtrack.\n\nOur string is:\n\nt48 t33 t99 t13 t68 t96 t99 t66 t33 t96 t62 t71 t87 t41 t41 t48 t17 t36 t33 t87 t41 t48 t17 t66 t68 t96 t96 t86 t35 t57 t19 t41 t48 t35 t13 t33 t10 t85 t37 t48 t17 t85 t57 t57 t37 t13\n\nWait, perhaps I got the positions wrong.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either to a single terminal or two non-terminals. The starting symbol is S.\n\nThe initial rule for S is:\n- S -> NT7 NT23\n- S -> NT97 NT54\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminals, either NT7 and NT23 or NT97 and NT54. Let's look at the string provided:\n\nt48 t33 t87 t41 t48 t17 t36 t68 t96 t4 t19 t48 t71 t36 t33 t85 t57 t48 t17 t36 t51 t23 t41 t66 t13 t96 t41 t13 t68 t96 t87 t41 t57 t48 t71 t36 t51 t23 t41 t66 t51 t23 t41 t36 t68 t96 t85\n\nThe first token is t48. I need to trace back how this could have been generated. Looking at the grammar, several non-terminals can produce t48. For example:\n\n- NT48 -> t86 (multiple rules for NT48 seem to lead into terminals)\n- NT50 -> t85 (via NT50 -> NT55 NT1, etc., but one rule is NT50 -> t85)\nWait, looking back at the grammar, there's a production NT50 -> 't85' directly. So NT50 can produce t85.\n\nBut the first token is t48. Wait, how is t48 produced? Looking through the grammar, I need to find a production that directly gives t48.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. Hmm, I see:\n\n- NT48 -> t96 (via NT48 -> t96)\n- Also, NT48 can be produced from other non-terminals, but none directly produce 't48' as a terminal. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Wait, looking at the grammar, some rules directly produce terminals:\n\nFor example, NT50 -> 't85' (directly). So, to get t48, maybe it's produced by a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't48'. Hmm, that's a problem. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT48 has production to 't40' and 't96', but no direct 't48'. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe an intermediate step.\n\nWait, maybe I've misread the grammar. Let me list out all the rules that produce terminals because that's how they contribute to the string:\n\n- NT97 -> 't31'\n- NT54 -> 't93'\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n- NT23 -> 't62'\n- NT40 -> 't71'\n- NT8 -> 't32'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- NT95 -> 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT84 -> 't58' (in one rule) and 't84' (another rule)\nWait, no, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT84 -> NT58 NT86\n- NT84 -> NT84 NT8 \u2192 Wait, no, looking back, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me re-express the grammar structure:\n\nThe grammar consists of rules where each left side is a non-terminal, and each right side is either a terminal or two non-terminals. From the given code:\n\nThe grammar includes:\n\n- S \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT54\nOther rules:\n- NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16\n- NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54\n- NT94 \u2192 NT96 NT98\n- NT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1\n- NT90 \u2192 NT94 NT95\n- NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\n- NT59 \u2192 NT56 NT53\n- NT53 \u2192 NT28 NT23\n- NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\n- NT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95\n- NT16 \u2192 NT56 NT40\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT86\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n- NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT18\n- NT13 \u2192 NT41 NT18\n- NT90 \u2192 NT84 NT8\n- NT50 \u2192 NT55 NT1\n- NT8 \u2192 NT40 NT96\n- NT58 \u2192 NT22 NT8\n- NT98 \u2192 NT40 NT90\n- NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT53\n- NT50 \u2192 NT59 NT46\n- NT88 \u2192 NT7 NT40\n- NT54 \u2192 't93'\n- NT97 \u2192 't31'\n- NT40 \u2192 't71'\n- NT8 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't10'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't19'\n- NT41 -> 't68'\n- NT54 -> 't12' (Wait, NT54 has another rule: 't12' and 't93')\nWait, looking back, the NT54 production is split into two rules:\n- NT54 \u2192 't93'\n- NT54 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT54 -> 't93' and also NT54 -> 't12'. So both of these are direct productions of terminal strings.\n\nSo, any occurrence of NT54 in the parse tree must be replaced by either 't93' or 't12'.\n\nBut in our string, the first token is 't48', which is different from both 't93' and 't12'. So how can 't48' be generated?\n\nWait, that's confusing. Because in the initial rule S \u2192 NT7 NT23, so S generates two non-terminals, NT7 and NT23. Now, looking at NT7 and NT23 production rules in the grammar:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I think I missed some rules earlier.\n\nLooking again:\n\nAre there any rules for NT7? I saw NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16, etc., but how about NT7?\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked NT7's production. Let's recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't48'\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT7 can directly produce 't48'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT23:\n\nNT23 has multiple production rules, but the initial parse starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23.\n\nSo, the first part of the string, 't48', must come from NT7 \u2192 't48'. So, that's possible.\n\nNow, the next part is 't33'. Since the next symbols come from the second non-terminal in S's production, which is NT23.\n\nSo, after the first two tokens (t48 t33), let's check how that could happen.\n\nLooking at NT23's production rules. From the grammar:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\nAlso, perhaps others, but I need to track how NT23 can produce 't33' as the next terminal.\n\nWait, so let's see. The second token is 't33', which is the output of NT23's production.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, does NT23 have any production that ends with 't33'? Or more likely, how does the second non-terminal NT23 produce the second token.\n\nWait, perhaps the second non-terminal (NT23) can produce 't33' via a chain of productions. Let's see.\n\nWait, from NT23's rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nSo, both options involve two non-terminals. Now, one of these might eventually produce a terminal, possibly 't33'.\n\nWe need to dive into each possibility.\n\nFirst, let's take the first option: NT23 \u2192 NT45 NT53.\n\nWe need to see what NT45 and NT53 produce.\n\nFrom NT45: NT45 \u2192 NT99 NT95\n\nFrom NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT28 NT16"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll take a look at the grammar. The start symbol is S, which splits into two non-terminals, either NT99 or NT58. Each of those then produce pairs of non-terminals or terminals. Looking through the productions, I see that many of them produce a terminal directly\u2014like NT54 \u2192 't12' or S \u2192 NT54 't12'. So, the string provided might directly correspond to some of these terminals.\n\nThe string I have is a sequence of tokens starting with 't48' and ending with 't71'. I need to parse this string to see if it can be derived from the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, so I need to check if these terminals can be connected through the productions.\n\nThe grammar has a lot of rules, so maybe I should try a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to break down the string. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach might work too. Let me think about how the string could be constructed.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it starts with 't48 t68 t96...'. Let's see where these can come from. \n\nLooking at the productions, NT16 \u2192 't90' and NT22 \u2192 't57' (wait, actually NT22 is a production? Wait, no, NT22 isn't directly a non-terminal in the given production, except it's part of the string. Wait, looking back, I see that NT22 is not a non-terminal in the first part of the rules. Let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar given has a lot of NTs and some rules produce terminals. Let me list the productions to understand better. The S starts as NT99 or NT58. Each of those produce other non-terminals. For example, NT99 can go to NT66 NT16, which then can go to terminals or more non-terminals, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps each token in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. I need to see if this string can be built by combining the terminals produced by the non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let me note that the grammar gives certain terminals directly. For instance, NT54 \u2192 't12', NT58 \u2192 't94', NT66 \u2192 't51', etc. So these terminals are directly produced. The other non-terminals go to pairs of other non-terminals, like NT99 \u2192 NT66 NT16.\n\nBut to process the string, I'll probably need to map the terminals in the string to the productions.\n\nThe string is: t48, t68, t96, t96, t33, t85, t96, t41, t41, t48, t17, t36, t86, t48, t17, t66, t68, t96, t96, t51, t99, t71, t41, t36, t86, t71, t57, t35, t86, t68, t96, t57, t19, t25, t32, t48, t71, t66, t62, t48, t71, t85, t41, t48, t71, t85, t57.\n\nThis is quite long. Let's see if I can find a way to map this to the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT99 NT58, for example. So the first step is to split the string into two parts corresponding to NT99 and NT58.\n\nBut that might not make sense because each would produce two parts themselves, leading to deeper splits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a single path from S down to the terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to try to backtrack through the grammar, ensuring that each production leads to the expected tokens.\n\nBut given that this is a complex grammar with many non-terminals, perhaps a better approach is to use a parsing algorithm, like recursive descent, but manually simulate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look for patterns or break the string into segments that match the productions.\n\nLet me start by trying to parse the string as a sequence of terminals.\n\nStarting token is t48.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can find which NTs produce t48.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT54 produces 't12', 't53', 't10', 't32', 't19', etc.\nWait, more systematically:\n\nLooking for which non-terminals produce t48.\n\nIn the given grammar, the rules for NT produce strings that result in terminals. Let me see:\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT90 NT1. So that might not involve t48.\n\nBut wait, I need to look for all NTs that directly or indirectly can lead to 't48'. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the production rules, let me find which NTs directly produce 't48'.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t71\n- NT56 \u2192 t10? Wait, no, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLet me go line by line.\n\nLooking for 't48':\n\n- NT48 appears in several productions. For example:\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95\nNT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54\nNT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\nNT48 \u2192 NT56 NT54?\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, no, my mistake. Let's look for all rules where a non-terminal is on the left and the right side includes 't48'. \n\nLooking through all production rules:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT94 NT54,\n\nBut I'm looking for 't48', not NT48.\n\nWait, perhaps NT56 \u2192 NT48? Wait, in the grammar as given, which NTs generate 't48' as a terminal? Let me check each rule:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\n- NT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95\n- NT48 \u2192 ...? Wait, in the grammar, NT48 is not a production itself. So, perhaps NT96 and NT98 produce 't48' as a terminal, through the chain:\n\nNT96 \u2192 't48' NT23, which would mean NT96 produces t48 followed by NT23.\n\nSimilarly, NT98 \u2192 't48' NT95.\n\nWait no, looking back at the grammar:\n\nThe given rules have:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT48 NT23\nNT98 \u2192 NT48 NT95\n\nSo, NT96 and NT98 can each produce a terminal 't48' followed by another non-terminal.\n\nSo, 't48' must be the first token in either a production by NT96 or NT98.\n\nWait, let's look:\n\nWhen S \u2192 NT99 NT58, then each of these might contribute to the string.\n\nBut the first token in the string is t48. So, perhaps t48 comes from NT96 or NT98. But the S rule starts with NT99 or NT58, not directly producing t48.\n\nSo, perhaps t48 comes from one of the children produced by S. Let's think about S \u2192 NT99 NT58.\n\nSo, the string would be a concatenation of the two sequences produced by NT99 and NT58.\n\nSo, let's say the first part of the string is produced by NT99, and the rest by NT58.\n\nAlternatively, the string could be split into two parts, each matching the production of NT99 and NT58.\n\nSo, the overall string is a combination of tokens generated by each part.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part is the production of NT99 and the second part is NT58, or vice versa.\n\nLet me try to parse the string as generated by S \u2192 NT99 NT58.\n\nSo, first, split the string into left and right parts, each corresponding to NT99 and NT58. But this recursive approach would require splitting the string into two parts each time, which can be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be derived by a single S production, but given the length, that's unlikely.\n\nAnother approach is to map the tokens in the string to possible derivations.\n\nLet me try to map the tokens step by step.\n\nFirst token is t48. As per above, in NT96 \u2192 't48' followed by 'something', and NT98 \u2192 't48' followed by 'something else'.\n\nBut S is split into NT99 and NT58, so the production is S \u2192 NT99 NT58.\n\nSo, perhaps NT99 produces a sequence that starts with t48...?

{"custom_id":"request-916","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the provided grammar to understand the production rules. There are several productions, each splitting into two parts on the right side. I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals directly, like S and NT54 producing 't93', 't31', etc. These are the terminal symbols, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols: t48, t33, t86, etc., and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation produces just a single terminal symbol at a time, unless it's part of a larger chain. Wait, no\u2014that's not exactly right. In CNF, each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, each step can at most produce two non-terminals, but since we're starting with S, which likely produces two non-terminals, the derivation would grow the string by one symbol at a time each step.\n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Each production can produce two symbols, but to get a string of symbols, you need to expand non-terminals step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. But in the string provided, all elements are terminals already, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived by expanding S step by step using the given rules.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards. Start from the given string and see if it can be split into pairs that match the production rules. Because in a CNF grammar, the string can only be formed by a series of productions where each symbol is either a terminal or the left-hand side of a production. But since all symbols are terminals, each must result from a production of a non-terminal that directly produces a terminal.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not necessarily correct. The string is formed by terminals, but some non-terminals can produce multiple symbols. Hmm, maybe I should construct a parse tree. Let me try that.\n\nThe string has 37 symbols. Since the grammar is binary (each production splits into two), the parse tree should have a structure that doubles the nodes each time. But for a linear string, the parse tree must be a straight line, i.e., a chain.\n\nLet me see: The starting symbol S produces NT7 and NT23. So the root would be S \u2192 NT7 NT23. Each of these non-terminals would produce others, and so on.\n\nI'll write down the string: t48 t33 t86 t68 t96 t87 t41 t48 t35 t66 t33 t10 t13 t33 t10 t36 t68 t96 t86 t68 t96 t99 t13 t51 t90 t41 t85 t13 t86 t41 t41 t57 t57 t37 t13 t57 t17 t87 t41 t93 t25 t71 t96 t62 t48 t35 t85 t57.\n\nWait, the user input seems long, but perhaps I can find a pattern or see if the symbols can be grouped into pairs that match the production rules. Alternatively, I can try to see if the entire string can be derived from S.\n\nAnother approach is to notice that each production in CNF either ends in a terminal or two non-terminals. So the string must be a sequence of terminals derived by expanding non-terminals. Therefore, starting from S, the first step is to split into two parts, each of which must produce a substring that eventually leads to the first terminal and then the second, and so on.\n\nBut I think the most efficient way is to look for the entire string as a leftmost derivation. However, with 37 symbols, it's a bit tedious. Alternatively, I can consider that since the grammar is in CNF, the minimal number of symbols in the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of splits. But 37 isn't a power of two, so that's a red flag. Wait, no\u2014CNF allows for any length as long as it's possible through the productions. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production splits into two symbols, but these can be non-terminals or terminals. So the string can be of any length as long as it follows that structure. But in reality, in a context-free grammar, the maximum possible length after k derivations is 2^k. So starting with S, after 1 step, you have two symbols. After 2 steps, four symbols, etc. So for a string of length 37, which is not a power of two, that would be impossible because each step doubles the number of symbols. Wait, but the user's string is being generated by a series of steps, not that each step doubles the count. Wait, each production can produce two symbols, so the number of symbols after each step can increase, but not necessarily be exactly doubling or any particular rule. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to find if the sequence can be derived starting from S.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t48. Let's check which non-terminals produce t48. Looking through the rules:\n\nI see NT48 \u2192 t96, and NT48 \u2192 t86. Also, NT46 \u2192 t37, NT48 \u2192 t96, and other rules that end in t's. Wait, in the given grammar, are there any rules that produce t48? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\nNT48: There are two rules:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t96\n- NT48 \u2192 t86\n\nSo NT48 can produce t96 or t86. But in the string, the first symbol is t48. Wait, that's a problem. Because in the grammar provided, is there any rule that produces t48 as a terminal?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t48. All the other rules either produce t57, t40, t31, etc., but not t48. So if the first symbol in the string is t48, but no NT in the grammar can produce t48, then it's impossible for the string to be generated.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Did I miss any rule? Let me go through the list again:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, every production either splits into two non-terminals or ends with a single terminal.\n\nIn the given rules:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 t48 ? No, wait, looking back:\n\nNT48 appears as:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t96\n\nNT48 \u2192 t86\n\nSo no, no NT48 \u2192 t48 exists. Therefore, the first symbol t48 cannot be produced by any NT in the grammar. Thus, the entire string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but that seems too quick. Maybe I misread the rules. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT37: I don't see any rules ending with t37 except NT46 \u2192 t37.\n\nWait, but where is t48? Let me check each rule.\n\nScanning through all the rules:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t96\n- NT48 \u2192 t86\n- NT46 \u2192 t37\n- NT37 doesn't produce anything\n- NT50 \u2192 NT59, etc.\n- NT57 produced by several rules, like S and others, but not NT57 \u2192 t48.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t48. So, the grammar as given cannot produce a string starting with t48 because no rule exists for NT48 producing t48. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I overlooked some rule or made a mistake. Let me quickly scan the rules again.\n\nWait, the first part of the given grammar for NT57 includes S \u2192 NT57 t57. Is that correct? Or is the way the rules are written different. Let me parse that again.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS -> NT7 NT23\n\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nOther rules... Then looking at NT57:\n\nI don't see any NT57 productions. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, near the end:\n\nYes, I see NT1 \u2192 t57 and others, but no NT57.\n\nSo, NT57 is used in S's production as S \u2192 NT57 NT59, but NT57 doesn't produce t48.\n\nTherefore, the very first symbol t48 in the string cannot be produced by any NT in the grammar, so the entire string cannot be generated. Thus, 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar seems to follow this structure, as most rules are two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has two productions: S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. So S starts by expanding into two non-terminals. The string starts with `t48 t51 t99...`, so the first step is to see which production could generate these.\n\nI'll consider NT7 and NT23 from the S->NT7 NT23 rule. NT7 has production -> t48, so that's straightforward. NT23 can go to t62 or other non-terminals. Looking at the NT23 production, it can be NT40 NT53 or t66 or other options. Wait, in the initial S->NT7 NT23, after expanding NT7 to t48, the next part is NT23. Let's see the production for NT23:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT23 actually has two options: NT40 NT53 and t66. But I need to check if NT23 can lead to t51, which is in the string after t48.\n\nWait, t51 is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, NT66 -> t51. So perhaps there's a path where another non-terminal leads to t51.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me list the string as a list of tokens for easier handling:\n\nt48, t51, t99, t71, t41, t13, t68, t96, t10, t13, t33, t99, t13, t33, t96, t36, t96, t41, t85, t17, t23, t35, t86, t68, t96, t85, t41, t48, t35, t66, t66, t96, t41, t13, t68, t96, t84, t19, t57, t48, t17, t13, t86, t48, t35, t85, t13, t37.\n\nLet me try to break this down into the possible expansions. Starting with S.\n\nS can expand to NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's take S -> NT7 NT23. NT7 -> t48, so the first token is t48.\n\nNow, NT23 can expand as t66 or NT52? Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the given rules, NT23 is present. Let me check. Wait, the grammar is:\n\nNT23 -> NT40 NT53 | t66. Yes, so NT23 can either produce t66 or NT40 NT53. Since the next token after t48 is t51, we need to see how to get t51. So perhaps NT23 is using another production.\n\nWait, but t51 is a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see NT66 -> t51. So perhaps the path goes through another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a production where a non-terminal expands to t51 via another non-terminal. Let me look again.\n\nLooking for a way to get t51, perhaps through NT66 -> t51. So the previous production would be something that leads to NT66.\n\nLet me think about the current state. After S -> NT7 NT23, we have NT7 -> t48, so the string starts with t48. Then, we need to get t51. So perhaps the NT23 expansion leads to NT40 and then NT40 leads to something else.\n\nWait, NT40 -> t71, which is in the string next. Let's see: after t48 comes t51, t99... Wait, no, the next token after t48 is t51, then t99, which is different. Hmm, maybe this path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the other production of S: S -> NT97 NT54. NT97 -> t31, but the second token in the string is t51, so that doesn't fit. Wait, no, S's first expansion is NT97. If NT97 -> t31, which would match the string's second token as t51, so that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing NT97's production. Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking back, the rules have:\n\nNT97 -> 't31'\n\nYes, so NT97 expands to t31. But the second token is t51, which is not t31. So S->NT97 would produce t31 as the first token, but our string starts with t48. So perhaps S->NT7 NT23 is the correct first expansion.\n\nSo now the string is: t48 (NT7) followed by NT23. NT23 can expand to t66 or to NT40 NT53. Let's consider t66. If NT23 -> t66, then after t48 comes t66, but the next token is t51, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, NT23 -> NT40 NT53. Let's see what NT40 can do.\n\nNT40->t71, and in the string after t48 comes t51, t99... So t71 is not t51. Maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of multiple steps. Let's try to look for possible substructures in the given string that match the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t48, then t51, t99, t71, t41, etc. Let's see if these can be part of some derivation.\n\nLooking at t48, which is generated by NT7.\n\nThen t51: looking for a way to get t51 after that. So perhaps after NT7, which is t48, NT23 needs to generate t51, but NT23's options are t66 or NT40 NT53.\n\nHmm, that might not directly give t51. Maybe I'm missing a production where t51 is generated through another path. Let me check if any non-terminals directly produce t51. It seems that NT66 is the one, as NT66->t51.\n\nSo maybe the path goes through NT66. So perhaps after t48, we have NT23 -> NT66, which leads to t51.\n\nLooking back, NT23's rules are NT40 NT53 or t66. So if NT23 is NT66, then the next token would be t51. So does NT23 have a production to NT66? Wait, no. The grammar says NT23 has NT40 NT53 or t66. So to get NT66 from NT23, NT23 must be expanded into NT66 somehow.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.\n\nEach non-terminal can expand into other non-terminals or terminals. So for NT23, its possible expansions are:\n\n- t66\n\n- NT40 NT53\n\nSo to get a t66, we would have NT23 -> t66. To get NT66, that would require that NT66 is derived from NT23, but NT23's rules don't include NT66. Wait, perhaps that's a misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar rules, NT66 is produced by NT23? Wait, no. Looking at the rules, for example, ND84 -> t4, t84, but I'm looking for NT66.

Let me list each non-terminal and their productions:\n\nS:\n- S \u2192 NT7 | NT93\n\nNT7:\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 | ... Wait, looking back, in the original rules, NT7 is on the right-hand side of some productions, but does NT7 itself have any productions? Scanning through, I don't see NT7 -> anything. So NT7 is a terminal. Similarly, NT93, NT99, etc., but many of them may have no further productions except terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify which non-terminals have productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, every non-terminal on the left has productions on the right that are either terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo for example:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 | NT93\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 | ...? No, in the given rules, NT7 only appears on the right side. So NT7 is a terminal. Checking each rule where NT7 appears, it's always on the RHS, meaning no production for NT7 itself. So all non-terminals in the RHS are either terminals or other non-terminals with defined productions.\n\nNow, I'll parse the string step by step, looking for possible paths.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt48 t51 t90 t41 t66 t68 t96 t57 t32 t48 t71 t36 t62 t48 t71 t66 t68 t96 t96 t68 t96 t87 t13 t25 t32 t57 t57 t35 t96 t13 t96 t41 t85 t71 t4 t71 t96 t51 t90 t41 t13 t62 t41 t41 t48 t71 t13 t86 t57\n\nFirst, note that each token is a single terminal. Since all RHS in the grammar are single symbols (either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals), the entire string is a sequence of terminals. The parsing must derive the string by expanding non-terminals into terminals, step by step.\n\nLet's attempt to parse the string in reverse, starting from the last part, but it's often easier left to right. Let me try to find a plausible leftmost derivation path.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can be NT7 or NT93, each leading to a single terminal. So the string starts with t48, t51, etc. So S must expand to NT7 or NT93, but since the string starts with t48, let's see if it can be part of either.\n\nWait, the first token is t48, which is the RHS of several non-terminals:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT7: no, because NT7 is just a terminal, but t48 is linked to other non-terminals. Let's find which rules have t48 on the right.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT99 and NT53. Then NT99 is linked to NT66 and NT16, which can expand further. But another rule: NT48 \u2192 t96, so NT48 produces t96. Wait, but in reverse. Alternatively, let's see where t48 is generated.\n\nWait, looking at rules, I think the right-hand sides for NT56 are t99 and t53, which are terminals. Wait, no, NT56 \u2192 NT99 and NT53, which in another rule are NT53 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-932","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it makes parsing a bit easier. But I'm not an expert on all the rules, so I'll need to break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it consists of a set of production rules. The start symbol is S, and it's broken down into combinations of non-terminals and terminals. My string starts with 't48 t68 t96 ...' and has 40 tokens in total. I need to see if I can match each token step by step according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me write down the start symbol S and the string to parse. S can produce two main branches: S -> NT7 NT23 or S -> NT97 NT54. Each of these leads to different combinations of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't48'. I remember that some non-terminals expand to 't...'. For example, NT56 -> t56 if I recall correctly, because in the rules, I see NT56 -> 't10'? Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me check: in the grammar, NT56 -> 't10'\u2014yes, that's right. So 't48' would come from NT59? Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT56 -> t10, but that's for NT56, not NT55 or others. Hmm, maybe I should map which NTs produce which terminals. Let me go through the rules:\n\nNT56 -> 't10'\u2014so when the non-terminal NT56 is expanded, it becomes 't10'. Similarly, NT23 can produce 't62' from the rule NT23 -> 't62'. Other NTs produce various t's.\n\nWait, so in the string, the first token is 't48'. I don't see any direct production that results in 't48'. Hmm, that's a red flag. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at all the rules, for NT96 -> 't48', yes, in the rule NT96 -> 't48'. So that means NT96 expands to 't48'. Similarly, other NTs produce other ts.\n\nSo for the string, the first token is 't48', which would have to come from either NT96 or maybe another NT that doesn't appear in the first level but deeper.\n\nWait, maybe the first token comes from a deeper expansion. But let me see. The string starts with 't48', so I need to find a way for a non-terminal to produce 't48'. Checking all the rules, the only time 't48' appears is in NT96 -> 't48' and in the rule for NT23 -> 't62' for example. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT96 -> 't48 NT23'\n\nIs that correct? Wait, no, let me look again. The rules include:\n\n- NT96 -> 't48 NT23'\u2014no, wait, no, actually, looking through the list, I don't see that. Wait, actually, in the list:\n\nNT96 -> 't48' is not a rule; looking through, I only see NT96 -> NT48 NT23. So that's a production for NT96. Oh wait, no. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n- NT28 -> 't66'\n- NT40 -> 't17'\n- NT84 -> 't4'\n- NT84 -> 't84'\n- NT56 -> 't10'\n- Others like NT96 -> 't48' is not a rule; instead, NT96 is a non-terminal that produces NT48 NT23. So no, 't48' only appears as a terminal in productions where NTs produce them.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Let me check again. Looking at the rules:\n\nI see NT84 -> 't57' and NT84 -> 't84'. Other NTs have terminals like t31, t32, etc. Specifically, looking at NT96, the rule is NT96 -> 't48 NT23', which is a production that gives 't48' followed by NT23.\n\nAh, so NT96 is a production that starts with 't48' and then continues with NT23. So in the string, the first token is 't48', which could be the start of NT96's production. So the string starts with 't48', followed by another term, then 't96', and so on.\n\nWait, but NT96's rule is NT96 -> 't48 NT23'. So when we expand NT96, it's 't48' followed by the expansion of NT23. So the first token 't48' would be the first symbol, followed by the expansion of NT23.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 can be expanded in two ways: either 't62' (from NT23 -> 't62') or further through other productions.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me check the rule: NT23 can be in several ways: \n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't62' (directly)\n- NT23 is also the left-hand side of the production NT84 -> NT86 NT25: no, wait, that's not.\n\nWait, let me find NT23's productions.\n\nLooking through all the NT23 rules:\n\n- NT23 -> 't62' (is that a production? Yes, at the bottom of the list: NT23 -> 't62')\n\nSo yes, NT23 can directly produce 't62' or if it's used as a left-hand side, then in other rules like S -> NT97 NT54 and NT54 is another rule. Wait, no, looking through the list, I don't see NT23 being the left-hand side elsewhere except in the initial productions.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, the start symbols are S -> NT7 NT23 and S -> NT97 NT54. So NT23 and NT54 are part of the start productions.\n\nSo NT23's first production is NT23 -> 't62' on the bottom. So that's a terminal production. Then, there's another rule where NT23 is used as a left-hand side: NT23 -> NT45 NT53. Hmm, that seems correct because earlier, I saw in the rules that NT23 -> NT45 NT53.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me scan through the grammar to find NT23's rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT23 -> 't62' (terminal)\n- NT23 -> NT45 NT53 (non-terminal production)\n\nHmm, so NT23 can either produce 't62' or be expanded further into NT45 NT53. So in our case, the string after 't48' is 't68'. Let me recall the rule: NT96 -> 't48' followed by NT23, which would be 't48' 't62' or something else.\n\nWait, our string is:\n\nt48 t68 t96 t86 t36 t96 t41 t13 t68 t96 t96 t86 t96 t41 t41 t57 t48 t71 t85 t96 t41 t93 t25 t71 t96 t62 t48 t35 t36 t86 t48 t35 t13 t68 t96 t57 t32 t48 t35 t66 t68 t96 t10 t85 t13 t48 t17 t66 t86\n\nSo after t48, it's t68. So if t48 comes from NT96, then the next part is the expansion of NT23.\n\nNow, the production for NT96 is 't48' followed by NT23. So if the next token is 't68', then expanding NT23 should yield t68 as its first token. But NT23 can produce 't62' or NT45 NT53. So 't68' as the next token would require that NT23's production starts with a 't...'\n\nWait, so looking at NT23, the only terminal production is 't62', so how does the string get 't68'? That's a problem because 't68' isn't a terminal for NT23; it must come from a higher-level non-terminal.\n\nWait a minute, this suggests that there's a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-956","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on my CFGs, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky normal form is. If I remember correctly, it's a form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because all the rules look like they have two non-terminals on the left or a terminal.\n\nNow, the grammar provided starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and other similar rules. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of t's and numbers, like `t48 t33 t84 ...` and so on. I think the approach here is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar, starting from S.\n\nI guess a systematic way to do this is to use a parsing algorithm like the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent approach might also work. Alternatively, I could try to build the parse tree step by step. Let's try a top-down approach.\n\nThe string starts with `t48`. Let me look at the grammar's rules to see where 't48' appears. Scanning through, I notice `NT28 -> t36`, but that doesn't help. Wait, I see `NT50 -> t85`, but not 't48'. Wait, there's `NT28 -> t36` and another rule `NT28 -> t66`. Hmm. Alternatively, I see `NT84 -> t4`, and `NT84 -> t84` but that's not 't48'. Wait, `NT56 -> t99`, that's not it. Let me search again.\n\nWait, the `NT50` rule has some t's. Wait, looking at the list: `NT50 -> 't85'`, no 't48'. Wait, there's `NT46 -> 't13'`, `NT46 -> 't37'`. Hmm, not helpful. Wait, looking back, maybe I missed a rule. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I see `NT7 -> 't48'`, okay, that's one for t48. So S \u2192 NT7 NT23, which starts with NT7 and NT23. So if the first token in the string is 't48', then perhaps we can parse this as NT7 producing 't48'. So the first part of the string should consume 't48', and then the remaining string must be generated by NT23.\n\nSo the remaining string after 't48' is `t33 t84 t71 t86 t68 t96 t86 t51 t99 t35 t41 t36 t51 t90 t41 t36 t62 t96 t41 t41 t48 t71 t85 t48 t71 t66 t33 t96 t68 t96 t85 t71 t57 t19 t25 t71 t96 t86 t41 t57 t48 t35 t36 t13 t96 t41 t85 t57 t57`.\n\nNow, NT23's production. Looking at the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT53 and NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50. Let me see which of these could produce the next part.\n\nWait, the remaining string starts with 't33'. Let me see if 't33' can be produced by either NT7's rules or NT13's rules. Looking at the grammar, NT7's rule is `NT7 -> 't48'`, which I've already used. So perhaps NT13's rules. Wait, no, NT7 can't produce t33. But maybe in the higher levels.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Since NT23 can be broken down into two parts, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT53. So if that's the case, then after 't48', the next part would be NT7 and NT53. But the first token is 't33', which isn't produced by NT7 anymore because that's fixed as 't48'. So that path can't be taken.\n\nSecond possibility: NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50. So after 't48', we have NT13 and NT50. Let's see what each produces.\n\nFor NT13: `NT13 -> 't33'`. Perfect, that matches the first token in the remaining string. So the 't33' comes from NT13. Now, that splits into NT13 and NT50.\n\nSo now, the string becomes `t84 t71 t86 t68 t96 t86 t51 t99 t35 t41 t36 t51 t90 t41 t36 t62 t96 t41 t41 t48 t71 t85 t48 t71 t66 t33 t96 t68 t96 t85 t71 t57 t19 t25 t71 t96 t86 t41 t57 t48 t35 t36 t13 t96 t41 t85 t57 t57`.\n\nNow, after 't33' from NT13, the next part is NT50 producing the next token. Let's look at NT50's productions: `NT50 -> 't85'` and possibly others? Wait, I think NT50 also has `NT50 -> NT57 NT46`, but I need to check.\n\nWait, from the given rules, let me see: `NT50 -> 't85'` and also `NT50 -> NT57 NT46`. Okay, so there are two options.\n\nLooking at the current token after 't33' is 't84'. Hmm, so 't84' would have to come from the next rule. Let me see where 't84' is produced. Scanning the rules, I see `NT84 -> t4` and `NT84 -> t84`. Hmm, maybe from a non-terminal that can produce that.\n\nLet me check the rules for NT94 and others. Wait, maybe looking for 't84' as a production of some non-terminal: `NT23 -> 't86'`? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps NT84 can produce 't84'.\n\nWait, yes, `NT84 -> 't84'` is a production. So if that's the case, perhaps the next part after NT13 is NT50 producing 't84'. But wait, after NT13 and NT50, the next token after 't33' is 't84'. So perhaps NT50 is producing 't84' via its rule.\n\nLooking back, NT50 can produce 't85' and also NT57 NT46. So how can it produce 't84'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. NT50 can produce 't85' but not 't84' directly. So perhaps 't84' comes from NT84, but I'm not sure how that links here. Maybe I need to consider how NT50 is a non-terminal that can expand into other non-terminals, which then expand into the actual tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, starting from S.\n\nLet me try again. The string is `t48 t33 t84 t71 t86 t68 t96 t86 t51 t99 t35 t41 t36 t51 t90 t41 t36 t62 t96 t41 t41 t48 t71 t85 t48 t71 t66 t33 t96 t68 t96 t85 t71 t57 t19 t25 t71 t96 t86 t41 t57 t48 t35 t36 t13 t96 t41 t85 t57 t57`.\n\nI need to parse this as a series of non-terminals expanding into tokens.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT7 NT23. The first token is 't48', which is 'NT7' producing 't48', so that's correct. Now, the remaining string starts with 't33 t84...'\n\nSo the next part is NT23, which can be split into NT13 and NT50. The first token here is 't33', which is 'NT13'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-949","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two symbols on the right, or a terminal. The string to check is quite long, so I'll need to think about how to approach this efficiently.\n\nFirst, I should remind myself what CNF entails. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string must be derived from S through a series of these productions.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the productions are:\nS \u2192 NT7 NT23\nS \u2192 NT93 (Wait, no, looking again, the grammar isn't all on one line. Let me check again. Oh no, the grammar as presented starts with S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and then S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Wait, that's inconsistent. So the second production for S is S \u2192 NT97 NT54. That must be a typo or formatting issue. So the grammar as given has two alternative productions for S: S \u2192 NT77 NT23 (if I combine the two, but looking again, perhaps it's S \u2192 NT7 NT23 and S \u2192 NT97 NT54. I think the user intended S to have two different right-hand sides, each with two non-terminals. So S can produce either NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nBut wait, the actual grammar in the problem seems to have two S productions. Let me double-check:\n\nThe user wrote:\nGrammar:\nS -> NT7 NT23\nS -> NT97 NT54\n\nYes, so S has two productions. That's correct. So S can go to NT7 NT23 or NT97 NT54.\n\nNow, the string to check is: t48 t51 t23 t41 t66 t68 t96 t96 t51 t90 t41 t36 t51 t10 t17 t41 t66 t33 t99 t66 t33 t87 t41 t48 t71 t13 t33 t85 t48 t35 t85 t13 t96 t41 t41 t48 t17 t85 t48 t17 t13 t51 t23 t41 t36 t51 t23 t41 t36 t86.\n\nThis is a sequence of tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree must be a binary tree where each internal node has two children. The string's length is 44 tokens, so the derivation would have a tree depth of log2(44) \u2248 6 levels, since each step doubles the number of symbols.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, it's better to think in terms of parsing the string by looking for the possible starting points and seeing if it can be broken down into the allowed non-terminals.\n\nGiven that S can produce two options, each starting with a non-terminal (NT7 or NT97), I'll need to see if the string can be derived from either.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with t48. So I need to check if the first two symbols can be produced by the S's first production, which is NT7 NT23.\n\nLet's look at the productions for NT7:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7 \u2192 t48. Yes, NT7 is a terminal, so it directly produces t48.\n\nSo, the first two symbols t48 must come from NT7 and NT23. So, the first part of the string is t48 then the next symbol must be t23. Wait, because S \u2192 NT7 NT23, so the first symbol is t48 (from NT7), and then the next symbol should come from NT23.\n\nLooking at the string: t48 t51 t23... Wait, so the second symbol is t51, but according to S \u2192 NT7 NT23, after t48, the next should be whatever NT23 produces. So I need to see if NT23 can produce t51. Looking at the grammar for NT23:\n\nFrom NT23 -> ... looking through the productions, I see in the user's grammar:\n\nNT23 \u2192 t66 is one of the productions? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, under NT23:\n\n- NT23 -> t36\n- NT23 -> t41\n- NT23 -> t23\nWait, no. Let me find NT23 in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the user's grammar:\n\nNT23 \u2192 t66\nNT23 \u2192 t36 (Wait, no, let me check again. The user wrote:\n\n\"NT23 -> NT41 NT53\nNT23 -> NT13 NT50\"\n\nSo NT23 can produce NT41 NT53 or NT13 NT50. Neither of these produce a terminal directly; they are non-terminals. Then, I need to see what these non-terminals produce.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT7 NT23, the first token is t48. The next token, t51, must come from NT23's production. But NT23's productions don't include a terminal; only non-terminals. So this suggests that the first approach of S \u2192 NT7 NT23 doesn't match the string, because after t48, we have t51, which isn't a terminal.\n\nHmm, maybe I should have considered the other production S \u2192 NT97 NT54. Let's check that.\n\nThe string starts with t48. So for S \u2192 NT97 NT54, the first symbol should be from NT97. Looking at the grammar, NT97 \u2192 t31.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT97 NT54, the first token is t31, but the string starts with t48. Therefore, this production can't be the starting point. So, this implies that S \u2192 NT7 NT23 is the correct production to use, but then the problem arises because the next token after t48 is t51, which doesn't match NT23's terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding NT23's productions. Let's look again:\n\nThe user wrote under NT23:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT41 NT53\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50\n\nSo these are the two options. Neither produce terminals, so NT23 must produce a pair of non-terminals. But in the string, after t48, the next token is t51, which suggests that NT23 must produce something that leads to t51. But in this case, NT23 can't produce any terminals directly. Therefore, perhaps the S production S \u2192 NT97 NT54 is not matching the string, but S \u2192 NT7 NT23 leads to t48 followed by something that needs to produce t51, but NT23 can't reach t51. So maybe the string is not possible.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing some productions. Let me see if any NT23 production eventually leads to t51.\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT23's descendants:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT41 NT53 (1)\nNT41 \u2192 t68 (from NT41 \u2192 t68)\nNT53 \u2192 t85 (from NT53 \u2192 t85)\nSo from (1) NT23 \u2192 NT41 NT53, then NT41 \u2192 t68, NT53 \u2192 t85, so NT23 can produce in this path t68 t85.\n\nBut the next token after t48 is t51, which is not t68 or t85. Alternatively, if NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50 (2), then NT13 \u2192 t33? Let me check:\n\nNT13 \u2192 t33 (from NT13 \u2192 t33)\nNT50 \u2192 t5\u2192?\n\nWait, NT50's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT50 \u2192 NT59 NT46 or NT50 \u2192 t85.\n\nSo, from (2) NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT50, then NT13 \u2192 t33 and NT50 can be either NT59 NT46 or t85.\n\nIf NT50 is t85, then this path becomes NT23 \u2192 t33 t85.\n\nBut again, the string starts with t48, so after t48, the next token is t51, which wouldn't come from t33 or t85.\n\nSo, perhaps the only way to get t51 is through another path.
