{"custom_id":"request-6","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t69\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol possibly having just a terminal. Wait, actually, looking closer, all the production rules in the grammar seem to start with a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right, except some have terminals. \n\nHmm, but Chomsky normal form usually allows the start symbol to have a single terminal, but that's typically when expanded. Here, I see some rules where terminals like 't8', 't93', etc., appear as the right-hand side of productions. That's a bit confusing because I thought in CNF each production should only have non-terminals. Maybe I misinterpreted something or perhaps these are errors. Well, I'll have to proceed with what I have.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t69\". I think I need to see if \"t69\" can be derived from the start symbol 'S' through a series of productions. \n\nLooking at the grammar, there are a couple of rules that directly lead to \"t\" followed by a number. For example, NT1 -> NT25 NT17, but that's a non-terminal, so I need to find the terminal paths. Wait, also, I notice some rules like NT35 -> 't105', NT46 -> 't8', etc. So these terminals are at the base of some production rules.\n\nI need to find a path from S down to \"t69\". Let me start by looking at the start symbol S. The production rules for S are:\n\nS -> NT1 NT28\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nSo S expands into two non-terminals. Let's take S as NT1 NT28 and see where that leads. But wait, I might need to consider both possibilities or maybe it's easier to work backwards from the string \"t69\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the rule that directly produces \"t69\". Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT17 -> 't94'\nNT7 -> 't97'\nNT46 -> 't8'\nNT47 -> 't3'\nAnd so on. But none of these directly produce \"t69\". So perhaps I need to see if \"t69\" can be built through a sequence of productions.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. I see that NT1 -> 't84', but not \"t69\". Looking deeper, perhaps the string \"t69\" is part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that one of the rules is NT46 -> 't8', NT47 -> 't3', etc. But not \"t69\". Alternatively, maybe \"t69\" is a combination of terminal steps from nested productions.\n\nWait, let me think: to get \"t69\", perhaps there's a production that leads to 't' followed by a number derived from a sequence of non-terminals. But I'm not seeing any rule that directly gives \"t69\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"t69\" is produced through a chain. Let me try to figure out how to reach \"t69\" from the start symbol.\n\nS can produce NT1 NT28. Let's pick S -> NT1 NT28.\n\nNow, I need to see what NT1 and NT28 can produce. \n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 -> 't84'\n\nWait, so NT1 can produce 't84'. Then, the string would be \"t84\" when NT1 is used. But we need \"t69\". So maybe NT28 can be used to produce something that combines with \"t84\" or vice versa?\n\nWait, no. The string is \"t69\", so perhaps NT28 can produce some kind of non-terminal that can further expand into \"t69\".\n\nLooking at NT28: NT28 -> NT4 NT6\n\nSo NT28 can produce NT4 NT6. Let's see what each can do.\n\nNT4: NT4 -> NT21 NT15\n\nNT21: NT21 -> NT37 NT20\n\nNT37: NT37 -> NT7 NT33\n\nNT7: NT7 -> NT24 NT6\n\nNT24: NT24 -> NT11 NT6\n\nWait, NT24 has a rule NT24 -> 't11' and 't6'. Oh wait, looking back, I don't see NT24's production here. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT24 -> 't11', yes:\n\nLooking through the rules, the relevant ones are:\n\nNT9 -> 't19'\nNT46 -> 't24'\nNT22 -> 't58'\nNT24 -> 't11'\n\nSo NT24 -> 't11' and I don't see other rules for NT24. So NT24 can be 't11' or wait, actually, looking again, it's only one rule for NT24, which is -> 't11'.\n\nSo, NT24's production is 't11'. Okay.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 -> 't24' and NT6 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me trace this chain:\n\nS -> NT1 NT28\n\nNT1 -> 't84'\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT6\n\nNT4 -> NT21 NT15\n\nNT21 -> NT37 NT20\n\nNT37 -> NT7 NT33\n\nNT7 -> NT24 NT6\n\nWait, so starting from S, NT28 goes to NT4 and NT6. Then NT4 is NT21 and NT15, and so on.\n\nIt's getting complicated. Maybe this is not the right path. Maybe I should explore the other production of S: S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nSo let's see what NT50 and NT27 can produce.\n\nNT50: Looking through the rules, I don't see NT50 directly. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT50 -> 't4' and NT15?\n\nWait, looking for NT50's production, I find:\n\nNT27 -> 't50'\n\nWait, but wait, no. Let me check each production.\n\nLooking for NT50: from the rules, I see:\n\nNT50 -> 't4'\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking again, I think I might have misread. Let me go through each rule again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT50 -> 't17' (maybe, or is it NT27?)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look carefully:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT27 -> 't124'\n\nWait, but that's NT27, not NT50.\n\nWait, the rules start with S, then NT1, NT2, etc.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I can't find NT50 being a non-terminal with a terminal production. Wait, maybe it's a typo and it should be another non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by assuming that NT50 has a production that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nBut without more information, this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to see if \"t69\" can be produced, perhaps using a different method, like looking for \"t69\" in the right-hand side of any production rules, which I can see:\n\nLooking again through the rules, I don't see any production where the right-hand side is just 't69'. All terminals have specific numbers, like 't8', 't93', etc. So perhaps \"t69\" is not present in the grammar at all, which would mean the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe some production rules, when combined, can lead to \"t69\". Let me consider if any combination can create it. But given that I don't see any production that leads directly to \"t69\", and all terminal strings seem to have unique, fixed t-number strings, perhaps \"t69\" isn't in the language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"t69\" is part of a chain, but without a production rule for that, it's hard to see. For example, suppose I have a production that leads to 't6' followed by 't9' to make \"t69\", but I don't see such a rule.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again for 't's:\n\n- NT7 -> 't24' and NT6 -> 't58' (I think, looking at the rules, yes, NT6 appears in:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't58'\n\nYes, so NT6 can become 't58'. Hmm.\n\nAlso, other rules produce 't's like:\n\nNT3 -> 't69'! Oh wait, that's in the rules. Wait, let me find it.\n\nLooking through the rules under NT3:\n\nNT3 -> 't69'\n\nYes, so I did miss that earlier.

Let me start by looking at the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. From the grammar, I see that the initial productions are S -> NT1 NT1 or other combinations of NTs leading to terminals.\n\nThe string to check is `t70`. Looking at the NT productions, I need to see which rules could produce something ending with `t70`.\n\nLooking through the NTs, I see that NT20 -> NT43 NT50. Wait, but in the detailed rules, NT20 has two productions: NT43 NT50 and another which isn't shown here. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT20 is defined as NT43 NT50. So that's one way. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I see NT20 -> NT43 NT50 and NT20 -> NT38 NT33 as well. Wait, looking back, I see in the grammar, NT20 has multiple productions, including NT20 -> NT43 NT50 and NT20 -> NT38 NT33.\n\nHmm, but looking at the NT20 definition, I think I need to check all the rules that NT20 can go to.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT20 is defined as:\n\nNT20 -> NT43 NT50\nNT20 -> NT38 NT33\nNT43 -> NT8 NT3\nNT38 -> NT102\nNT33 -> NT28 NT15\nAnd, importantly, NT102 and NT28 have further productions. Wait, actually, looking back, NT38 is NT102, and NT33 is NT28 and NT15. But NT102 is defined as NT8 NT8, and NT28 is a separate NT28.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, looking at NT10: NT10 -> NT43 NT15. Also, NT21 is defined multiple times, but I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on how NT20 can lead to terminal symbols.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT20 can go to NT43 NT50 or NT38 NT33.\n\nNT43 -> NT8 NT3, and NT8 is a terminal. But wait, looking back, NT8 has multiple rules, but I don't see a production where NT8 \u2192 't65'\u2014no, wait, looking at the detailed productions, I see NT8's rules: Wait, no, in the provided grammar, NT8 is not directly in the main NTs, it's in the detailed productions, like NT38 -> 't102' and others. Wait, perhaps I should list all possible ways to get to 't70'.\n\nWait, another approach is to see all possible non-terminals that can derive 't70'. Since 't70' is a terminal, we look for non-terminals that have a production leading to it as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, several non-terminals have rules that produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nFor example, NT56 -> NT20 NT17, and NT56 can produce 't112' among others? Hmm, but maybe I'm getting lost there.\n\nWait, let's start from the beginning. The string is 't70'. Which non-terminal can produce 't70'? I need to find a rule where a non-terminal directly leads to 't70'. But looking at the grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce 't70'? It seems none, except maybe indirectly.\n\nWait, in the detailed productions, for example, NT30 -> NT6 NT48, and then NT6 can go to 't58' via another production, but that's not 't70'. Alternatively, NT48 can go to 't24'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace possible paths from S to 't70'.\n\nS can go to NT1 NT1 (or others). Let's consider the first production: S -> NT1 NT1.\n\nNT1 has several productions. Looking at the grammar, NT1 -> NT25 NT17. So S could expand to NT25 NT17 NT25 NT17.\n\nBut wait, no, in the grammar, S can go to NT1 NT1, which is S -> NT1 NT1.\n\nSo expanding S, each NT1 can go to NT25 NT17. So S becomes NT25 NT17 NT25 NT17.\n\nNow, NT25 can go to NT6 NT31. So each NT25 is NT6 NT31, and NT31 goes to NT117, which is a terminal? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT31 -> 't117' which is a terminal, but I don't see 't70' in there.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm going down a wrong path. Let's see if any of the NTs can derive 't70'.\n\nLooking at the grammar's detailed productions, I see NT17 -> 't24', NT27 -> 't28', NT28 -> 't76', and others. Wait, but I'm looking for 't70'. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to see if any NT directly produces 't70'. But in the given grammar, I don't see any NT directly going to 't70'; the terminals are all for numbers like 2, 7, 4, etc. So I need to find a path where a sequence of non-terminals leads to 't70'.\n\nLooking at the possible NTs that can produce 't70', perhaps via some multiplication. Wait, perhaps looking at the production NT20 -> NT38 NT33.\n\nNT38 -> NT102, and NT102 -> NT8 NT8. So NT38 can go to NT8 (twice). But NT8 in the detailed productions goes to 't102'? No, wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine.\n\nWait, in the detailed grammar, I see:\n\nNT38 -> 't102'\nNT8 -> 't102'\nWait, but that can't be, because NT8 appears in several rules. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, in the detailed grammar, there's a line NT28 -> 't76', and another line NT38 -> 't102'. Similarly, NT33 -> 't120' (wait, NT33 -> NT28 NT15, and NT28 -> 't76', NT15 -> 't93', so that's t76 t93, but wait, I'm getting more confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for how 't70' could be generated by some chain of productions.\n\nWait, maybe NT40 has a production that leads to something else. Wait, in the grammar, NT40 isn't defined as a terminal, it's a non-terminal. Looking through the grammar, NT40 has a production. For example, NT40-> 't28', but that's a terminal, so perhaps that's a way.\n\nWait, looking at the detailed productions, I see NT40 -> 't28'. So if I can get from a non-terminal to NT40, then to 't28'.\n\nBut we need 't70', so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps NT45 can reach 't28', but that's going elsewhere.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for any NT that can produce 't70' through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT9 can go through a chain that gets us to t70.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, NT9 -> NT35 NT46. NT35 has several productions: NT53, NT105, and 't17', 't94', 't24', etc. But none of these seem to lead to 't70'.\n\nWait, let me focus on specific paths.\n\nLooking at NT20 -> NT38 NT33.\n\nFrom NT38: NT38 can go to NT102, which can go to NT8 NT8. But NT102 leads to 't8' or 't102'?\n\nWait, in the detailed productions, NT38 is 't102'. So if NT38 is 't102', then that's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT33 -> NT28 NT15.

{"custom_id":"request-25","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the string `t98 t120` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me recall how to approach this. In Chomsky Normal Form, the leftmost derivation is straightforward. Each step, I replace the leftmost non-terminal with either a terminal or the right-hand side of a production. Since it's CNF, the number of steps in a derivation corresponds to the length of the string, right? And each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the string `t98 t120`, it's a sequence of two terminals. So, for a string of length 2, the number of production steps should be 2. That means I should be able to derive this string from the start symbol S in two steps.\n\nLet me look at the grammar's productions for S. I see two productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo, the first step is choosing either of these. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nCase 1: The first production S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n- So, after step 1, S becomes NT1 NT28.\n- Now, in step 2, each of these non-terminals needs to be replaced. Let's look at NT1 and NT28.\n\nLooking at NT1:\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n\nSo, replacing NT1 gives us NT25 NT17. Then, we have NT28. Let's see what NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6.\n\nSo, in step 2, replacing NT28 gives NT4 NT6.\n\nSo, the entire string after two steps would be NT25 NT17 NT4 NT6.\n\nNow, let's see what NT25, NT17, NT4, and NT6 produce.\n\nLooking up each symbol:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31 (from production NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45? Wait, no, let's check NT25's production. Looking at the grammar, I see NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. So NT25 becomes NT6 NT31.\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT4 NT3 (from production NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6? No, wait, let's check NT17. In the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT94? No, wait, let me recheck: I see NT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing symbols. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT17: I see NT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53 (is that right? Or wait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, our current symbol in NT28 is resolved as NT4 NT6, not directly NT17. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me backtrack.\n\nWait, in the first case, after step 1, it's NT1 NT28. Then step 2: NT1 becomes NT25 NT17, and NT28 becomes NT4 NT6. So, the string after step 2 is NT25 NT17 NT4 NT6. Now, I need to see if these can be terminals or lead to the terminals 't98' and 't120'.\n\nLooking at each non-terminal:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31 (so NT25 becomes NT6 NT31)\n- NT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53 (so NT17 becomes NT44 NT53)\n- NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15 (so NT4 becomes NT21 NT15)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 (from NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6). So NT6 becomes NT54 NT6. Wait, but that might lead to an infinite loop unless these resolve to terminals.\n\nWait, that's an issue. Let me check NT6's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6. Hmm, that's a recursive production, so NT6 can't produce a terminal unless in some step it's resolved via other productions that eventually reach terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm choosing the wrong path. Maybe I should consider the other initial production for S.\n\nCase 2: S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n- After step 1, S becomes NT50 NT27.\n- In step 2, replace NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at NT50: production NT50 \u2192 NT14 NT34.\n\nSo, NT50 becomes NT14 NT34.\n\nLooking at NT27: production NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16.\n\nSo, after step 2, the string is NT14 NT34 NT39 NT16.\n\nNow, let's expand each of these non-terminals.\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT79 NT93 (from NT14 \u2192 NT79 NT93? Wait, let me check: Looking at NT14, the production is probably NT14 \u2192 NT79 NT93.\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT36 NT32 (from NT34 \u2192 NT36 NT32)\n\n- NT39 \u2192 NT48 NT14 (from NT39 \u2192 NT48 NT14)\n\n- NT16 \u2192 NT10 NT34 (from NT16 \u2192 NT10 NT34)\n\nHmm, again, this seems to be getting more non-terminals, which might not lead directly to the required 't98' and 't120' terminals. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the given string `t98 t120` is two terminals, which would correspond to a derivation of two steps from S, with each step handling each terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each terminal corresponds directly to a production. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals have productions that include terminal symbols. For instance, NT6 \u2192 't58', NT7 \u2192 't93', 't79', 't97', 't42', etc. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 't94', NT27 \u2192 't124', etc.\n\nSo, perhaps each terminal in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that directly produces that terminal. Therefore, we can break down the string into its components and see if each can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nThe string is `t98 t120`, which are two terminals. Let's consider each as the result of replacing a non-terminal in two steps.\n\nSince it's two terminals, we need to find a way to get each from the grammar. Let's start by looking at 't98' and 't120'.\n\nLooking for 't98':\n\nIn the grammar, several non-terminals directly produce 't98'. Looking through the entries under NT:\n\nLooking through the '...' lines, I see:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT79 NT93\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT39 \u2192 't131'\n- NT15 \u2192 't48'\n- NT30 \u2192 't111'\n- NT43 \u2192 't69', 't27'\n- NT44 \u2192 't114'\n- NT42 \u2192 't2'\n- NT47 \u2192 't40'\n- NT38 \u2192 't102'\n- NT37 \u2192 't17'\n- NT7 \u2192 't79', 't93', 't97'\n- NT41 \u2192 't52', 't4'\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT1 \u2192 't69'\n- NT41 \u2192 't52', 't4'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n- NT14 \u2192 't79', 't93'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT26 \u2192 't50', etc.\nWait, looking for 't98', I don't see it directly. Wait, let me scan through all the 'a' productions:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see several NT non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't91'\n- NT7 \u2192 't79', 't93', 't97'\n- NT9 \u2192 't19'\n- NT24 \u2192 't17', 't29', 't46', 't62', etc. But 't62' is 't120'.\nWait, no, let's check:\n\nWait, the NT24 production is: NT24 \u2192 't29', 't46', 't62', etc. Wait, one of the entries says NT24 \u2192 't62', so 't62' is 't12"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-23","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string \"t131 t120\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I should probably look at the structure of the grammar and the string to see how they might connect. The string consists of two tokens: \"t131\" and \"t120\". Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, I need to see if these tokens can be formed through the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S. It produces NT1 NT1 and NT50 NT27. So S can go into two possible paths. Let's see if either of these can lead to the string we have.\n\nFrom S, the first path is NT1 and NT28. Wait, no, S is NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So the first option is NT1 NT28, which can't be immediately split since they are two non-terminals, but each of those can further produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have \"t131\" which is a terminal, so that has to come from some production that ends in a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT39 -> 't131' and NT33 -> 't79', among others.\n\nSo to get \"t131\", I need a production of the form NTsomething -> 't131'. Looking at the production rules, I see NT39 -> 't131' and that's the only one for t131. So any path generating \"t131\" must start from NT39.\n\nSimilarly, for \"t120\", I look at the productions and see if any non-terminals produce 't120'. It looks like NT36 -> 't120' and NT48 -> 't120'. So the string has two terminals, each of which must come from a production of the form NTsomething -> 'tX'.\n\nSo the first token is t131 from NT39, and the second is t120 from either NT36 or NT48.\n\nNow, let's see how NT39 can be generated. From the grammar, NT39's productions are: \n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see NT39 being a non-terminal that produces directly to a terminal except in the list above, like NT39 -> 't131', but as a non-terminal, NT39 must be on the left side of some production. Let me check the list:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only t131 is from NT39. So to produce t131, NT39 must be introduced somehow. But in the grammar, I don't see any production where NT39 is derived from other non-terminals. Wait, that can't be right. Perhaps the 't131' is a terminal symbol in the grammar production, not an actual non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So some of the non-terminals directly map to terminals. For example, NT22 -> 't87', 't58', 't48', 't29', 't14', etc. Similarly, some non-terminals produce multiple terminals. For example, NT46 -> NT27 NT28 and can also produce 't8', 't17', etc.\n\nBut in this case, I see that NT39 -> 't131' and also has a production NT39 -> NT30 NT41. So NT39 can derive a string of terminals or a combination of non-terminals leading to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe that's not right. Let me check the given grammar rules again. It looks like the grammar has some rules where non-terminals produce multiple terminals. For example, NT39 appears in two rules:\n\nNT39 -> 't131'\n\nand\n\nNT39 -> NT30 NT41.\n\nWait, the grammar says:\n\nNT9 -> NT35 NT46\n\nBut then NT35 can go to 't102', 't73', etc. So the way to get 't131' is through NT39.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT39 -> 't131' is a production, so that's a terminal. So to produce 't131', the non-terminal NT39 must be used as a production step that directly outputs 't131'. But then, where is NT39 coming from? Because if NT39 is a non-terminal, it can only produce 't131' or other combinations, but if we have to produce 't131', it must be that NT39 is on the left side of a production that outputs 't131'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each non-terminal can have multiple productions. So NT39 can be derived in two ways: either to 't131' directly or through NT30 NT41. So to produce 't131', we can use the production NT39 -> 't131'. But then, how is NT39 derived? Because in the grammar, maybe NT30 and NT41 lead to other terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I think I might be mixing up the rules. Let's parse it step by step.\n\nThe first string token is 't131', which is a terminal. So the left-hand side must be a non-terminal that can produce it. From the production rules, the only way to get 't131' is via NT39 -> 't131'. So to generate 't131', we need a production that introduces NT39. But where does NT39 come from?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT39's productions are: NT39 -> 't131' and NT39 -> NT30 NT41. So NT39 is produced by itself and another production. Wait, that can't be right, unless it's a left-recursive production. Wait, no, the rule is NT39 -> NT30 NT41. So NT39 can be derived from the combination of NT30 and NT41.\n\nBut then, NT30 and NT41 must produce terminals or other non-terminals. Let's check:\n\nLooking at NT30: NT30 -> NT6 NT48.\n\nNT6: NT6 -> 't53', 't58', 't62'... wait, according to the given rules:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT6 has production NT6 -> 't53', and NT6 -> 't58', but also is used in other rules like NT36 -> 't87', NT46 -> 't53', etc.\n\nWait, let me look for NT30's productions. From the given grammar:\n\nNT30 -> NT6 NT48.\n\nWait, no, the given grammar has the rule NT30 -> NT6 NT48? Wait, looking through the list:\n\nThe rules provided include:\n\nNT26 -> NT14 NT45\n\nNT14 -> NT24 NT0\n\nNT22 -> NT49 NT14\n\nNT30 -> NT6 NT48\n\nYes, I see NT30 -> NT6 NT48. So NT30 is produced by NT6 and NT48.\n\nBut NT30's production is NT30 -> NT6 NT48. So to generate 't131', NT39 must be on the left side, and it's derived by NT30 NT41.\n\nSo NT39 -> NT30 NT41.\n\nSo, to have 't131' as a result, we need to have a production that leads to NT39, which then leads to 't131' directly.\n\nWait, but then for 't131', we have to have a path that goes NT39 -> 't131'. So the entire string \"t131 t120\" would require that the start symbol S can somehow derive a string where first is t131 and second is t120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to derive it through the production rules.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe we can see if the string can be split into two parts, each being a terminal that can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSo the string is \"t131 t120\". Let's check if both \"t131\" and \"t120\" can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWe've established that \"t131\" comes from NT39 -> 't131', and \"t120\" comes from NT36 -> 't120' or NT48 -> 't120'.\n\nBut how do these non-terminals NT39 and the respective (NT36 or NT48) get produced from the start symbol?\n\nLooking back at the start symbol S, which can produce NT1 NT28 or NT50"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-43","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the string `t2 t50 t28` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammar has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided seems to follow this structure, with most rules having two non-terminals on the right and some terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT1... seems to fit.\n\nThe string I'm given is `t2 t50 t28`. Each of these is a terminal symbol. So, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the terminals appear in the productions, but they're either single or in certain combinations. Let's check each terminal in the string and see how it can be derived.\n\nStarting with the first part of the string: `t2`. I'll scan through the grammar to see where `t2` appears. Scanning the productions, I see that in the production for NT6: NT6 -> NT54 NT6, which later results in `t58`. Wait, that's not `t2`. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT10 has a production: NT10 \u2192 NT56 NT27, and NT27 has NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4, but that's still not helpful. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Or maybe in another production.\n\nWait, actually, I see that S can produce NT50 NT27, and NT50 is S's second option. So maybe the string can start with `t2` if NT50 \u2192 something that includes `t2`.\n\nWait, let's check the NT50 production. Looking through the grammar, does any rule result in `t2`? Let me go through each non-terminal's productions.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 can become NT54 NT6, and then NT54 can become NT24 NT6 and so on, eventually resulting in `t58`. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, in the grammar's later part, I see NT10 \u2192 't2' according to some production: looking at the grammar, there's NT10 with two productions: one is NT10 \u2192 't2' directly. Wait, yes, looking again: there's a rule `NT10 -> 't2'`. So NT10 can produce `t2`.\n\nSimilarly, for the second part, `t50`: looking for NT rules, I see S has an option S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So if S can produce NT50 followed by something else, perhaps NT50 can produce `t50`. Looking at NT50, let me check the grammar for NT50. The grammar has: NT56 -> 't112', but not NT50. Wait, let me scan the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT50 with a terminal directly. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let's see: the only NT50 is in the start symbol S \u2192 NT50 NT27, but NT50 isn't producing a terminal on its own. So if NT50 needs to produce something that leads to `t50`, it's unclear. Wait, but NT10 can produce `t2`, and S can have NT50, so maybe NT50 is used here.\n\nWait, but if NT50 doesn't produce a terminal, but the string has `t50`, how is that possible? That suggests I might have made a mistake, so let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking again, I see that in the grammar, there's a production `NT10 -> 't2'`. So maybe NT10 can produce `t2`. So if the string starts with `t2`, that would correspond to NT10. But how does the grammar derive `t2`?\n\nWait, in the string `t2 t50 t28`, perhaps the `t2` comes from NT10, and `t50` comes from another non-terminal. But S can generate NT50, so maybe S \u2192 NT50 NT27, and NT27 can produce `t50`. Alternatively, let's see if NT50 can somehow produce `t50`. But from looking through the grammar, it seems that NT50 is not directly producing a terminal, but rather other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production. Or maybe `t50` is part of a longer expansion. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Given the string `t2 t50 t28`, I can think of it as three terminals. So the derivation should have three steps where non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut in the grammar, each production either splits into two non-terminals or produces a terminal. So each application of a production reduces the count of non-terminals by one at most.\n\nWait, but in a tree, each node (non-terminal) can produce two children (non-terminals or terminals). So to generate a string of three terminals, the grammar would have to produce a leftmost derivation where each non-terminal produces either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but let's model the string. The string is `t2 t50 t28`.\n\nAssuming the derivation starts with S, which can split into two non-terminals, say S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nSo, first, S becomes NT50 NT27. Now, each of these non-terminals can either produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at NT50: does it produce `t50`? From the grammar, I don't see NT50 directly produce a terminal. So perhaps NT50 needs to expand into other non-terminals, and eventually, one of them produces `t50`.\n\nSimilarly, NT27: from the grammar, I see S has an option S \u2192 NT27..., but perhaps NT27 can expand into more non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check NT27's productions. Looking: NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16 and NT27 \u2192 NT124 NT50. So, NT27 can split into two non-terminals. But where do `t50` and `t28` come in?\n\nWait, this might not be the right approach. Maybe I should track each terminal in the string and see how they could be generated.\n\nGiven that S can split into NT50 and NT27, let's say the first part is NT50 producing `t50` and NT27 producing `t28`, followed by NT27 producing `t50` and NT27 producing `t28`, but it's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at each terminal in the string and see if the grammar can generate each of them step by step.\n\nFirst, `t2`. As I saw earlier, NT10 \u2192 't2'. So if S can produce NT10, and have `t2` as the first symbol, that's possible.\n\nBut looking at the start symbol S, it can produce NT50 or NT27. Wait, S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So S starts with NT50, then NT27. So the first symbol would come from NT50, and the next from NT27, then another NT27 or NT50, etc., until three terminals are generated.\n\nBut wait, in the string `t2 t50 t28`, the first symbol is `t2`. So this would have to come from either NT50 or NT27. But from the grammar, does NT50 produce `t2`? Looking, no, S \u2192 NT50, but NT50 isn't producing a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps S can produce NT50 and NT27, and then from NT27, further expansion is needed. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S splits into NT16 and NT34, but looking at the first option of S, it's NT50 and NT27. So starting with NT50, which needs to produce `t50`, but in the grammar, NT50 doesn't directly produce `t50`. So perhaps that's not the way.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built through other productions. Let me think about each symbol.\n\nThe string is `t2 t50 t28`.\n\nSo, `t2` comes first. From the grammar, the only NT that directly produces `t2` is NT10 \u2192 't2'. So `t2` must come from NT10.\n\nBut S can't directly produce NT10; S can produce NT50 and NT27. So perhaps S must produce NT50 and NT27, then NT50 must somehow produce `t50`, which it's not directly doing, and NT27 must produce `t28`, but looking at NT27, it can go to NT124 and NT50, but"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. That should make parsing a bit more straightforward, I think. Each non-terminal can only produce two non-terminals at a time, except for the terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and it has two productions:\n1. S -> NT1 NT28\n2.

Wait, maybe I should think deeper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe `t5` isn't a terminal directly but can be derived from a non-terminal. But looking through the grammar, I don't see a production that ends with `t5`. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, checking the productions again: I see NT35 -> 't105', NT7 -> 't93', NT27 -> 't124', etc. But no `t5`. So maybe `t5` is actually a terminal? But in the string, the user wrote `t5` as is, perhaps it's not in the grammar. That could be an issue. Wait, but the user included it, so I have to accept it as the string to check, even if not present in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again: the grammar has NT54 -> 't53', NT27 -> 't124', NT24 -> 't29', etc. No `t5` terminal. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the string isn't in the language because one of the terminals isn't present. Or perhaps I misread a production.\n\nWait, wait, looking back, I see NT21 -> 't3', but that's `t3`. So, maybe I should figure out the parse tree for `t2 t79 t5`.\n\nBut first, let's look at the string: three tokens separated by spaces. Since the grammar uses S as the start symbol, which produces two non-terminals, the string should have an even number of symbols if derived from S directly. But `t2 t79 t5` has three symbols, which is odd. That suggests that perhaps the string can't be directly derived from S because each production from S spawns two non-terminals, and that can be expanded into more symbols but leading to an even count. Or perhaps not\u2014it depends on how the non-terminals expand.\n\nWait, no. Each non-terminal expansion adds one more symbol because each production is two non-terminals, which when expanded can add more. So perhaps the number of symbols isn't an issue here because the start symbol's tree can produce an odd number of terminal symbols depending on the path. But maybe that's not the case. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is that some non-terminals produce terminals, and the string's structure doesn't fit the possible parse tree. Let's think about the string: `t2 t79 t5`. So three terminals.\n\nTo generate three terminals, the grammar's derivation must result in three symbols. Let's see how that can happen.\n\nThe start symbol S produces two non-terminals, so from S, we have NT1 and NT28.\n\nEach of these can be expanded further. Let's consider NT1 and NT28.\n\nLooking at NT1 -> NT25 NT17.\n\nNT25 -> NT6 NT3. From NT6 -> 't54' and NT3 -> NT6 NT3. So NT6 can produce 't54' followed by more from NT3.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 -> NT4 NT35. NT4 -> NT21 NT15, which NT21 -> NT37 NT20 and NT15 -> NT50 NT15.\n\nThis seems getting complex. Alternatively, let's look for a possible parse.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to check if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nLooking at the terminal tokens:\n\nFirst, `t2` can come from NT10 -> 't2'.\n\nThen, `t79`\u2014looking through the grammar, I don't see any production that directly gives `t79`. Wait, looking again, I see NT35 -> 't105', NT7 -> 't97', etc. Perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, looking back through the productions, I see NT7 -> 't93' and 't97', but no `t79`. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe the string isn't in the language because one of the terminals isn't available. Or perhaps I made a mistake in reading the productions.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. I might have misread NT7's productions. Looking back:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't93'\n- NT7 -> 't97'\n\nNo `t79`. So the grammar doesn't produce `t79`. Therefore, the string contains `t79`, which the grammar can't generate. So the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure. Let me double-check. Maybe there's a production I overlooked that produces `t79`. Scanning through the grammar again:\n\nLooking for 't79'\u2014I don't see it in any production. The productions for terminals are:\n\nNT47 -> 't3'\nNT17 -> 't94'\nNT27 -> 't124'\nNT24 -> 't29'\nNT22 -> 't128'\nNT1 -> 't69'\nNT41 -> 't52'\nNT48 -> 't24'\nNT56 -> 't112'\nNT47 -> 't3'\nWait, no `t79` there. So the string contains `t79`, which is not present in the grammar, so it can't be generated. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken and `t79` comes from some other production. Let me check more thoroughly.\n\nLooking at all NT productions:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT3. No terminal here.\n\nNT4 -> NT21 NT15, which NT21 -> NT37 NT20, NT15 -> NT50 NT15. No terminals.\n\nNT5 -> NT13 NT24, which NT13 -> NT43 NT26, NT24 -> NT29 NT3. Still no terminals.\n\nNT6 -> 't54 NT6'. So NT6 can expand to 't54' plus itself, but it's recursive.\n\nWait, no `t79` in any NT's terminal production. So the string can't be generated because it includes `t79`, which isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF means. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, I see that all the production rules fit this form, so that's good.\n\nNext, the goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules. The string `t16 t134 t27 t119` consists of four tokens, which I assume are terminals. So, I need to check if there's a way to break down the start symbol S into these tokens through the productions.\n\nLet me look at the grammar's productions to see how these tokens can be generated. I notice that several productions end with 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT17 \u2192 't94', which might generate 't94', etc. But I need to figure out which combinations can lead to the given string.\n\nLet me list the relevant productions that result in terminals starting with 't':\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT26 \u2192 't48' and some have 't24', 't93', etc.\n- NT14 \u2192 't79', etc.\n- NT22 \u2192 't58', 't29', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't93', 't97', etc.\n- NT26 can generate multiple 't's: 't48', 't58', 't24', 't93', 't79', 't58', etc.\n- NT32 \u2192 't59'\n- NT20 \u2192 't2' (in NT10)\n- NT6 \u2192 't58' and so on.\n\nWait, but the string is `t16 t134 t27 t119`. Let me see if any of these productions generate exactly the needed 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't2' and 't50' so 't2' is one of the options.\n- NT21 \u2192 't3' (but in the string it's 't16', so not matching).\n- NT9 \u2192 't19', which is one of the given 't's, but the string has 't16' which isn't produced by NT9.\n- NT3 \u2192 't6' (so not matching 't16').\n- Looking further, I see NT20 \u2192 't2', but the string has 't16', so maybe another production.\n- NT26 \u2192 't48', which isn't matching. Wait, are there any 't16'? Let me check the grammar again. Oh, wait, the productions seem to have some 't's but maybe no 't16' is a direct production. So maybe it's generated through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps 't16' is part of a larger derivation. Let me think about how to reach 't16' from the start symbol.\n\nStarting from S, following productions:\n\nS can go to NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. Let's see NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17 or NT42 NT35. Neither of these end with 't', so they must be further expanded. Let's say we take NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. Now, NT6 can produce 't58' or 't120', but neither is 't16'. So maybe this path isn't leading us to 't16'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT50 NT27. NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT50 (which seems like a loop) or other productions. But looking at NT50, one production is NT50 \u2192 't4' (from NT15's production), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, looking back, the NT50 productions include NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15. This seems like a looping production, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the tokens in the string and see if they can be matched in sequence. The string is `t16 t134 t27 t119`. Let me check each token:\n\n- `t16`: Is there any production that directly generates 't16'? Looking through, I don't see any direct production to 't16' from a non-terminal. However, perhaps 't16' is generated through multiple steps.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT20 \u2192 't2', which is 't2', so maybe 't16' is derived from a longer chain, but in the string, 't16' comes first. Let me see if any production can generate 't16' somewhere in the chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. The string has four tokens: t16, t134, t27, t119.\n\nFirst, t16: Maybe it's from NT0 \u2192 't126', but no. Alternatively, looking for a production that produces 't16' as a terminal. But from the given grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces 't16'. So perhaps 't16' is generated through a series of steps. Let me try to see if any non-terminals can generate 't16' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible that 't16' is a terminal that's the result of a specific derivation path. Let me check if any non-terminals directly produce a 't16' token. Looking at the productions, I don't see any, which suggests that t16 might not be present in the grammar. But the string includes t16, so unless I'm missing something, it's impossible for this string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any production that ends with 't16'. For example, NT21 \u2192 't3', NT15 \u2192 't48', etc. So 't16' isn't directly produced by any production rule in the grammar.

Hmm, that's a problem. If the string starts with `t17` and the grammar doesn't have a production for NT17 that ends in 't17', then the string can't be generated. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules for NT17. Oh, I see that NT17 \u2192 't94' is actually in the grammar. Wait, no, looking again, the grammar has NT17 \u2192 't94' in one of the rules. So NT17 can produce 't94', but not 't17'. Therefore, if the string has `t17`, there's no way to get that from NT17.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's `t17`, so that would require NT17 to produce 't17', which isn't present. Therefore, the string can't be generated because the first token doesn't match any production. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT17 is derived from a combination of other non-terminals that can produce 't17'. But looking through the rules, all productions for NT17 are either to other non-terminals or to specific terminals like 't94'. There's no path where NT17 can produce 't17' or 't28', as in the string. \n\nSo, since the first token `t17` can't be produced by any of the NT17 rules, the entire string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of production rules, all of which are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, as it's in Chomsky Normal Form. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it starts with `t89`. I should check if `t89` is a terminal or if it's derived from a non-terminal. Looking through the production rules, I see that several non-terminals have productions ending with terminals like `t7`, `t93`, `t94`, etc. I'm scanning the rules to see if any of them produce `t89`.\n\nWait, I see `S -> NT1 NT50` and `S -> NT50 NT27`. Hmm, but `NT50` is a non-terminal, so the string starts with `t89`, which is a terminal. That suggests `t89` must be produced by a non-terminal or directly as a terminal.\n\nLooking deeper, I see that `NT43 -> 't69'` and `NT42 -> 't28'`, but I don't see a rule that produces `t89` as a terminal. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the production rules again. Oh, I see `NT44 -> 't114'` and `NT44 -> 't89'`. So `NT44` can produce `t89`? That means for `t89` to appear in the string, there must be a `NT44` somewhere in the derivation.\n\nSo the first step is: the string starts with `t89`, which means it must come from `NT44`. Now, `NT44` can be either `t114` or `t89`. In this case, we need `t89`, so `NT44` must be the rule `NT44 -> 't89'`.\n\nSo the derivation starts as S \u2192 NT1 NT50 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Let's see if either of these can produce `t89`... Actually, the string starts with `t89`, so maybe the derivation is S \u2192 NT44 and then that NT44 produces `t89`.\n\nWait, but looking at the start symbol S, the first step must be S \u2192 NT1 NT50 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. But if S \u2192 NTsomething, and the first symbol is `t89`, that means one of the non-terminals must derive to `t89` starting from S.\n\nSo S \u2192 A B (where A and B are non-terminals). The first symbol in the string is `t89`, which is `A`, so `A` must derive to `t89`. Let me check the production rules for A. If A is NT44, then A can be 't89'. So perhaps S \u2192 NT44 NT50, and then NT44 \u2192 't89'. Or S \u2192 NT50 NT27, and NT50 can derive to something starting with `t89`... but looking at the rules, NT50 has productions like `-> NT14 NT34` and `-> NT4 NT27`, but none start with `t89` immediately. So more likely, the first step is S \u2192 NT44 NT50, and NT44 produces `t89`.\n\nSo after that, we have `t89` from NT44, and then we need to check what NT50 produces. The next symbol is `t48`, so we need to see if NT50 can produce `t48` as part of its expansion.\n\nLooking at NT50's rules: `-> NT14 NT34` and `-> NT4 NT27`. Neither of these start with `t48` as a terminal, because both lead to non-terminals. So I must see how NT50 can derive to something that starts with `t48`.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps each symbol in the string corresponds to a non-terminal, which then produces a terminal. So let's look at the entire string: `t89 t48 t62 t16 t87`.\n\nEach part is a terminal, so each must come from a non-terminal production ending in a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. `t89` must come from a non-terminal with a production rule ending in `t89`. From above, `NT44` has `-> 't89'`.\n\n2. Next, `t48` must come from another non-terminal, say NTx, which can produce `t48` as a terminal. Let me check the rules. Looking through, I see NT24 -> 't48' and NT8 -> 't48' in other rules. Wait, in the production for NT24, there's `-> 't48'`? Let me find all terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I spot `NT0 -> 't126'`, `NT6 -> 't58'`, `NT49 -> 't109'`, `NT26 -> 't98'`, `NT13 -> 't135'`, etc. Wait, actually, I see in the later rules:\n\n- `NT24 -> 't48'`\n- `NT17 -> 't94'`\n- `NT28 -> 't76'`\n- `NT39 -> 't131'`\n- `NT47 -> 't41'`\n- `NT15 -> 't48'`\n- Others like `NT24-> 't48'`.\n\nSo `t48` can come from NT24 or NT15, among others. So in the second position, `t48` is the result of NT24 or NT15.\n\nSimilarly, the third term is `t62`. Looking for `t62` in the rules, I see `NT46 -> 't62'`.\n\nFourth is `t16`, which I see in `NT10 -> 't16'`.\n\nFifth is `t87`, which is `NT6 -> 't87'` or from NT21, etc.\n\nSo, now let's try to build a derivation.\n\nStarting from S, which is either NT1 NT50 or NT50 NT27.\n\nThe string starts with `t89`, which must come from NT44. So S must be producing NT44 NT50, as S's first production is NT1 NT50 or NT50 NT27, but NT44 is a non-terminal, so perhaps S allows that? Wait, the initial productions for S are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT50\n- S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nBut NT1 and NT50 are non-terminals, so when S expands, the first part is NT1 (which can produce different things) followed by NT50.\n\nBut the string starts with `t89`, which needs NT44, which is not covered by S's initial productions. Because in S's first step, it can only produce NT1 or NT50, but NT44 is a different non-terminal. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar's productions include all NTx as non-terminals, and S is the only start symbol. So S must derive the entire string, which is a sequence of terminals. So to start, S must expand into NT1 NT50 and then NT1 must expand into the correct sequence, etc.\n\nBut the string starts with `t89`, so NT1 must produce `t89`. Looking at NT1's productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT1 \u2192 NT42 NT35\n- NT1 \u2192 NT24 NT15\n- NT1 \u2192 NT7 NT3\n- NT1 \u2192 't84' (I think I missed this earlier. Let me check: looking through the rules, I see `NT1 -> 't84'` and `NT1 -> 't7'` (from earlier rules). Wait, no, looking again:\n\nIn the production list, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT24 \u2192 't48'\n- NT39 \u2192 't131'\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed NT1's rule. Scanning the list, I find:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't84' in some rules. Let me search for 't84'.\n\nYes, here: `NT1 -> 't84'`, but this is under the production for NT1. So S can expand to NT1 NT50, and then NT1 can produce `t84`, but that's a terminal. But the string starts with `t89`, not `t84`. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-101","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string \"t4 t114 t45 t17 t109 t36\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how Chomsky normal form (CNF) works. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The starting symbol does not appear on the right side of any production. The grammar provided follows this structure, so that's reassuring.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t4 t114 t45 t17 t109 t36\". Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nI think the approach here is to work backward from the string and see if we can reach the start symbol S using the given production rules. Since each production in CNF either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals, each production step should reduce the number of symbols by one, except when introducing non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string \"t4 t114 t45 t17 t109 t36\", there are six terminals. Since each production either introduces one terminal or two non-terminals, the number of steps needed should be such that starting from S, after n steps, we have a string of n-1 non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: each production in CNF is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So, starting from S, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for a string of length 6, how many steps would that require?\n\nLet me see. Let's count the number of terminals in the string: 6. So, starting from S (a single non-terminal), each production either increases the number of non-terminals by one (A\u2192BC) or replaces a non-terminal with a terminal (A\u2192a). But since the string only has terminals, the entire string must have been generated by replacing non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nEach time we apply A\u2192BC, the number of symbols increases by one. So, starting from 1 symbol (S), each step could either keep the same number (if A\u2192a is applied, but wait no\u2014if we apply A\u2192a, then the total number decreases by zero, because we replace one non-terminal with one terminal. Alternatively, A\u2192BC increases the number of symbols by one.)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about the number of symbols: starting from S, which is one symbol. Each production A\u2192BC takes a non-terminal and turns it into two non-terminals, so the total number of symbols increases by one. Each production A\u2192a takes a non-terminal and turns it into a terminal, so the number of symbols remains the same.\n\nTo get a string with six terminals, let's count how many steps would be needed. Each A\u2192a production replaces a non-terminal with a terminal, but we need to consider how many non-terminals we have and how they're replaced.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string top-down using the grammar.\n\nLet me list the string: t4, t114, t45, t17, t109, t36.\n\nI need to see if these can be generated by the grammar. Let's see what each terminal can be derived from.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can either start by trying to see if the entire string can be matched by the start symbol S, or perhaps breaking it down into the different productions.\n\nAnother approach is to think about each of the terminals and see if they can be generated by some non-terminal. For example, each terminal should have a production rule that directly expands to it, and the non-terminals should expand into sequences that eventually produce the given string.\n\nBut looking at the provided grammar, I notice that many non-terminals have production rules that either reference other non-terminals or terminals. For example, S starts as S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So, we need to see if the given string can be broken down into pieces that correspond to these initial productions.\n\nWait, but the string is \"t4 t114 t45 t17 t109 t36\". Since S starts with either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27, let's see if the string can be divided into a prefix that comes from NT1 NT28 and a suffix from NT28 or vice versa.\n\nBut perhaps it's more straightforward to look for possible substrings. Let me check each terminal in the string to see if they have any direct production rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each non-terminal may have rules that end in terminals. So, let's see:\n\nFor example:\n- NT4 has a rule NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, which in turn might produce more non-terminals. But I also notice that NT4 has rules ending in 't87', 't93', and 't97', etc., but wait, some of these are directly to terminals. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see for example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't120', NT27 \u2192 't58', NT53 \u2192 't112', etc. So, these non-terminals can directly produce a terminal with a 't' and a number.\n\nSo, each terminal in the string corresponds to a production of a non-terminal. Therefore, to generate this string, the derivation must result in these non-terminals expanding to the respective terminals.\n\nSo, let's see if each of these terminals (t4, t114, etc.) can be directly produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking again, for example:\n\n- t4: Is there a non-terminal NTx that produces 't4'? Looking through the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 't21' (wait, no, in the last part of the grammar, NT4 has 't21', but in the earlier parts, maybe it's not directly. Wait, let me re-examine. Hmm, perhaps I should look in the final part:\n\nYes, towards the end, we have NT46 \u2192 't4', NT45 \u2192 't28', etc. So, NT46 can produce 't4'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- t114: Looking for a non-terminal that produces 't114'. Scanning through the grammar, near the end, NT27 \u2192 't124', but that's not 114. Wait, perhaps in the earlier part: Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT56 has rules like \u2192 't112' and \u2192 't134', but I'm not seeing 't114' in the rules. Wait, actually in the grammar, looking near the end: I see the last lines have 't87', 't105', etc., perhaps not directly helpful.\n\nWait, maybe looking in the parts where NT114 is generated. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see NT10 \u2192 't2', but not t114. Hmm, perhaps I need to look deeper. Alternatively, maybe it's better to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each t in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that can produce that 't'. So, for each t followed by a number, I can find a non-terminal in the grammar that directly produces that 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, perhaps each of these 't' strings ends with a single 't' and a number, like 't4', 't114', etc. So, for example:\n\n- t4 is produced by NT46 \u2192 't4'\n- t114: Looking for a non-terminal that produces 't114'. Hmm, looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see this. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nWait, in the beginning of the grammar, I see NT27 \u2192 't124'. No help there. Maybe towards the end: Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't114'. Similarly, for 't45', 't17', 't109', etc., there may or may not be corresponding non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me list each terminal and attempt to find a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nTerminals in the string: 't4', 't114', 't45', 't17', 't109', 't36'.\n\nLooking in the grammar for each of these:\n\n1. 't4': Found in NT46 \u2192 't4'\n\n2. 't114': Looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't114'.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I notice a mix of non-terminals and terminals, so I'll have to parse the string accordingly.\n\nThe string given is: `t14 t66 t58 t126 t27 t11`. These are all terminals ending with 't', indicating they're likely atomic symbols or literals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the most efficient way to parse is using the CYK algorithm or checking for a leftmost derivation. However, given the complexity, I think a leftmost derivation approach might be more manageable for me.\n\nI'll start from the start symbol S. The grammar's start symbol is S, which has the following productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT50\nS \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nHmm, the string starts with 't14', so maybe it's helpful to see how the string can be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT36, NT28, NT16, etc., but wait, the string doesn't have many non-terminals except for 't's.\n\nWait a minute, let's look at the productions for the non-terminals that map to 't's. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58\nNT29 \u2192 t48\nNT46 \u2192 t76\nNT28 \u2192 t76 (another one)\nNT22 \u2192 t29 (from the rules)\nNT10 \u2192 t2\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to find a leftmost derivation:\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT1 NT50 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Let me try both options.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT1 NT50\n\nNow, NT1's production rules? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any productions for NT1, except in the context of S:\n\nWait, checking the given grammar, the only rule that starts with NT1 is: NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. So, NT1 expands into two non-terminals.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT1 NT50 becomes (after expanding S) NT25 NT17 NT50.\n\nBut wait, NT25 is \u2192 NT6 NT31. Let's see if this helps.\n\nBut the string we have doesn't have any NT25 or NT17 or NT31 in between. This seems complex. Maybe Option 1 leads to a dead end because the string doesn't have any of the relevant non-terminals.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nNT50's productions: looking for rules starting with NT50. Indeed, NT50 \u2192 t4. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through, I see NT50 \u2192 t4? No, no. Let's check each production.\n\nLooking for NT50, it seems that NT50 \u2192 NT21. Let me verify:\n\nLooking through the rules, yes, in the grammar, NT50 is defined as NT21. So, S \u2192 NT50 NT27 becomes NT21 NT27.\n\nNow, NT21: from the rules, NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT20. So NT21 expands to NT37 NT20.\n\nSo now, S \u2192 NT37 NT20 NT27.\n\nLooking at each component:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT7 NT33\nNT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50\nNT27 \u2192 NT50 NT4? Wait, in the grammar, NT27's productions:\n\nLooking again, NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4, or NT27 \u2192 t124. Wait, no, in the given rules, NT27 has the following:\n\nLooking back: NT27 \u2192 t124. Because in the rules, I see \"NT27 -> NT54 NT4\" and \"NT27 -> t124\". Oh, yes, so NT27 can either produce NT54 NT4 or 't124'.\n\nAnd NT20: NT20 can produce NT38 NT33 or 't50'.\n\nAnd NT37: NT7 \u2192 something else, but 't24' or maybe 't79'?\n\nWait, no, NT7's productions: in the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 t93, t97, t79, t94, t93, t7. Wait, no, in the rules, NT7's productions seem to lead to various terminals, but also in the early part of the grammar, NT7 is defined as NT35 \u2192 NT53 NT55 and others, but looking for NT7 specifically.\n\nWait, let's clarify: in the grammar, under NT7, I see:\n\nNT7 -> t93\nNT7 -> t97\nNT7 -> t79\nNT7 -> t94\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 -> t93\nNT7 -> t97\nNT7 -> t79\nNT7 -> t94\n\nWait, but in the given rules, is there a rule that directly maps NT7 to a terminal? From the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT7 NT33\nThen, NT7 \u2192 't93', 't97', 't79', 't94'\n\nSo, in the derivation, S \u2192 NT37 NT20 NT27 becomes:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT7 NT33\nNT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50\nNT27 \u2192 e.g., 't124' (assuming that NT27 has a production to 't124'), but wait, earlier I thought NT27 can produce 't124', but in the original grammar, looking:\n\nWait, checking the grammar provided:\n\nLooking for the production of NT27:\n\nHere's the line: NT27 -> t124. Actually, no, the line is \"NT27 -> NT54 NT4\". However, in another line, \"NT27 -> t124\". Wait, is that correct?\n\nIn the provided grammar, I see:\n\nlooking line by line, starting from top:\n\n... \n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT27 -> t124\n\nYes, so NT27 can produce either \"t124\" or something else.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t14, not t79 or t79 or t24. So, perhaps I'm going the wrong way.\n\nWait, the string is t14 t66 t58 t126 t27 t11.\n\nHmm, that's six 't's, but the grammar seems to have various productions for each non-terminal.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Perhaps I should try to see what sequence of rules can lead me to this string.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t14, perhaps I need to find which non-terminals produce t14, t66, etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I need to find production rules that produce these terminals. Let me look for each occurrence:\n\n- t14: looking for a production ending with '14'. In the grammar, I see NT14 -> t7.\n\nWait no, in the grammar line: NT14 -> t79, not t14. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't immediately see any 't14's. Let's see:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nLines that have 't...':\n\n- NT36 -> ...t56...\n- NT6 -> ...t62...\n- NT46 -> ...t53...\n- NT17 -> ...t94...\n- NT27 -> ...t124...\n- NT22 -> ...t29...\n- NT1 -> ...t69...\n- NT45 -> ...t73...\n- NT47 -> ...t3...\n- NT10 -> ...t2...\n- NT55 -> ...t36...\n- NT6 -> ...t58...\n- NT50 -> ...t4...\n- NT22 -> ...t45...\n- NT22 -> ...t57...\n- etc.\n\nWait, in the lines provided, I don't see any 't14' terminal being produced. So that's a problem because the string starts with t14. Therefore, unless one of the non-terminals directly produces t14, the string can't be in the language.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any NT rule that produces t14 directly. The closest is NT14 -> t79, but that's for 14, not 14 directly. Or wait, looking at NT17 -> t44? No.\n\nWait, let me check all the non-terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have productions ending with terminals like t79, t2, etc. These terminals are part of the language, so the string we're checking must consist of a sequence of these terminals, connected by non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe given string is \"t79 t2 t63 t38 t31 t41 t1\".

NT14 \u2192 't79', etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong, and 't63' isn't generated by any rule in the grammar.

The string is `t59 t59 t34 t41 t117 t41 t108`. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal leads to exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. But looking at the grammar provided, I see that some productions might lead to terminals but more than two. For example, `S -> NT1 NT1` would have non-terminals, but other productions like `NT4 -> NT21 NT15` are all non-terminals. Wait, actually, some rules have mix of non-terminals and terminals? Let me check some rules. Hmm, looking at the rules, some right-hand sides have terminals like 't87', 't93', etc. So the grammar allows terminals, but in CNF, I think all productions must be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. \n\nWait, no\u2014the user said it's in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me recall: CNF requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So the given grammar must have all productions in CNF. But looking at some rules, I see NT44 \u2192 NT38 NT13, which are both non-terminals, so that's fine. Then there's NT34 \u2192 NT36 NT32; NT16 \u2192 NT10 NT34\u2014all non-terminals. But then other rules like NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17: okay, non-terminals. Then, for example, NT34 has a production NT44 NT38, which are non-terminals. Wait, but in the rules, some seem to involve a mix. Wait, no: all right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So that conforms to CNF.\n\nBut wait, for terminals like 't59', that's a single terminal, which is allowed in CNF as A \u2192 a.\n\nNow, the string given has multiple 't' tokens, each being a single terminal. So each of these 't's must be generated by single-terminal productions.\n\nThe approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the given string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce either NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27. So S has two possible initial productions.\n\nLet's try expanding each path.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT1 NT1.\n\nNow, NT1 has a production NT45 \u2192 NT46. Wait, looking back, NT1 has a production NT25 NT17, but in the list above, NT1: 'NT1 -> NT25 NT17'?\n\nWait no, looking at the grammar, under NT1 it says 'NT1 -> NT25 NT17'. Hmm, but in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking back, the grammar starts with S -> NT1 NT1, S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nThen under NT terms, I see:\n\nNT1: 'NT1 -> NT25 NT17'\n\nWait, but that's two non-terminals; that's acceptable.\n\nSo for the first step, S can produce NT1 NT1.\n\nLet's try expanding the first NT1. So NT1 can be expanded into NT25 NT17.\n\nNow, NT25 is 'NT25 -> NT6 NT31' via the rule under NT25.\n\nSo NT25 produces NT6 NT31.\n\nNow, NT6 has a production: 'NT6 -> NT54 NT6'?\n\nWait, looking back: under NT6, the rule is 'NT6 -> NT54 NT6'. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, under NT6, I see multiple entries. For example:\n\nNT6: 'NT6 -> NT54 NT6'\u2014no, that's a cycle. Wait, no, that's a production: NT6 can be replaced by NT54 NT6, which would create an infinite loop unless another production is taken. Also, NT6 has another production: 'NT6 -> t58' and 'NT6 -> t21' and how?\n\nWait, looking again: I see under NT6: 'NT6 -> t58' and 'NT6 -> t21' as separate rules. So NT6 can produce a single terminal like t58 or t21.\n\nSo in NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31, NT6 can produce a terminal, say t58, and then NT31 can produce something else.\n\nWait, but in the string we have t59, so maybe I need to consider whether the grammar allows t59 to be produced by some rule.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT33 \u2192 NT7 NT33 (which seems like a cycle), but also NT33 can produce t58 via 'NT33 -> t58'\u2014no, wait: looking through the rules, I see:\n\nUnder NT33: 'NT33 -> t58'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, under NT33:\n\nYes, under NT33: 'NT33 -> t58', which allows it to produce t58.\n\nAdditionally, under NT36: 'NT36 -> t58'? Hmm, wait no:\n\nLooking back, I see that NT36 is transformed into NT56 and NT10, but does it also produce a terminal? Let me check:\n\nUnder NT36: 'NT36 -> NT56 NT10' is one rule, but then looking further:\n\nI see NT36: 'NT36 -> NT20 NT15'\u2014another production. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps some terminals are in rules that I didn't list correctly.\n\nWait, upon reviewing, I see that under NT36, the first production is NT56 NT10. Wait, but further down, under NT36, there's 'NT36 -> t59'. Yes, that's correct. So NT36 can produce t59.\n\nWait no: under the 'Grammar' provided, I don't see any NT36 \u2192 t59. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nWait, the rules for NT36 are:\n\n- NT36 -> NT56 NT10\n\n- NT36 -> NT20 NT15\n\nAdditionally, looking further, under NT36, I see: 'NT36 -> NT120'\u2014no, perhaps not. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Wait, the grammar provided includes a line: 'NT120' is not a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see a production where NT36 produces t59. Wait, perhaps I missed some. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nWait, under NT36, the first two productions are to other non-terminals. Then looking later, I don't see a production NT36 -> t59. Similarly, NT33 can produce t58. So in this case, t59 is coming from another rule.\n\nWait, looking back, I see a line: 'NT53 -> NT29 NT3'?\n\nWait, that's a production for NT53. Alternatively, I need to see how t59 is produced.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, under NT33, I see 'NT33 -> t58' as a production. Then, perhaps NT34 can produce t37, as 'NT34 -> t37'. Similarly, other non-terminals produce various terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for where t59 is produced. Let me check:\n\nUnder NT36: is there a production to t59? I think not; perhaps another non-terminal produces t59.\n\nLooking through the rules, perhaps NT67: maybe I missed that. Alternatively, perhaps I should track back how t59 is generated.\n\nWait, perhaps NT36 can produce t59 via some path. Alternatively, maybe it's another non-terminal that can produce t59.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT36:\n\nIn the rules, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> NT56 NT10\n\n- NT36 -> NT20 NT15\n\nAdditionally, does it have a production to a terminal?

Let me go through all the rules again.\n\nThe rules are listed as:\n\n...\nNT36 -> NT56 NT10\nNT36 -> NT20 NT15\n...\nI think NT36 only produces non-terminals.\n\nElsewhere, looking for terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see several 't' productions, such as 't2', 't93', 't42', etc.\n\nLooking for t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. But looking at the given grammar, I see some rules where the right-hand side has more than two symbols, like S -> NT1 NT1 NT28. Wait, no, actually in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols on the right, right? So I must have made a mistake because some rules seem to have three symbols. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the rules, they're mostly in the form A -> BC, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals or terminals. But some have three symbols, like NT47 -> NT47 NT47. No, wait, actually looking closer, most are two symbols. For instance, NT36 -> NT56 NT10, which is two symbols. So maybe it's okay. I think some rules might have terminals, like NT46 -> 't8', which is a single terminal. That\u2019s allowed because in CNF, the right-hand side can be terminals or non-terminals, but the number is limited. Wait, no, in CNF, each production on the right must be exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So if a production has a terminal and a non-terminal, that's fine. But if it's a terminal and a terminal, that's two terminals. Or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two non-terminals. So looking at the grammar, all seem to have exactly two on the right. For example, NT46 -> 't8' is a terminal, so it's actually a single terminal symbol. Oh, but wait, in CNF, the right-hand side should be two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. But if it's just one terminal, that's not possible because you need two symbols. This seems contradictory. Maybe I'm confusing the rules.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar provided is in a mix of forms, not all strictly CNF. Alternatively, perhaps some productions have only one symbol on the right. But that's not allowed in CNF. I think I need to double-check the given grammar. Let me look for any productions with more than two symbols on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see some lines like NT47 -> NT47 NT47, which is two non-terminals. Others like NT44 -> NT38 NT13, which is two non-terminals. Then there are rules like NT25 -> NT6 NT31, which is two non-terminals. However, I also see lines like NT36 -> NT56 NT10, which is two non-terminals. So far, I don't see any production with more than two symbols on the right. So perhaps it's all in CNF. Okay, moving on.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is \"t38 t87 t11 t21 t102 t76 t117 t21\". Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces a terminal or combines two non-terminals. To generate the string, each literal in the string must come directly from the start symbol through a series of productions, possibly via non-terminals, which eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, can produce either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So the string must start with either t38 or t7 (since NT1 -> 't78' and NT50 -> 't4'). Wait, looking back, in the grammar, the rules for the start symbol are S -> NT1 NT28 and S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nLet me check what NT1 and NT28 produce. NT1 -> NT4 NT17. Then NT4 -> NT21 NT15. NT4 is also listed as NT46 -> 't93'? Wait, no, in the grammar above, I think I misread.\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar correctly. The grammar has the production S -> NT1 NT28 and S -> NT50 NT27. Each of these non-terminals, NT1, NT28, NT50, etc., have their own productions.\n\nSo, for the start symbol S, the first part is NT1 NT28. Let me see what NT1 and NT28 expand to.\n\nNT1 -> NT4 NT17\n\nLooking at NT17: Wait, in the grammar, NT17 is not listed, so perhaps it's a terminal? Wait, no, the grammar doesn't have NT17 as a non-terminal, so perhaps it's a terminal. Let me check: in the grammar rules, I see NT17 -> 't94' and NT17 -> 't24'. So NT17 can produce either a terminal t94 or t24.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT28 produces. Looking at the grammar, I have NT28 -> NT46 NT53, but wait, looking again, the rule is:\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount. The grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT1 NT28\n\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nThen, the non-terminals include NT1, NT28, NT50, NT27, and many others.\n\nLooking at NT28, it actually has a rule: NT28 -> NT4 NT6. Wait, no, looking again, the rule is:\n\nLooking carefully, I think I misread earlier. Let me read the grammar lines again, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nHere's a part:\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT6\n\nWait, no, in the initial user message, it's:\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT6. So, NT28 is a non-terminal, and it produces NT4 and NT6, both of which are non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> NT14 NT45, etc.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I was mistaken earlier about the string. The string given is \"t38 t87 t11 t21 t102 t76 t117 t21\", which splits by spaces, so there are eight elements.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation must introduce exactly two symbols. So the string consists of eight terminals, which would require seven productions, each introducing one more terminal.\n\nEach production either introduces a terminal or combines two non-terminals. But if a production for a non-terminal results in a terminal, that's the end of that part.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which branches into either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nLet me explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider S -> NT1 NT28. Then, NT1 is NT4 NT17, and NT28 is NT4 NT6.\n\nWait, but NT28 is supposed to be two symbols, right? Since the rule is S -> NT1 NT28, where NT28 is NT4 NT6, so NT4 and NT6 are each non-terminals.\n\nSo the initial expansion would produce NT1 (which is NT4 NT17), followed by NT28 (which is NT4 NT6). So the initial string is NT4 NT17 NT4 NT6.\n\nBut to get down to terminals, each of these non-terminals must be expanded.\n\nWait, this approach might get too complicated. Maybe I should use the CYK algorithm. The CYK algorithm is used to parse strings in context-free grammars, especially in Chomsky normal form. It's a dynamic programming algorithm that can determine if a string is generate by a given grammar.\n\nThe steps of the CYK algorithm involve creating a table where each cell [i,j] contains the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize the table: For each position i, [i,i] contains the non-terminals that produce the corresponding terminal (if the grammar includes the production A -> a, where a is a terminal, then A is added to [i,i]).\n\n2. For each substring length l from 2 to n (n is the length of the string), fill the table by considering all possible pairs of [i,i+k] and [i+k,i+l-k] and see if any production exists that combines the two.\n\n3. If the start symbol S is found in [1,n], then the string is in the language.\n\nGiven the string is \"t38 t87 t11 t21 t102 t76 t117 t21\", which is 8 symbols, so n=8.\n\nI need to construct the table step by step.\n\nFirst, build the initial table where for each position, the non-terminals that can produce the terminal at that position."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar and the possible way the string could be formed. Let me examine the productions to see how the start symbol S generates the terminal symbols in the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT50\n- S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo S starts with either NT1 NT50 or NT50 NT27. The string begins with t94, which is a terminal. Looking through the productions, I see that NT17 \u2192 t94. So, to get t94, the derivation must have NT17 somewhere.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT... Wait, no\u2014S can split into S1 S2, but the first step is S \u2192 NT followed by another NT. So, the first two symbols in the string must come from the first or second part of S's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string step by step. Let me write down the string: t94, t76, t11, t63, t69, t42, t8, t73.\n\nLet's see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Each step should replace a symbol with two symbols (if it's an A \u2192 BC production) or a terminal (if A \u2192 a).\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every non-terminal production either splits into two non-terminals or produces a single terminal. So, for each step, we can replace a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree.\n\nStarting from S:\nThe first step is either:\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT50\n- S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t94. I know that NT17 \u2192 t94, so somewhere there must be a NT17.\n\nIf I choose S \u2192 NT50 NT27, the first term is NT50, which would produce t42 (since NT42 \u2192 t8, but wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking at NT42 \u2192 t84? Or NT4 \u2192 t91. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check NT50.\n\nIn the grammar, NT50 \u2192 t4. Wait, looking at the productions, NT50 appears in S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Also, NT50 \u2192 t4, but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I misremember.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, there's NT50 \u2192 t4? Or maybe I'm looking at a different part. Let me check:\n\nIn the productions, I see NT50 \u2192 t4? Wait, actually, in the list above, I see that NT45 \u2192 't87', NT35 \u2192 't105', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the terminal assignments which are the right-hand sides of non-terminals ending with t.\n\nWait, some NT productions are 't...', meaning they produce a terminal.

How is NT17 derived?\n\nLooking at the productions for NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t94 or another production like NT17 \u2192 ... ?\n\nWait, let me check. The productions include NT17 \u2192 't24'?

Let me start by looking at the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each production starts with the left-hand side (LHS) non-terminal, followed by two non-terminals or terminals on the right-hand side (RHS).\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of a sequence of terminals: t31, t120, t105, t107, t16, t100, t105, t15, t37. So, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, let's note that the start symbol is S. The only productions starting with S are:\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo, the first step is to split the string into possible expansions of these productions.\n\nLet me parse the string as a series of symbols. Since each production results in two non-terminals or a terminal and something else, I might need to split the string into a series of these pairs.\n\nLooking at the string: t31 t120 t105 t107 t16 t100 t105 t15 t37.\n\nThat's 9 symbols. Since each production splits into two, the start symbol S should generate a parse tree where each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal sequence.\n\nLet me try a top-down parse starting from S.\n\nOption 1: Assume S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nThen, the string should start with NT1 followed by NT28. So, \"t31 t120\" would correspond to NT1 and NT28.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for NT1 and NT28.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions. From the grammar, NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nSo, NT1 expands into another two non-terminals.\n\nSo far, the string starts with t31, which would correspond to NT1, so the initial expansion would be t31, then NT17. Similarly, the next symbol is t120, which is the RHS of NT28.\n\nSo, let's map this out:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT28 \u2192 (after NT1: NT25 NT17) (after NT28: t120)\n\nWait, no. NT28 is a non-terminal, so it must expand into something else. Looking at the grammar, NT28's production is NT4 NT6.\n\nSo, stepping through:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n   - NT1 expands to NT25 NT17.\n   - NT28 expands to NT4 NT6.\n\nNow, the string starts with t31 t120. But t120 is the RHS of NT28, which is a terminal. So, let's see:\n\nFirst symbol is t31, which is NT1's expansion. NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. So, next we need NT25 and NT17.\n\nBut the next symbol is t120, which is the result of NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6. But that would mean after nt1 nt28, the next non-terminals are nt4 and nt6. Wait, that might not align.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step using a recursive descent method or to list out possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parsing table or using the CYK algorithm could help, but considering the time, maybe I can do it manually.\n\nLet me think about each symbol and see how they can be generated by the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list all the productions that produce a terminal symbol:\n\n- NT1: doesn't have a terminal production\n- NT3: NT6 NT3\n- NT6: NT54 NT6\n- NT9: NT35 NT46\n- NT24: NT40 NT17\n- NT27: NT39 NT16\n- NT41: NT19 NT10\n- NT46: NT47 NT28\n- NT53: NT29 NT3\n- NT56: NT20 NT17\n- NT22: NT49 NT14\n- NT28: NT8 NT8\n- NT32: NT15 NT13\n- NT36: NT120 NT10\n- NT44: NT38 NT13\n- NT57: Not sure, maybe I missed some.\nWait, actually, many have productions that end with a terminal, like NT17, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal followed by something. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at it wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some NTs can produce a terminal directly. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10, and NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17. Wait, unless somewhere a terminal is produced directly. Looking through all the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT28: NT4 NT6 \u2192 not terminals.\n- NT8: Not in the non-terminals, perhaps another NT? Wait, the production NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6: NT4 is NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, which are NTs, and NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6: again NTs.\n\nLooking through all productions, I see several that involve terminals:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't105'\n- NT28 \u2192 't8' (Wait, wait, in the grammar, looking again:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nNT53 \u2192 't105'\nNT46 \u2192 't8'\nNT28 \u2192 't8' (Wait, no.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because that means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The S productions are S -> NT1 NT1 and S -> NT50 NT27. So the string must start with either NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27. The input string starts with `t52`, which must be the result of one of these initial productions.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is `t52`. Let's see where `t52` comes from. In the grammar, `t52` is produced by NT41. So, I need to check if S can derive to NT41 NTsomething that eventually produces `t52`. The possible productions for NT41 are S, looking at the provided rules. Oh wait, looking at the rules: NT41 appears in a couple of productions, but in the main ones, NT41->'t87'? No, wait, no, the main productions for NT41 are:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT22 -> NT49 NT14\n- NT53 -> NT49 NT54\n- NT46 -> NT49 NT28\n- NT29 -> NT31 NT41\n- NT41 -> 't52' (once)\nWait, in the provided rules, under NT41 we have:\n\nNT41 -> 't87'\nNO, wait, let's scan for NT41 productions.\n\nIn the provided grammar, under the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT41 -> 't69' (Wait, no), actually, scanning for NT41:\n\nThe rules for NT1 are:\n\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT22 -> NT49 NT14\n- NT53 -> NT49 NT54\n- NT46 -> NT49 NT28\n- NT29 -> NT31 NT41 (twice)\nWait, looking through each rule:\n\nLooking for NT41, maybe it's not directly a terminal but let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, are there any NT41 productions that result in terminals?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, under NT31 -> 't117', etc. Hmm, but for NT41, in the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't immediately see NT41 being directly a terminal. Wait, let me count:\n\nLooking through the rules, under NT rules:\n\nWait, I see NT41 -> 't84' (once) and also NT41 -> 't52' (another time). So NT41 has two productions: one to 't84' and one to 't52'. So, when NT41 is derived, it can produce either 't52' or 't84'.\n\nBut in our case, the first token is `t52`, which would require that the first step in the derivation is via NT41 -> 't52'. So, S must expand to something that includes NT41 as one of the symbols.\n\nSo, S can be NT50 NT27.\n\nNow, let's see. S's productions are S -> NT1 NT1 and S -> NT50 NT27. So the initial step is either NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27.\n\nSince the first token is `t52`, and considering that the first part of S would be NT41 NTsomething, perhaps we need NT50 to contribute `t78` or something else.

{"custom_id":"request-185","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. The grammar is provided with a set of production rules. These rules seem a bit complex, but I notice that every non-terminal symbol (the left-hand side) has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, which fits the definition of CNF. So that's a good start\u2014it's in the correct form.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t97 t131 t102 t84 t135 t8 t42 t69 t15 t40`. I remember that in such grammars, the terminals are the strings of the original language, often resulting from the productions, and sometimes they can be terminal symbols that don't expand further.\n\nMy approach should be to trace back from the string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions. Essentially, I need to build a parse tree upwards from the leaves (the terminals) to the root (S).\n\nLet me list the string again for clarity: [t97, t131, t102, t84, t135, t8, t42, t69, t15, t40].\n\nI'll start by looking at each terminal and see if they match any direct productions in the grammar. Some of these might be terminal symbols, which correspond to a single rule. For example, if a terminal like 't7' appears, I can check if there's a production that directly results in 't7'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that some productions are only in the form of NT... -> 'txxx', meaning those non-terminals expand directly into a terminal string. For instance, NT22 -> t58, etc.\n\nNow, I'll try to match the string backward from S:\n\n1. S generates two non-terminals: either NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27.\n2. So the string needs to have these two non-terminals as their roots.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a list of terminals. So, the very top-level productions would have to generate these. Let's assume S -> NT1 NT28. Then, the string must split into two parts, each corresponding to NT1 and NT28.\n\nBut since the string is linear, I need to see if the entire string can be generated by a single S production directly, or through intermediate steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the given grammar only has terminals on the RHS where certain NTs are directly mapped to them. So each token in the string must come from such a production.\n\nLet me check each terminal:\n\n- t97: From the grammar, NT17 -> 't97'. So, NT17 is at the top level.\n\nWait, actually, let me see: NT17 has a production NT17 -> 't94', and another NT17 -> 't97'. So, depending on which branch we take, but I think the key here is that each terminal must come from an NT that directly maps to it, and these NTs can't depend on other NTs except their children.\n\nSo each txxx must be directly generated by an NT. So I'll list all the t's and see if their NT exists in the grammar and whether each can be connected back to the root S.\n\nLet's list all the tokens and identify their NTs:\n\nt97 comes from NT17 (NT17 -> 't97').\n\nt131: Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't131'. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan the rules again. Hmm, seems that t131 isn't directly listed. Wait, perhaps it's generated via another NT. Let me think. Maybe it's an intermediate terminal that expands further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Since the string is a list of terminals, and each must be directly generated by an NT. So each token must be in the form of NT -> 'txtxtx'.\n\nSo let's check each token:\n\n- t97: yes, NT17 has that.\n\n- t131: Wait, I don't see any NT whose production is directly 't131'. So perhaps t131 is an NT that directly expands to it, but in the grammar, I don't see that. So maybe this is a problem. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I need to look again. Let me check the grammar again. The grammar's productions are in the form NT -> some combination of NTERMs or t's.\n\nLooking again, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't131'. So that's a red flag. That would mean that 't131' cannot appear in the string since it's not produced by the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure because sometimes terminals can be generated through multiple steps. Wait, no\u2014in this grammar, every production is in CNF, so the only terminals are those that appear directly in the RHS of a production. All non-terminals on the RHS must have their own productions, which are either more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo if an NT expands to another NT and then to a terminal, but in this case, the tokens are all leaves, so each must be directly generated by a single production. Therefore, if t131 is not present in any production's RHS as a terminal, then it can't appear in the string.\n\nLooking at all the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't131'. For instance, let me check NT37: NT37 -> 't17' and 't33'. So NT37 can produce 't17' and 't33', but not 't131'.\n\nSimilarly, I don't see any other NT that directly produces 't131'. So that means the string cannot be generated because t131 is not in the terminal set of the grammar.\n\nWait, but that seems like a big conclusion. Did I miss anything? Maybe I should double-check the grammar. Let me go through the productions again to see if any NT is mapped to 't131'.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, the only terminals are from 't7' to 't19', 't24', etc., but nothing up to t131, except perhaps some 't105', 't124', 't134', etc., but none as 't131'.\n\nSo there's no NT that directly produces 't131', which means it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer must be 'No'.\n\nWait, but am I sure that the string isn't a mistake, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar? No, looking at the grammar, t131 isn't there. So, yes, the string can't be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So I should find which non-terminals produce 't' terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't79'\n- NT3 \u2192 't42'\n- NT13 \u2192 't16'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- NT26 \u2192 't48'\n- NT46 \u2192 't27'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT22 \u2192 't58'\n- NT10 \u2192 't2'\n- NT21 \u2192 't3'\n- NT48 \u2192 't24'\n- NT46 \u2192 't100'\n- NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- NT47 \u2192 't41'\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT45 \u2192 't73'\n- NT42 \u2192 't2'\n- NT48 \u2192 't24'\n- NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- NT47 \u2192 't134'\n- NT14 \u2192 't79'\n- NT26 \u2192 't58'\n- NT13 \u2192 't16'\n- NT55 \u2192 't45'\n- NT9 \u2192 't19'\n- NT29 \u2192 't48'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT41 \u2192 't4'\n- NT32 \u2192 't66'\n- NT10 \u2192 't50'\n- NT34 \u2192 't37'\n- NT47 \u2192 't40'\n- NT21 \u2192 't3'\n- NT36 \u2192 't87' [Wait, no: looking again, NT36 \u2192 't87'?

Oh, I thought earlier that some non-terminals lead to terminals, but looking through, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me check each line again to see which NTs produce 't'.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't42'?

The string is `t62 t70 t89 t3 t131 t73 t80 t124 t119 t69 t126`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, and the start symbol can produce two terminals directly. This structure makes parsing easier using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just trying to determine if the string is in the language, I might need to trace backward from the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S has two productions: S -> NT1 NT1 and S -> NT50 NT27. Wait, no, looking again, the grammar starts with S -> NT1 NT28 and S -> NT50 NT27. So, the string starts with t62, which I see is from NT47's production: NT47 -> t3 and NT49. Wait, I'm getting confused because the productions for terminals seem to be spread throughout. Oh wait, some non-terminals directly produce terminal strings, like NT46 -> 't24', NT6 -> 't54', etc.\n\nSo, to parse the string from left to right, I might need to see if each part of the string can be derived from the grammar.

Wait, but I'm looking for t62. Hmm, wait, does any NT directly produce t62? Looking through the productions, I see NT29 -> 't26 NT14' and other terminals, but t62 is from NT47 -> 't3 NT49'? No, actually, looking back, I see some have longer terminals. For example, NT1 -> 't69', NT22 -> 't58', etc. Wait, no, perhaps t62 comes from a terminal production. Wait, looking in the grammar, I see NT46 -> 't24 NT28'? No, actually, looking again: NT47 -> 't3', NT17 -> 't94', and so on.

{"custom_id":"request-207","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has several non-terminals, each expanding into combinations of other non-terminals, and eventually terminals. The string I'm given is `t36 t91 t120 t62 t111 t135 t91 t89 t58 t80 t40`.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal is rewritten into two non-terminals. Some terminals might be in the right-hand side, but here all the productions seem to go into non-terminals until they reach terminals. Let me check if that's the case in the given grammar. Yes, each production on the left side, like S -> NT1 NT1, etc., all go into combinations of NTs, with some having a terminal (like NT46 -> 't8').\n\nNow, the Chomsky Normal Form has productions of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the given grammar seems to fit that, with some terminals appearing in the productions.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t36, t91, t120, etc. I need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar. How do I approach this? Well, one method is to construct a derivation starting from the start symbol S and see if I can build the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at the grammar, S expands into NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So the first two symbols in the string are t36, t91. Wait, but t36 and t91 might not directly come from the start symbol's expansion. Let me look for derivations.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about working backwards. Start from the given string and see if I can factor it into the possible non-terminal expansions, eventually leading to S.\n\nLet me break down the string into its components: t36, t91, t120, t62, t111, t135, t91, t89, t58, t80, t40.\n\nI'll try to see if each terminal can be part of a production.\n\nLooking at t36: It's part of the expansion of NT36, which from the grammar expands into NT56 NT10 (NT36 -> NT56 NT10). Looking at the string, t36 is the first symbol, so perhaps it's part of NT36, which would mean the string starts with t36, then the next parts must come from the expansion of NT56 and NT10.\n\nWait, actually, each production is S -> NT1 NT28, meaning S is directly two non-terminals. So to get a string starting with t36, which is t36, perhaps t36 comes from NT36, which is part of some expansion.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that: the productions are S -> NT1 NT28 or S -> NT50 NT27. So any string generated will be two parts: first a derivation from NT1 and then from NT28, or NT50 and NT27.\n\nSo if the string starts with t36, that would mean that t36 is part of the derivation from NT1 or NT28, depending on whether it's S -> NT1 NT28 or S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: let's build a tree from the start symbol S, breaking down each production step by step to see if the given string can be constructed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the sequence of terminals matches the possible terminal sequences from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs have terminals in their productions. For example:\n\n- NT46 -> 't8'\n- NT36 -> NT56 NT10\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT6\n- And so on.\n\nWait, but not all NTs produce terminals. Some produce non-terminals, and others produce terminals directly.\n\nI need to see which NTs can directly produce the terminals in the string.\n\nLet's look at the required terminals: t36, t91, t120, t62, t111, t135, t91, t89, t58, t80, t40.\n\nI'll check each terminal to see which NTs can produce it.\n\n1. t36: From NT36 -> NT56 NT10. Then NT56 -> NT20 NT8, NT10 -> NT34 (from the grammar). NT34 has a production NT34 -> NT44 NT38 and NT34 -> NT44 NT13. Wait, let me check NT34: Yes, NT34 -> NT44 NT38 and NT44 -> NT38 NT13.\n\nWait, so from NT56: NT56 -> NT20 NT8, and NT20 -> NT38 NT33. NT8 from NT82 (I think NT8 is another NT? Wait, looking back, I see NT8: I think NT8 is part of the productions, but I'm not sure if NT8 -> 't8', but perhaps that's a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the only NTs with terminals are:\n\n- NT46 -> 't8'\n- NT36 -> ...\n- Let me check:\n\nLooking through the production list:\n\nNT6 -> 't54 NT6' and 't58'? Wait, some NTs expand into a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, actually, NT46 is the only NT that has a production directly ending with a terminal 't8'. Others like NT56 and NT36 become non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the productions, for example:\n\nNT55 -> 't15'\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n- NT45 -> 't45'? No, wait, looking at the end of the production list:\n\nNo, wait, looking at the grammar provided, perhaps some NTs directly produce terminals:\n\nWait, in the end, I see some productions that end with terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-227","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t53 t120 t80 t63 t41 t120 t4 t87 t66 t109 t70 t41`. \n\nFirst, I'm a bit rusty on how CNF grammars work, but I remember that CNF grammars have productions that either produce a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that it's defined with various productions. The start symbol is S, which produces NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. Each of these non-terminals then have their own productions. My task is to follow the possible derivations from S and see if the string can be generated.\n\nThe string consists of several tokens separated by spaces, all of which appear to be terminals that match those in the grammar. For example, t53, t120, etc., are terminals, and I need to check if these can be generated from the productions.\n\nI'll approach this step by step. Starting from S, let's see what S can produce. The first production is S \u2192 NT1 NT28. Let's consider that path.\n\nNT1 has the production NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. So, substituting that, we'd have S \u2192 NT25 NT17 NT28. Now, looking at NT25, the production is NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. Substituting, S \u2192 NT6 NT31 NT17 NT28.\n\nContinuing, NT6 can produce either a terminal or further non-terminals. In the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which suggests it can produce two NTs. The other option for NT6 is when it's a terminal, but looking at the provided productions, I see that NT6 can also produce t54 NT6 or when combined with others. Wait, actually, in the list, there's `NT6 -> NT54 NT6` and also a production `NT32 -> NT15 NT13` which is not directly related here.\n\nAlternatively, I might be looking for where NT6 directly produces a terminal. Wait, in the provided grammar, I notice that NT6 has `NT6 -> 't58'`, so it can produce t58 as a terminal. So, going back, S \u2192 NT6 NT31 NT17 NT28. If NT6 becomes t58, then S produces t58 NT31 NT17 NT28.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe I should trace the entire string as a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, since the string starts with t53, I should see which non-terminal can produce t53 as a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT directly producing t53 in the initial productions except in the production `NT46 -> NT27 NT28`, which then in further productions leads to t53 (since NT27 \u2192 t27 is mentioned, and NT28 \u2192 t97, but that might not be the case. Wait, no, looking more carefully, I see `NT46 -> 't8'`, `NT47 -> 't3'`, and others. There's a production `NT56 -> 't112'`, `NT47 -> 't41'`, and `NT28 -> 't76'`, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions where a terminal appears:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t76\n- NT16 \u2192 t83\n- NT34 \u2192 t37\n- NT44 \u2192 t114\n- NT24 \u2192 t122\n- NT46 \u2192 t76, t112, t134\n- NT17 \u2192 t24, t94, t79 (multiple times)\n- NT56 \u2192 t112, t102, etc. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see several productions where a terminal is used directly. For example:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't8', meaning it can produce terminal t8 directly.\n- NT28 \u2192 't76' or could be t8 or something else? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the provided list, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6, NT28 \u2192 't76' (is this correct? No, looking more carefully, in the grammar list, I see entries like `NT28 -> NT4 NT6` and `NT28 -> 't97'` perhaps? Wait, no, let me be precise.\n\nGoing through each production, I notice:\n\n- `NT28 -> NT4 NT6`\n- `NT28 -> 't97'` (is that for NT28?) Or is it looking at production lines where NT28 is on the left?\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT28 is on the left in several productions, the relevant ones are:\n\n- `NT28 -> NT4 NT6`\n- `NT28 -> 't97'` (this must be a terminal production for NT28, producing 't97')\n- `NT28 -> 't76'` (another terminal production, but I don't see it in the list. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the provided list, lines starting with NT28 are:\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT6\nNT28 -> 't97'\nWait, but perhaps the 't8' is under NT46.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, for NT28, the only terminal is 't97'. So NT28 can produce either NT4 NT6 or 't97'.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 has several entries:\n\nNT46 -> NT20 NT8\nNT46 -> 't8'\nNT46 -> 't112'\nNT46 -> 't76'\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I find:\n\nNT46 -> 't8'\nNT46 -> 't112'\nNT46 -> 't134'\nAnd in other parts:\nNT46 has other productions, but the terminals are 't8', 't112', 't134'.\n\nWait no, let me check the full list:\n\nLooking through each line, I spot:\n\n- NT28 is on the left in lines where it has productions:\n  1. NT28 -> NT4 NT6\n  2. NT28 -> 't97'\n\nSimilarly, NT46 has:\n- NT46 -> NT20 NT8\n- NT46 -> 't8'\n- NT46 -> 't134'\n- NT46 -> 't76'\n\nSo NT46 can produce 't8', 't134', or 't76' as well as NT20 NT8.\n\nNow, the string starts with t53, which I need to see how it can be generated.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that only NT46 can produce t53? Because in the production list, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT35 -> 't53'\nBecause in the provided productions, there's NT35 \u2192 't53' which is a terminal production.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I find:\n\nNT35 -> 't53', so NT35 can produce 't53'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at where NT53 appears in productions, but perhaps that's a non-terminal. Wait, but is there a production for NT53?\n\nIn the list, I see:\n\n- NT53 -> 't105'\nNT53 -> 't17'\nSo NT53 can produce these terminals, but it can also produce NT44 NT55, as in `NT53 -> NT44 NT55`\n\nSo, to produce t53, the path must be through NT35 \u2192 't53'.\n\nSo, starting from S, can I derive the string by replacing the start symbol through NT35?\n\nLet's try to see:\n\n- The string starts with t53, so the first part of the derivation must involve NT35 \u2192 't53'\n\nNow, how does NT35 appear? Looking at the grammar, NT35 appears on the left in the production NT53 -> NT44 NT55 and also production NT35 \u2192 't105' and NT35 \u2192 't17'.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, looking for NT35 on the left, it's in NT53's production. So NT35 is a non-terminal that can produce T105, T17, or be involved in other productions where NT35 is on the left. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has several NT35 entries,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-229","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is \"t2 t102 t28 t31 t41 t112 t1 t4 t84 t63 t70 t116\".\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means. In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Importantly, there are no \u03b5-productions (productions that produce an empty string) in CNF. The given grammar seems to fit this since all the productions except for some that end with a single terminal (like NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3) are in the form of two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, NT46 \u2192 't8' is a production that's just a terminal, as is NT45 \u2192 't87', etc. So those would correspond to terminals.\n\nNext, I need to parse the given string against this grammar. The string is a series of terminals separated by spaces, so I have: t2, t102, t28, t31, t41, t112, t1, t4, t84, t63, t70, t116.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation would produce this string as a sequence of non-terminals breaking down into terminals. Each step would involve replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we reach terminals. But since some rules produce a single terminal, those are the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S. The string is a concatenation of terminals, so each terminal must come from a production that directly produces that terminal or via a chain of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that rules like S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So S produces two non-terminals, which then need to produce the sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me see what NT1 and NT28 produce. From NT1, it seems to have production NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT15, and NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which is a bit circular. Wait, maybe I should look at the rules for NT1. The production for NT1 is only one: NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. So NT1 becomes NT25 and NT17.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 can be broken down into multiple steps. Let me look at the rules:\n\nNT28 can go to NT4 NT6 (from NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6) or NT28 \u2192 NT8 NT8.\n\nWait, I need to see what the string is. The first few symbols are t2, t102, t28, so maybe that corresponds to some derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to match the string to the grammar. Each step involves choosing a production and expanding the leftmost non-terminal until all non-terminals are expanded into terminals.\n\nLooking at the string's first symbol, t2, I need to find a production that can produce t2. Looking through the grammar, I see NT10 \u2192 't2'. So perhaps the derivation starts with a rule that includes NT10.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT50 NT27, then NT50 and NT27 would need to produce parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT50, I see from the grammar that NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT0. Then NT15 has some rules, including a production NT15 \u2192 't93'.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe the string can be matched by a leftmost derivation. Let me try to see if each part of the string can be linked to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down parsing approach would be better. Starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet's look at the string: t2 t102 t28 t31 t41 t112 t1 t4 t84 t63 t70 t116.\n\nIf I start with S \u2192 NT1 NT28. Then, S becomes NT1 NT28. The string starts with t2, so perhaps NT28 is producing the first part of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I can reverse the approach. Let's see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the string, the first terminal is t2. Let's see which NTs produce t2. From the grammar, NT10 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo maybe in a derivation, a non-terminal that becomes NT10 would produce t2.\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence is such that a derivation leads to NT10 being the first to produce t2. Let's try to think backwards.\n\nThe string is a concatenation of 12 terminals. So, in a leftmost derivation, the number of productions would be 12 - 1 = 11, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, each terminal corresponds to a production that's applied a certain number of times.\n\nWait, in CNF, each step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, and so on until the leaves are terminals. So, the derivation of the string would require multiple steps where non-terminals are broken down into more non-terminals until they finally produce terminals.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet me see the string: t2 t102 t28 t31 t41 t112 t1 t4 t84 t63 t70 t116\n\nLooking at t2, which comes from NT10. So perhaps somewhere in the derivation, NT10 is used. NT10's production is NT10 \u2192 NT15 NT50.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, NT10 \u2192 't2' directly, so NT10 is a non-terminal that can produce 't2'. So if in the derivation, we have NT10, it can be expanded to 't2'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at t102, which could come from NT27 because from the grammar, NT27 has a production to 't102'. Let me check:\n\nLooking for a production that produces 't102', I see that NT27 can go to NT26 NT14, or NT18 is not mentioned, but looking at NT27, in the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, wait, looking at the grammar, some produce t's. So for example, NT27 \u2192 't102'. So NT27 can produce t102 directly. Hmm, no. Let me check: the grammar includes NT27 \u2192 NT16 NT45, NT27 \u2192 NT45 NT24, NT27 \u2192 NT8 NT34, etc. Wait, from the given grammar, looking at NT27, I see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT26 NT14 or NT27 \u2192 NT16 NT45, etc. Wait, none of these directly produce t102. Wait, no, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, production rules are all up to 'NT46 \u2192 't87' etc. So I see that some non-terminals produce a terminal, like NT45 \u2192 't87', NT46 \u2192 't87', etc. So for example, NT45 \u2192 't87', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps to find the part of the string that corresponds to t102, I need to see which NT can produce t102.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT27 \u2192 NT26 NT14 (so that might not directly produce t102), but perhaps else where.\n\nWait, looking more closely, let me see each production that ends in a terminal. For example, NT27 \u2192 't70'... wait, no, check each NT:\n\nLooking in the grammar:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't105'\n- NT46 \u2192 't112'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT41 \u2192 't41' ... Wait, no, some NTs go to terminals. For example:\n\nLooking for NT that have a production to 't102':\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT36, etc., but in the grammar provided, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't102' except maybe one of the terminals.

S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nI'll consider each option to see if they can generate parts of the string.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n- NT1 is derived from: NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT28 has two productions: NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 or NT28 \u2192 t94 (since in the given CFG, NT28 can now produce t94, as per the provided rules)\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT1 NT28, then the first part would be NT1 (which could produce something) and NT28. But looking at the string, the first symbol is t100. So let's see if t100 can be produced directly.\n\nLooking through the CFG, t100 is a terminal produced by NT56 \u2192 t112 and NT35 \u2192 't102', etc. Wait, but in the provided rules, some terminals are 't' followed by numbers. So maybe the string's symbols are directly from these productions.\n\nWait, actually, the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers like t100, t45, etc. So each 't' is a terminal, and their numbers correspond to the 'tN' productions in the CFG.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so I need to see if this sequence can be formed by the CFG.\n\nAnother approach is to reconstruct the parse tree. Let me look at the first symbol, t100, and see which production can produce it.\n\nLooking through the CFG, t100 is produced by NT53 \u2192 t102, but that's not t100. Wait, let me check all terminal productions:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't53'\n- NT47 \u2192 't40'\n- NT46 \u2192 t8 (so 't8')\n- NT41 \u2192 't24'\n- NT53 \u2192 't105'\n- NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT26 \u2192 't98'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- NT32 \u2192 't66' (so 't66' is produced by NT32)\nWait, the string starts with t66, so looking for NT32 \u2192 't66' yes. So the first symbol can be produced by NT32.\n\nWait, but in my analysis above, the string's first symbol is t100, which I'm seeing in the CFG, where does t100 come from? Let me look again:\n\nLooking through the CFG, I don't see any NT that produces 't100'. For example, looking at the list:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't53'\n- NT47 \u2192 't40'\n- NT46 \u2192 't8' etc.\n\nHmm, there's no 't100' directly, but maybe it's produced by a chain of productions. For example, NT6 \u2192 't58', not 100. Let's see:\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce 't100' directly. It doesn't appear in the terminal productions provided. Wait, the CFG may not have 't100' as a production; perhaps the string contains a symbol that's not generated by the grammar, which would mean the answer is No.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t100. If the CFG doesn't have any production that can generate 't100', then the string is invalid.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions provided, I don't see any NT that produces 't100'. Therefore, the grammar doesn't have a production for 't100' as a terminal symbol.\n\nSo the string cannot be generated because it contains a terminal symbol that the grammar doesn't produce.\n\nBut wait, I might have missed something. Let me double-check the terminal productions. I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT32 \u2192 't66'\n- NT46 \u2192 't8' etc.\n\nHmm, no 't100' is listed.

{"custom_id":"request-242","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to analyze the structure of the string.\n\nThe given string is: `t123 t108 t105 t16 t107 t82 t73 t3 t124 t58 t79 t107 t116`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with several 't' tokens, and according to the grammar, some of these terminals correspond to specific productions. For example, looking at the grammar, NT14 is defined as 't79' and NT20 is 't2'. Wait, but in the string, one of the tokens is 't123' and another is 't73'.\n\nLet me go through the grammar and see what the terminals are. I see that NT32 is 't66', which isn't in the string, but other non-terminals have terminals like 't123', 't105', etc. \n\nWait, actually, the grammar seems to have some interesting productions where non-terminals are assigned to 't' tokens with specific numbers. For example, NT17 is defined as 't94', but the string has 't123', which might derive from a different non-terminal.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules more carefully. The main start symbol is S, which can produce S NT1 NT28 or S NT50 NT27. Both of these are S followed by two non-terminals.\n\nEach non-terminal is defined in terms of other non-terminals until we get to certain points where a non-terminal is defined as a single terminal, like NT36 is 't87', or NT3 is 't6'.\n\nI think the approach here is to break down the string into tokens and see if each sequence can be derived from the grammar. The first token is 't123', which probably comes from NT123 or a non-terminal that can produce 't123'. But looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't123', but maybe it's derived through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again. I should look for any rule that defines a non-terminal which directly or indirectly leads to a terminal 't123'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see any non-terminal that is 't123'. But wait, rule NT33 is 't79', and NT17 is 't94', but that's not helping. Hmm. Maybe the string 't123' is produced by a non-terminal that eventually leads to a 't123' through a series of derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built from the start S by choosing productions and eventually leading to the given string. Let me think of the structure.\n\nThe string starts with 't123', which must be the result of some derivation starting from S. Since S can produce S NT1 NT28 or S NT50 NT27, but those are S followed by other non-terminals. Wait, that can't be right. Looking again, actually, the rules start with S->NT1 NT28 or S->NT50 NT27. So the initial expansion is S generating two non-terminals, not starting with S again.\n\nWait, I think I misread that. The rules for S are S->NT1 NT28 and S->NT50 NT27, which means the initial production is two non-terminals, NT1 and NT28, or NT50 and NT27. So the string is built from the start as NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify. The grammar is in CNF, so each production is a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right. So S-> NT1 NT28 and S-> NT50 NT27. So the start symbol S produces two non-terminals. That means the string must be a sequence where the first two tokens are the results of these non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the given string is a list of terminal tokens: t123, t108, t105, etc. So each of these must be the result of the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nSo, for example, the first production S->NT1 NT28 implies that NT1 and NT28 will produce a series of terminals, which together form the string. Similarly for S->NT50 NT27.\n\nSo the given string must be the concatenation of the strings derived from NT1 and NT28, or NT50 and NT27.\n\nNow, let me look at the string: t123 t108 t105 t16 t107 t82 t73 t3 t124 t58 t79 t107 t116.\n\nThat's 13 tokens. Wait, but if S->NT1 NT28, then the string should be the combination of what NT1 produces and NT28 produces. Similarly, for the other production. So each side is a subtree, but the entire string is a concatenation of the two.\n\nSo, let's consider whether the string can be split into two parts, one being the expansion of NT1 and the other the expansion of NT28. But given that the entire string is t123 followed by t108 t105 etc., maybe it's one big expansion, but wait, that's not how the grammar works. The S production is two non-terminals, so the entire parse tree would consist of two branches, each from NT1 and NT28, resulting in two separate strings, which are then concatenated.\n\nWait, but the given string is just a single string of tokens, so it's the concatenation of the two derived strings. Therefore, the entire string should be the concatenation of the strings from NT1 and NT28.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for any non-terminals in the grammar that produce the 't' tokens. Let's scan through all the non-terminals and their corresponding terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see many non-terminals that output specific 't' strings. For example, NT36 is 't87', NT6 is 't54', NT3 is 't6', NT13 is 't16', and so on. But none of them directly output 't123', 't108', etc.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Most of the rules don't output any terminal except for specific ones. Let me list out all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT13 -> 't16'\n- NT7 -> 't79', 't93', 't97', etc.\n- NT23 -> 't58'\n- NT28 -> 't8', 't76'\n- NT29 -> 't48', 't116'\n- NT3 -> 't6', 't37', 't124'\n- NT7 -> 't6'\n- NT22 -> 't40', 't58', 't128', etc.\n- NT24 -> 't62', 't102', 't11', etc.\n- NT27 -> 't24', 't107', 't116'\n- NT6 -> 't58', 't62', 't76', 't119', etc.\n- NT1 -> 't5', etc.\n\nThis shows that most of the non-terminals produce single 't' tokens, but not all. So, for a string like 't123', the only way it can be produced is if the non-terminal that produces 't123' is in the grammar, but looking through the rules, I don't see any rule that assigns a production to a non-terminal resulting in 't123'. \n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed something. Let me scan again. Scanning each line, do any of the non-terminals on the left equal to 't123'? Looking at the entire set, there's a line NT35 -> 't105' and NT33 -> 't79', but nothing for 't123'.\n\nSo, unless the grammar has a non-terminal that somehow can derive 't123' through some chain, which seems unlikely given the CNF structure, this 't123' would not be in the language. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is a sequence of 't's that can be produced by other non-terminals. Let me think about how the string can be built.\n\nSuppose S->NT1 NT28. Then NT1 produces a part of the string, and NT28 produces the other part. For NT1, let's see what rule it might have. Looking at the rules, NT1 is defined as NT25 NT17."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So each production in the grammar seems to follow this structure, so it's in CNF.\n\nNow, my task is to check if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions. The string is a sequence of terminals, which in this case are strings of the form 'tXXXX' where X is digits. Each 't' seems to represent a terminal symbol.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to reconstruct a parse tree from the string backwards, starting from the root (S) and seeing if the leaves match the string. Essentially, I can use the method of checking if the string can be derived by checking the sequence of terminals.\n\nThe grammar's rules include both non-terminals (NTs) and terminals. Each production for an NT splits into two other symbols (could be NTs or terminals). So the string `t63 t94 t1 t3 t63 t80 t97 t123 t14 t83 t78 t73 t134 t94` is a series of terminals, so I need to see if this can result from a series of splits according to the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is finite and the string is quite long, it might help to see if there's a pattern or if certain terminals can only appear as leaves in the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to see if the string can be built by applying the productions step by step.\n\nBut given the complexity, it might be easier to look for a step-by-step approach or perhaps find if there's a way to break down the string into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nAnother idea is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form. The CYK algorithm works by checking the grammar's productions for each substring of the input string and determining if it can be generated by non-terminals that can be derived from the beginning of the string.\n\nGiven the string has 14 symbols, applying the CYK algorithm would require considering all possible substrings and the possible non-terminals that can produce them. This seems time-consuming, but perhaps I can find a pattern or specific production rules that might generate the string.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the string, all symbols are terminals, so the string must be a sequence of productions that split into the given terminals.\n\nLet me see if the first symbol is 't63'. So starting from S, which goes to NT1 NT10. Alternatively, S could go to NT50 NT27, etc. But to get 't63', I need to see if any of these productions can split into 't63' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT7 \u2192 t93 and t79, among others. Wait, the production for NT7 is listed twice: `NT7 -> NT39` and another `NT7 -> t79`. Wait, is that correct? Let me look again.\n\nI see that in the grammar, under the NTs, there are some rules where a non-terminal is split into two, and others that have a terminal followed by symbols. Wait, looking at NT7's rules: I see `NT7 -> t93` and `NT7 -> t79`. So in the grammar, NT7 can produce t93 and t79 as single terminals. So 't79' is a terminal that NT7 can produce.\n\nLooking at the string's first symbol is 't63'. So, I need a production that can produce 't63'. Let's check if any non-terminal in the grammar can produce 't63'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT27 \u2192 t124, which is a terminal, but also, NT27 has another production: `NT27 -> NT20 NT50`. Similarly, NT47 has some rules. Let me see: I don't see NT6 producing 't63' directly. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see multiple rules where NTs produce terminals, such as NT7, NT4, NT24, etc.\n\nWait, I think I see that NT17 \u2192 t94, which is another terminal. So in the string, the second symbol is 't94', which would be directly produced by NT17. So that might be a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, perhaps it's best to reconstruct possible splits. Since it's a CNF grammar, each split would result in two terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree from the string backwards.\n\nThe string is: t63, t94, t1, t3, t63, t80, t97, t123, t14, t83, t78, t73, t134, t94.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is 't94'. So looking for NTs that can produce 't94'. From the grammar, I see that NT17 \u2192 t94, right? Let me check: yes, under NT17's rules, `NT17 -> t94`.\n\nSo the last symbol comes from NT17. Now, what about the second-to-last symbol, which is 't73'? Looking for NTs that produce 't73'. I see that NT17 also produces t74? Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see that NT74 isn't in the grammar. Wait, perhaps I need to look again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NTs, I see NT17 \u2192 t94. There's also NT67 and other numbers, but I think I need to check if any NTs produce 't73'. Hmm, going through the rules, I don't immediately see any NT producing t73. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back, under NT17, it's:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t94\n- Also, perhaps other rules? Maybe I missed it. Let me look again.\n\nIn the grammar, I don't see any other production for NT17 except `NT17 -> t94`. So the second-to-last symbol 't73' must come from an NT that produces 't73'. Wait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me check the entire list.\n\nLooking through the entire list, I don't see any NT producing 't73' except perhaps through some intermediate steps. Alternatively, maybe 't73' is a non-terminal that's derived from other symbols, but that seems unlikely because in CNF, the only way terminals appear are as single symbols.\n\nWait, this means that unless 't73' is a terminal, it can't appear directly. So in the string provided, 't73' is a terminal, so it must be produced directly by some NT. Let me check the grammar again for any NT that produces 't73'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t93, t79\n- NT4 \u2192 t91\n- NT24 \u2192 t11, t29, t62, t46, t84, etc.\n- NT35 \u2192 t69, t36, etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 t94, t24? Wait, no, let me see.\n\nAh, under NT17, I see: `NT17 -> t24 NT53` and `NT17 -> t94`. So NT17 can produce t24 as a terminal. But is t24 a terminal or a non-terminal? Because a rule starting with a terminal would just produce that terminal. So 't24' is a terminal. Therefore, the rule NT17 \u2192 t24 would produce 't24' directly.\n\nSo if the string has 't73' as a terminal, we must find a non-terminal that can produce it directly.\n\nLooking through the grammar again, I see NT67: no, it's not there.

{"custom_id":"request-267","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string we're checking.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My task is to see if the string 't105 t50 t58 t34 t70 t24 t21 t65 t66 t11 t76 t135 t94 t102' can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S and the possible productions. The grammar has two initial productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. Let's check the string: it starts with 't105 t50', which corresponds to S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nThat means the first part of the string should be NT50 and the second part should be NT27. Let's see what NT50 and NT27 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, both NT50 and NT27 have productions. Let's list their options:\n\nFor NT50:\n- NT50 \u2192 NT6 NT46 (from production NT50)\n- NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT50 (left recursion, but can be handled)\n- NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT15 (if applicable, but I think the productions don\u2019t show this)\nWait, looking back, NT50\u2019s productions are in the grammar. From the given rules, looking for NT50, I see:\n\nNT50:\n- NT50 \u2192 NT6 NT46\n- NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT50\n- Also, I notice a rule NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT15 somewhere? Wait, let me check. Yes, under NT50: 't50' \u2192 't53' seems not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at all the rules and see how NT50 is derived. From the given grammar, looking for NT50, the production is NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT50 and NT50 \u2192 NT6 NT46. So, NT50 can be directly derived as NT15 NT50 or NT6 NT46.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 has these productions:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT27\n\nSo, the string starts with NT50, which is 't50', and then NT27, 't27'.\n\nNow, I need to see if the rest of the string corresponds to the possible derivations from NT50 and NT27.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t105 t50 t58 t34 t70 t24 t21 t65 t66 t11 t76 t135 t94 t102\n\nThe first two tokens are 't105' and 't50'. Since 't105' is from NT35 (from the grammar, NT35 \u2192 't105'), and 't50' is from NT50, so the start is correct: S \u2192 NT35 NT50? Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, looking back, the first production for S is NT1 NT28 and the second is NT50 NT27. So S can be NT50 and NT27. Wait, the initial split is S \u2192 NT50 NT27, so the first part is NT50, which is 't50' on the left, but in the string, the first token is 't105'. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's clarify.\n\nThe first option for S is S \u2192 NT1 NT28. NT1 generates 't84', and NT28 generates 't76' because in the grammar, NT28 \u2192 't76' right away. So S via this route would start with 't84 t76'. But in the string, the first part is 't105 t50', which comes from S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So 't50' from NT50 and 't27' from NT27.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't105 t50', which would imply NT35 produces 't105' and NT50 produces 't50'. But wait, no. S's options are NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So the string's first two tokens should be either NT35 NT28 or NT50 NT27. But the string's first two tokens are 't105 t50', which would be NT35 and NT50, but according to the grammar, S's options are NT1 NT28 (which starts with NT1) or NT50 NT27 (which would be NT50, but the starting token is 't50' which would require NT50's production to be 't105').\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing rules. Let's get back.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the initial option for S is S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So the first part of the string should be NT1, which according to the grammar has a production NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. Additionally, looking at the NT1 production: under NT1, the rule is NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. And NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31, and NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which seems like it could produce a terminal string, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string's first token 't105', which came from NT35 (as per the grammar rules: NT35 \u2192 't105') so how does that fit into the production for S?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the initial S is producing via another route. Let's look at the entire grammar and see if 't105' is a terminal generated by any NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see rules like:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't105'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't42'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't91'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't19'\n\nOther NTs like NT7, NT13, etc., have terminals too.\n\nSo 't105' is directly a terminal from NT35. So the first part of the string is 't105', which is a terminal, so that must come from NT35.\n\nThen, since the start symbol is S, the start production is S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nBut in the string, S is supposed to produce two NTs, either NT1 and NT28, or NT50 and NT27.\n\nWait, that's conflicting because the first token is 't105' which is from NT35, but in the production for S, the first part is either NT1 or NT50.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the initial assumption that the string is produced by S \u2192 NT50 NT27 is incorrect because the string starts with NT35, which is a terminal, meaning that 't105' is generated directly, implying that S must be generating a chain where one of the NTs eventually produces 't105'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe start symbol S has productions S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. The string starts with 't105 t50', which suggests that the first part is NT35 (since NT35 \u2192 't105') and the second part is NT50 (as 't50' is from NT50). But S's productions don't directly split into NT35; S's first component is either NT1 or NT50. So unless NT1 and NT50 can produce 't105', which seems impossible because NT35 is a separate NT.\n\nWait a second, maybe the start production isn't directly S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Or perhaps the grammar is structured such that a single NT can appear in the production. Alternatively, perhaps I got the productions wrong.\n\nWait, actually, the initial productions for S are S \u2192 NT1 NT28 and S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So the first component of S's production is either NT1 or NT50. Therefore, the string must come after expanding these NTs, but if the first token is 't105', which comes from NT35, then that NT35 must somehow be part of the first component of S's production.\n\nBut according to S's production, it can only generate NT1 or NT50, not NT35.

That simplifies things because the derivation tree corresponds directly to the parse tree, and the string's length can help determine possible steps.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it starts with `t53`, which is a terminal. From the grammar, I should check which non-terminals can produce `t53` directly. Scanning down, I see two productions where `t53` is on the right side: one under NT47 and another under NT17 and NT7. \n\nWait, in the grammar, I see the production NT47 \u2192 t3 and NT17 \u2192 t94. There's also a production NT27 \u2192 t124 which might not be relevant here. Hmm, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong parts. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait a minute, actually, the grammar's rules include some where terminals are directly written. For example, NT24 \u2192 t29, NT56 \u2192 t112, NT3 \u2192 t42, etc. There are a lot of these. But in the given string, I see several `t` terms, so I need to see if those `t` terms are derived from terminals.\n\nI think a better approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S. S is defined as S \u2192 NT1 NT28 and S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So, the first step is to split the string into components that might correspond to NT1 and NT28, or NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, which is 17 tokens long (including spaces), but since each step in the grammar produces exactly two non-terminals, the number of symbols should double each time, starting from 2 to 4, 8, etc. 17 is an odd number, which seems suspicious. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount: \n\nLooking at the string: `t53 t93 t80 t117 t19 t84 t94 t19 t11 t119 t112 t135 t114 t27 t81`. That's 15 symbols, which is odd. In a binary tree, the number of leaves (terminals) should be a power of two if the derivation starts from a single symbol. Since 15 is not a power of two, the string can't be generated by this grammar, which requires an even number of symbols at each step after S.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. The initial S produces two non-terminals, so the first expansion has two parts. Each subsequent expansion doubles the count. For example:\n\n- Level 0: 2 symbols\n- Level 1: 4 symbols\n- Level 2: 8 symbols\n- Level 3: 16 symbols\n- etc.\n\nBut the given string has 15 symbols, which doesn't fit any of these levels. So unless there's a mistake in the counting, the string has an odd number of terms, which suggests it's not a valid expansion from the start symbol, which always produces an even number of symbols. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has a space somewhere, but no, in the input it's clearly 15 terms. So I think the answer is 'No' because the number of symbols is not correct for the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The string is `t53 t93 t80 t117 t19 t84 t94 t19 t11 t119 t112 t135 t114 t27 t81`\u2014that's 15 symbols, right? Let me count: 1. t53, 2. t93, 3. t80, 4. t117, 5. t19, 6. t84, 7. t94, 8. t19, 9. t11, 10. t119, 11. t112, 12. t135, 13. t114, 14. t27, 15. t81. Yep, 15 symbols. Since the grammar's derivation always results in a number of symbols that is a power of two, 15 isn't. So the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed that some non-terminals can produce multiple symbols. But no, CNF requires each production to either be a single terminal or two non-terminals, so each step adds non-terminals, not terminals until the final step. Therefore, the count should strictly be 2^k after k steps.\n\nThus, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-285","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t5 t80 t17 t21 t102 t135 t134 t50 t21 t94 t16 t48 t16 t3 t94`. \n\nFirst, I should remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, it seems all rules are either left-hand side as a single non-terminal and right-hand side as two non-terminals, or some as terminals. Hmm, but wait, in CNF, all productions must have two non-terminals on the right. Oh, but in the given grammar, I see some productions end with a terminal, like NT7 \u2192 't93'. So maybe this isn't strict CNF? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nBut regardless, I need to analyze the string. The string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, and I notice that some of these are terminals, like 't5', 't17', etc., while others seem to be non-terminals since they're part of the NT rules. Wait, how are the NTs handled? Each NT is a non-terminal, and when expanding, we replace them according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list all the NTs:\n\nNT0, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT9, NT10, NT13, NT14, NT15, NT16, NT17, NT19, NT21, NT22, NT24, NT25, NT26, NT27, NT28, NT29, NT32, NT33, NT34, NT35, NT36, NT37, NT38, NT39, NT41, NT42, NT43, NT44, NT45, NT46, NT47, NT48, NT49, NT50, NT53, NT54, NT55, NT56, NT58, etc.\n\nBut the string has t5, t80, t17, etc. Since I'm looking for non-terminals, the 't' followed by numbers are terminals. Wait, no, in the grammar, NTs are non-terminals, and terminals are the ones appearing at the end with 't' and numbers. So in the string, the parts after 't' are terminals or sequences.\n\nSo each 't' followed by a number is a terminal production. Let me see the grammar and see if 't80', 't94', etc., are terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT46 \u2192 't8', 't27', etc. But wait, some rules are like NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13, while others are NT3 \u2192 't6 NT3' or 't42' or similar. So it seems that some non-terminals have terminal productions, like NT7 \u2192 't79', while others produce other non-terminals.\n\nSo each 'tXXX' in the string represents a terminal that can be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar. So, for example, 't5' must be a terminal that appears in the grammar as a terminal production. Looking through the grammar, I see some NTs have 't' followed by numbers as their productions. For instance, NT7 \u2192 't93', NT17 \u2192 't94', etc. So each 'tXXX' in the string is a terminal that the corresponding non-terminal can produce.\n\nNow, the string is `t5 t80 t17 t21 t102 t135 t134 t50 t21 t94 t16 t48 t16 t3 t94`. Each token is a terminal, so the entire string is a sequence of these 't' followed by numbers, which must be generated by expanding the start symbol S = NT1 NT50.\n\nSo, the question is whether the start symbol S can expand into this string through the grammar rules. Since S is a non-terminal, it must expand into other non-terminals until we reach all terminals in the string.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to parse the string according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the recursive descent parsing method or look for the leftmost derivation.\n\nBut to avoid getting stuck, let me try to see if each terminal appears in the grammar. For example, does 't5' exist in the grammar? Let me look through the productions:\n\nLooking at NT5 \u2192 ? Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 't58', NT4 \u2192 't91', NT24 \u2192 't122', NT46 \u2192 't76', etc. Hmm, is there an NT that produces 't5'? Let me go through each production to see if any NT's RHS produces 't5'. \n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT4 \u2192 't91'\n- NT24 \u2192 't122'\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT22 \u2192 't58'\n- NT46 \u2192 't27'\n- NT35 \u2192 't102'\n- NT44 \u2192 't114'\n- NT41 \u2192 't4'\n- NT48 \u2192 't24'\n- NT26 \u2192 't98'\n- NT43 \u2192 't27'\n- NT29 \u2192 't48'\n- NT7 \u2192 't79'\n- NT38 \u2192 't102'\n- NT39 \u2192 't131'\n- NT14 \u2192 't4'\n- NT28 \u2192 't97'\n- NT42 \u2192 't2'\n- NT10 \u2192 't2'\n- NT55 \u2192 't15'\n- NT15 \u2192 't87'\n- NT21 \u2192 't1'\n- NT33 \u2192 't79'\n- NT36 \u2192 't87'\n- NT38 \u2192 't102'\n- NT39 \u2192 't131'\n- NT41 \u2192 't5'\nWait, here's NT41 \u2192 't5'!

Hmm, the CFG is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because that means each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, right? No epsilon productions here, I think. Let me look at the productions. Each rule is either S -> NT1 NT28 or other combinations, except for some that end with a terminal like NT46 -> 't8'. So, some of the productions have terminals, which means the language includes terminal strings, not just non-terminals. That makes sense because the string we're testing has terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to test is: `t40 t91 t131 t52 t24 t70 t14 t73 t59 t19 t69 t128 t83 t84 t41 t52`.\n\nEach token is a terminal, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.

Let me see NT35: the rules are NT35 -> NT10 NT38 and NT6 -> 't54'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by working backwards from the string. Each terminal in the string must be produced by a specific production rule.\n\nThe string starts with 't40', so the first symbol is from some NT that directly produces 't40'.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, NT54 -> 't81' and NT35 -> 't10' and 't38', but not 't40'. Hmm. Maybe I need to build a tree starting from the string and see if it can be reduced down to S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see which NTs can produce each of the tokens, working from the first symbol back.\n\nLet's list all the 't's with their numbers:\n\n1. t40\n2. t91\n3. t131\n4. t52\n5. t24\n6. t70\n7. t14\n8. t73\n9. t59\n10. t19\n11. t69\n12. t128\n13. t83\n14. t84\n15. t41\n16. t52\n\nNow, let's see which NTs can produce each of these.

So maybe we can represent the string as a sequence of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is part of the language if we can break it down into parts that match the rules.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can work recursively. Let's see.\n\nThe string starts with t40, so we need a production that starts with NT-> 't40' somewhere deep in the tree. Alternatively, there must be a production that results in 't40' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking through, perhaps NT40 -> something, but I don't see that. Wait, checking all the production rules for NT40:\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT45 -> 't87', NT41 -> 't52', NT47 -> 't73', etc. Maybe I'm missing NT40. Wait, looking through:\n\nThe rule NT20 -> 't16' is under some rules, but I don't see NT20 producing 't40'. Let me check NT17. NT17's rules are NT17 -> NT44 NT53, NT44->..., so perhaps not. Maybe NT39 -> ... No.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol 't40' is generated by some non-terminal that has a production ending with 't40'.\n\nLooking again through all the NTs, I don't immediately see any rule ending in 't40', except perhaps in more complex derivations, like a chain of productions that eventually produce 't40'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first 't40' comes from a production that eventually depends on a chain leading down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with 't40', and so the root S must have a path where S's first child is an NT that generates 't40' when combined with another NT.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe another approach: look for rules where the left-hand side is an NT that can generate the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can generate 't40' from the start. S branches into two NTs. Let's assume the first symbol is from the first NT.\n\nSo NT1. Looking at NT1's rules: NT1->NT25 NT17, NT9->t19. Wait, but maybe I'm missing some.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT1 can produce multiple possibilities, but without the full rules, it's hard.\n\nAnother approach: count the number of tiles, but not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the sequence is 16 symbols long. Since it's a CFG in CNF, which uses binary trees, the number of symbols should be 2^n -1, but 16 isn't, so maybe some symbols are leaves in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' is a tile that corresponds to a specific number. Maybe some pattern among these numbers can help.\n\nLooking at the string's t's:\n\nt40, t91, t131, t52, t24, t70, t14, t73, t59, t19, t69, t128, t83, t84, t41, t52.\n\nWait, t52 appears twice, so that might be a loop or something.\n\nLooking for patterns: t52 appears at the end as well.

The string is t52 t134 t4 t69 t63 t69 t116 t34 t112 t15 t124 t119 t97 t8 t131 t73. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The starting symbol can only be a non-terminal, and there are no productions with more than two non-terminals on the right side.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to follow CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27, which are two non-terminals each.\n\nThe string starts with t52, which suggests that the starting symbol S must derive through a chain of productions leading to terminals. Since the initial non-terminals are S, which branches into NT1 and NT28, or NT50 and NT27, I'll need to track how the string is built.\n\nI'll break down the string step by step to see if each terminal matches the productions. The string has 16 terminals, so I'll need to find a derivation path that produces exactly these terms in order.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT50 NT27 (let's assume this path)\n   - Now, derive NT50 and NT27.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT50 can go to NT4 and NT6:\n2. NT50 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n3.

Hmm, in the grammar provided, NT35 can go to NT29 NT3 or NT41 NT49, but I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a different approach. Each production in CNF will split each non-terminal into two others or a terminal. So, for the string, each terminal corresponds to a production that terminates with a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the first term t52: which non-terminal leads directly to t52? Looking through the grammar, some non-terminals like NT47 can produce t3, t4, t7, etc., but I need to check if any produce t52 directly. Wait, is there a production where a non-terminal goes directly to t52? No, I don't see any. So perhaps t52 must be part of a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if t52 is a terminal produced by any non-terminal. Looking at the productions, I don't see any NT producing t52, which suggests that t52 must come from an NT production that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, I don't see any production that directly outputs t52. So maybe the string cannot be generated because there's no rule leading to t52, making the entire string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t52 is derived from a chain of rules, but since the grammar doesn't explicitly produce t52, I'm unsure how that would happen. Let me check the entire grammar for any NT that produces t52. Scrolling through the rules, I don't see any NT \u2192 t52. So, perhaps the answer is 'No' because t52 isn't part of any production.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through all non-terminals again. NT47 has productions like NT47 \u2192 NT3 NT22 or NT47 \u2192 NT35 NT54. But no NT seems to directly produce t52. So, without any production for t52, the string can't be generated.

{"custom_id":"request-326","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is given in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The string to check is \"t93 t59 t79 t109 t52 t1 t41 t27 t14 t65 t76 t8 t94 t109 t53 t59 t91\". I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the initial productions are S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So the string must start with either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. Looking at the string, the first two elements are \"t93\" and \"t59\". Wait, but according to the grammar, the first step is either NT1 -> t93 or NT50 -> t50. But I see that \"t93\" is actually NT1's production. So the first part is OK.\n\nNow, moving on. The string has 17 tokens. Let's break it down into pairs as per the grammar. Each production in CNF splits the string into a series of terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t93, t59, t79, t109, t52, t1, t41, t27, t14, t65, t76, t8, t94, t109, t53, t59, t91.\n\nI'll need to parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial S \u2192 NT1 NT28, so we have t93 (from NT1) and then need to find NT28. NT28's production is NT4 NT6. So the first two steps are t93, then t4 and t6.\n\nLet's see: t4 is in the string. So after t93, t4 should come. Looking for t4: but the string after t93 is t59, t79, etc. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider each production step and see how the string can be processed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a combination of multiple productions, so I'll need to track how each part is derived.\n\nLet me list the terminals: t93, t59, t79, t109, t52, t1, t41, t27, t14, t65, t76, t8, t94, t109, t53, t59, t91.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see if any terminals correspond to NT1, NT50, etc.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT1 \u2192 t25 (Looking back, the grammar says NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT1's productions. Wait, I think I might have misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNo, wait. The grammar is a list of productions, each starting with a left-hand side (LHS) and then the right-hand side (RHS). The productions for NT1, for example, are in the middle. Let me parse the grammar more carefully.\n\nFrom the given grammar lines:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT49 NT14\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT1 \u2192 t69 (looking at the lines where NT1 is on the RHS)\n\nWait, actually, the grammar has some productions where terminals are directly listed, like:\n\nNT46 \u2192 t8\n\nNT17 \u2192 t94\n\nNT7 \u2192 t97\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58\n\nWait, hold on. Looking through the entire grammar, I see multiple lines where a production ends with a terminal, like NT46 \u2192 t8, NT17 \u2192 t94, NT7 \u2192 t97, etc. So these are production rules where the LHS is a non-terminal that directly produces that terminal.\n\nSo each of these lines from the grammar is a production rule where A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nNT46 \u2192 t8\n\nNT17 \u2192 t94\n\nNT7 \u2192 t97\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, so each step in the derivation must involve reducing a part of the string using these rules.\n\nLet me try to process the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt93, t59, t79, t109, t52, t1, t41, t27, t14, t65, t76, t8, t94, t109, t53, t59, t91.\n\nI'll start by checking what could derive these in order.\n\nThe first step is S. From S, we can go to NT1 NT28.\n\nSo the string starts with t93 and then the production for NT28.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6.\n\nSo after t93, next should be t4 and t6.\n\nLooking at the string: after t93, the next is t59, then t79. So t59 is not t4 or t6, which suggests that this path might not be the right one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should consider S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nSo the first two tokens would be NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the production for NT50: NT50 \u2192 t12 (from NT50 \u2192 t42? Wait, no. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, let me find NT50's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT20 NT36\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT42 NT35\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT38 NT13\n\nI see that at line: NT33 \u2192 NT6 NT3, and earlier, NT3 is defined as \u2192 NT6 NT3. Hmm, but NT6's production is NT6 \u2192 t58.\n\nWait, looking deeper, NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3, and NT3 is \u2192 NT6 NT3, but NT6 \u2192 t58.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confused. Let me list all the terminal productions to see which terminals are possible.\n\nFrom the grammar, the lines ending with terminals are these:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 t8\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t94\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t97\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t58\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't87'\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't105'\n\n- NT37 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t97 (duplicate)\n\n- NT46 \u2192 t8 (also duplicates with another NT46 \u2192 t8)\n\nWait, perhaps the lines are:\n\nLooking for all the RHS that are terminals:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 t8\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t94\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t97\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t58\n\n- NT45 \u2192 t87 (probably)\n\n- NT35 \u2192 t105\n\n- NT37 \u2192 t17\n\n- NT53 \u2192 t102\n\n- NT56 \u2192 t112\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's not just a list. Let me check each production:\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for those that produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10 \u2192 and NT56's production is \u2192 t112, so NT36 \u2192 t112 NT10.\n\nBut no, wait. Let me think differently. The way the problem is presented is with multiple lines, each being a production where the LHS can produce the RHS. So for example, NT46 \u2192 t8, which is a direct production.\n\nSo the terminals in the grammar are:\n\nt8, t94, t97, t58, t87, t105, t17, t102 (from NT53 \u2192 t102), t112 (from NT56 \u2192 t112), t53 (from NT46 \u2192 t53?), wait no, looking again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with multiple lines, each being a production. Let me parse them:\n\n- S -> NT1 NT28\n\n- S -> NT50 NT27\n\n- NT36 -> NT56 NT10\n\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT6\n\n- NT16 -> NT10 NT34\n\n- NT32 -> NT15 NT13\n\n- NT17 -> NT44 NT53\n\n- NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-324","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that most of the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Wait, for example, NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6, which is two non-terminals, and NT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50, also two non-terminals. Some have terminals like NT41 \u2192 NT42 NT35\u2014those would expand into terminals and non-terminals. But I think in standard CNF, the RHS shouldn't have both non-terminals and terminals, unless it's allowed to have a single terminal, which is okay as A \u2192 a.\n\nBut wait, the productions given have some that have two terminals, like NT41 \u2192 NT42 NT35, but in reality, they're all non-terminals except the terminals are on the RHS as single symbols. Wait, no, the grammar has terms like 't93', 't102', etc., which are terminals. So the grammar is actually a mix of left-hand sides being non-terminals and right-hand sides being terminals and non-terminals. So it's not exactly in pure CNF, but maybe it's a combined form. Hmm, but perhaps that's fine for our purposes.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t135 t120 t119 t93 t3 t112 t29 t45 t122 t50 t28 t48 t111 t117 t117 t2 t65 t126 t89 t89`. I need to see if this can be derived from the grammar.\n\nEach symbol in the string is a terminal, so the derivation should start from the start symbol S and replace non-terminals step by step until only terminals are left, matching the string.\n\nThe string has 20 terms. Let's count: t135, t120, t119, t93, t3, t112, t29, t45, t122, t50, t28, t48, t111, t117, t117, t2, t65, t126, t89, t89. That's 20 symbols.\n\nTo parse this, I need to look for possible leftmost derivations or find a way to split the string into parts that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, which can go to NT1 NT28 (two options: NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27). Alternatively, looking at the options, S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Wait, the grammar is presented with multiple rules. So S can go to NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27, both of which are two non-terminals. So the initial step would produce two parts: first part from NT1, second from NT28, or first from NT50 and second from NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, which is a linear sequence of terms, so the first two terms would come from NT1 and NT28, or the first from NT50 and the second from NT27.\n\nLet me check what NT1 and NT28 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n\nWait, NT28 leads to two non-terminals, NT4 and NT6. Then, moving further down:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15\nNT21 \u2192 NT37 NT20\nNT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15\nNT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17\nNT20 \u2192 NT38 NT33\nNT33 \u2192 NT28 NT15\nWait, that seems like an infinite loop, but eventually, perhaps it resolves via other rules.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string back to the grammar. Since the string is 20 terms, each production in the grammar either adds two terms or a terminal. But perhaps the most straightforward way is to try to find a way to split the string into parts that can be generated by the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a top-down parsing approach, starting with S and seeing if it can expand into the first few terms of the string.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So the first two symbols in the string should be from NT1 and NT28's derivations.\n\nLooking at the string: first term is t135. So let's see what NT1 can produce. NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nLooking deeper: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to look at each possible symbol in the string and see if it can be derived from any non-terminal.\n\nWait, another approach: the string must be a series of terminal symbols, so each part of the string must come from a path in the grammar tree.\n\nLooking for the start symbol S, which branches into two non-terminals. Each of these two must then derive into their respective parts of the string.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is t135. So we need to see if t135 can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT15 \u2192 't42' and 't48' (I think). Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't48 NT15'? Wait, no. Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Looking back at the provided rules, I notice that some rules have 't's, like:\n\nNT35 \u2192 't102'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't79, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list the rules that produce terminals. Let me go through each line and pick out the ones that produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 \u2192 no terminals.\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT79 \u2192 looking for 't' sequences.\n\nWait, here's a rule: NT41 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, so NT41 can produce 't2' as a terminal. Similarly, NT15 \u2192 't79'?\n\nWait, I see NT37 \u2192 't17', and NT15 \u2192 't50'?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the rules that lead to terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, no, in the rules provided, the 't's are for certain nt's.\n\nHere's a list of all rules that produce terminals (they have 't' followed by a number):\n\n1. NT28 \u2192 ... wait no, looking through all the rules:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the provided rules:\n\nNT35 \u2192 't102'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't87'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't102'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't112'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't114'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't124'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't76'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't79 etc. Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, looking at the provided rules, the ones that end with 't' are:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't105'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't19'\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't48'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't69'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't81'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't79'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't19'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't7'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't102'\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. The provided grammar has some rules where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example, NT35 \u2192 't105'. That means that non-terminal NT35 can produce the terminal 't105'.\n\nSo looking through all the rules, the NTs that can derive terminals are:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't19'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't79'\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't48'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't69'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT54 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-341","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A CFG is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Importantly, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production except possibly the ones leading to terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see multiple production rules. Each production seems to be either a non-terminal breaking down into two other non-terminals or into a terminal. For example, the first rule is S \u2192 NT1 NT11\u2014wait, no, actually looking closer, all the productions are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ or NTX \u2192 't...'. So each production either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal string. That confirms it's in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t63 t89 t2 t4 t114 t116 t119 t114 t38 t123 t82 t94 t8 t58 t73 t11 t45 t15`. It looks like it's a sequence of terminals. Note that in the grammar, some production rules directly produce terminals (e.g., NT44 \u2192 't89', some NTs produce other terminals), but most produce more non-terminals.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, my job is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I can model the process of generating the string by starting from the start symbol S and applying productions step by step until we reach the terminal string, ensuring all non-terminals are expanded appropriately.\n\nBut since the production rules are quite extensive and the string is long (20 tokens), it's impractical to go through all possible derivations manually. Instead, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string against the grammar, ensuring that each terminal in the string corresponds to a valid production chain starting from the top.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree from the string, verifying at each step that the grammar allows it. Let me consider the string as a sequence and see if each part can come from the grammar rules.\n\nLet me first list the string again: t63 t89 t2 t4 t114 t116 t119 t114 t38 t123 t82 t94 t8 t58 t73 t11 t45 t15.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar:\n\n- Some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT4 is 't91', but wait, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce multiple terminals. For example, NT47 is sometimes 't3', and there's a rule like NT47 \u2192 't114', and so on.\n\nI need to check which non-terminals directly produce which terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t63. Let me see which non-terminal rules generate t63.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 't94', NT37 \u2192 't17', NT7 \u2192 't93', NT7 \u2192 't97', etc. Hmm, I need to find where 't63' comes from.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT38 \u2192 't102', NT38 \u2192 't123', and NT33 \u2192 't79', etc. Wait, no, checking the rules again.\n\nWait, let me go through each rule more carefully:\n\nLooking for any production rules that produce 't63' directly.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't58'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't91'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't28'\n\n- NT14: no, looking for t63.\n\nWait, maybe 't63' comes from a production where NT47 is 't73', but no, NT47 has multiple productions: 't3', 't100', 't14', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, let's look again:\n\nWait, at the end of the provided grammar, there's a line:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't14' (from production NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45, but wait, actually, looking back, the grammar has Nts which can produce terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, in the production rules, some of the rules are written as NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, while others are NTX \u2192 't...'. For example:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n\n- NT75 \u2192 not present.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

So, these are the NTs that directly produce 't...' terminals.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't63'. Is there any NT that directly produces 't63'? Scanning the above list:\n\nNo, none of the rules produce 't63' directly. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, looking more carefully through the provided rules, I realize that some lines are written with multiple parts, perhaps indicating production rules. Let me check the full provided rules again.\n\nAh, here's a line: NT37 \u2192 't17', so 't17' is produced by NT37.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a production that leads to 't63' as a terminal, possibly through chaining several non-terminals. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce 't63'.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, none directly produce 't63'. Hmmm. That's a problem because the string starts with 't63', which isn't directly produced by any rule. Unless 't63' is produced via a chain of productions.\n\nBut wait, perhaps 't63' is part of a larger production. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT1 NT11. Then NT1 can produce various things, but perhaps the 't63' is part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string is 't63 ...', so the very first symbol is 't63'. That would mean that the initial production must expand to start with 't63'. But none of the rules directly produce 't63'. That suggests that 't63' must be part of a larger production, but I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't63' as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me scan through the rules again to see if any of them produce 't63' as a terminal.\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't58' and 't116'\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't3', 't100', 't14'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't102', 't123'\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't79', 't126'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't29', 't70', 't48'\n\nWait, I don't see any rules where a non-terminal directly produces 't63' as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-346","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to decide whether this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT36, NT28, etc.) and terminals (like 't4', 't8', up to 't197'), which seem to correspond to parts of the string.\n\nI notice that the grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS) except for the start symbol, which could produce a terminal. However, looking at the given grammar, it seems that all production rules have two non-terminals except the rules that produce terminals, which appear to be the ones with '|' before a terminal, like NT46 -> 't8', etc. Wait, no, looking closer, each rule is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals, or a non-terminal producing a terminal. Wait, actually, some rules have two non-terminals separated by a hyphen, like NT28 -> NT4 NT6, while others have a ternary structure, like 'NT46 -> NT20 NT8' and so on. Wait, no, actually, looking again, no, all the rules are in the form of two non-terminals, except when there's a terminal, which is represented by a string like 't8' or 't94' etc.\n\nWait, maybe I need to double-check that. Let's take an example: NT46 -> 't8' would mean that NT46 can produce the terminal 't8'. Similarly, NT37 -> 't17' and others. Wait, but that can't be because in CNF, each production rule should have only one non-terminal on the left and either another non-terminal or a terminal on the right. Oh, but in the given grammar, all production rules for the non-terminals are of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, meaning each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. The exception would be when a production rule directly produces a terminal, but in the given grammar, it looks like each rule is of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ. So maybe the grammar as presented doesn't have any production rules that produce a single terminal, which is odd because in CNF, sometimes the start symbol can produce a terminal, but others require that all other rules produce two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the structure. Looking at some rules like 'NT46 -> 't8'', that might be a mistake because in CNF, each production should have either one non-terminal or one terminal as the RHS, but in the way it's written, it's followed by '->' and then two parts. So, perhaps the way the problem is presented, all non-terminals produce exactly two non-terminals, and to ever get a terminal, you'd have to go through a chain of productions that eventually leads to a non-terminal that's allowed to produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses a notation where a '->' followed by multiple terms, such as 'NTX -> a b', would mean that the non-terminal NTX can produce the string \"ab\" by substituting a and b. But in the given grammar, it's written as NTX -> NTY NTZ, which would produce each of those non-terminals. So each of these steps would correspond to replacing a non-terminal with two others, and to reach a terminal, you'd have to go through a chain until you reach a non-terminal that's allowed to produce a terminal, but in the given grammar, every production seems to be NTX -> NTY NTZ, without any NTX -> 'tX'.\n\nHmm, that's confusing because in a typical CNF grammar, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which might produce a terminal. But here, perhaps the start symbol is S, which has production rules, but each seems to be producing two non-terminals. So perhaps all the non-terminals only produce other non-terminals, meaning that every generated string would be a combination of two non-terminals, and terminals are produced when the chain of productions reaches a point where a non-terminal is supposed to produce a terminal, but in this grammar, all rules are two non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Maybe the way it's written, like 'NTX -> NTY NTZ' actually represents a production rule where NTX is replaced by the two non-terminals NTY and NTZ, which themselves may produce more non-terminals or terminals. So for the string to be generated, each step would replace a non-terminal with two others, and the string is built from the bottom up.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, there are terminal parts like 't48', 't40', 't78', etc. So the process is top-down, where S is replaced by NT1 and NT28, then each of those is further replaced until we reach terminals.\n\nBut let me check: the string provided is 't48 t40 t78 t3 t135 t117 t41 t134 t109 t66 t11 t27 t94 t120 t111 t27 t66 t135'. So 18 tokens. I need to determine if this can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by determining the structure of the grammar and seeing how the string can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the parse tree that would generate this string step by step.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I can consider the concept of the CYK algorithm for parsing strings against a context-free grammar, but given the complexity, especially considering that this is in CNF, the number of possibilities would be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to analyze the grammar structure and see if the string can be formed step by step.\n\nLet me look for the starting symbol S. The grammar starts with S -> NT1 NT28 or S -> NT50 NT27. So each production of S produces two non-terminals. So whatever string is generated will start by expanding these two.\n\nFor example, let's take S -> NT1 NT28. So the first two parts of the string would be 'tX' from NT1 and 'tY' from NT28.\n\nLooking at the given string: t48 t40 t78 t3 ... So maybe t48 is from NT1 and t40 from NT28, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but then we have to see which options are possible. Let me look at NT1 and NT28.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT4 -> NT21 NT15\n- NT24 -> NT46 NT2\n- NT22 -> NT49 NT14\n- NT33 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building a map of each non-terminal to its possible production rules, then see if the string can be split into two parts that can be generated from those non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to attempt to parse the string using the given grammar, starting from the beginning.\n\nLet's split the string into parts:\n\nThe string is t48 t40 t78 t3 t135 t117 t41 t134 t109 t66 t11 t27 t94 t120 t111 t27 t66 t135.\n\nLet me count the tokens: 18.\n\nIn a CFG in CNF, each step produces exactly two non-terminals, so the parse tree will have depth log2(n), but for 18 tokens, n is even? Wait, 18 is 2*9, then 9 could be split into 4 and 5, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to process from the start and see how the non-terminals can expand.\n\nFirst, S can produce either NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t48. So we need to see if either NT1 or NT50 can produce t48 when expanded.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, NT1's production is NT1 -> NT25 NT17. So NT1 itself is a non-terminal that only produces other non-terminals. Similarly, NT50 has production NT50 -> NT29 NT10. Both of these non-terminals are only expanding to other non-terminals, which suggests that perhaps any string from NT1 or NT50 must eventually derive to terminals.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t48, so we'd need that t48 comes from NT1, which would mean that through a series of productions, NT1 expands into t48.\n\nWait, but NT1 -> NT25 NT17, both of which are non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-361","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form consists of production rules where each rule either produces two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. The start symbol is S, and all other productions are to two symbols. So, looking at the given grammar, it seems to adhere to CNF because each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal at the end, except maybe for some that have more terminals? Wait, wait, no, actually looking closely, all the productions appear to be two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. So that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t69 t131 t59 t15 t45 t15 t134 t14 t126 t134 t126 t21 t62 t21 t16 t15 t63 t5 t134`. \n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. \n\nI remember that in CNF, the only terminals that appear are in the right-hand sides of the productions, and everything else is non-terminal. So, each terminal in the string must correspond directly to a production rule where the right-hand side contains that terminal.\n\nLet me list all the terminal symbols in the string: `t69, t131, t59, t15, t45, t134, t62, t14, t126, t16, t5, t63, t5, t134`.\n\nWait, I notice that 't134' appears multiple times. I should check which production rules correspond to these terminals to see if they can be part of a derivation.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some rules end with 'tX' where X is a number. These are the terminals. I'll note down the terminal symbols and their corresponding productions.\n\nFor example:\n- S -> NT1 NT1 (I think the NT numbers are just labels, not necessarily terminals)\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar is written in terms of NT symbols, which are non-terminals, except where the right-hand side ends with a terminal (like 't69', 't131', etc.). So each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nSo, for each terminal in the string, we need to find a production rule that produces it. For example:\n\nt69: Looking through the grammar, I see a rule N46 -> t69.\n\nt131: Check the rules. Hmm, I don't immediately see one. Wait, let me check. Oh, there's N39 -> N41 N14, but that doesn't end with t. Wait, did I miss one? Alternatively, I might have to look for any N that directly produces t131. Looking at all rules, I only see N35 -> 't105' and N24 -> 't29', and others like N117 but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking again, under N50, there's N50 -> 't4', so t4 is a terminal.\n\nBut for t131, I need to check all rules. Let's go through them:\n\n- NT35 -> 't105'\n- NT37 -> 't17'\n- NT7 -> 't93, t97'\n- NT46 -> 't8, t27, etc.\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let me check each rule that ends with 't':\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-360","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I\u2019ve got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens that look like they're separated by spaces, like `t31 t27 t83 ...` and so on. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has all productions in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I think I need to parse the grammar to see how the non-terminals can expand into terminals. The string is made up of terminals starting from t31 down to t120 or so, so I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S, which branches into NT1 and NT28, or NT50 and NT27. NT1, NT28, NT50, and NT27 are non-terminals that themselves have productions either splitting into two non-terminals or into a terminal. So, the overall structure is that the grammar builds up strings of these terminals by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nI need to check if the string can be derived by starting from S and expanding it to match the entire string. Since the string is long, there are a lot of possible steps, but perhaps I can find a pattern or a way to break the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking closer, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT9 \u2192 t97, or NT4 \u2192 t91, or NT6 \u2192 t54 NT6. Wait, but in some cases, a non-terminal might split into two terminals, like NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6, and then maybe those NT4 and NT6 go on to produce t84 and t62, respectively, because NT4 \u2192 t84 and NT6 \u2192 ... Well, let me look at NT6. In the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t54 NT6. Hmm, that's a recursion. But in the given string, I don\u2019t see any recursion, so maybe this path isn't used in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT6 is part of another expansion. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10, and both NT56 and NT10 are terminals. NT56 \u2192 t20 NT8, and NT8 \u2192 t102, so NT56 would produce t20 t102. NT10 is t2.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see t2 somewhere, but it's not clear. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nAnother thought: the string is a list of tokens, and each token is a terminal (like t31, t27, etc.). Each of these terminals must come from a production that either directly produces that token or from a series of productions that eventually result in that token.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT35 \u2192 't105' or 't53', etc. Some of these produce a single terminal, others produce two non-terminals, and some non-terminals split into others.\n\nI think the key here is to figure out a way to parse the string step by step, replacing non-terminals with possible terminals or sequences that match.\n\nBut since the string is a list of terminals, I need to see if there's a way each part of the string can be generated by the grammar. Let me see: the string is t31 t27 t83 t45 t114 t112 t2 t107 t120 t40 t42 t11 t98 t124 t89 t62 t93 t58 t91.\n\nThat's 19 tokens. The grammar seems to have a lot of NTs that can produce two terminals, but sometimes they require multiple steps. Maybe each token in the string is generated by a chain of productions from the non-terminals.\n\nWait, but starting from S, which splits into S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So the entire string should be generated by expanding S. Each step of the expansion will produce a sequence of NTs, which can then be expanded further until all are terminals.\n\nGiven the string is 19 tokens, we need to see if there's a way to split this string into the sequence of non-terminals S would produce.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reverse engineer the string, starting from the start symbol and trying to expand it into the given tokens.\n\nAnother approach: think of each token in the string as a result of a production chain starting from S. Since S can produce either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27, perhaps the string can start with either NT1 or NT50.\n\nLet me see the first token: t31. So, which non-terminals directly produce t31? Looking at the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t31. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe it's produced via some expansion.\n\nLooking at the NTs: NT31 \u2192 ... Let me check NT31's productions. In the grammar, I see NT31 \u2192 NT6 NT35, and that's it. So NT31 doesn't produce t31 directly or via a terminal. Hmm, that means that the first token t31 is being generated by NT31, but in the grammar, NT31 can't produce t31 directly or through any other terminal. Wait, let me check all NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see the productions for NTs that produce t31.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 t58, but t31 is somewhere else. Wait, actually, looking back, I only see NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45, and NT41 \u2192 NT4 NT2..., but I don't see any NT that directly produces t31 except perhaps NT31 \u2192 NT6 NT35. So if the string starts with t31, that would require NT31 to expand into t31, but in the grammar, NT31 is an intermediate and only expands into NT6 NT35, which are non-terminals. So that would mean that the string's first token would have to come from NT31 somehow, but NT31 doesn't produce any terminals based on the given productions. Therefore, t31 can't be generated unless there's a production I'm missing.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. Let me look through the productions for each NT. For example, NT6 \u2192 t54 NT6. Wait, but maybe t54 is a terminal? Or is it another NT? In the production NT6, the only production is NT6 \u2192 t54 NT6. So NT6 can't produce a terminal by itself because it involves another NT. So t54 must be part of a non-terminal, meaning that unless t54 is a terminal, NT6 can't produce it directly. Looking back, no, in the given grammar, all the symbols after NT (like NT31, NT22, etc.) are non-terminals, and the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t31, t27, etc.\n\nWait, but in the productions, for example, NT9 \u2192 t97. So some NTs directly produce terminals, but others (like NT31) do not. So for the string to start with t31, there must be a production that allows NT31 to produce t31. But looking at the grammar, NT31 \u2192 NT6 NT35. So it can't produce t31 directly, and thus the string can't start with t31. But the string does start with t31, so that seems like a problem. Unless I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-examine the grammar. Each line represents a production where the left side is a non-terminal, and the right side can be either a terminal or a sequence of non-terminals. For example, NT31 \u2192 NT6 NT35. So NT31 can't produce t31 directly; it produces NT6 followed by NT35. So unless NT6 or NT35 produce t31, which they don't, t31 can never appear as a terminal in the string.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t31, which according to the grammar can't be generated by any production, because no NT directly or indirectly produces t31. So does that mean the string is not in the language? That would make the answer 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing a production that I didn't look at correctly. Let me check each line again.\n\nLooking at NT31: only one production, which is NT6 NT35. So NT31 doesn't produce t31. Similarly, NT39 \u2192 t49 NT24, and NT24 is somewhere else.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe t31 is produced by a non-terminal that in turn can be split into more non-terminals that eventually produce t31, but unless that's possible, t31 can't appear in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

So I need to see if S can produce something that starts with t21. Looking at S's productions, they go to NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27. So for the first symbol to be t21, one of these non-terminals needs to produce t21 followed by something.\n\nBut looking at the NTs, for example, NT1 has a production NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. Then NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6. NT54 \u2192 NT53. So let's see what NT53 can produce. From the productions, I can see NT53 \u2192 't8' or NT53 can produce other NTs. Looking through the NT53 productions: NT53 \u2192 NT53 NT47 or 't8'. So NT53 can be recursive, but the only terminal production for NT53 is 't8'.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the first symbol is 't21', not 't8'. So if I have S \u2192 NT1 NT1, and NT1 \u2192 ... \u2192 NT53, which can only produce 't8'. So that path would give 't8' at the end, which doesn't match the string starting with 't21'.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any NT can produce 't21' directly. Looking through the productions, are any NTs directly producing 't21'? Let me scan the 't' productions:\n\nLooking through NT productions, I see some NTs produce 't's, but I don't see any NT directly producing 't21'. For example, NT31 \u2192 't117', NT41 \u2192 't69', NT29 \u2192 't116', and so on. So none of the NTs directly produce 't21' as a terminal. That means the only way to get 't21' is if some NT can generate it recursively through other productions.\n\nBut looking at the structure, none of the NTs have a production that includes 't21'. The productions for NTs all either break into other NTs or produce a specific 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check all NT productions to see if any of them can generate 't21'. But looking through the list, I don't see any 't21' production. The only NT that might produce 't21' is if some recursive path leads to it, but the way the NTs are structured, they either break down into other NTs or specific terminals.\n\nLooking at the NTs, for example, NT33 \u2192 't79', NT35 \u2192 't16', NT21 \u2192 't3', so none of these are 't21'. Similarly, NT117 is a number but isn't a terminal\u2014it's a symbol. Wait, NT117 is a non-terminal because it's in the same format as S, NT1, etc. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the symbols in the string like 't21' are terminal symbols. So in the NT productions, when you see something like NT117, it's a non-terminal that can produce other NTs or a terminal. So, to see if 't21' can be derived, I need to see if any NT can produce 't21' directly or indirectly.\n\nBut looking at the NT productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't21' or can produce it through a chain. For example, NT47 \u2192 't3', so if a NT can derive NT47 and then get 't3' in the string, but that's not matching 't21'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at this incorrectly. Maybe the string is being generated step by step, but since the NTs don't have any 't21' production, 't21' can't appear anywhere in the string.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for the string to be generated, each symbol must be either a terminal or derived from a production. Since none of the NTs can produce 't21' as a terminal, the string can't contain 't21'.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since the string starts with 't21' and no NT in the grammar produces 't21' as a terminal, the string is not in the language generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't21', but no non-terminal production in the grammar directly or indirectly produces 't21'. Therefore, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nAnswer: NO"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-381","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are quite long, so I'll need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that in CNF, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can go directly to terminals. Wait, actually, wait\u2014the exact definition: In CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (a terminal). But looking at the grammar provided, it seems like all productions are two non-terminals because I don't see any terminal symbols on the left side (like A \u2192 a). Instead, the terminals appear on the right side. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, all the left-hand sides (LHS) are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) consist of two non-terminals except where terminals appear. Wait, no, looking closely, all the rules have two non-terminals on the RHS, like S \u2192 NT1 NT1, but some RHS have terminals, like NT34 -> NT44 NT38 followed by NT39, NT53, etc. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, no, actually, every production has two non-terminals. Even those that seem like they produce terminals might not\u2014wait, no, looking deeper: For example, NT46 -> 't8'... Wait, some of the productions have 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. Oh, right, in the grammar, the NT productions are followed by some strings with 't' which are terminals.\n\nSo, the grammar is in CNF because all the LHS are non-terminals, and the RHS are pairs of non-terminals except when they have terminal symbols. Wait, no: CNF requires productions to be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except the start symbol. But if there are terminal symbols on the RHS, that's not CNF. So maybe the given grammar isn't strictly in CNF because some RHS contain terminals. Wait, the question says it's in CNF, so perhaps the terminals are somehow derived from non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the productions. Each rule is of the form NT_x \u2192 NT_y NT_z, except some have terminals. For example, NT46 \u2192 't8'. So, that's a terminal. So, the grammar must be such that these terminals are the terminal symbols, and the NT symbols are non-terminals. So, the grammar allows both non-terminals and terminals on the RHS. Wait, but CNF only allows non-terminals on the RHS. So maybe the grammar isn't in CNF because some RHS contain terminals.\n\nWait, the user says it's in Chomsky Normal Form, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe all the RHS are pairs of non-terminals, and the terminals are somehow produced elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the grammar is given, and the terminals are the ones starting with 't', like 't65', 't134', etc., which would be terminal symbols, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nSo, the approach is to parse the given string using the grammar, treating the 't's as terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string to parse is: t65 t134 t34 t17 t37 t48 t41 t131 t36 t123 t73 t28 t3 t8 t48 t80 t135 t100 t76 t84.\n\nSo, it's a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions.\n\nThe strategy is to use a stack-based approach or parsing with the given productions. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can try to simulate a top-down parser, like the CYK algorithm, but maybe given the complexity, it's easier to see if the string can be broken down step by step using the productions.\n\nBut considering the length, perhaps it's more feasible to look for possible derivations.\n\nFirst, note that the string has 20 tokens: t65, t134, t34, t17, t37, t48, t41, t131, t36, t123, t73, t28, t3, t8, t48, t80, t135, t100, t76, t84.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT1 NT1 (or another form), the start symbol S would produce two non-terminals. So, the root of the parse tree would be S, and each terminal in the string needs to be generated by the corresponding non-terminal expansions.\n\nOne approach is to see if the entire string is a sequence that can be built by applying productions step by step, ensuring that each terminal matches the corresponding production.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as the stack starting with S and trying to match the production, popping and pushing symbols as needed, checking if the input can be fully consumed.\n\nLet me try to think of how the string starts. The first token is 't65'. Looking at the grammar, I need to find a production that starts with 't65'. Wait, the NT productions don't have terminals except where specified. Looking at the grammar rules, some NT might derive to a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, looking through the productions, I see NT17 \u2192 't94' and others like NT3 \u2192 't42', etc. So, each non-terminal can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, in the given grammar, each production is of the form NT_x \u2192 NT_y NT_z, except for those that have a terminal on the RHS, like NT46 \u2192 't8'... Wait, no, no, looking at the provided grammar, many rules have two non-terminals on the RHS, but some have a terminal. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the user provided the entire grammar, but the right-hand sides have both non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT46 \u2192 't8' is a production where the RHS is a terminal? But that can't be, because in CNF, RHS must be two non-terminals. So perhaps the given grammar is such that the terminals are part of the productions, meaning that the grammar's rules include both steps of generating non-terminals and terminals. But that would not be CNF, unless the terminal 't's are in the rules.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar is such that some non-terminals can produce a terminal. That is, the RHS can have a mix of terminals and non-terminals? Because in standard CNF, each rule's RHS is two non-terminals, so the terminals are derived from those. So perhaps in this case, the grammar is given with the possibility of deriving terminals directly, meaning that some non-terminals produce terminals, effectively ending the derivation at that point.\n\nSo, for example, if NT46 can produce 't8', then once NT46 is expanded to 't8', the derivation stops there, as that's a terminal.\n\nSo, going back to the problem, the parsing of the string 't65 t134...' would require that each 't' comes from some non-terminal in the grammar, derived from the start.\n\nThus, the process is: starting with S, the string must be generated through a series of expansions, each time replacing non-terminals with their RHS until all symbols are terminals.\n\nGiven the string length, perhaps I should look for the productions that generate single terminals and see if they can appear in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backward from the beginning, trying to see which non-terminals can derive the first few terminals.\n\nWait, let's take the first token, 't65', and see what non-terminals can produce it. Looking at the productions, I see NT10 \u2192 't2', NT17 \u2192 't94', etc. Wait, but none of them seem to produce 't65'. Hmmm.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, let's check for 't65':\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't19'\n\nNT45 \u2192 't73'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't102'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't83'\n\nWait, somewhere else:\n\nLooking at:\n\nNT37 \u2192 't17' (but that's a RHS terminal 't17' followed by another NT, not producing 't65').\n\nWait, let's check systematically.\n\nLooking through all the RHS terminals:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't52'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't21'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't135'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t66 t119 t58 t34 t65 t124 t107 t109 t94 t94 t66 t69 t89 t63 t14 t91 t66 t122 t108 t66 t122`. Hmm, that's quite a long string!\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all productions are two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side, except I see some have two terminals. Wait, no, looking again, all productions have either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the starting symbol S has two productions, and other non-terminals produce either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string consists of several 't' followed by numbers, like `t66`, `t119`, etc. I notice that these could represent terminals in the grammar, as they don't have subscripts like letters. So I think each 't' followed by a number is a literal production in the grammar.\n\nNext, I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals). So the derivation process would break down each non-terminal into two parts, recursively, until all symbols are terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I can see that many non-terminals produce terminals. For example, `NT6 -> t58`, `NT36 -> t87`, `NT41 -> t52`, etc. So each of these non-terminals can produce a single terminal in one step, but since the grammar is in CNF, those terminals cannot be split further because they are leaves.\n\nNow, the given string is quite long, but perhaps it's a combination of several productions. I should maybe try to break it down step by step. Let's start by looking for parts of the string that can be derived directly from a single production.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: `t66 t119 t58`. Let's see if `t66` can be generated. Looking at the grammar, I see `NT32 -> t66 t6`, but wait, no, `NT32 -> NT15 NT13`. Wait, that's for NT32. Then later, looking further, I see `NT1 -> NT25 NT17`, etc.\n\nWait, but `t66` is a terminal, so looking for a production that directly gives `t66`. Scanning through, I spot `NT32 -> t66 t6`. Wait, no, production NT32 is `NT32 -> NT15 NT13`, not `t66`. Let me check again. Scanning through all the productions, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces `t66 t6` except in one case: NT22 -> t128, etc., no.\n\nWait, maybe I should check all productions for any NT that directly expands to `t66`. Hmm, looking through all the rules, I see NT21 -> t3, NT46 -> t27, etc., but I don't see any NT that directly produces `t66`. So that would mean `t66` must be an input terminal provided in the string, not derived from any NT.\n\nBut wait, if the grammar has a production that directly gives `t66`, that production would be like `NTx -> t66`, but looking through the provided rules, I don't see any NT directly giving `t66`. Therefore, `t66` must come from a non-terminal that eventually derives it in one step, meaning some NT with a production that eventually leads to `t66`. Alternatively, maybe it's built from other non-terminals that produce `t66`.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the way the string is written, each pair of symbols corresponds to a production. But no, the string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, so each element is either a terminal or a non-terminal, but the actual derivation tree can have longer paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar has certain non-terminals that can produce multiple terminals by expanding step by step. For example, maybe NT32 can produce t66 and some other terminal, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar:\n\nNT32 -> NT15 NT13\n\nLooking for NT15, which is:\n\nNT15 -> NT56 NT15\n\nWait, that's a recursive production. Let me see NT56:\n\nNT56 -> NT20 NT17\n\nNT20 -> NT43 NT50\n\nNT43 -> NT8 NT3\n\nNT8 -> t34\n\nWait, so NT43 can produce t34 and NT3, which NT3 is:\n\nNT3 -> NT6 NT3, which is recursive. Let's see NT6:\n\nNT6 -> NT54 NT6, which is recursive, and NT54 is NT119, which is:\n\nNT54 -> t53\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to trace down how to get t66.\n\nWait, let's go back to the string. The start is t66, which is a terminal. So in the derivation, the start symbol S must eventually produce t66. Since S can produce NT1 NT1, etc., which are non-terminals. So perhaps t66 comes from expanding one of those NTs.\n\nWait, let me check the NTs for t66. Looking through:\n\nIs there any NT that directly produces t66? Well, in the given rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t66. So to produce t66, there must be some NT that can derive it through several steps.\n\nWait, looking for any NT where t66 is one of the symbols in its expansion. Like, perhaps NT6 -> t66 t6. Wait, no, that's a production, is there any NT that directly produces t66?\n\nLooking through all the rules again, the only NT with NTx containing 't66' is in NT22: NT22 -> t128, etc., no. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the string given has t66 as the first element. So S must expand into something that leads to t66 as the first symbol. Since S in the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT1 NT1\n\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nSo S can only lead to those two possibilities. So the first symbol in the string must come from NT1 or NT50. So looking at the string: first is t66, so either NT1 or NT50 must produce t66.\n\nLooking at NT1:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT1 -> NT25 NT17\n\nNT25 -> NT6 NT31\n\nNT31 -> NT117 NT?\n\nWait, let me check NT25 production: it's NT6 and NT31. NT6 is -> NT54 NT6, which then goes to NT54 as t53 and NT6 again, leading to t53, etc. So NT6 can produce t53, and NT54 -> t53 as well.\n\nWait, no, NT6 -> NT54 NT6, and NT54 -> t53. So when expanding NT6, it first expands to t53 and NT6, which then loops back. Wait, no: because NT54 -> t53, so in production NT6: it's NT54 NT6, which would expand NT54 to t53, and then NT6 again. So does that mean NT6 can produce t53 NT6, which can't terminate unless there's another production for NT6 to stop. Hmm, but NT6 seems to have a recursive production that only ends with NT54 -> t53. So perhaps NT6 can eventually produce t53, but it's a single terminal, not t66.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar in the question. Under NT6, the production is:\n\nNT6 -> NT54 NT6\n\nAnd NT54 is:\n\nNT54 -> t53\n\nSo NT6 can be replaced by t53 in one step? Or is it that NT54 is t53, but the production is NT6 -> NT54 NT6. So when you expand NT6, it's t53 and NT6 again. So you can't directly get t66 from NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let's focus again on NT1. NT1 is:\n\nNT1 -> NT25 NT17\n\nNT25 -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It looks like it's in CNF because each production starts with a non-terminal on the left and is followed by two other non-terminals on the right, except for the terminals. The start symbol is S, which splits into two non-terminals, and then each of those continues breaking down into more non-terminals until terminal symbols are reached.\n\nThe string provided consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. I'll need to see if these terminals can be derived by expanding the start symbol S through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production either expands a non-terminal into two others or eventually leads to a terminal. So, I need to track the possible terminals that can be generated from S. Each step in the string must match a terminal production or be part of the chain leading to it.\n\nI'll start by checking each terminal in the string to see if it can be derived. For example, the first part is t17. Looking at the grammar, I see NT17 -> NT44 NT53. Then, NT44 has production rules, and so does NT53. This seems a bit tangled, but I'll try to see if I can break it down.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar, using a method like leftmost derivation or some kind of recursive descent. Alternatively, I can check if each terminal in the string is allowed by the grammar and if the overall structure can be matched.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be generated without leaving any symbols in between. Since each production in CNF splits into two, the number of symbols in the string should correspond to the expansion steps. The string has 23 elements, so the derivation from S should generate 23 terminals, which means 22 splits, which in CNF would mean a string length of 2^22, but the string here is only 23, which is much smaller. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe my initial thought is incorrect because in CNF, each production splits into two, so the number of terminals generated from each node doubles at each step. But the string is 23 terminals long, which is 2^something but not a power of two. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down step by step. Let's take the first few elements: t17, t53, t45, t41, t89, t62, t100...\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17 can produce NT44 and NT53. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT17 -> NT44 NT53. Then NT44 has multiple rules, for example, NT44 -> NT38 NT13. NT53 has productions like NT53 -> NT29 NT3, and NT53 can also be terminal in some cases, like in NT37 -> 't17'. But in the string, t17 is the first symbol, which maps to NT17 in the derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if each terminal can be generated from their respective non-terminals. For example, t17 comes from NT17, which needs to be expanded into NT44 and NT53. Then each of those needs to be expanded further until we reach terminals.\n\nBut this seems a bit too involved. Maybe I should check if each terminal in the string is present in the grammar, either as a terminal production or reachable through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several terminals like 't93', 't97', 't8', 't24', 't29', 't79', etc. In the given string, all the 't' symbols are present in the grammar. For example, t17 is from NT17, which is defined, t53 is part of the grammar, t45 (NT45 can produce 't28'), t41 (NT41 can produce 't52'), t89 (NT89 isn't directly in the grammar, but wait, NT89 must come from somewhere else, perhaps NT44 which can go to t89 or maybe another path), and so on.\n\nWait, let's check t89. Looking at the grammar, I don't see an explicit rule for NT89. Hmm, maybe it's derived from another non-terminal. Looking further, I see NT44 has a production NT44 -> NT38 NT13. NT38 -> NT102, but wait, there's a terminal 't102' which comes from NT88 perhaps. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to map each 't' to the possible non-terminals. For example:\n\nt17 comes from NT17\nt53 can come from NT53, which is produced by NT17, or other places.\nt45 comes from NT45, which can be produced by NT6 etc.\n\nThis might take a long time, but I think it's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a reverse mapping. Take each 't' and see if it's a terminal in any non-terminal's production. Looking through the grammar, I see several 't' terminals. So, any 't' that's present as a terminal production in the grammar is acceptable.\n\nBut in the string, all the 't's are present in the grammar, so that shouldn't be a problem. The issue is whether the sequence of non-terminals can generate the exact sequence of 't's as given.\n\nAnother point to consider is the count of each 't'. For example, t17 appears once in the string. In the grammar, NT17 can only produce t17 in certain cases, or not? Let me check the grammar for NT17:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT17 -> NT44 NT53 (from earlier lines). But wait, further down I see NT7 -> 't93', NT17 -> 't24', and NT17 -> 't17'. Oh, so NT17 can derive to 't24' or 't17' or NT44 NT53. So in the string, t17 is allowed via NT17 -> 't17'. So that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, t53 can come from NT53 or via other paths. NT53 has a production NT53 -> NT29 NT3, which can lead to t3 or t29. But in the string, t53 is just 't53', which may come from NT53 -> 't53' (not sure if NT53 has that as a production). Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see a production where NT53 directly becomes 't53'. Let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT56 -> 't3', but NT53 has productions like NT53 -> NT29 NT3 and NT53 -> 't105' and 't114' (from lines like NT35 -> 't105' and NT46 -> 't114'). Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT35 -> 't105'\n- NT53 -> 't105' (I think this is via NT35 -> NT53 -> ... but need to check exact lines.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nNT35 -> NT105 (but looking at the lines: NT29 -> NT26 NT14, etc. Wait, maybe I'm looking at it wrong. Let me parse the grammar more clearly.\n\nThe grammar is given in a list of production rules. Each line starts with a non-terminal, followed by the production.\n\nLooking for NT53, I see:\n\n- NT53 -> NT29 NT3\n- NT53 -> 't105'\n- NT53 -> 't17'\nWait, no, I don't think so. Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided lines:\n\n- NT17 -> 't94'\n- NT27 -> 't78'\nWait, no, the line for NT17 is:\n\nLooking at the first lines:\n\nNT17 -> NT44 NT53\nNT33 -> NT28 NT15\nNT6 -> NT54 NT6\nNT45 -> 't87'\nNT53 -> NT29 NT3\nNT56 -> NT20 NT17\nNT20 -> 't2'\nOh, so NT53 does not directly produce 't53'.

{"custom_id":"request-421","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if this string is generated by the given grammar. I'm not very familiar with context-free grammars, but I'll do my best. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems there are a lot of these production rules, mostly combining non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t97 t11 t112 t82 t15 t134 t59 t42 t123 t81 t16 t69 t59 t36 t124 t45 t1 t76 t82 t117 t11 t108`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a series of terminals like t97, t11, etc. My goal is to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has two initial productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo, regardless of which one we take, the derivation starts with either NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27. Each of these NTs is a non-terminal that needs to be resolved further.\n\nLet's start with the first option: S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nFirst, NT1: According to the grammar, NT1 is not directly defined, but looking at NT1's productions, I see NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. So, we need to derive NT25 and NT17.\n\nLooking up NT25: The rule is NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. NT6's rule is NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6. This is a chain that will lead to a loop unless it terminates. Let's see: NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6. NT54 \u2192 NT81 NT120. But looking for 54, NT54's production is NT54 \u2192 NT53 NT55, which then would need to resolve. This seems complicated, but maybe there's a way to get 't97' from NT6 or NT54.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see that some NTs directly map to terminals. For example, NT6 has a rule NT6 \u2192 't58', but in the string, I don't see a 't58'. Let me check the provided string: it has t97, t11, t112, etc., but no 't58'. So, unless NT6 can produce t58, maybe we should explore if NT25 can produce something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to trace a possible derivation.\n\nOption 1: Start with S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6.\n\nThis seems like a loop. NT54 \u2192 NT53 NT55.\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT49 NT54 (multiple times). NT54 again loops. This could go on indefinitely unless it terminates with a terminal. But looking through the productions, NT53 can sometimes produce 't53' (I think) or more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should pick the other initial production: S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT15 NT38.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT56 NT26.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17.\n\nWait, NT56: I see NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17, so NT20 is involved. Let's break down NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3.\n\nWait, but NT8 is not defined in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, NT8 isn't a non-terminal; perhaps it's a terminal. So, if NT8 is a terminal, it would map to 't8'. But looking at the string, I don't see 't8'. So maybe this path is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any NTs can produce 't97'. Looking through the productions, I notice that NT7 \u2192 't79' and NT77... Wait, looking at NTs: NT7 has a production to 't93' and 't97' as terminal, right? Because in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't93'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't97'\n\nSimilarly, NT71 \u2192 't79', NT7 \u2192 't79'? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't93'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't97'\n\nSo, both options are available for NT7. So, perhaps the string has a t97, which could come from NT7.\n\nLooking at the string: `t97 t11 t112 t82 t15 t134 t59 t42 t123 t81 t16 t69 t59 t36 t124 t45 t1 t76 t82 t117 t11 t108`.\n\nThe first element is t97, so perhaps the derivation starts with NT7.\n\nWait, let's backtrack. Starting with S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT15 NT38.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT56 NT26.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3.\n\nHTHink, if NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3, then NT8 must be a terminal. Checking the grammar, I don't see NT8 defined as anything except possibly terminal.\n\nLooking again at the grammar, for NTs:\n\nLooking through the list, NT8 appears in NT8 \u2192 't82' and 't102'. So NT8 can produce t82 or t102.\n\nWait, looking at NT8: \n\nIn the grammar:\n\nNT8 production is:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't82'\n\nand also\n\nNT8 \u2192 't102'\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t82 appearing twice. So, if we can get t82 from NT8, that could make sense. But I'm not sure if NT8 is reachable in this derivation.\n\nBut wait, in the initial S \u2192 NT50 NT27, we have NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT38.\n\nThen NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT26.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT50 NT27 \u2192 NT15 NT38 NT27.\n\nThen NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT26 \u2192 NT20 NT17 NT26.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50 \u2192 NT8 NT3 NT50.\n\nWait, if NT8 is a terminal, that's t82 as per the grammar.\n\nBut in the string, we have t82. Let me see if we can get that.\n\nSo, in this path, the first elements are t97, which we think is from NT7. But how does NT7 get into play if we're in the S \u2192 NT50 NT27 branch?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S \u2192 NT1 NT28 is the correct path. Let me try that.\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT53 NT55.\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT50 NT48.\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT15 NT38.\n\nWait, this seems like a loop. NT50 again, which is part of the initial S, so maybe this could go on forever unless it terminates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to find another path.\n\nWait, maybe the first NT in the string is t97, so it's better to see if the first production can be NT7 \u2192 t97.\n\nSo, perhaps the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT7 t97 NT28, but in the grammar, S has only NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27. So, unless NT1 has a terminal, which I don't think it does, as NT1's rule is NT25 AND NT17, which are both non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider the string and see if any terminals match what the grammar can produce.\n\nLooking at the string: t97, t11, t112, etc.\n\nWe can see that t7 exists in the grammar as NT7 \u2192 't79' and 't97'.\n\nt6 is in NT6 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-447","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the structure of the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This is important because it tells me how the derivations will proceed. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, as indicated by the two initial productions: S \u2192 NT1 NT1 and S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So, any derivation starts from S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t111 t63 t69 t109 t81 t119 t66 t79 t66 t105 t107 t79 t53 t31 t116 t37 t11 t4 t135 t45 t48 t94 t102.\n\nI notice that the string consists of 24 tokens, all of which are terminals of the form 't' followed by numbers. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting from S through a series of production rule applications.\n\nTo approach this, I'll try to match the string from the top-down using the grammar, which might involve some backtracking. Alternatively, I can look for the possible ways the string can be broken down into parts that fit the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string into parts that might correspond to the grammar's structure. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production either introduces a terminal or splits a non-terminal into two parts.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt111 t63 t69 t109 t81 t119 t66 t79 t66 t105 t107 t79 t53 t31 t116 t37 t11 t4 t135 t45 t48 t94 t102\n\nI can consider that the entire string is derived from S, which has two parts connected by a space (i.e., two non-terminals). Looking at the possible productions, S can be NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27. So, the string must be split into two parts, each of which is derived from one of these non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string must be split into two substrings, each starting with the symbols of NT1 or NT50.\n\nLet me check the string length. It's 24 tokens. Each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. Starting from S, which is two non-terminals, each step will increase the number of symbols by one (since each non-terminal is replaced by two, leading to an increase of one non-terminal, which can eventually produce terminals). So, the number of symbols after k steps will be 1 (S) + k.\n\nWe have 24 symbols, which means that 23 steps are needed, leading to a parse with a leftmost derivation of 23 steps.\n\nBut that's a bit abstract. Instead, let me try to split the string into two parts at different positions and see if either of them corresponds to the productions of NT1 or NT50.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nIt starts with t111. Let me see what NT1 can derive. From the grammar, I can look for the productions of NT1.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nI see NT13 \u2192 NT43 NT26\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT69 or NT27\n\nAnd looking for NT13 elsewhere, I see NT13 \u2192 NT19 NT9.\n\nWait, actually, let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT1 is defined as:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n\nAlso, other NTs might eventually lead to NT1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree or use a recursive descent approach.\n\nAlternatively, since each rule is either a concatenation of two non-terminals or a terminal, perhaps I can try to split the string into two parts that each can be generated by NT1 or NT50.\n\nLet me look at the string again: the first few tokens are t111, t63, t69, t109, etc.\n\nWait, I should check if 't111' appears in any production. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for 't*' in the right-hand sides of the rules. I notice that some rules have 't*' as part of their production.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58\n\nNT14 \u2192 t79\n\nNT10 \u2192 t65\n\nNT21 \u2192 t3\n\nNT38 \u2192 t53\n\nNT47 \u2192 t4\n\nNT7 \u2192 t93, t97\n\nNT17 \u2192 t94\n\nNT27 \u2192 t124\n\nNT24 \u2192 t29\n\nNT22 \u2192 t58, t98\n\nNT10 \u2192 t2\n\nNT55 \u2192 t45\n\nNT24 \u2192 t62\n\nNT46 \u2192 t24\n\nNT1 \u2192 t2\n\nNT41 \u2192 t5\n\nNT7 \u2192 t79\n\nNT48 \u2192 t24\n\nNT56 \u2192 t112\n\nNT47 \u2192 t3\n\nNT7 \u2192 t79\n\nAnd so on. Wait, some of these have 't*' as their terminal.\n\nFor instance, NT14 \u2192 t79, which is one of the rules above.\n\nSo, perhaps some of the non-terminals derive to a terminal directly or through other non-terminals.\n\nThis suggests that some of the 't*' in the string can be directly derived by certain NTs, but others would need to combine multiple steps.\n\nGiven that, maybe the string can be broken down into two parts, each derived from NT1 or NT50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be split into two parts, each starting from NT1 or NT50.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backwards, starting from the terminals and seeing if they can be linked through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the smallest possible steps.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to approach this as a parsing problem. Given the grammar, can the string be generated?\n\nAnother approach is to see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nGiven the string has 24 symbols, and the grammar is in CNF, the derivation should expand S into two non-terminals, each expanding until they produce the required symbols.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts, each corresponding to one of the non-terminals that S can split into.\n\nS can be NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27.\n\nSo, I'll try each possibility:\n\nOption 1: The string is derived as NT1 followed by NT1.\n\nSo, the string must be split into two parts, each part being the expansion of NT1.\n\nOption 2: The string is derived as NT50 followed by NT27.\n\nSo, it's split into two parts, one from NT50 and the other from NT27.\n\nI'll check both options.\n\nStarting with Option 1: NT1 followed by NT1.\n\nEach NT1 would need to generate a substring and another substring.\n\nBut I'm not sure what NT1 produces. Let's look for the productions of NT1.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nAlso, other NTs might eventually derive into NT1.\n\nWait, let me check. For instance, looking for NT1's productions:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n\nI don't immediately see other rules for NT1, except for this one.\n\nSo, each NT1 production would involve substituting for NT25 and NT17.\n\nBut to proceed, let me see what NT25 and NT17 can derive.\n\nLooking at NT25:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n\nSo, NT6 \u2192 t58 or t62 or others.\n\nWait, looking for NT25:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nNT6 can produce t58 (looking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 t58). So, if NT6 \u2192 t58, then NT25 \u2192 t58 NT31.\n\nThen NT31 \u2192 t117 or another path? Let's check NT31:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT31 in any production on the left-hand side except once as NT42 \u2192 t122 (no, actually, no. Wait, checking through the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the full grammar:\n\nNT42 \u2192 t82\n\nWait, in the given rules, NT42 is on the right-hand side, not the left, except in cases like NT46 \u2192 t74, etc. So perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps NT25 is part of a longer chain. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's take a step back.\n\nSince the first part of the string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-444","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is great because that structure makes it easier to parse. But wait, is it really in Chomsky normal form? Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nChomsky normal form (CNF) requires every production to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, every production seems to be either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So yes, it's in CNF.\n\nThe string to test is: `t15 t117 t8 t58 t36 t124 t87 t100 t40 t76 t81 t111 t131 t116 t1 t128 t97 t15 t11 t36 t100 t42 t24`.\n\nHmm, that's a long string with multiple 't' and numbers. I notice that the string has a mix of letters and numbers, but in the grammar, NTs are non-terminals, and the terminals are the 't's followed by numbers, like 't8', 't15', etc. So each token in the string is a terminal. Each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me map the string to the grammar. The string has 24 symbols, which are terminals. To generate the string, the grammar must have a leftmost derivation path that results in exactly this sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the productions have non-terminals that expand into other non-terminals until we get to the terminals. The challenge is to see if the given string can be generated by any sequence of these productions.\n\nBreaking it down, the first token is 't15'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT15 has productions ending in 't21' and 't15'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the production for NT15 is `NT15 -> NT56 NT15 | NT46 NT15`. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT15: `NT15 -> NT56 NT15` and NT15 -> NT46 NT15. Hmm, but that seems odd. Or perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, the production for NT15 is `NT15 -> NT56 NT15 | NT46 NT15`. That would make it a right-recursive non-terminal, which is acceptable in CNF, but perhaps not helpful for direct expansion. Alternatively, there are other NTs that directly lead to terminal symbols.\n\nI should perhaps look for which NTs can derive to the required terminals. For example, looking for NTs that have rules directly to 't' symbols.\n\nLooking at NT15, in the grammar, the production is actually:\nNT15 -> NT56 NT15 | NT46 NT15.\n\nWait, but then where do the terminals come from? Let me check each NT in the grammar to see if they have any production that directly goes to a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT3. Hmm, leads to NT6.\n- NT6 -> NT54 NT6.\n- NT54 -> NT53.\n- NT53 has a production: NT53 -> NT29 NT3, which then leads to NT29 and NT3.\n\nLooking deeper, NT29 has several productions, including NT29 -> NT10 NT24. NT10 has NT10 -> 't2' and another production NT10 -> NT50. So, from NT29, we can get 't2' through NT10 when the rule is 't2' and also other options.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs that might lead directly to terminals include:\n\n- NT35 -> 't93' and 't53'\n- NT38 -> 't102' and 't89'\n- NT17 -> 't94'\n- NT33 -> 't79'\n- NT42 -> 't2' and 't82'\n- NT1 -> 't69'\n- NT46 -> 't8'\n- NT7 -> 't93' and 't97'\n- NT14 -> 't79'\n- NT26 -> 't98'\n- NT22 -> 't58' and 't49'\n- NT10 -> 't2'\n- NT55 -> 't45'\n- NT24 -> 't11' (from production NT24 -> NT46 NT15 -> but no, that's a longer path)\n- NT6 -> 't58' and 't21'\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should see if the overall string can be broken into smaller substrings that each correspond to sequences of NTs expanding into the required terminals.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt15 t117 t8 t58 t36 t124 t87 t100 t40 t76 t81 t111 t131 t116 t1 t128 t97 t15 t11 t36 t100 t42 t24.\n\nBreaking it into 24 steps, each corresponding to a production. But since each NT can only produce two non-terminals or a terminal, it's a matter of seeing if starting from S, the non-terminals can expand into the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be parsed by trying to match each part to a possible production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for parts of the string that match the possible NT productions.\n\nFor example, the string starts with t15. We need a production that leads to t15 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT15's productions:\n\nWait, NT15's productions seem to be: NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15 and NT15 \u2192 NT46 NT15.\n\nI'm not seeing a direct terminal for t15. Let me check all NTs to see if any of them directly have 't15' as a terminal.\n\nLooking, is t15 in any of the rules? Let me scan the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I find:\n\n- NT4 -> 't91'\n- NT6 -> 't58' and 't21'\n- NT3 -> 't42'\n- NT13 -> 't16'\n- NT1 -> 't69'\n- NT46 -> 't8'\n- NT22 -> 't58' and 't49'\n- NT10 -> 't2' and 't50'\n- NT34 -> 't37' and 't38' etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT46's productions: NT46 -> 't8' and other rules like NT46 -> NT20 NT8 and NT46 -> NT13 NT6 etc.\n\nWait, so 't8' is a terminal in NT46's production. So, does any NT directly produce t15?\n\nLooking back: NT15 has a production NT15 \u2192 't93' and NT15 \u2192 't15' and other rules? Wait, no, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT15: I don't see a direct 't15' production. Let me check again:\n\nThe grammar provided has:\n\n- NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15 | NT46 NT15.\n\nHmm, that suggests that NT15 can't directly produce 't15' or 't93'. Wait, did I miss any? Looking for 't15' in the grammar:\n\nLooking through each production, do any NTs directly produce 't15'?\n\nLooking through each line, except for the ones showing 't7' 't14', etc.:\n\nLooking at NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which leads to NT6.\n\nNT6: NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT53.\n\nAnd NT53 has several productions, one of which is NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3, which then leads to NT29 and NT3.\n\nNT29 has multiple productions, including NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14, which leads to NT26 and NT14.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to check if 't15' is even present in the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking through the provided terminals in the grammar:\n\nI see things like t102, t83, t15 in production rules: for example, NT22 -> 't58' and 't49', but not 't15'.

This helps in applying specific parsing techniques like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not experienced with that, I'll try a more manual approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that many non-terminals are connected to terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers. For example, S is initially connected to NT1 NT28, which then derive into sequences that eventually produce 't' followed by numbers. So the goal is to see if the given string can be derived by expanding the non-terminals step by step until all symbols are terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the productions to understand the possible paths. Notably, the start symbol S can derive into either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So the string must start with the symbols derived from either NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't134', which is a terminal, so I need to find a production that eventually leads to 't134'. Scanning the grammar, I see that NT46 -> 't87', NT56 -> 't112', NT35 -> 't105', etc. But 't134' is unique\u2014I need to check if any NT can directly produce 't134'. scrolling through the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't134', so I'll have to look indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't134' is part of a longer production chain. Looking deeper, I see entries like NT46 -> 't8', NT17 -> 't94', NT27 -> 't124', etc. But none of these link directly to 't134'.\n\nWait, let me check if 't134' is produced by any NT. Looking through the grammar, I see a production NT46 -> 't87', and another NT17 -> 't94'. But I don't see 't134' being directly produced by any NT. Hmm, that might be a problem because if the string starts with a terminal that's not directly produced by any NT, the string can't be generated by the grammar. But maybe through some expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I've missed something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can go through a series of productions that eventually result in the string. So I'll need to perform a step-by-step expansion from S.\n\nLet me take a look at the string and see what non-terminals can derive into those terminals. For example, the first token is 't134'. So I need to find if there's any NT that can lead to 't134'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, are there any paths that can produce 't134'? Let's look through the productions:\n\n- NT56 -> 't112'\n- NT46 -> 't87' or 't4' or 't73' (looking at the later productions)\nWait, under NT46, I see multiple productions, including NT46 -> 't87', NT46 -> 't41', ..., but no direct 't134' is listed. So perhaps 't134' is part of a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't134' comes from expanding a non-terminal that is connected to other non-terminals. For example, maybe NT29 can derive into 't134' indirectly.\n\nLooking into NT29, I see NT29 -> NT20 NT24, which then perhaps can derive into something that results in 't134', but I don't see NT29 directly leading to 't134'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol S can lead to NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27, and let's explore NT28 and NT1 separately.\n\nNT28 is defined as NT4 NT6. So S can go to NT4 and NT6, which would then need to produce certain strings.\n\nNT4 is NT21 NT15, and NT15 is either NT56 NT15 or NT46 NT15. So NT15 seems to produce different possibilities.\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nSince the string starts with 't134', 't84', 't73', etc., which might be leaves of the parse tree. So each terminal in the string must correspond to a leaf in the grammar's BNF.\n\nAn alternative approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be derived by some path.\n\nLet's list the terminals: t134, t84, t73, t31, t17, t109, t126, t29, t80, t65, t31, t8, t135, t122, t62, t14, t89, t78, t97, t128, t105, t31, t119, t2.\n\nFirst, check if any of these terms are already present as non-terminals in the grammar's RHS. Or, perhaps, whether they can be generated through the grammar.\n\nFor example, 't134' is in the first token. I need to see if there is a production that eventually leads to 't134'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nI see NT46 -> 't4', NT28 -> 't8', etc. But I don't directly see 't134' being produced as a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps it's in the RHS of a more complex production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't134' is a derived term after multiple steps. Let's see, starting from S, expanding step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to look at what S can produce. Let me see:\n\nS -> NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nTaking the first case: NT1 and NT28.\n\nNT1 -> NT25 NT17.\n\nNT25 -> NT6 NT31.\n\nNT6 -> NT54 NT6.\n\nNT54 is another non-terminal; looking at its productions, NT54 -> NT53 NT54 or NT36 NT54. Hmm, this seems to lead into a loop. Wait, maybe not. Let me check NT54: \n\nFrom the grammar, NT54: 't53' is a terminal. Wait, no: looking at the productions, I see NT54 -> 't53'. So NT54 can directly produce 't53'. Or wait, let me recheck:\n\nIn the grammar, NT56 -> 't112', NT54 -> 't53'.\n\nWait, in the initial provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT53: 't105' (from NT45 -> 't112', etc., but looking into NT53, it's part of a production where NT9 can be 't19' or NT46 -> 't97' (when NT17 is 't94' and so on.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first term is 't134', so let's see if any non-terminals can be mapped to this.\n\nWait, maybe 't134' is part of a derived production chain. To find that, perhaps 't134' is generated under a different non-terminal. For instance, looking at NT35, which has a production to 't105'. But 't134' isn't directly there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't134' is connected via multiple expansions. But without knowing the exact derivation, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't134' is generated by NT46. Looking into the grammar, I see that NT46 is involved in several productions: NT46 -> 't87', 't41', 't40', etc., but no 't134'. So that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't134' is generated by some NT that isn't listed in the grammar, which would immediately mean the string isn't derivable.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I should check if all the terminals in the string can be derived from some combination of non-terminals.\n\nFor example, let's take 't134' \u2013 does any production produce this? If I scan the RHS of all productions, the only place I see 't' followed by a number is in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-465","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. That helps because parsing might be more straightforward, but I'm not planning to do a full parse right now.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t66 t73 t120 t63 t11 t3 t38 t114 t117 t81 t83 t117 t28 t81 t93 t109 t52 t31 t50 t3 t62 t31 t28 t48`.\n\nI think the approach is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So each production of S results in two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals will then be expanded, potentially further, until terminals are the only symbols left, which should match the input string.\n\nBut wait, each production in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, starting with S, each step will replace a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. The process continues until all non-terminals are replaced, and we're left with a sequence of terminals that must match the input.\n\nThis seems like a top-down approach, simulating the parse. However, given the complexity, maybe I should look for a way to decompose the string based on the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that some parts might correspond to specific non-terminals. Let's see if I can find patterns or a path from S down to the string.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nLet me try the first option: S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So, NT1 and NT28.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT1 is rewritten as NT25 NT17. So, expanding NT1 gives NT25 NT17.\n\nNow, NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. So, expanding NT25 gives NT6 NT31.\n\nLooking at the string, I see 't3' appears early. Let's see where 't3' comes from. Looking at the grammar, some symbols produce 't':\n- NT7 \u2192 't62' (Wait, no, NT7 \u2192 't93' and 't7' is another symbol).\nWait, in the grammar, NT7 has two productions: \u2192 NT35 NT46 and \u2192 't93'. NT46 has productions like \u2192 t8, t24, t120, etc.\n\nWait, let me list all rule productions where a terminal is on the right:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- NT46 \u2192 't87' (twice), 't8', 't24', 't27', 't62', etc. Wait, this might be helpful. Maybe 't3' comes from another rule.\n\nWait, looking in the grammar, NT28 \u2192 't63'. Hmm, in the string, I have 't63' at position 4 (0-based index 3). So maybe NT28 is 't63'. But wait, looking at the grammar, NT28 can only go to NT4 NT6. Wait, no\u2014looking again at the grammar: 'NT28 -> NT4 NT6'.\n\nWait, so in the grammar, NT28 is rewritten as NT4 NT6, not necessarily a terminal. The string has t63, which is a terminal. So how does that fit?\n\nThis might mean that the expansion of NT28 eventually leads to t63 through its productions. Let me see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6.\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15. Oh wait, this could be an infinite loop. But in the string, 't63' is followed by 't11', etc. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps it's better to try to reverse-engineer the string by seeing which symbols can appear where.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. The string starts with 't66 t73 t120 t63 t11 t3 t38 t114 t117 t81 t83 t117 t28 t81 t93 t109 t52 t31 t50 t3 t62 t31 t28 t48'.\n\nSo it starts with several terminals. Let me see if I can match this starting sequence to any possible expansion starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree from the string. Let me try to find where 't3' comes into play.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 has the rule NT6 NT3. So NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which could lead to t3 eventually if NT6 expands to a terminal. Wait, looking at NT6's rules: NT6 has rule 't58' and 't62' among others. Wait, looking specifically at the grammar, NT6 can produce 't62'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't58' or 't62' or 't58' again? Wait, checking:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't58' and 't62', right? So NT6 can produce t58 or t62.\n\nSimilarly, NT15 expands to NT56 NT15. NT56 \u2192 't112' or 't16', etc. Hmm, this seems a bit tangled.\n\nWait, let's try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar. For instance, looking at the string's beginning: 't66 t73 t120 t63 ...'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can try to find NT66 or something, but the grammar doesn't have 't66' as a production. So 't66' must be produced by some NT rule. Wait, in the grammar, looking at the rules for terminals:\n\nWait, all the terminals are prefixed with 't' followed by a number except for the NT entries.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see rules like NT14 \u2192 't79', NT22 \u2192 't58', etc. So if a non-terminal expands to 't14', that means that NT14 can produce 't14' through a production. So for example, if a non-terminal becomes 't14', then that's 't14'.\n\nIn the string, we have 't66' as the first symbol, which is not any of the terminal symbols listed. Wait, does the grammar have any NT that can produce 't66'? Looking through the grammar, I don't see 't66' as an explicit terminal. So 't66' must be produced by a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, are there any rules that end with 't66'? Let's check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10, which is not a terminal.\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't58' or 't62' or 't48'.\n\nWait, NT6 can't produce 't66', so 't66' must come from some other non-terminal.\n\nLooking further, maybe NT32 \u2192 't66'?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT32's production is: NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13. So, it's two non-terminals. So the expansion of NT32 would go through NT15 and NT13. But that leads to more non-terminals, so 't66' could possibly come from NT32, but maybe via some chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, looking through the grammar for where 't66' is a possible terminal. Maybe a non-terminal I haven't considered.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the production rules again to see if any non-terminal rule has 't66' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through each production in the grammar:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13 \u2192 does not produce a terminal.\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't114' etc.\u2014no.\n\nWait, looking deeper, NT6 \u2192 't62' and 't58'; not 't66'. Maybe somewhere in the expansion, a non-terminal can reach 't66'? Or perhaps 't66' isn't even part of the grammar and thus the string is invalid. But wait, the string includes 't66' so it should match a production. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't66' is generated by a non-terminal that I haven't considered yet.

{"custom_id":"request-481","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, this looks a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, I see some produce a single terminal, like NT46 -> 't8', which is a terminal. So the grammar includes terminals, which are the actual characters in the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t66 t4 t45 t28 t65 t123 t1 t62 t116 t3 t79 t81 t117 t3 t126 t15 t48 t52 t27 t107 t34 t76 t4 t19 t3`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure about the specifics here. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me see the grammar rules. I'll list out the rules and terminals first.\n\nLooking at each rule, some produce terminals like 't8', 't93', 't97', etc. So each production can generate a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if the string can be built using these.\n\nLet's try to match the string from the grammar. I'll start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with 't66'. Looking at the rules, which NT can produce 't66'? Checking the rules, I see NT32 -> 't66'. So 't66' comes from NT32. Now, NT32's production in CNF must split into two NTs. Looking at the rules, let's see what NT32 produces. Oh, wait, in the given grammar, NT32 -> 't66' is a terminal, but wait, in CNF, all rules should be non-terminals producing two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as a list of productions, each of the form S -> ..., NT36 -> ..., etc. Some of them produce a single terminal, like NT46 -> 't8', etc. So NT32 in the rules is 'NT32 -> 't66'', meaning NT32 is a terminal, but that doesn't make sense because in CNF, all rules should be for non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check.\n\nNo, in the given grammar, some rules produce a single terminal, like NT46 -> 't8', which is allowed. So NT46 is a non-terminal that produces the terminal 't8'. Similarly, some rules produce two non-terminals. So the process is, for each step, replace a non-terminal with its production (either a terminal or two non-terminals).\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, and to generate it, each non-terminal must parse into that terminal sequence.\n\nLet me attempt to reconstruct the parse tree starting from the left.\n\nThe string starts with 't66'. Looking back, the rule NT32 -> 't66' (I think). Wait, in the given rules, I see NT32 -> 't66'? Let me check the provided rules.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT32 -> NT15 NT13.\n\nWait, that's a production for NT32 as two non-terminals. But then, does NT32 ever produce a terminal? I don't see that. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, another rule: NT32 -> 't66' is not present. Wait, let me double-check. The rules provided don't list NT32 -> 't66'; instead, NT32 is in the list as NT32 -> NT15 NT13.\n\nHmm, so if the string starts with 't66', but according to the grammar, NT32 can't produce 't66', then perhaps 't66' must be generated by some other rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT32 -> NT15 NT13. That's one option. Another option?\n\nWait, I don't see another production for NT32. So probably, NT32 only has two non-terminals as options.\n\nTherefore, 't66' must be produced by some other non-terminal, which in turn must have a production that results in 't66'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't66' is generated by a different non-terminal that eventually splits into the necessary rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for a non-terminal that can produce 't66' through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me start from the beginning of the string and see possible matches.\n\nThe first symbol is 't66'. So I need to find a non-terminal that can produce 't66' as its expansion.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT21 produces 't3' and 't3'. Not helpful here.\n\n- NT32: as mentioned, it's 'NT32 -> NT15 NT13' but does it ever produce 't66'? No, I don't see that.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look through all the terminal rules:\n\nNT29 -> 't48'\nNT24 -> 't122'\nNT46 -> 't134'\nNT35 -> 't112'\nNT24 -> 't62'\nNT46 -> 't53'\nNT35 -> 't93'\nNT17 -> 't94'\nNT27 -> 't124'\nNT24 -> 't29'\nNT46 -> 't76'\nNT56 -> 't112'\nNT14 -> 't79'\nNT26 -> 't48'\nNT13 -> 't16'\nNT55 -> 't45'\nNT9 -> 't19'\nNT29 -> 't48'\nNT28 -> 't76'\nNT41 -> 't4'\nNT32 -> 't66' (Wait, no, NT32 is in the rules as NT32 -> NT15 NT13. Where does 't66' come from?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's see, the rule for NT32 is: NT32 -> NT15 NT13. Does any other NT produce 't66'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT6 -> 't58', NT15 -> 't50', NT28 -> 't76', NT41 -> 't4', etc. I don't see a rule that produces 't66' as a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with 't66', but according to the given rules, no NT directly produces 't66'.\n\nWait, that can't be. Maybe I misread the rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT6 -> 't58'\n- NT32 -> 't66' \u2014 Oh, no, wait. Wait, looking back, in the rules, I see: NT32 -> NT15 NT13. So it's two NTs. I was wrong earlier; I didn't see 't66' being directly produced by any NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread and missed the rule for NT32. Let me go through each rule again:\n\nNT32 is defined as 'NT32 -> NT15 NT13'. So it doesn't directly produce 't66'. So how does 't66' get generated?\n\nWait, perhaps the rule for NT15 or NT13 can produce 't66'.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT15: NT15 -> NT56 NT15. That's a recursive definition. Not helpful.\n\nLooking at NT13: NT13 -> NT43 NT26. Not helpful.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 -> 't58' \u2014 not 't66'.\n\nHmm, where is 't66' coming from? It seems that 't66' isn't directly produced by any NT in the given grammar. That would mean the first symbol can't be produced, so the string isn't in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me search for 't66' in all the rules.\n\nLooking through, I don't see 't66' as the result of any production. So it's impossible for 't66' to be the first symbol. Therefore, the entire string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a step-by-step derivation I'm missing, but given the rules, 't66' can't be generated, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided string begins with the terminal symbol 't66'.

Since the string has 27 tokens, the parse tree should have a structure that allows each token to be mapped to a production.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll approach this step by step, trying to see if each token in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI'll start from the first token, t81. Looking at the NT45 productions, I see NT45 \u2192 't109', which isn't t81. NT35 \u2192 't105', also not. NT37 \u2192 't17', nope. NT46 \u2192 't27' or 't8', not t81. NT41 \u2192 't52', no. NT26 \u2192 't48' or 't98', no. Not finding t81 yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for NTs that produce t81. Scanning the grammar, I see NT54 \u2192 't53' and NT55 \u2192 't45'. None. Looking further, NT22 \u2192 't58' or 't124', nope. NT39 \u2192 't131' or 't116', so wait, NT39 can produce t116. How does that help?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's create a parse tree.\n\nBut with 27 tokens, this is tedious. Maybe the string is a concatenation of certain terminals that can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can check each step, starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nLet's see if the string starts with either NT1 or NT50.\n\nLooking for what NT1 and NT50 produce. From the grammar:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 or NT6 \u2192 't58' or 't62'. Hmmm.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t81. Does any NT produce t81? Looking through the grammar, I see NT46 \u2192 't76' or 't112', not t81. NT39 \u2192 't131' or 't116' as mentioned earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminals and see which NTs produce them.\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT \u2192 terminal:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 t8, t27, t41, t46, t53, etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 t94, t97\n- NT27 \u2192 t124, t24, t58, t17, t29, t105, t22, t26, etc.\nWait, this might take a while. Maybe a better approach is to reverse-engineer the string, starting from the end.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of terminals. Let me list them:\n\nt81, t116, t107, t65, t62, t91, t37, t124, t135, t34, t21, t91, t131, t53, t19, t21, t80, t50, t120, t78, t109, t11, t83, t91, t87.\n\nMaybe I can check which NTs produce these terminals directly.\n\nLooking for t81: any NT \u2192 t81? Let me go through the grammar:\n\nLooking through all NT productions, I see NT14 \u2192 t79. NT25 \u2192 t107? Let me check NT25's productions: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31, NT6 \u2192 t54 or t58, etc. Doesn't directly produce t81.\n\nWait, maybe I should look more carefully. Let's go step by step for each token in the string and see if each can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the derivation step by step.\n\nWait, another approach: the start symbol is S, which produces NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nIf I can show that the string can be derived from either S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27, then it's possible.\n\nBut it's a long string, so perhaps focusing on the first few tokens would be more efficient.\n\nFirst token is t81. So, whatever NT1 or NT50 produces first token as t81.\n\nLooking at NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 \u2192 't54' or NT6 \u2192 t58, t62, etc.\n\nAlternatively, NT6 can produce t58 or t62. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 | NT66 | NT67? Wait, according to the grammar provided:\n\nWait, looking back, the provided grammar shows:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 | NT62.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT6 is defined as:\n\nNT6 -> NT54 NT6\n\nNT6 -> NT62\n\nSo, NT6 can produce NT54 NT6 or NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT54 \u2192 't53' or...?\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't53' (wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 -> 't53'\n\nSo, NT6 \u2192 't53' via NT54.\n\nWait, actually, I need to look for NT6 \u2192 't53' or directly for producing t81.\n\nWait, t81 is the first token. So, if the string is generated, the initial production should lead to t81.\n\nBut from the start symbol S, the first step is to produce either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nSo, each of these would produce two non-terminals, which would then need to derive t81 as the first token.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because S is split into two parts, each of which may produce a series of non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first token comes from NT1 or NT25, depending on the initial split.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I should map possible derivation steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long for the grammar to handle, considering that Chomsky Normal Form grammars can generate all possible strings given the right productions, but with a limit on the derivations.\n\nBut perhaps the string has a sequence that cannot be matched by the given rules.\n\nWait, but without a step-by-step derivation, it's impossible to be 100% sure. However, since this is a thought process, I can try to outline how I might approach it.\n\nStarting with the first token, t81. Looking through the NT productions, does any NT directly produce t81? From the provided grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t81.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't8' (no)\n- NT54 \u2192 't53' (no)\n- Other NTs are for various terminals, but none produce t81.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong. Let me check all NT productions to see if any produce t81.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT producing t81 directly. So, the first token in the string, t81, cannot be directly produced by any NT in this grammar. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the user is providing a specific string to check. Maybe I missed an NT.\n\nWait, checking the grammar again: looking for terminal strings:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't8', 't27', 't41', 't46', 't53', etc.\n\n- NT17 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-502","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, along with the string to check. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form has productions where each non-terminal generates exactly two terminals or a single non-terminal. The grammar given seems to fit CNF since each production on the left side of the arrow has two non-terminals on the right, except for some where a single non-terminal is on the right (like S -> NT1 NT28, which seems to have two non-terminals, but wait, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. Wait, yes, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this case, every production on the left has exactly two on the right, which is correct. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe string to check is: `t48 t38 t58 t21 t38 t108 t93 t65 t66 t94 t41 t50 t17 t81 t5 t15 t98 t58 t102 t62 t116 t70 t87 t120 t48 t93`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be produced by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a method similar to the CYK algorithm or parse the string step by step, checking possible derivations.\n\nBut before diving deep, maybe I can look for any terminals that are only produced in specific ways or if any terminals are dead ends. Let me check if all the terminals used in the string are covered by the grammar. The string has terminals like t48, t38, t58, etc., so I need to ensure each of these terminals is defined in the grammar. Looking through the productions, each terminal (like t48, t38, etc.) seems to be explicitly defined as a production, such as NT46 -> 't24' and others. So the terminals are all accounted for.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, every step in the parse will involve replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we get down to the terminals. Alternatively, we can model this as a series of steps where each production is applied to the string, replacing non-terminals with their right-hand sides until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the CYK algorithm would be efficient, but given the length of the string and the number of non-terminals, it might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t48, which corresponds to NT46. From the productions, NT46 can produce 't24' and something else. Let me check the productions for NT46: Looking through the grammar, I see NT46 -> 't87', NT46 -> 't24', and another production NT46 -> 't27'. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't87'\nNT46 -> 't24'\nNT46 -> 't27'\n\nWait, in the initial part of the grammar, it says NT46 -> NT20 NT8, but then later in the detailed productions, NT46 can produce 't24'. So, each production is either replacing NT46 with two non-terminals or with a terminal. \n\nSo, the process would involve starting with S and replacing it step by step according to the productions until reaching the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the string can be broken down via the productions. Let's try to parse the string step by step, trying to find a possible derivation.\n\nThe string is: t48 t38 t58 t21 t38 t108 t93 t65 t66 t94 t41 t50 t17 t81 t5 t15 t98 t58 t102 t62 t116 t70 t87 t120 t48 t93\n\nThis is a list of 26 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each parse step reduces the number of symbols by replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, effectively increasing the count by one each step until we reach the starting symbol S with two non-terminals. Wait, but that leads to longer strings. Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. When you derive, you replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, increasing the number of symbols. But here, the original string is a single sequence of terminals, so it would represent a derivation path leading to that string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe thinking about building a parse tree and ensuring that the string can be decomposed into the productions.\n\nLet me try to see if each terminal in the string can be matched to a production. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe first token is t48. Looking for NT48 productions. From the grammar:\n\nNT48 doesn't appear in the initial set, but looking deeper, perhaps. Wait, in the detailed productions:\n\nNT44 -> NT38 NT13\nNT47 -> NT40 NT36\nNT29 -> NT20 NT24\nNT29 also has NT20 NT41, but that might not be relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals. Let me try to map each terminal to their production:\n\nt48: NT46 -> 't24' (but that's t24, not t48. Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express all the NT-X productions that produce terminals.\n\nFrom the detailed grammar, I can list NT-X -> terminal:\n\n- NT6 -> 't54' (Wait, in the grammar, it's NT6 -> 't54' ?

{"custom_id":"request-506","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: `t65 t42 t21 t84 t27 t36 t122 t31 t48 t126 t116 t84 t122 t21 t48 t63 t97 t111 t63 t62 t78 t112 t108 t28 t81 t40`. That's a lot of tokens, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form is structured such that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The CFG given seems to have productions that sometimes produce terminals like 't', but also non-terminals. So, each non-terminal must expand into two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the productions start with S or NT followed by two NTs, like S \u2192 NT1 NT28, or S \u2192 NT50 NT27, etc. These must be the start points. So, the string starts with S, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two others until terminals are reached.\n\nI need to see if the given string can be derived from S using these productions. Let's start by parsing the string from left to right, checking each token to see if it can be produced by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nBreaking down the string:\n\nt65, t42, t21, t84, t27, t36, t122, t31, t48, t126, t116, t84, t122, t21, t48, t63, t97, t111, t63, t62, t78, t112, t108, t28, t81, t40.\n\nI notice that some terminals could be produced by NTs. For example, looking at the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45, and NT45 \u2192 't8'. So, perhaps NT45 can produce 't8'. Similarly, NT37 \u2192 't7t', but in the string, I don't see such combinations immediately.\n\nLet me try to map each token to possible non-terminals:\n\n1. t65: Looking at the grammar, NT21 \u2192 't84'. Hmm, but 65 is a number. Wait, maybe I need to see which NTs produce t65. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't65'. So, maybe t65 is produced by NT10. Looking at NT10, its productions are: NT10 \u2192 NT34 NT15 and NT10 \u2192 't2'. So t65 is likely from NT10, but NT10 only produces t2 or combines NT34 and NT15. Maybe I'm missing something here, but I think t65 isn't directly a terminal, so perhaps it's a terminal symbol in the grammar. Wait, no, the grammar seems to have some NTs that produce t-something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at all the NTs and see which produce t-numbers. For example, NT10 \u2192 t2, NT21 \u2192 t84, NT27 \u2192 t124, NT22 \u2192 t58, NT1 \u2192 t69, etc. So, 't65' isn't listed as a terminal production, so maybe I need to find an NT that can produce it. Alternatively, perhaps the string contains tokens not covered by the grammar, which would mean the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that some NTs produce specific 't's. Let me list all the 't' productions:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't2'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT21 \u2192 't84'\n- NT22 \u2192 't58', 't48', 't78'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29', 't97', 't11', 't62', 't102'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124', 't55', 't126', 't50', 't76', 't87', 't17', 't16', 't50', 't65'?\n- Wait, looking back, NT27's productions include 't124', 't16', etc., but I don't see 't65' there. Similarly, NT33, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t65. So, perhaps the string contains a terminal that's not present in the grammar, which would mean the string isn't in the language, hence the answer is 'No'. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT27 has a production NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4. NT54 \u2192 't53', and NT4 \u2192 't91'. So, if I expand NT27, it could produce 't53' and 't91', which is 't53t91'. But in the string, I see 't65' which isn't appearing here. Maybe another NT produces t65. Looking elsewhere: NT24 has 't11', 't97', etc., but not t65. NT10 only produces t2. NT34 produces 't37', etc.\n\nWait a minute, the grammar seems to have some NTs that produce 't's, but perhaps the provided string includes a 't65' which no NT can produce. Alternatively, perhaps I need to see if 't65' can be part of an expansion of some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules again, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't65'. The closest is NT27 which can produce 't54' and 't4', but that would produce 't54t91', which is 't5491', not 't65'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't65' is a typo or I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the grammar has a typo, but I shouldn't assume that.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string contains a 't65' that can't be derived from any NT, which would mean the string isn't in the language. But I'm not 100% certain. Another angle: maybe the string is built correctly, but I need to find a way to parse it step by step.\n\nLet me try to start from the beginning:\n\nThe string starts with 't65'. Since none of the NTs directly produce t65, perhaps t65 is the result of an NT that doesn't directly produce a terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, all non-terminals either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for the string to have t65, the corresponding NT must produce it directly via a production to a terminal. But in the grammar, I don't see any NT that produces t65. So this might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping. Let me double-check all the NTs and their terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 t2\n- NT17 \u2192 t94\n- NT21 \u2192 t84\n- NT22 \u2192 t58, t48, t78\n- NT24 \u2192 t29, t97, t11, t62, t102\n- NT27 \u2192 t124, 't69' is for NT1, which may not be relevant here. NT27's terminals are not including t65.\n- NT33's rules: t79, t97, etc.\n- NT45 \u2192 t8\n- NT37 \u2192 t17\n- Wait, looking through all the rules, I can't find any NT that produces 't65'. The closest is NT24 which has t97, t112, etc., but not t65.\n\nSo, if the string has a 't65', but no NT in the grammar can produce it, then that token would make the entire string invalid because it's unattainable from the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misunderstood the grammar's rules. The grammar is in CNF, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the only terminals are the ones explicitly mentioned, like 't7', 't8', etc., but perhaps 't65' is a different terminal. However, looking at the grammar, I don't see 't65' being produced by any NT. So it seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me go through the rules carefully again to make sure.

{"custom_id":"request-521","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. The grammar is a bit complex with multiple non-terminals, and the string provided is a sequence of tokens like 't21', 't83', etc. I need to figure out if the given string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, I see a mix. Some rules produce two non-terminals, which is fine, but I notice some also have terminals on the right side. Wait, actually, in CNF, it should only have two non-terminals on the right. Let me check a few rules.\n\nLooking at the top-level productions:\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- S \u2192 NT50 NT27\nHmm, these seem to produce two non-terminals, which is correct for CNF. But all other non-terminals have productions where they split into two non-terminals except some that have terminals.\n\nWait a minute, for example:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT45 \u2192 NT40 NT36\nThis seems fine in terms of structure. But now, looking further, I spot some productions like:\n- NT10 \u2192 NT65\nWait, but NT65 isn't a non-terminal; it's a terminal? Or maybe it's a typo because in the grammar, it should only have non-terminals. Looking back, I see that some non-terminals have terminal strings, but in standard CNF, all symbols on the right side should be non-terminals. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, going through the grammar, the rules have on the right-hand side either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal? For example, NT14 \u2192 NT79 NT9. Wait, but no, that's two non-terminals. Wait, hold on. Let me check all the rules.\n\nLooking at some of the rules:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT13 \u2192 NT43 NT26\n- NT22 \u2192 NT49 NT14\n- NT23 \u2192 NT17 NT25\nWait, but I'm looking for any production that has a terminal directly, but in this grammar, it seems each non-terminal on the right side is a non-terminal. Oh, here's a rule: NT17 \u2192 t94. That's a terminal right-hand side! So the grammar isn't in Chomsky normal form because some rules have terminals on the right-hand side. That\u2019s confusing because the user said it\u2019s in CNF, but I have to double-check. Alternatively, maybe it's in a modified form.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo or miswrote the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps the non-terminals that split into a terminal and a non-terminal are allowed in CNF?\n\nNo, in Chomsky normal form, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a where a is a single terminal. So any production that splits into more than two symbols is invalid, but in this case, all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, which isn't allowed. So perhaps this is not in proper CNF, which the user mentioned, but assuming I have to proceed, I might proceed as if the user presented a partially correct grammar, but perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the 'a' in the RHS refers to a terminal, so even if it's written as two symbols, if one is terminal, it's not in CNF. So perhaps I should proceed as if that's the case, perhaps treating such rules as allowed for the sake of this problem, but it might complicate things.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I should proceed to analyze the given string. The string consists of these tokens: t21, t83, t3, t80, t134, t50, t21, t65, t89, t78, t38, t8, t38, t28, t19, t80, t111, t34, t119, t58, t98, t41, t73, t59, t81, t63, t105.\n\nEach token like 't83' is perhaps a terminal symbol. So to see if this string is generated by the given grammar, I need to find a derivation path from S to this string, expanding non-terminals step by step, replacing them with their productions until only terminals remain.\n\nBut the issue is that the grammar's structure is complex. So perhaps another approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a sequence of terminals generated by the grammar. So each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol.\n\nBut without knowing the actual non-terminals and how they derive to these 't's, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps each 'tX' is a production of a non-terminal NTX, but looking through the grammar, I see that each non-terminal expands into other non-terminals, but some produce terminal sequences.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I realize that NT10 \u2192 't2'. That's a terminal production. Similarly, NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which would require more steps to reach a terminal. So perhaps I can model this as a bottom-up approach, checking if each terminal can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLet me list the rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't2'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT45 \u2192 't81'\n- NT9 \u2192 't19'\n- NT35 \u2192 't17'\n- NT7 \u2192 't93', 't97'\n- NT46 \u2192 't76', 't3', 't4', etc.\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, some non-terminals have terminal symbols as their expansion. For example:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't2'\n\nSo, the string has t2, t83, etc. But t83 is not a terminal in the grammar because none of the non-terminals directly produce t83.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if each of these t tokens are present in the grammar. Let me see the rule NT8: no, in the given grammar, I don't see any production for NT8. Looking at the grammar again, perhaps NT28 has rules that produce t8 and t9, but the main string has t83, which isn't a terminal in any non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, no. Let's list each non-terminal's production and see if they include any 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15\n- NT0 \u2192 NT31 NT50\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT13 \u2192 NT43 NT26\n- NT22 \u2192 NT35 NT34\n- NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16\n- NT24 \u2192 NT40 NT17\n- NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\n- NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT8\n- NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45\n- NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT9\n- NT22 \u2192 NT49 NT14\n- NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3\n- NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- etc.\nWait, but none of these seem to directly produce any t-number. Except looking at the production for NT10: NT10 \u2192 't2', which would expand to the token t2.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 \u2192 't58'\n\nLooking at the given string, tokens include 't2', 't83', 't3', 't80', 't134', etc. So 't2' is produced by NT10; 't58' by NT6. But 't83', 't3', 't80', 't134' don't seem to be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. For example, NT13 \u2192 NT43 NT26, but if either leads to a terminal, but none of the rules directly, from non-terminals, produce t83, t3, etc. The only terminals are t2, t58, etc., as per the grammar.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated by the grammar, all its tokens must be among the terminals that some non-terminal can produce.\n\nLooking back, the string has a token 't38', which in the grammar has NT44 \u2192 t114, etc. Wait, let me look for t3. From the grammar: NT34 \u2192 't38' is produced. So 't38' is from NT44's rule.\n\nWait, no, looking at NT34 \u2192 't38'?

{"custom_id":"request-528","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to go step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. That should make parsing easier, but I'm not sure how that helps right away.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t16 t80 t91 t100 t80 t76 t89 t70 t78 t2 t11 t11 t1 t42 t45 t76 t128 t58 t91 t8 t66 t19 t83 t3 t29 t14 t100`. It starts with `t16`, which matches the production rule for NT16: `NT16 -> NT10 NT34`. So I need to break down the string into substrings that correspond to these productions.\n\nLet me list the production rules that end with terminals (they have 't' followed by numbers):\n\n- NT16 -> t2 NT34 (since NT16 leads to NT10 and NT34, but looking at the rules, NT16 -> NT10 NT34, and NT10 -> t2, NT34 -> t37 perhaps? Wait, I need to check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT10 -> t2\nNT16 -> NT10 NT34: so NT16 would produce t2 followed by NT34.\n\nBut the string starts with t16, so perhaps the NT16 rule isn't the one here. Wait, the grammar uses NT (non-terminals) and terminals (t followed by numbers). Each production is a combination of NTs on the right, and terminals are the leaves.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to parse the string step by step, trying to match the rules. Starting with the entire string, see if it can be split into two parts according to any production rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to look for the longest possible match first, or the shortest. Let's see.\n\nThe string is: t16 t80 t91 t100 t80 t76 t89 t70 t78 t2 t11 t11 t1 t42 t45 t76 t128 t58 t91 t8 t66 t19 t83 t3 t29 t14 t100\n\nFirst token is t16. Looking through the rules, I see NT16 -> NT10 NT34. NT10 is a terminal t2, and NT34 can produce t37. Wait, but in the string, after t16, the next is t80. Wait, t16 is followed by t80, but according to NT16's production, it would be followed by t2, then t37. That doesn't match t80. So maybe NT16 isn't the starting point.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is a sequence of terminals, and each production replaces a non-terminal with two terminals or other non-terminals. So, for example, the initial step would be to split the entire string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt16, t80, t91, t100, t80, t76, t89, t70, t78, t2, t11, t11, t1, t42, t45, t76, t128, t58, t91, t8, t66, t19, t83, t3, t29, t14, t100\n\nThat's 27 tokens. So the grammar must generate a string of 27 terminals.\n\nNow, I need to see if the entire string can be matched by the grammar. Let's see how the productions can chain together.\n\nStarting with S, the initial production is S -> NT1 NT28 or S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider both options and see if either can produce the string.\n\nLet's try S -> NT1 NT28 first.\n\nNT1's production is NT42 NT4. Looking at the rules, NT42 -> t2, t42. Not sure.\n\nWait, let me check each production:\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 -> NT25 NT17. NT25 -> NT6 NT31. NT6 -> t58. NT31 -> t117. That seems too deep. Maybe not matching the string.\n\nAlternatively, NT17: NT17 -> NT44 NT53. NT44 -> t89. NT53 -> t15. So NT17 produces t89, t15.\n\nSo NT1 -> NT25 NT17 -> t58 t117 (but the string starts with t16). So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nNT50 -> NT15 NT50. NT15 -> NT56 NT15. NT56 -> t20 NT17. Wait, this could get lengthy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by parsing the string backwards.\n\nThe last token is t100. Looking for productions that end with t100.\n\nLooking at the rules, which NTs produce t100? \n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT10 -> t2: no\n- NT16 -> NT10 NT34: so t2 followed by whatever NT34 produces. No t100 here.\n- NT35 -> t35 t46\n- NT53 -> t8 t3\n- NT17 -> t94\n- NT27 -> t24\n- NT24 -> t66\n- NT15 -> t93\n- NT8 -> t102\n- NT55 -> t112\n- NT22 -> t58\n- NT26 -> t98\n- NT10 -> t2\n- NT46 -> t100?\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nUnder some rules, NT46 -> 't8' and 't100' and so on. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nI see:\n\nNT33 -> NT56 NT10: no.\n\nWait, actually, under the rules, some NTs produce terminals directly as t-numbers:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT36 -> t56 NT10\n\nWait, but the rules are from earlier, so perhaps I need to re-examine the entire list:\n\nLooking through all rules again:\n\nHmm, actually, I might have misinterpreted the rules.

Each of these non-terminals (NT1, NT28, NT50, NT27) then produce other NT symbols, and some produce terminal symbols like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t98 t34 t50 t82 t119 t114 t76 t5 t69 t105 t5 t91 t16 t131 t135 t93 t93 t3 t16 t134 t89 t124 t11 t69 t36 t63 t17 t41`.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into tokens based on spaces: [\"t98\", \"t34\", \"t50\", \"t82\", \"t119\", \"t114\", \"t76\", \"t5\", \"t69\", \"t105\", \"t5\", \"t91\", \"t16\", \"t131\", \"t135\", \"t93\", \"t93\", \"t3\", \"t16\", \"t134\", \"t89\", \"t124\", \"t11\", \"t69\", \"t36\", \"t63\", \"t17\", \"t41\"].\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal production results in exactly two symbols. To parse the string, I can count the number of symbols, which must be (n) where the string length is n, so the parse tree should have n-1 productions.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't98', which is a terminal symbol. So, I need to trace back from the top-down using the grammar to see how each 'tX' can be generated.\n\nLet me list the productions that produce 'tX' terminals as per the grammar. Looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't8'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- NT46 \u2192 't27'\n- NT8 \u2192 't102'\n- NT35 \u2192 't36' (but NT35 has other productions, so probably a better way is to list all NT that lead to terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the productions given towards the end are all the terminal productions, I think. Let me scan through the grammar to find all productions that end with a single 't' symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar end, I see many entries like:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't48'\n- NT46 \u2192 't24'\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\n- NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- NT47 \u2192 't3'\n- NT14 \u2192 't79'\n- NT26 \u2192 't98'\n- NT13 \u2192 't16'\n- NT55 \u2192 't45'\n- NT9 \u2192 't19'\n- NT29 \u2192 't48'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT41 \u2192 't4'\n- NT32 \u2192 't66'\n- NT10 \u2192 't50'\n- NT34 \u2192 't37'\n- NT47 \u2192 't40'\n- NT21 \u2192 't3'\n- NT36 \u2192 't87'\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT47 \u2192 't41'\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT15 \u2192 't48'\n- NT29 \u2192 't14'\n- NT6 \u2192 't21'\n- NT49 \u2192 't109'\n- NT33 \u2192 't79'\n- NT36 \u2192 't120'\n- NT38 \u2192 't102'\n- NT39 \u2192 't131'\n- NT14 \u2192 't58'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT10 \u2192 't17'\n- NT48 \u2192 't70'\n- NT27 \u2192 't116'\n- NT30 \u2192 't111'\n- NT43 \u2192 't69'\n- NT43 \u2192 't27'\n- NT42 \u2192 't82'\n- NT6 \u2192 't120'\n- NT1 \u2192 't28'\n- NT33 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't102'\n- NT10 \u2192 't65'\n- NT21 \u2192 't1'\n- NT38 \u2192 't123'\n- NT15 \u2192 't93'\n- NT4 \u2192 't91'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28'\n- NT26 \u2192 't98'\n- NT32 \u2192 't59'\n- NT19 \u2192 't126'\n- NT46 \u2192 't76'\n- NT56 \u2192 't134'\n- NT3 \u2192 't42'\n- NT45 \u2192 't73'\n- NT28 \u2192 't97'\n- NT44 \u2192 't114'\n- NT24 \u2192 't122'\n- NT46 \u2192 't100'\n- NT16 \u2192 't83'\n- NT13 \u2192 't135'\n- NT46 \u2192 't14'\n- NT7 \u2192 't79'\n- NT38 \u2192 't53'\n- NT36 \u2192 't59'\n- NT44 \u2192 't89'\n- NT55 \u2192 't15'\n- NT54 \u2192 't81'\n- NT46 \u2192 't15'\n- NT38 \u2192 't34'\n- NT14 \u2192 't4'\n- NT1 \u2192 't78'\n- NT47 \u2192 't114'\n- NT1 \u2192 't5'\n- NT31 \u2192 't117'\n- NT42 \u2192 't80'\n- NT10 \u2192 't42'\n- NT55 \u2192 't36'\n- NT15 \u2192 't87'\n- NT43 \u2192 't89'\n- NT17 \u2192 't63'\n- NT24 \u2192 't11'\n- NT0 \u2192 't126'\n- NT29 \u2192 't31'\n- NT50 \u2192 't38'\n- NT25 \u2192 't107'\n- NT6 \u2192 't119'\n- NT32 \u2192 't108'\n- NT22 \u2192 't128'\n- NT29 \u2192 't116'\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n- NT47 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, this seems a bit tedious.

{"custom_id":"request-544","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, but the string is quite long and seems complex. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form is a specific way to write CFGs where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because many algorithms, like the CYK parser, are designed to work with it.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the starting symbol is S, and the productions are all in CNF except for some parts. For example, I notice that some productions have more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side, like NT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46, but wait, no, in the given grammar, all the productions seem to follow A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Wait, actually, I need to check if all productions are of the form two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nUpon closer inspection, I see that all the productions are indeed in CNF because each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT1, etc., and some have a single terminal like NT46 \u2192 't8'.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t2 t80 t45 t128 t42 t59 t78 t108 t28 t58 t109 t112 t5 t98 t52 t134 t24 t8 t76 t29 t70 t34 t28 t70 t2 t126 t108 t117`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the productions are such that each step either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. However, CNF can sometimes lead to the need for parsers to handle multiple steps, but in this case, perhaps the string can be broken down into a series of steps that follow the grammar.\n\nBut dealing with this directly might be tricky. Maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by some non-terminal, and then see if the sequence as a whole can follow the production rules.\n\nSince the grammar is provided with all non-terminals and their productions, I might need to reconstruct possible derivations for the string. However, with such a long string, this seems impractical manually. So perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since the string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, each of which corresponds to a terminal symbol, I can see which non-terminals produce these terminals. For example, looking for which non-terminals have 't' as a production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10, but that breaks down further. Wait, the terminals like 't8' are produced by NT8. Wait, let's check the grammar rules for terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-568","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to determine if the string provided is generated by this grammar. The string is `t59 t94 t128 t108 t36 t38 t81 t107 t31 t41 t5 t19 t14 t66 t134 t24 t82 t34 t114 t50 t41 t82 t31 t76 t114 t122 t108 t34 t34`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided productions, I see multiple non-terminals with production rules, some producing terminals (like 't7' or 't8') and others producing other non-terminals.\n\nThe start symbol here seems to be S, and the string starts with t59, which is a terminal. So I need to find a path from S to t59 through the grammar.\n\nLooking at S, it has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo, the first step is to figure out which non-terminals can produce t59 or other components needed to form the string.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's see which NT can produce t59. Checking the rules, NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10, and NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17, but I don't see any NT producing t59 directly. Wait, let me check all NT rules to see if any of them produce t59.\n\nHmm, looking through the productions, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces t59. Let me go through each NT:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10: 56 and 10 are non-terminals. Then NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17, so that's deeper.\n- NT56 is involved in multiple steps, but not producing t59.\n- Looking for t59, perhaps it's a leaf node somewhere in the derivation tree. But I'm not seeing directly any NT that produces t59. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me list all NT productions to check.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t58\n- NT35 \u2192 t79\n- NT49 \u2192 t109\n- NT46 \u2192 t27\n- NT46 \u2192 t76\n- NT47 \u2192 t4\n- NT45 \u2192 t28\n- NT44 \u2192 t38\n- NT29 \u2192 t48\n- NT36 \u2192 t87\n- NT28 \u2192 t97\n- NT13 \u2192 t135\n- NT4 \u2192 t91\n- NT26 \u2192 t98\n- NT32 \u2192 t59\n- NT34 \u2192 t37\n- NT17 \u2192 t94\n- NT22 \u2192 t58\n- NT6 \u2192 t58\n- NT20 \u2192 t16\n- etc.\n\nWait a minute, looking at NT32: it produces t59 as the first symbol. NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13, so to get t59, we need to see if NT32 can be derived from S. So the string starts with t59, which comes from NT32.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t59. That means the first step in the derivation is S \u2192 NT32 NT13. Wait, but looking at the productions for S, the first option is S \u2192 NT1 NT28, and the second is S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Neither of these directly has NT32 involved. So this seems problematic. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I misread the production rules. Let me check all S productions again:\n\nS is split into two:\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo, to get NT32 as the first symbol, the initial step must be S \u2192 NT32 NT13. But in the given grammar, S doesn't have such a production; it only has S \u2192 NT1 NT28 and S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Therefore, the string cannot start with t59 because S cannot produce t59 directly.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's a production for NT1 or NT50 that leads to t59 through other steps.\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which can produce an infinite loop of t58. But t58 doesn't lead to t59.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm going too deep. Let me try to parse the string using possible steps.\n\nThe first symbol is t59, which comes from NT32 (NT32 \u2192 t59). But S doesn't produce NT32 directly. So unless there's a way for S to produce NT32 via other rules, which I don't see, the string cannot start with t59.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the grammar works. Perhaps NT1 is the start, but the initial S seems to be the top symbol. So without S \u2192 NT32, it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, since the first symbol t59 requires S to produce NT32, but S doesn't have that production, the string is not generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-565","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to determine if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. The grammar is quite large with many non-terminals (S, T, NT1, NT2, etc.) and terminals (t followed by numbers). \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, meaning each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each production looks like A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, and B, C, a are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t97 t58 t102 t2 t1 t53 t16 t80 t3 t134 t102 t24 t97 t65 t37 t108 t70 t108 t81 t87 t80 t93 t135 t123 t63 t69 t97 t108 t114.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, any generated string will have length equal to the number of non-terminals in the derivation plus one (starting from the start symbol). But given the number of symbols in the string, it's a long string, so I might need a methodical approach.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S. The S productions are:\nS -> NT1 NT28\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nSo any string generated by S must start with two non-terminals, either NT1 followed by NT28 or NT50 followed by NT27. Since the string starts with t97, I'll check which of these produces a terminal that starts with t97.\n\nLooking at NT27 in the grammar:\nNT27 -> NT14 NT4, NT25 NT45, NT29 NT4, NT22 NT4, etc.\nWait, actually, let's check NT27's productions:\nFrom the grammar, I see:\nNT27 -> NT39 NT16\nNT27 -> NT43 NT50\nNT27 -> NT24 NT14\nNT27 -> NT10 -> 't2' (Wait, no, wait. The productions for NT27 are under NT27, like:\nLooking back at the grammar, for example:\nNT27 -> NT14 NT4\nNT27 -> NT43 NT50\nNT27 -> NT24 NT14\nNT27 -> NT10 -> but wait, maybe it's in another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all productions for NT27. From the provided grammar:\n\nNT27: \nNT27 -> NT14 NT4 \nNT27 -> NT23 NT16 (Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check each line. Oh, perhaps it's easier to note that for any NT (like NT27), their productions are in the grammar section for NT27. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the relevant entries for NT27 (could be a typo, but assuming NT27 is correct):\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> NT14 NT4\n- NT27 -> NT43 NT50\n- NT27 -> NT24 NT14\n- NT27 -> NT10 -> 't2' (Is this correct? Wait, no. In the grammar, sometimes rules have the right-hand side as terminals. Let's check if there's a production where NT10 produces a terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar lines:\n\nLooking for NT10: Yes, here's a line:\nNT10 -> 't2'\n\nAh, so NT10 produces 't2'. So let me summarize the possible starting points.\n\nThe string starts with t97, which is a terminal. Looking at where t97 appears in the grammar. I see:\n\n- NT46 -> 't97'\n- NT3 -> 't97'\n- NT14 -> 't79'\n- NT7 -> 't97'\nWait, let's double-check each terminal occurrence.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are all 't' followed by a number. For example, 't97' appears in these rules:\n\nNT46 -> 't97'\nNT3 -> 't97'\nNT14 -> 't79' (no, that's not it)\nNT47 -> 't4' (no)\nWait, looking through each production:\n\nLooking for 't97':\n- NT46: 't97' is in NT46 -> 't46' (Wait, no, in the grammar, I see NT46's rules:\n\nWait, actually, looking through each line, let's spot 't97':\n\nIn the grammar:\n\n- NT46 -> 't97'\n- NT3 -> 't97'\n\nYes, so NT46 and NT3 both produce 't97'.\n\nSo, for the string starting with 't97', either NT46 or NT3 could be part of the derivation. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nGiven S can produce NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nIf the string starts with t97, and S produces NT50 NT27, then the first non-terminal would be NT50, which must produce the first 't97'. So let's see if NT50 can produce 't97'.\n\nLooking at NT50's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, let's find NT50's rules. The grammar shows:\n\nNT50 -> NT15 NT50\nWait, no. Let's check each line:\n\nLooking for NT50:\n\nNT50: 't17' is in NT50 -> 't50' is not, let's look for NT50's productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nLooking through each line for NT50:\n\n- NT50: the production seems to have 't1' somewhere. Wait, actually, in the grammar under NT50: \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to check each production for NT50.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT50 -> 't1' is under another rule. Wait, perhaps I've miscounted. Let me look for NT50:\n\nIn the provided grammar lines, I see:\n\nNT50: \"50 -> NT28 NT5\" but no, I think I need to parse correctly. Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that NT50's productions are given as:\n\nLooking through each rule in the grammar up to NT55:\n\nNT50: \n\n- NT50 -> 't42' (No, wait, in the grammar line under NT50, it's:\nNT50 -> NT15 NT50: No, wait, I think I made a mistake. Let's re-examine the grammar lines.\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT50: 't42' appears in NT50's production, but actually, let me find it. Wait, looking carefully, I see:\n\nNo, wait, perhaps it's easier to note that in the grammar provided, under NT50, there's this line:\n\nNT50 -> 't42'\n\nYes, I see:\n\nLine under NT50: \"50-> 't42'\". So NT50 can produce 't42' directly.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't97', not 't42', so if the string starts with t97, then the first non-terminal in the derivation must produce 't97', which could be NT46 or NT3.\n\nBut S starts with NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nIf S starts with NT46 NT27, then the first non-terminal is NT46, which could produce 't97' as NT46->'t97'.\n\nSo, the string starts with t97, which could come from NT46. Let's explore this path.\n\nSo the first step in the derivation would be S -> NT46 NT27.\n\nNow, the first symbol in the string is t97, which would be from NT46, assuming NT46 -> 't97', which is allowed.\n\nSo the right-hand side (RHS) would be NT46 NT27, and we look at the string. The first symbol is t97, which is the terminal, so the first part would consume that.\n\nWait, but in terms of parsing, each symbol in the string comes from a production, which is a sequence of non-terminals and terminals. So, the entire string is a series of terminals generated by the grammar. Therefore, the entire string must be a sequence of terminals produced by the grammar.\n\nSo, for S, the first symbol must be a terminal, which must come from either NT46 or NT27.\n\nWait, let's correct that. S is a non-terminal, and the string starts with t97, which is a terminal. So when S is expanded, it must produce a sequence that starts with a terminal. Since in CNF, each production for a non-terminal is either a single terminal (if possible) or two non-terminals.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-578","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. Hmm, let me start by understanding what I have here.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the start symbol which can also produce terminals directly. Wait, but actually in the rules provided, some of them have more than two non-terminals or are mixing non-terminals and terminals. Wait no, actually, some of the productions like S->NT1 NT10 have two non-terminals. But I think I might have made a mistake here because in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals except for the start symbol, which can produce terminals directly. Let me check those productions:\n\nLooking at S's productions:\nS -> NT1 NT10\nS -> NT50 NT27\nThat seems fine, both have two non-terminals. But wait, then looking elsewhere, like NT36-> NT56 NT10, that's two non-terminals, which is okay. Similarly, NT28\u2192 NT4 NT6, which is two non-terminals. So maybe this is correct.\n\nWait, but some rules have more than two, like NT6 -> NT54 NT6. That would be two non-terminals, so that's fine as well. Right, all the productions are in the form of two non-terminals, so this is a valid CNF grammar.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t27 t19 t41 t82 t98 t114 t79 t124 t37 t29 t124 t70 t81 t82 t109 t45 t105 t63 t134 t62 t119 t135 t126 t111 t42 t29 t120 t27 t84 t135.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, all with 't' followed by numbers. Now, I need to see if each of these 't...' tokens can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but since the string is quite long, that might be tedious. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be split into a derivation tree that starts from S.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from S in a way that the entire string is covered. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I notice that S starts with NT1 and NT10, etc. But looking at the string, the first token is t27. So we need to see which production rules can derive t27.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals can directly produce t27. Hmm, looking at the rules:\n\nNT27 -> NT39 NT16\nBut t27 starts with NT27, which breaks into two non-terminals. So that would mean t27 is part of a larger derivation. Alternatively, maybe I should look for rules where a non-terminal directly produces 't...' something.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT9 -> 't93', NT7 -> 't97', NT17 -> 't94', etc. These are terminals. So these non-terminals produce a single 't...'.\n\nFor example, NT17 can produce 't94', which is a single terminal. Similarly, NT29 can produce 't25' and other 't' strings.\n\nWait, but how does 't27' fit into this? Let's look for which non-terminal directly produces 't27'. Looking at the given rules, I notice:\n\nLooking at the end parts of rules, for example:\n\nNT17 is 't63', NT3 is 't42', NT14 is 't4', etc. Wait, no direct references to 't27' in the rules. So I might need to see if a production leads to 't27' through a series of rules.\n\nLooking at NT27: NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16. But neither NT39 nor NT16 produce 't27'. Alternatively, perhaps NT29: NT29 can produce 't25' and 't41', but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should see if the string can be constructed by the grammar step by step. Let's consider the first few terms:\n\nt27, t19, t41, t82, t98, t114...\n\nSo the first term is 't27', which should come from some non-terminal. Looking at the rules, NT27 can produce 't' followed by other things, but to get 't27', perhaps it's the result of a deeper production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed by a series of non-terminals that eventually produce 't27' and other terms. Since this is complex, maybe I should see if the entire string can be derived.\n\nWait, another approach: each non-terminal in the string must be the start of some subtree in the derivation. But since the string is quite long, let me think about possible subtrees that can generate these 't' strings.\n\nLooking at the rules, some non-terminals directly produce a 't', such as:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't93'\nNT7 \u2192 't97'\nNT17 \u2192 't94'\nNT27 \u2192 't104'? Wait, looking back: No, NT27's production is NT39 NT16, which don't produce 't104'. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the rules, a specific rule is NT17 \u2192 't94', so that's direct. Similarly, NT27 has a production that leads to two non-terminals. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string corresponds to a certain structure. Let's see how many symbols are there: the string is 30 symbols long. Each production in CNF splits into two non-terminals, so the number of symbols can be used to check the possible structure, but 30 is even, which could be possible.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the structure of the grammar to see if each step splits the string into parts that can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct a tree where each node is a non-terminal and each leaf is a terminal, ensuring that all the given symbols appear in order.\n\nAnother idea: since each production in CNF adds two symbols, the entire string length should be such that it's compatible with the number of splits. However, since the grammar allows for more than two symbols, maybe that's not so straightforward.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the string can be divided into parts that each production can cover.\n\nLooking at the first token 't27', which is part of NT27. But NT27 itself needs to be split into two non-terminals. So, for instance, if t27 is part of a larger structure, like two non-terminals derived from other parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of several products, each of which comes from a production.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to try to construct a recursive descent parser for this grammar and see if it can parse the string.\n\nBut given the time, maybe it's more efficient to look for any contradictions. For example, check if any of the symbols can't be produced by any non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't27', so I need a non-terminal that can produce 't27'. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't27'. The only non-terminals that produce 't' are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't'97, NT9 \u2192 't'93, NT17 \u2192 't'94, NT27 \u2192 't27'? Wait, wait, looking at the rules again:\n\nWait, actually, I think I misread earlier. Let me look again. The rule for NT27 is NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16. Wait, is there a way to get 't27' directly? Wait, maybe in the rules for 't27' are being produced by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again: in the provided rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't27'; so the only way 't27' can appear is as part of a production chain. Wait, for instance, if a non-terminal A can produce a sequence that results in 't27' as one of its symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach: let's see which terminal symbols appear in the string and check if they are covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals are sequences like 't105', 't87', 't8', etc. So the string has these as well.\n\nWait, does the string contain any symbols that the grammar's rules don't produce?\n\nLooking at the string: t27, t19, t41, t82, t98, t114,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-580","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is: `t45 t14 t37 t78 t69 t29 t111 t135 t87 t3 t87 t107 t36 t1 t107 t87 t82 t34 t63 t76 t98 t78 t52 t131 t81 t97 t15 t108 t76 t48`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in CNF has productions where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, except for the start symbol which could have multiple terminals and non-terminals. But in CNF, even terminals are part of the productions as single terminals, but typically in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Wait, no, more accurately, in CNF, all productions are non-terminals \u2192 non-terminals, and terminals are considered as single symbols, so perhaps to apply standard CNF, we might need to adjust. But in the given grammar, all the productions on the left side of the arrow are non-terminals (like S, NT1, etc.), and the right side are terminals (as per the given rules).\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see rules like S \u2192 NT1 NT16; NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10; and several others where non-terminals are followed by non-terminals, except for some which end with terminals like S \u2192 NT1 NT16, and some NT productions ending in terminals like NT46 \u2192 't87', etc. Hmm, so this grammar actually mixes non-terminals and terminals on the right-hand side of productions, which is typical for allowing the grammar to generate terminal strings. So each production is either a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a non-terminal expanding into a terminal and another non-terminal, or two terminals? Wait, no, looking again, the productions in the given grammar seem to have each non-terminal on the left expanding into two non-terminals on the right, except some of the productions end with a terminal. For example, NT46 \u2192 't87', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT24 \u2192 't29', etc. So in this grammar, some productions are non-terminals \u2192 terminal, but in CNF, terminal symbols are considered as single symbols, so perhaps in this case, the grammar is indeed in a form where each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. But I think the user presented the grammar correctly, as it includes both cases.\n\nSo, the approach to check if the string is in the language is to use a parsing strategy, usually a CYK algorithm or some form of recursive descent. However, given the complexity of the grammar and the string, it's probably easier to simulate the derivation process step by step, tracing back from the string to see if it can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals (like t45, t14, etc.), which should correspond to the terminal symbols in the grammar. First, I need to break down the string into tokens and see how they could fit into the grammar.\n\nLet me start by listing the string:\n\nt45, t14, t37, t78, t69, t29, t111, t135, t87, t3, t87, t107, t36, t1, t107, t87, t82, t34, t63, t76, t98, t78, t52, t131, t81, t97, t15, t108, t76, t48.\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these tokens can be derived from the grammar's terminals. \n\nFirst, let's look at the start symbol S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT1 NT16 and S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t45. So, perhaps the string starts with one of the productions for S. Let's see what t45 corresponds to.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT46 \u2192 't46', but the string doesn't have t46. The closest is t45, which is not present in the given rules. Wait, let me check the grammar again. The grammar has:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't87', but that's not t45. Looking elsewhere, I don't see any production with 't45' as the right-hand side. Hmm, that's a problem. If t45 is not a terminal in the grammar, then the string can't be generated by this grammar because the grammar doesn't have any rule that produces t45. But wait, looking at the grammar more carefully, I see that NT45 \u2192 't73', but that's not t45 either. So, perhaps the string starts with a t45, which is not present as a terminal in any production.\n\nWait, that can't be. So if t45 isn't a terminal in the grammar, then the string can't be generated. But let me check again. The grammar has:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't87'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't124'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't112'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't62'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't27'\n\nWait, there's no production that outputs 't45'. So the first token is t45, which the grammar doesn't have any rule for. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the NT productions can derive to t45 through rules that involve concatenation or something, but given that all the productions on the right side are either non-terminals or terminals directly, I don't see how t45 can be derived. For t45 to appear, it must be a terminal in the grammar, but it's not present in any of the NT productions. Therefore, the string contains a terminal that the grammar can't generate, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

NT50 NT27\n\nI'll need to see how the string starts and match it to one of these options.\n\nThe string starts with 't119 t34 t41 t50 t2 ...'. Let's map this to the initial productions.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT1 NT28. So, the first two symbols should be the results of deriving NT1 and NT28. NT1 and NT28 can be terminals or non-terminals depending on how they're derived.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't119'. Let's see where 't119' appears in the grammar. Scanning through the rules, I see NT1 -> 't117', NT31 -> 't117', and others, but 't119' is not directly a terminal in the production rules. Wait, looking in the production rules, I see that a lot of the NTs are converted into terminals like 't91', 't102', etc. 't119' is actually an output of NT25: NT25 -> 't107' isn't 't119', but hold on, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, in the production rules, I spot:\n\nNT26 -> 't62'\nNT25 -> 't107'\nNT6 -> 't54 NT6'\nWait, no, wait. Let's check each rule step by step.\n\nActually, looking through the entire set of production rules, I notice that 't119' appears as the result of NT31: NT31 -> 't117'. Hmm, but 't119' isn't directly a terminal; perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe 't119' comes from a non-terminal that's derived as a terminal through other steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me check if 't119' appears as a terminal in any rule. Scanning through the rules:\n\nLooking through each rule, I see that some NTs directly produce terms like 't93', 't8', etc., but I don't see 't119' directly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again:\n\nNT3 -> 't69'\nNT13 -> 't16'\nNT33 -> 't79'\nNT8 -> 't102'\nWait, I see in the production rules:\n\nNT26 -> 't62'\nNT32 -> 't108'\nNT22 -> 't122'\nNT29 -> 't14'\nNT6 -> 't54 NT6'\nWait, but 't119' isn't listed here. Hmm, maybe 't119' comes from some non-terminal's production, perhaps via a chain of rules. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps 't119' is derived from NT25, which produces 't107', but that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe 't119' comes from another path. Wait, I think I might have a miscalculation here. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking for 't119' in the production rules, I don't see it as a direct production. So perhaps 't119' isn't a terminal in this grammar, which complicates things because the first symbol would then have to come from a non-terminal production.\n\nWait, but this is a CFG, so the string can consist of both terminals and non-terminals, but in this case, the string provided is all terminals, right? Wait the string given is: `t119 t34 t41 t50 t2 t111 t135 t119 t91 t76 t8 t134 t78 t107 t93 t4 t52 t111 t15 t31 t69 t131 t100 t34 t62 t114 t59 t8 t28 t100 t97`.\n\nYes, all are terminals. So each symbol in the string is a terminal symbol. Therefore, each symbol must be the result of a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nBut looking through the rules, some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT7 -> 't79', NT27 -> 't76', etc. However, 't119' is not directly a result of any NT in the production rules. Wait, let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nNT25 -> 't107'\nNT26 -> 't62'\nNT46 -> 't11'\nNT9 -> 't93'\nNT7 -> 't79'\nNT17 -> 't94'\nNT27 -> 't124'\nNT24 -> 't29'\nNT39 -> 't131'\nNT46 -> 't100'\nNT15 -> 't42'\nWait, no 't119' as a terminal. So if the string contains 't119', perhaps the grammar doesn't produce it. In that case, the answer would be 'No' because 't119' is not a terminal in any production rule, and thus cannot be part of any string derived from the grammar, which only includes terminals that appear explicitly as productions.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through all the production rules carefully for terminals.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT1 -> 't78'\nNT31 -> 't117'\nNT29 -> 't48'\nNT32 -> 't33'\nNT41 -> 't14'\nNT43 -> 't14'\nNT53 -> 't27'\nNT6 -> 't120'\nNT45 -> 't73'\nNT28 -> 't34'\nNT47 -> 't40'\nNT16 -> 't83'\nNT13 -> 't135'\nNT55 -> 't15'\nNT9 -> 't19'\nNT29 -> 't20'\nNT24 -> 't62'\nNT15 -> 't87'\nNT42 -> 't2'\nWait, here's a rule: NT24 -> 't62', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT34 -> 't37', NT27 -> 't76', etc.\n\nBut I don't see 't119' as a terminal. So if the string contains 't119', and it's not a terminal in any production, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Thus, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps 't119' is derived from NT25: NT25 -> 't107', but that's only if 't107' is in the string, which it isn't. Alternatively, maybe 't119' comes from NT26, which is 't62'. No, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, but looking through all the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't119'.

Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, understanding CNF. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each non-terminal has exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right side. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can see that most non-terminals have productions with two non-terminals on the right except for some that have a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT1, which fits, and some like NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, which also fits. So, the grammar is in proper CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t119, t40, t91, t89, t114, t2, t93, t59, t109, t112, t120, t124, t89, t52, t134, t87, t50, t38, t112, t94, t50, t116, t94, t100, t78, t28, t105, t29, t80, t37, t1.\n\nTo determine if this string is in the language, I need to see if it can be derived starting from the start symbol S. But it's a bit complicated because the grammar is big, with many non-terminals. Instead of trying to parse the entire string, maybe I can find the start symbol and see if the string can be broken down into non-terminals accordingly.\n\nThe start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT1\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo, the string must start with either 't119' (if NT1 produces t119) or the result of NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t119. So, let's assume the first split is S \u2192 NT1 NT1. Now, I need to see if NT1 can produce the first t119.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT1:\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17 and NT1 \u2192 NT47 NT28. Neither of these seems to produce t119 directly because they're non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look further down. Let me check the productions for NT25 and NT47.\n\nNT25 has a production NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. Hmm, so NT25 would produce two non-terminals. Similarly, NT47 has multiple productions, but none seem to directly produce t119.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the NT productions from NT1.\n\nLooking again, NT1 has only two productions:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT1 \u2192 NT47 NT28\n\nSo, to produce t119, either NT25 or NT17 would need to produce t119. But checking their productions, maybe I can see if any of them have a terminal leading to t119.\n\nWait, looking at NT25's productions: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 or NT6 \u2192 t58. So, NT6 can eventually produce t58. But t58 doesn't help with t119.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 has several productions, including t87 and others. Maybe I should check NT28.\n\nLooking at NT28, for example, NT28 \u2192 t87. But wait, in the string, after t119 comes t40, which isn't t87. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at NT47, which has multiple productions, including NT47 \u2192 t3 and others. Wait, no, looking back, the productions for NT47 are things like NT47 \u2192 NT17, etc., but none produce a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not going the right way. Let me consider that the first symbol t119 is part of NT1's production. So NT1 must derive a string that starts with t119, but looking at the productions, NT1 doesn't have any terminals except in the first level, which is after another split.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the string represents a leftmost derivation starting from S. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to create the parse tree starting from the root S and see if it matches the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string represents the sequence of non-terminals expanded by NT1. Since t119 is the first symbol, maybe NT1 produces t119. But looking at all the possible NT1 derivations, I don't see a production that directly or indirectly leads to t119. Wait, perhaps I missed something.\n\nLooking at the NT1 productions:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT1 \u2192 NT47 NT28\n\nLet me see what NT25 and NT47 can produce in terms of terminals.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n- NT6 can produce t58\n- NT31 \u2192 NT117 (from NT31 \u2192 t117)\nSo, from NT25, you can get t58 t117, which would be t58 followed by t117. So, if NT1 produces NT25, it would start with t58 t117. But the string starts with t119, so that's not matching.\n\nWhat about NT47?\nNT47 \u2192 NT17\nBut NT17 has its own productions, including NT17 \u2192 t94, etc. Let me see NT17's productions:\n- NT17 \u2192 t24\n- NT17 \u2192 t2\n- NT17 \u2192 t27\nWait, looking at the given grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 t27, t24, and t94. But t24 is later turned into NT7's production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for other NT1 productions. Maybe I'm missing something in the NT47's productions that could lead to t119.\n\nWait, NT47 has a production NT47 \u2192 t3, which is a terminal. So, perhaps NT47 can produce t3, which then is followed by something else. But in the string, t119 is followed by t40, not t3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the overall string is too long and not aligning with any possible derivation. Alternatively, perhaps the first symbol t119 is at the end of a much longer derivation, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the grammar has a way to produce multiple t symbols, but it's structured with non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, I notice that many non-terminals have productions that can eventually lead to a single terminal when expanded. So perhaps the string was generated by repeatedly expanding these non-terminals into terminals.\n\nBut the first symbol is t119, so perhaps S \u2192 NT1 NT1, and one of the NT1s produces t119. But as I saw, NT1's productions are NT25 NT17 or NT47 NT28, which all lead to sequences of non-terminals. To get t119, maybe one of these non-terminals eventually reaches t119.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see NT33 \u2192 NT79, and NT79 \u2192 t19, then perhaps further down. Hmm, but I don't see t119 appearing in any of the terminals. Or wait, maybe one of the non-terminals does produce t119. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the given productions, I see NT35 \u2192 t105, NT25 \u2192 t58, etc. Wait, maybe NT126 is somewhere, but no. I don't see an NT that directly produces t119. So, perhaps the grammar doesn't have any terminals, which would make it impossible for the string to start with t119. But wait, the production NT6 \u2192 t58 exists somewhere. So, perhaps there's a way t119 is generated indirectly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the productions more carefully.\n\nWait, looking at NT36 \u2192 t87. Then, in the string, t87 appears. So, perhaps somewhere in the derivation, NT36 is used. But again, I'm stuck on the first symbol t119.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the first symbol is t119 and see if any non-terminal can derive t119. Scanning through the productions, it seems that none of the non-terminals directly produce t119.

{"custom_id":"request-617","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided, along with a string, and I need to figure out whether the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar is in Chomsky normal form if all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol which can have a production with just a single terminal. In this case, the grammar uses S as the start symbol and has productions from various non-terminals (like S, NT36, NT28, etc.) to combinations of other non-terminals or terminals (denoted by 't' followed by a number, I suppose).\n\nThe string we're testing is: `t79 t17 t87 t111 t94 t15 t111 t70 t102 t73 t42 t73 t38 t119 t93 t38 t70 t52 t105 t58 t1 t48 t15 t97 t15 t79 t58 t50 t78 t116 t66 t69`.\n\nMy approach is to parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing context-free grammars is typically done using methods like recursive descent or Pratt parsing. Since I'm not writing code, I'll try to simulate this parsing step by step.\n\nStarting with the string, I need to see if I can break it down into symbols that correspond to the non-terminals, working from the start symbol S. The start symbol can produce NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27, as per the first two productions.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is t79. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminals that can produce something starting with 't' are:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't3'\n- NT35 \u2192 't102'\n- NT33 \u2192 't79'\n- NT25 \u2192 't107' (but starts with t1, so not relevant here)\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT7 \u2192 't79' (Wait, looking back, I see NT7 has two productions: one to 't93' and another to 't97'. Wait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, NT7 has two productions: NT7 \u2192 't93' and NT7 \u2192 't97'. But also, I see NT38 \u2192 't119', but that's with t119.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. In the given rules, NT7 is given as:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 't93'\nNT7 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 't97'\n\nHmm, perhaps I misread. Let me list all the NT7 productions. Looking through the grammar, the lines are:\n\nNT7 -> NT35 NT46\nNT7 -> NT7 NT33\nWait, no\u2014looking back, I think I need to check each NT7 production. Wait, let me look again.\n\nIn the given grammar:\n\nLooking for NT7... Let's see:\n\n- NT7 is defined as NT35 NT46 (earlier lines), and then two more:\n\nLines 20, 21, etc. Looking more carefully:\n\nWait, here's the relevant section:\n\nNo, actually, looking through the given grammar, the NT7 productions are:\n\nNT35 -> NT10 NT38\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT14 -> NT79\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me search the grammar for 't...' to see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to map each 't' symbol to the possible NTs that can produce them.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for each production, we can see when the right-hand side produces a terminal symbol 't':\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NTs that produce 't' are:\n\nNT35 \u2192 't102' (line NT35 -> 't102')\n\nNT33 \u2192 't79' (line NT33 -> 't79')\n\nNT17 \u2192 't94' (line NT17 -> 't94')\n\nNT7 \u2192 't93' (line NT7 \u2192 't93')\n\nNT7 \u2192 't97' (line NT7 \u2192 't97')\n\nNT36 \u2192 't87' (line NT36 \u2192 't87')\n\nNT39 \u2192 't131' (line NT39 \u2192 't131')\n\nNT21 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first symbol is 't79'. So I need to find which NT productions generate 't79'. Looking again, I see:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't79' (line 38: NT33 -> 't79')\n\nSo NT33 is the non-terminal that can produce 't79'. Wait, but do I have a production that starts NT33? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT33: search for NT33 in all lines. Yes, line 38: NT33 -> 't79'. So NT33 is a non-terminal that can produce 't79'.\n\nBut to derive 't79', we first need to have a production that starts with NT33. So in the top-level expansion, S can produce NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So when expanding S, we get a sequence of two non-terminals which then produce the symbols in the string.\n\nBut let's step back. Our string starts with 't79', so I need to find a production where a non-terminal generates 't79', which is NT33. So perhaps the first step in the parsing is to see if we can have NT33 as part of the start symbol's production.\n\nLooking at S's production:\n\nS can be divided into two possibilities:\n\n1. NT1 NT28\n2. NT50 NT27\n\nSo, to get 't79' as the first symbol, we would need that NT1 or NT50 or NT27 can produce something starting with 't79'.\n\nLooking at the NT1 production:\n\nLooking for NT1 productions: Let me search through the grammar.\n\nLooking for NT1 in all lines: NT1 -> NT25 NT17 (line NT1: NT1 -> NT25 NT17)\n\nAnd NT1 also has another production? Let me check: yes, line 16: NT15 -> 't48' (no, that's NT15). Wait, wait. Let me look again for NT1:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLine 67: NT17 -> NT44 NT53\n\nLine (approximate) 72: NT17 -> 't...', no. Wait, more accurately:\n\nThe grammar has NT1: line 67: NT17 -> 't3' (but that's for NT17, line (earlier) like 17: NT17 -> 't94'. Wait, perhaps I should list out all NT1 productions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to look at the given grammar and find all instances of NT1:\n\nLooking through all 70+ rules, I see:\n\n- NT14 -> NT79 (line NT14: 't79')\n- NT17 -> 't94' (earlier line: NT17 -> 't94')\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17 (line NT1)\n- Another line: NT1 -> 't84' (Wait, let me get the exact line). Hmm, no, I think I'm looking at other NTs.\n\nWait, let's check each line:\n\nLooking for NT1: \n\nLines:\n\n72: NT17 \u2192 't94'\n\n76: NT16 \u2192 't2' (Wait, that's NT16, not NT1.)\n\nLines in the nt1 production:\n\nLooking through the string, I don't see NT1 being part of a production unless in line 72. But looking for NT1 itself:\n\nI see that NT1 comes from NT15? Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-608","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to figure out if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is a series of tokens, each starting with 't' followed by numbers, like t79, t128, etc. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal and a is a terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to follow this because all the non-terminals on the left side have two non-terminals on the right, except for some that directly produce terminals, like NT46 \u2192 't87'. Wait, actually, looking closer, some of the productions seem to have a mix, like NT46 can go to 't87', which is a terminal, so that might complicate things a bit because in CNF, the non-terminals are only on the left side of two non-terminals, but terminals can appear directly on the right as well. So that's fine.\n\nNow, to determine if the string is generated by this grammar, I think I should break down the string into parts and see if each can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. The string is t79 t128 t19 t135 t119 t119 t66 t52 t42 t135 t135 t69 t93 t1 t2 t27 t100 t28 t128 t94 t38 t63 t62 t105 t34 t29 t122 t84 t123 t58 t50 t31. Each of these is a terminal symbol, so in the derivation, each 't' followed by a number must be generated by a production rule that produces that terminal. \n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT46 \u2192 't87', NT17 \u2192 't94', NT9 \u2192 't19', etc. So for each terminal in the string, I need to check if it is produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t79. I need to find which non-terminal can produce 't79'. Let's see: in the grammar, I see NT14 \u2192 't79'. So NT14 can produce t79. Next token is t128. Looking through the productions, NT128 isn't directly listed, but I see NT22 \u2192 t128? Wait, actually, in the grammar, are there any rules leading to t128? Looking back, I see NT22 \u2192 't58' and 't128'? Wait, no, let me check again. The grammar includes:\n\nNT22 -> NT49 NT14\nNT22 -> NT40 NT45\nNT29 -> NT48\nLooking for t128, perhaps NT28 \u2192 't128'? Wait, in the grammar, NT28 is not directly a terminal, but let me see. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\nBut that's not a terminal, so I need to find which non-terminals can produce t128. Hmm, maybe NT22 can produce t128. Wait, in the grammar, NT22 has two production rules: NT22 \u2192 NT49 NT14 and NT22 \u2192 NT40 NT45. Are any of these directly producing a terminal? Wait, the grammar doesn't seem to have NT22 directly producing a terminal, but perhaps other non-terminals produce t128. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, in the given grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce 't128'? Looking through all the rules, I don't immediately see any rule where a non-terminal directly gives 't128'. So maybe t128 isn't part of the grammar's terminals, or perhaps I've missed it. Alternatively, perhaps t128 is produced by some other rule. Wait, maybe I should list all the terminals first.\n\nWait, I notice that in the grammar, some non-terminals produce specific terminals, like NT46 \u2192 t87, NT9 \u2192 t19, NT15 \u2192 t48, etc. So each token in the string is a terminal, and for the string to be in the language, each token must be generated by a non-terminal. So for each token, I need to find a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nLooking at the first token, t79: NT14 \u2192 t79, so that's fine. Second token, t128: I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces t128 directly. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rules. Let me check all the rules again. The rules for NT22 are:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT49 NT14  \nNT22 \u2192 NT40 NT45  \n\nNeither of these produce a terminal, but perhaps NT49 or NT40 or NT45 produce 't128' indirectly. For example, NT49 \u2192 t109 (I think) or something else. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 t81  \nNT47 \u2192 t3  \nNT46 \u2192 t76  \nNT27 \u2192 t128  \n\nWait, NT27 has a production rule NT27 \u2192 't124', so t128 comes from elsewhere. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the string has t128, which might be produced by some non-terminal that I can't find in the rules. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake and t128 is produced by another rule. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see:\n\nWait, in the given rules, I can check each rule for producing terminals:\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't128' (Does that exist?) Let's see: In the given rules, NT28 \u2192 t123? Wait, checking:\n\nLooking back, in the given rules, I see NT28 \u2192 t76 (Wait, no, for NT28, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps I can spot the issue. The rules for NT22:\n\nNT22 -> NT49 NT14  \nNT22 -> NT40 NT45  \n\nSo, neither of these seems to produce t128. The rules for NT29 include:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14  \nNT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39  \nNT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24  \nNT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39  \n\nAgain, no terminal. Looking for any occurrence of 't128' in the grammar? Let me scan all the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT rules where the output includes 't' followed by three digits. For example, NT15 \u2192 t48, NT14 \u2192 t79, NT17 \u2192 t94, etc. But t128 isn't listed as a terminal directly. So does that mean that t128 isn't part of the language generated by this grammar? If that's the case, then the string cannot be generated because it contains a terminal that isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm looking back, maybe I missed a rule. Let me check NT22 again:\n\nNo, the rules for NT22 are only to other non-terminals. So perhaps t128 is not a terminal that can be generated by any non-terminal, meaning that the string cannot be in the language. But that can't be right because the string is given, so maybe I've misunderstood something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong grammar. Let me re-examine the initial grammar. The initial grammar is in CNF, so every rule is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal is expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to produce a string like the one given, each token must be produced by a non-terminal. If any token can't be produced by any non-terminal, then the string is invalid.\n\nSo, for the given string, let's check each token:\n\nt79: NT14 \u2192 t79 (OK)\n\nt128: Is there a non-terminal that can produce t128? Looking through all the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal goes directly to t128. The closest is NT28 \u2192 t76, but I'm not seeing t128 being directly produced. So, perhaps t128 isn't in the language, making the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps t128 is indirectly produced. For example, if a non-terminal X can produce 't128' via a chain. Let me see if any non-terminal leads to t12"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-632","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is provided, and the string to check is \"t100 t11 t14 t131 t63 t2 t97 t8 t62 t89 t93 t134 t24 t116 t107 t4 t117 t2 t126 t38 t122 t120 t41 t37 t11 t36 t119 t15 t8 t80 t134 t53 t14\".\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the productions are in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT28, which is two non-terminals, and NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17 or a terminal like 't17'. So, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols.\n\nThe task is to see if the given string can be produced by this grammar. Since the string consists of terminals (all the 't' followed by numbers), I need to find a derivation starting from the start symbol S and ending with the given string, expanding all non-terminals until only terminals are left.\n\nBut manually applying the entire derivation seems impractical because the string is quite long. Instead, I can try to break down the string and see if it can be structured according to the grammar.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string for clarity:\n\nt100, t11, t14, t131, t63, t2, t97, t8, t62, t89, t93, t134, t24, t116, t107, t4, t117, t2, t126, t38, t122, t120, t41, t37, t11, t36, t119, t15, t8, t80, t134, t53, t14.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't100', which is a terminal. Let's see which production leads to 't100'. Looking at the grammar, NT54 and NT46 can produce 't100'.

Let me list the rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking back, I notice that some NTs directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't79'\n- NT27 \u2192 't76'\n- NT28 \u2192 't97'\n- NT15 \u2192 't48'\n- NT46 \u2192 't100'\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, the user provided the entire grammar, but it's quite long. I think I need to identify which non-terminals can produce each terminal in the string.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each expansion reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So, starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. To reach the string, which has 34 terminals, the number of steps would be such that the derivation produces 34 terminals, meaning that the number of nodes on the parse tree would be such that the string is formed by 33 splits (since each split adds one more element).\n\nWait, more precisely, in Chomsky Normal Form, a string of length n requires n-1 productions. Since we have 34 terminals, we need 33 productions, meaning the derivation starts from S and expands to the string in 33 steps. But I don't know if that's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the start symbol S and see if it can produce the entire string through the allowed productions. Since S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27, I can see if the string starts with the first two symbols from one of these productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t100 and t11. Let me see what NT1 and NT28 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n\nSo, if S expands to NT1 NT28, which is NT1 (something) followed by NT28 (NT4 NT6). Then, we can look at how NT1 and NT28 expand further.\n\nBut wait, the first token is t100. So, let's see what NT1 and NT4 and NT6 could expand to.\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nLooking at NT25: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6.\n\nWait, no, from the grammar:\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n\nWait, that can't be right because it's a recursive production. That would lead to infinite recursion, but perhaps the terminal 't62' is involved.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's a different NT. Let me list the productions again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the user provided a long list of rules, and some of them might be S productions or others. Let me see: for NT6, the production seems to be NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 in one of the rules, but that's not shown. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, in the user's provided rules, under NT6, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT48\n- NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45\n- Etc.\n\nWait, so NT6 can produce either NT54 NT6 (which is recursive and thus problematic) or 't48'. But wait, in the given rules, there's a production for NT26: NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45, but for NT6, I think the correct rule is NT6 \u2192 't58'?

{"custom_id":"request-628","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string `t126 t40 t105 t52 t42 t109 t29 t76 t91 t5 t79 t11 t108 t59 t31 t105 t81 t114 t63 t134 t116 t45 t38 t19 t65 t19 t19 t63 t70 t5 t50` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of several production rules, and the string is a sequence of symbols (like t126, t40, etc.). \n\nFirst, I'll note that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The given grammar includes productions like S -> NT1 NT28, NT36 -> NT56 NT10, and others, all with two non-terminals. The terminals in the string are 't' followed by numbers, so I'll need to see how these terminals are generated.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some rules produce a single terminal, specifically when a production's right-hand side is followed by a terminal symbol:\n- NT46 -> t8\n- NT45 -> t87\n- NT35 -> t105\n- NT7 -> t93, t97, t94 (seems inconsistent, probably a typo, maybe different rules)\n- NT27 -> t124\n- NT22 -> t58, t29, t58 again\u2014wait, that might be a repetition or typo.\n- NT10 -> t2, t17, t65\n- NT21 -> t1, t38\n- NT14 -> t79\n- NT54 -> t53\n- NT15 -> t48\n- NT39 -> t41\n- NT46 -> t76, t27, etc.\n\nWait, I'm noticing that many production rules have a mix of some terminals and non-terminals. But since CNF requires that all production rules have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, the presence of any terminal in the right-hand side of a rule would violate CNF. However, in the given grammar, I don't see any such rules with terminals on the right-hand side. All productions have two non-terminals. Therefore, this grammar is indeed in Chomsky Normal Form, as given.\n\nBut then the string contains terminals like 't126', 't40', etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production can only generate two symbols at a time. So the derivation process will involve breaking down non-terminals into two non-terminals, and so on, until the entire string is a series of terminals.\n\nThe key problem is to determine if the given string can be fully expanded from the start symbol S. Each symbol in the string must be generated by the grammar's production rules. So, for each 'tN' in the string, I need to check if that number corresponds to a production where a non-terminal N can directly produce 'tN'.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- For example, NT46 can produce t8. But does the string contain t8? Let me check the given string. The string has t126, t40, t105, etc., but I don't see t8. Hmm. But wait, perhaps through expansion, the string could be built up. Alternatively, maybe the numbers in the string correspond to specific non-terminals that can expand to those ts.\n\nWait, but maybe each t in the string represents a production where the entire phrase is generated from a non-terminal that can expand to those ts. But that's confusing because each production in CNF only leads to two symbols, which would have to be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to model the string as a sequence of symbols that must be the result of expanding the start symbol S step by step. Since each step generates two symbols, the number of symbols in the string should be a power of 2 multiplied by the initial production (like 2^k, but I'm not sure). However, the given string has 32 symbols (counting each 't' part as one), so 32. 32 is 2^5, which fits because the start symbol S would first produce two non-terminals, each producing two, etc., resulting in a binary tree of depth 5, producing 32 terminal symbols. However, I need to check if each terminal corresponds to a correct production.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the grammar. So, for each 'tX' in the string, does there exist a non-terminal rule where NTX or something produces tX.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT46 -> t8\n- NT45 -> t87\n- NT35 -> t105\n- NT7 -> t93, t94\n- NT4 -> t91\n- NT21 -> t1\n- NT38 -> t102\n- NT6 -> t54, t58, t62, etc., but wait, looking again, I think I need to correct that. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nThe grammar's productions with a terminal on the RHS:\n\n- NT46 -> t8\n- NT45 -> t87\n- NT35 -> t105\n- NT7 -> t93, t97 (I think in the given, it's NT7 -> t93, NT7-> t97, similarly NT17-> 't94', etc.)\n- NT4 -> t91\n- NT6 -> t54, etc.\n- NT3 -> t69\n- NT40 -> t28\n- NT26 -> t98\n- NT22 -> t58\n- NT29 -> t48\n- NT4 -> t91, etc.\n\nSo, for each number in the string, I can see if it corresponds to an NT (non-terminal) that can produce that t.\n\nFor example, does 't126' correspond to any NT producing 't126'? Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see such a rule. Similarly, 't40' \u2013 does any NT produce 't40'? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again:\n\nWait, NT29 -> t48. So, I don't see 't40' being generated by any direct production. That's a problem because if the grammar only has certain terminals, and the string has a terminal that's not among them, then the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the t values correspond to other non-terminals through expansion. For instance, t40 could be generated if, say, NT45 produces t45, which could expand to t40 somehow. But wait, let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rules that produce 't40' directly. For example:\n\n- NT45 -> t87\n- NT35 -> t105\n- NT7 -> t93, t97, t94\n- NT4 -> t91\n- NT6 -> t54, etc.\n\nSo, 't40' doesn't seem to be present as a terminal in any production. That might mean that 't40' in the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nSimilarly, checking the other terminals:\n\n- 't126' \u2013 I don't see any NT producing 't126' directly.\n- 't52' \u2013 Maybe NT52 can produce 't52'? Or is it an NT in the rules? Looking through the rules, NT52 isn't a non-terminal in the grammar. So that's another point against it.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe 't' followed by a number is actually the terminal symbol, and the NT must be able to produce it. So, for the grammar to generate 't126', there must be a rule that NT126 can produce t126, but looking at the given grammar, I don't see such a rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more about parsing: the string must be derived from the start symbol S through a series of steps, expanding non-terminals to two symbols each time, until all are terminals. So, for that, the counts and order must build up correctly.\n\nBut the key issue is that the string contains several t-values (like t40, t126) that don't seem to be directly generated by any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, it's impossible for the grammar to generate the given string because it can't produce those t-symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I'm thinking incorrectly. Let me recheck the grammar to see if I missed any terminal symbols.

Looking at the grammar, NT46 can produce t27 (since NT46 -> t27? Wait, let me check. Looking through the grammar, I see NT46 -> t27. So NT46 can produce t27.\n\nNext token: t19. Looking for a rule that produces t19. Checking the grammar, NT17 can produce t94 and other t's. Hmm, I don't see a rule that produces t19. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me scan through all the NT rules for t19. Looking: NT17 can't produce t19. NT35 can produce t102, t37, etc. NT27 produces t107, t79. Wait, looking at NT35: it has a rule NT35 -> 't10' and others, but I don't see t19. Hmm. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing the production for NT20? Wait, NT20 -> t100 and others. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. I can note all the 't' productions and then see if each token is covered.\n\nLet me list all the NT rules that produce a 't' token:\n\nNT46 -> t3\n\nNT47 -> t4\n\nNT17 -> t94\n\nNT27 -> t117\n\nNT30 -> t111\n\nNT41 -> t52\n\nNT19 -> t126\n\nNT7 -> t79\n\nNT29 -> t131, t116, etc.\n\nNT28 -> t76, t97\n\nNT37 -> t17\n\nNT45 -> t4 (Wait, no, looking again: NT45 is 't4'? Wait, no: looking at the grammar, NT56 -> t112, NT47 -> t3, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to make a list of each NT and its 't' option.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better approach. Let's go through each terminal in the string and see if it matches any NT production.\n\nList of terminals in the string: 27,19,5,100,123,131,40,109,100,102,109,8,2,28,63,98,31,117,117,109,11,109,117,107,66,135,37,16,27,52,108,119,70,38.\n\nLet's process each one:\n\n1. t27: NT46 -> t27. So 46 is the non-terminal here.\n\n2. t19: Looking for NT that produces t19. Scanning through all the 't' options:\n\nLooking through NT rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t19. Wait, maybe the string might have been generated incorrectly? Or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again. I don't see any NT that can produce 't19'. So that might be a problem because t19 is a terminal in the string but can't be generated by any rule in the grammar, meaning the string can't be generated. But wait, perhaps I should continue to see if this is an error, but the rest should fit. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the first token is t27, which comes from NT46. Then the next is t19, which is problematic because if NT46 produces t27, then after that, we would need another NT that produces t19. But since there's no such NT, perhaps this means the string can't be generated. But the user provided the string, but perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the NT for t27.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT46 has multiple productions, including some 't' outputs. Let me list all 't' productions:\n\n- NT46 -> t3, t27, etc.\n- NT47 -> t4, t40, t4, etc.\n- NT17 -> t94\n- NT27 -> t117, t52\n- NT37 -> t17\n- NT35 -> t53, t36, t59, etc.\n- NT47 -> t3, etc.\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing. I think I need to list each NT that has a 't' as its sole terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a list where each NT has a rule that starts with 't'. For example, NT17 has t94. Let me compile a list:\n\n- NT46: t3, t27\n- NT47: t4, t40, t41 (no, looking again: NT47 has a rule NT47 -> 't3'? Wait, I'm not sure. Wait, the grammar seems lengthy. I'll try to list each NT with a 't' terminal.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT24: 't29'\n- NT47: 't3' (wait, looking at the rules, I see NT47 -> 't3' and NT47 -> 't40')\n- NT56: 't20', 't17'\n- NT24: 't29', 't62'\n- NT46: 't27', 't8', 't24', 't114', etc., but earlier I think NT46 has 't27', 't112', and 't36'\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for any NT that have a production ending with 'tX'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach the problem by trying to parse the string step by step using the grammar, applying the rules.\n\nSince S is the start symbol, and the string starts with 't27', which can be produced by NT46. So the first symbol comes from S -> NT1 NT28 (but looking at the first rules: S's rules are S -> NT1 NT28 and S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nWait, S has two options:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT1 NT28\n\nOption 2: S -> NT50 NT27\n\nThe first symbol is 't27', so let's see what NT27 produces.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT27 has a rule NT27 -> NT43 NT50 and others. Wait, but some of its rules start with 't', like t52, t79, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps we should look for a path where S can lead to the string.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck, perhaps because the string starts with 't27', which must come from NT27.

{"custom_id":"request-645","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and the string to evaluate is quite long. Hmm, let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. All the production rules are in the form A \u2192 BC, which is typical for Chomsky normal form, or maybe even Binary Normal Form since it's two symbols. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT1 NT50 or NT27 NT39, based on the rules. Wait, I should check the rules again.\n\nLooking through, I see S has a few options: NT1 NT50, NT50 NT27, etc. So it's producing two non-terminals each time. Moving on, each of these non-terminals (like NT36, NT28, etc.) has their own rules. Some lead to other non-terminals, and some directly to terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers. The string to evaluate is all 't' followed by numbers, so that's good because terminals are the actual \"leaves\" in the parse tree.\n\nThe string is: `t112 t80 t120 t17 t1 t16 t28 t126 t134 t19 t29 t97 t122 t76 t87 t87 t109 t107 t78 t5 t19 t81 t62 t123 t40 t19 t27 t24 t52 t109 t11 t58 t114 t58`.\n\nEach 't' is a token, so the string is a sequence of 38 tokens. Each 't' must correspond to a terminal derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the approach here is to simulate a top-down parsing or maybe build a parse tree and see if the derivation can reach this string. Alternatively, perhaps a bottom-up approach, like checking if each terminal can be derived in the correct order.\n\nBut given the size of the string, a detailed parse tree would be too time-consuming manually. Instead, maybe some observations can help. Let's see:\n\n1. Identify the start symbol's productions. S can produce two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, S's first production is NT1 NT50. So the string must start with a derivation that leads to NT1 and NT50. Let's check the first token: 't112'. So the first step should be S \u2192 NT1 NT50, then NT1 and NT50 should produce 't112'.\n\nWait, but NT1 is a non-terminal. Let's see what the rules for NT1 are. Looking through, oh no, I don't see NT1 producing directly to a terminal. Wait, the last rule I see is NT1 \u2192 't78'. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking for NT1 rules, I see:\nNT14 \u2192 't79'\nNT7 \u2192 't97'\nNT46 \u2192 't78'\nSo NT14, NT7, and NT46 can produce terminals, but NT1 itself doesn't. So if NT1 is in the string, must come from a rule where NT1 is derived into a terminal. Or is that possible? Wait, NT1's rules: NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, or something else? Wait, I don't see NT1 having a rule that terminates. It must derive into something else.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT1 producing directly to a terminal. Let me double-check:\n\nNT1 appears in several rules:\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17 (Line 41)\nNT1 \u2192 NT4 NT28 (Line 1)\nWait no, actually, line 1 is S \u2192 NT1 NT50, so NT1 is a non-terminal that's part of the initial step.\n\nWait, looking at NT1's rules:\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me scan through all the NT rules:\n\nLooking for NT1 in the non-terminals, lines 4 and 17:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT1 NT50\n\nAlso, in line 41: NT35 \u2192 NT10 NT38\n\nLine 42: NT34 \u2192 NT36 NT32\n\nWait, but I think I need to see if NT1 has any rule that ends in a terminal. For example, is there a production for NT1 that doesn't go further, like NT1 \u2192 't...' ?\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\nLine 6: NT45 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, let me look for any NT rule that starts with NT1. I don't see any NT1 \u2192 't...'. Instead, NT1 is part of other rules:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT4 (Line 46)\n- NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT10 (Line 41)\n- NT14 \u2192 NT79 NT53 (Line 14)\nWait, no, that's NT14, not NT1. So perhaps NT1 doesn't directly produce a terminal. So for the first token 't112', the initial step is S \u2192 NT1 NT50, but NT1 must somehow lead to 't112'. But if NT1 doesn't have a production that leads directly to a terminal, then 't112' must come from the derivation of NT1 and NT50.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should try to work backwards, starting from the end of the string and see if I can find a path to S.\n\nThe last few tokens: 't58 t114 t58'\n\nLooking at the last two 't58's. Let's see what produces 't58':\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT6 \u2192 't58' (Line 6)\n- NT25 \u2192 't58' (Line 20)\n- NT46 \u2192 't58' (Line 46)\n- NT27 \u2192 't58' (Line 42)\nWait, checking the rules:\n\nLine 6: NT6 \u2192 't58'\n\nLine 20: NT25 \u2192 NT53 NT22, which doesn't produce a terminal immediately.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLine 20: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n\nSo NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. Then, to get 't58', NT25 must derive into something that leads to 't58'. So NT6 \u2192 't58' at line 6. So that's possible.\n\nSo working backwards:\n\nt58 comes from NT6 \u2192 't58'\n\nNow, look for what can produce NT6. Looking at the non-terminals:\n\nNT6 doesn't directly produce anything. Instead, NT6 is in the rule for NT25: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nBut for the end token 't58', which is from 't58', that suggests the last non-terminal before 't58' must derive NT6. So, the last rule in the string would be something like NT6 \u2192 't58', but in the grammar, NT6 only has a rule that says NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which is a recursive rule. Wait, no:\n\nWait checking:\n\nLine 6: NT6 \u2192 't58'\n\nWait, that's a direct rule. So NT6 can directly produce 't58'. Great. So the last token is 't58' which comes from NT6 \u2192 't58'.\n\nSo the last step before that would be that NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31, but how?\n\nWait no, the last 't58' is the result of NT6. So before that, there must be another non-terminal that produces NT6 followed by something.\n\nBut wait, the string ends with three tokens: 't58 t114 t58'\n\nSo the sequence is 't58', 't114', 't58'. So the last two steps would involve a non-terminal that produces 't114' and leads into 't58' again.\n\nWait, perhaps the parsing is something like ... \u2192 't114' \u2192 't58'.\n\nLooking for 't114' in the rules. Looking at the terminal symbols, which ones are 't114':\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking for 't114' in the terminal symbols. Hmm.\n\nWait, 't114' appears in line 53: NT53 \u2192 't114' (line 53, which is line 53: NT46 \u2192 't8' is different. Wait, looking through each rule that starts with a terminal:\n\nLooking through all lines:\n\nLine 7: NT74 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, actually, 't79' is in line 14: NT14 \u2192 't79'\n\nAnd line 55: NT50 \u2192 't42'?\n\nWait, no, line 55 is NT39 \u2192 NT30 NT41.\n\nWait, perhaps '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-656","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which usually has rules of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. But looking at the provided rules, there are also instances where non-terminals produce a terminal directly, like S \u2192 NT1 NT1, but also some produce strings like 't94' directly. Wait, no, actually, in the rules, it seems that some non-terminals like NT17 are directly producing a terminal, which is allowed in Chomsky normal form.\n\nThe string to test is quite long and consists of many 't' followed by numbers. I need to parse this string based on the grammar. But with 100 terms, it's going to be tedious, so maybe I can find a pattern or a way to short-circuit the process.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, the top-level productions start with S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So the string should start with one of these two options. The first token is t100. Looking at the rules for NT1 and NT28, NT1 \u2192 NT19 NT25, and NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6. Hmm, not sure where that leads yet.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT10 and NT27: NT10 \u2192 NT34 NT15 and NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16. Let's check what the first token is: t100. Let me check if there are any rules that lead to t100.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3, which doesn't help. NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17. Wait, looking for t56, t20, t17. Not seeing t100 yet.\n\nWait, maybe I need to trace the string step by step. Let's split the string into tokens:\n\nt100, t122, t100, t42, t11, t128, t124, t78, t15, t112, t15, t94, t91, t83, t128, t70, t73, t65, t82, t45, t126, t107, t117, t134, t94, t98, t122, t62, t80, t80, t123, t123, t80, t65, t17.\n\nNow, let's see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar. The string is quite long, so it's going to require multiple steps. Let's see if there's a way to break it down step by step, starting from the highest level.\n\nAt the top level, S can become NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. Let's check the first token t100. Is there a rule that produces t100 as the start of a non-terminal? Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT53 NT47, but also NT50 \u2192 NT4 NT50, which is recursive-looking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for rules where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that can produce t100. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t100. So maybe the first step is to find which non-terminals can produce t100.\n\nWait, let me look at the production rules for each non-terminal and see if any of them can derive t100 as a terminal.\n\nLooking specifically, NT10 has production NT34 NT15, NT17 \u2192 t94, etc. Hmm, maybe not directly. Wait, no, looking through the rules, none of the non-terminals directly have 't100' as a terminal. Wait, but maybe in the rules there's a non-terminal that can derive something ending with t100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S productions can lead to t100. Let me check NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, and NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6. Hmm, not useful yet.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this differently. Since the grammar seems to consist of multiple non-terminals, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that match these non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach: since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form and also uses single terminals, maybe the string can be parsed using the grammar. Let's try to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nBut the string is so long that it's going to take a lot of steps. Maybe we can find a way to split the string into matching segments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for any rule that can start with t100. Looking through the rules, I don't see any direct production for t100. So maybe the first symbol t100 is derived via a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a non-terminal that eventually produces t100 as part of a longer derivation. For example, NT10 \u2192 NT34 NT15 \u2192 NT36 NT15 \u2192 NT6 NT3 NT15 \u2192 NT54 NT6 NT3 NT15 \u2192 and so on. But this could take a while, and it's unclear if it leads to t100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial symbols t100 t122 t100... are part of a larger structure. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT47: NT47 \u2192 NT41 NT13. NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT10. NT10 \u2192 NT34 NT15. Hmm, this might take ages. Instead, perhaps looking for the longest possible match starting from the beginning.\n\nAnother idea: since the first two tokens are t100 and t122, perhaps NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27 can split into these. Let's see:\n\nS can be NT1 NT28. NT1 \u2192 NT19 NT25, and NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6.\n\nSo the first part would be NT1 \u2192 NT19 NT25, generating two tokens: t19? t25? Hmm, but in our string, the first two tokens are t100 and t122, which don't match. Alternatively, maybe NT50 NT27. NT50 \u2192 NT4 NT50, which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the top-level productions can be such that NT1 produces t100 and a sub-structure, while NT28 produces t122, etc. To find out, I need to see if any non-terminals produce these t tokens.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any direct productions for NT1 to produce t100, and similarly for NT28 to produce t122. This is getting complicated. Maybe instead, I should look at the end of the string and see if it can be broken down, because the end has t17.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: ..., t65, t17. t65 is part of NT15? Let me check the rules for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15. NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17. So t56 and t17 can be generated by NT56 \u2192 nt20 nt17. If our last token is t17, that comes from NT56. So to have t65 t17, it's likely part of NT56 \u2192 t20 t17, but then the nt20 would be t20, but here it's t65 t17. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm losing track here. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the string is t100 t122 t100 t42 t11 t128 t124 t78 t15 t112 t15 t94 t91 t83 t128 t70 t73 t65 t82 t45 t126 t107 t117 t134 t94 t98 t122 t62 t80 t80 t123 t123 t80 t65 t17.\n\nI can look for specific patterns. For example, the presence of t70, which is in NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT3. Wait, looking at the rule: NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which then could be t6 and t3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should also check if any non-terminals have these terminal values directly.

{"custom_id":"request-651","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string to evaluate. The grammar is provided, and it's in CNF, which is good because that means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, or a terminal. The string provided is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, starting with 't105' and ending with 't14'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the top symbol is S, which produces NT1 and NT28. So, the string starts with t105 and t119, which correspond to symbols generated from NT1 and NT28. Let me map these to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S:\n- S -> NT1 NT28. From the string, the first part is t105 (NT1) and t119 (NT28). So, I need to see if these can be derived from NT1 and NT28.\n\nLooking at NT1 in the grammar, I see: NT1 -> NT25 NT17. So, t105 would be NT1, which splits into NT25 and NT17.\n\nNext, looking at NT25: NT25 -> NT6 NT31. So, NT25 = t6 and t31. In the string, after t105 comes t119 (NT28) and t102 (t52?). Wait, no, let me correct: the string is t105, t119, t66, etc. Wait, the second token is t119, which I think is NT28. So after t105 (NT1), the next is t119 (NT28), then t66 (which is NT32, because NT32 is 't66'? Wait, looking at the grammar rules, NT32 is 't66' and NT10 is 't50', so yes, t66 is NT32.\n\nSo, after S's first step, S becomes NT1 (t105) and NT28 (t119). Then, NT28 can be broken down into NT4 and NT6. Looking at NT4, it's defined as NT21 NT15. So, t119 (NT4) would split into NT21 (t21) and NT15 (which would be t50 because NT15 -> NT50 NT6. Wait, hold on, no: NT15 is NT50 and NT6? Or looking back, is NT10 -> NT50 NT15? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar rules:\n\nNT16 -> NT10 NT34\n\nNT10 -> NT35 NT46\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's take it step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS -> NT1 NT28.\n\nFrom the string, the first two tokens are t105 and t119. So NT1 is t105 and NT28 is t119.\n\nLooking up NT1 and NT28 in the grammar:\n\nNT1: NT1 -> NT25 NT17 (from the rules).\n\nNT28: NT28 -> NT4 NT6 (yes, because in the grammar, NT28 is defined as NT4 and NT6).\n\nSo, t105 is NT1, which is NT25 and NT17.\n\nt119 is NT28, which is NT4 and NT6.\n\nNext, I need to see if NT25 can produce t6 and t31. Looking at NT25: NT25 -> NT6 NT31. Yes, that's a production. So t105 is NT25, split into NT6 and NT31, corresponding to t6 and t31. But looking at the string, after t119(t119 is NT28, which is split into t4 and n6?), wait, this is getting messy.\n\nWait, no, the string is t105, t119, t66, t37, t52, t117, t109, t102, t31, t2, t53, t58, t58, t84, t76, t82, t87, t38, t83, t102, t89, t19, t81, t82, t114, t14, t11, t117, t41, t42, t79, t107, t89, t131, t3.\n\nWait, this seems too long. Let me clarify. The entire string is: t105 t119 t66 t37 t52 t117 t109 t102 t31 t2 t53 t58 t58 t84 t76 t82 t87 t38 t83 t102 t89 t19 t81 t82 t114 t14 t11 t117 t41 t42 t79 t107 t89 t131 t3.\n\nSo, the initial step is S -> NT1 NT28, leading to t105 (NT1) and t119 (NT28). Now, NT1 is processed into its components and NT28 as well.\n\nNT1 -> NT25 NT17.\n\nNT25 -> NT6 NT31.\n\nSo, t105 is NT25, which becomes t6 and t31.\n\nLooking at the string, after t105 comes t119. Wait, no, the string is t105, t119, t66, etc. So t105 is first, t119 is second.\n\nBut NT1 is split into NT25 and NT17, which in the string are t105 (which is NT25) and then t119 (which is NT28). So, after S produces NT1 and NT28, the next step is to replace NT1 with NT25 and NT17.\n\nBut wait, how does that fit into the string? The string starts with t105, which would correspond to NT1 or a terminal. Since t105 is from NT1, it's a terminal, so the first symbol is t105. Then the second symbol is t119, which is NT28, another terminal. Then comes t66, which is NT32 (since NT32 is t66).\n\nSo, the third symbol is t66, which is NT32. So, now, let's track the parsing steps:\n\n1. S -> NT1 NT28 (so far: t105, t119)\n\n2. NT1 -> NT25 NT17: so we push NT25 and NT17.\n\n3. Next, we have NT28 -> NT4 NT6.\n\nNow, in the string, after t105 (NT1), the next is t119 (NT28), then t66 (NT32). Hmm, this might mean that after NT1, we need to process NT28 and then NT32, but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parsing needs to follow a certain order, starting with S, then NT1, then NT28, and so on, decomposing each non-terminal step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps more carefully:\n\n- The string starts with t105, which is NT1. So we pop S and push NT1 and NT28. Next symbols are t119, t66, etc.\n\n- Now, we have symbols t119 (NT28), t66 (NT32). Wait, but after t105, the next is t119, which is NT28. So, after S is split into NT1 (t105) and NT28 (t119), the NT28 needs to be processed.\n\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT6. So, NT28 becomes NT4 and NT6. Now, the next symbol is t66 (NT32). Let's see how t66 is generated.\n\n- Looking at the grammar, NT32 is 't66', and NT32 -> NT15 NT13. So, NT32 splits into NT15 and NT13. So, in the string, after t105, t119, comes t66 (NT32), then t37, t52, t117, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should model the entire parsing process step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to represent the string as a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So each production is like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit complex with many productions, but I notice that some non-terminals are producing 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals. So the string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which are likely terminals.\n\nI need to check if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nStarting with S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT1 NT28 and S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nI need to see if the string can be generated by either of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first three tokens are 't28', 't50', 't89'. Wait, but S produces two non-terminals, so the string will have to be split into two parts. Let me see, the string is long, so maybe I need to parse it step by step.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model the derivation as a parse tree. Each step reduces the non-terminals using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to match the string by consuming it token by token, ensuring that each step of the grammar can account for the current terminal.\n\nBut this might take a while, given the string is quite long. Maybe I can start by looking for the initial productions.\n\nLet me see S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT1 NT28. The nt1 and nt28 must be expanded into the strings.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT50 NT27, so the first part would be nt50 and nt27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't28'.

So NT56 might eventually reduce to some terminals.\n\nThe key is to match the string step by step.\n\nBut this might take too long. Maybe I can look for the start symbol S and see if the string can be broken into parts that match the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to try to parse the string backward. Let's see:\n\nThe last token is 't3'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't3'? Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't3'. The production NT35 -> 't17' doesn't generate 't3', but maybe through other productions.\n\nWait, looking again, I don't see any rule for a non-terminal producing 't3'. So perhaps the last token 't3' can't be generated, which would mean the string is invalid, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Looking through all the rules, the only terminals are the ones like 't8', 't94', etc., but I don't see any rule where a non-terminal expands to 't3'.

{"custom_id":"request-666","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. This should make parsing a bit manageable, but with the size of the grammar, it might be a bit complex.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's all non-terminals (like S, NT36, NT28, etc.) that produce other non-terminals or terminal symbols (like 't135', 't29', etc.). The terminals are the t's with numbers, and the non-terminals are the ones with NT followed by a number, except for the start symbol S which starts as NT1.\n\nThe string to check is `t135 t29 t3 t87 t41 t28 t59 t123 t28 t89 t91 t31 t24 t29 t40 t123 t120 t2 t123 t97 t93 t52 t98 t1 t105 t91 t29 t120 t114 t117 t111 t70 t14 t82 t40 t1`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the string should be a leftmost derivation starting from S. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. But since it's CNF, each production is two symbols at a time, so the string's length should be 2^n + 1, where n is the number of productions. Wait, actually, if we have m productions, the length could vary.\n\nBut instead of looking at the structure, maybe it's easier to try to parse the string step by step according to the grammar rules. Let's break down the string and see if we can match it to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two productions: NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27. So the string must start with either NT1 or NT50 followed by NT1 or NT27. Let's see what starts the string.\n\nThe string begins with `t135` which is a terminal. Let's check which non-terminals produce t135. Looking through the grammar, several non-terminals produce 't135'. For example, NT17 \u2192 't94', NT35 \u2192 't105', etc. Hmm, perhaps looking for where t135 comes from would help.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 't94', not t135. Let me check all the productions that result in 't135'. Scanning the productions, I see that NT35 \u2192 't105' and another production: Wait, checking again, the non-terminals that result in t135: I think only NT90 or something, but actually looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions, the only ones that result in 't135' are probably NT... Hmm, looking through, I see that in the grammar, some non-terminals produce t135. Wait, in the provided productions:\n\nI don't see any NT producing t135 exactly. Wait, the given grammar list shows:\n\nLooking through all productions, I don't immediately see a non-terminal that produces 't135'. Wait, perhaps it's a typo? Or maybe I'm missing it. Let me check again:\n\nLooking for t135 in the productions: \n\nLooking through the provided productions, I don't see any NT35 producing t135. Instead, for example, NT9 \u2192 t19, NT7 \u2192 t97, etc. Wait, no, t135 is probably a terminal generated by a non-terminal I'm not seeing. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, in the grammar, the production NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. Then NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. Then NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which seems recursive. Maybe NT6 produces 't108' and 't54' as well. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t135, which could correspond to the non-terminal NT17 since I see NT17 \u2192 't94', but that's 't94', not t135. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the production chain leads to t135 elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the entire string and see if each t can be matched by the grammar's terminals, and see if each 'block' can be broken down into the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be produced by starting from S and applying the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent parser or similar approach would be complex, but given the time, maybe I can attempt a step-by-step breakdown.\n\nAnother approach: the string consists of a series of terminals. Since each non-terminal production produces either two non-terminals or a terminal, the string length should correspond to possible expansions. But given the complexity, maybe it's easier to look for the productions that could generate the given string.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for the breakdown of the string t135 t29 t3 ... etc., maybe t135 is from a non-terminal NT27. Let me check the grammar: NT27 \u2192 NT43 NT50. Then looking at NT43: NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3. NT8 \u2192 t7? Wait, looking through, I see NT8 \u2192 t83, NT3 \u2192 t42, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from the beginning: the first part is t135 t29. If S starts with NT1 NT1, then breaking it down. Alternatively, S could be NT50 NT50 or NT1 NT27, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see what each t in the string corresponds to and trace backward. For example, t135 could come from which non-terminal? Let's check the grammar for any NT that produces 't135'.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT producing 't135'. For example, NT14 \u2192 t79, NT26 \u2192 t48, etc. So if the string starts with 't135', but none of the NTs in the grammar produce 't135', perhaps the string isn't generated by the grammar. But that seems too quick because I might have made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the productions to see if any NT produces 't135':\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT4 \u2192 't91', NT29 \u2192 't40', etc. Hmm, actually, I notice that several NTs produce t87, t27, etc., but 't135' seems to be a generated terminal. If it's not listed as a production, then perhaps the grammar doesn't have any non-terminal that produces 't135', meaning the string can't be generated. Alternatively, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, no, looking again, in the grammar list, I find NT24 \u2192 't11', NT22 \u2192 't58', but 't135' must be produced by some NT. However, in the provided grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't135'. Thus, the first symbol in the string is 't135', which cannot be generated by any of the NT productions in the grammar. Therefore, the entire string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again. Scanning all the productions, the only way a terminal can appear is via the 2nd form, which is A \u2192 a. Looking through, 't135' is a terminal. Is there any production that produces 't135'?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error earlier. Let me check the productions again. Scanning each production line:\n\n- Looking for any line where RHS is 't135'. Looking through:\n\nYes! I found it: NT17 \u2192 't94' and others, but wait, actually, in the provided grammar, I find that NT27 \u2192 't124', not t135. Wait, let me double-check:\n\nWait, the productions provided are as follows (abbreviated), and I need to find any NT that produces 't135':\n\nLooking through each line, I see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT16 \u2192 NT10 NT34\n- NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13\n- NT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53\n- NT34 \u2192 NT44 NT38\n- NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3\n- NT41 \u2192 NT42 NT35\n- NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15\n- NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT35 NT34\n- NT20 \u2192 NT43 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production starts with an 'NT' followed by numbers or varies.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t83 t80 t59 t34 t93 t82 t59 t3 t14 t50 t81 t108 t2 t79 t19 t112 t82 t28 t14 t105 t73 t80 t40 t45 t79 t24 t38 t78 t4 t69 t69 t116 t41 t82 t3 t100 t34`.\n\nWow, that's a long string. Let me see if I can find a way to parse it or at least figure out the steps the parser would take. Since it's a context-free grammar, we can use a recursive descent parser or maybe a CYK algorithm, but manually analyzing that might be too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find the leftmost derivation for the string. Each token should correspond to a terminal in some production rule, and the sequence of productions should build up the string correctly.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t83. Let me see which production can generate t83. Looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT17 -> t94  \nNT27 -> t124  \nNT42 -> t2  \nNT10 -> t2  \nWait, that might not be helpful. Let me check which non-terminals produce a terminal that matches any of the string's tokens.\n\nLet's consider the beginning of the string: t83. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nS -> NT1 NT28  \nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nSo S is the start symbol and it can be split into two productions. Let's see the possible first step.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to look for which non-terminal can produce t83. Looking through the productions, I notice:\n\nNT27 -> t124  \nNT24 -> t62  \nIs there a production for another non-terminal that can produce t83?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that directly yields t83. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking more closely, perhaps some non-terminals combine to produce t83. For example, NT35 might produce t87 and something else, but not t83.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Each production in the grammar either is a terminal (like NT24 -> t62) or produces two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT1 NT28). So the string is generated by some sequence of these steps.\n\nThe string starts with t83, t80, t59, etc. Let me try to map this.\n\nIf I look at the grammar, some rules produce terminal strings. Let's list them out:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t93  \nNT14 \u2192 t79  \nNT17 \u2192 t94  \nNT24 \u2192 t62  \nNT28 \u2192 t76 (but also t97?) Wait, looking again:\n\nOh, I see NT28 has a rule that says NT28 \u2192 t97. Also, is there any other production for NT28? Yes:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6  \nAlso, earlier in the list, I see NT20 \u2192 t38 and other rules. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions that generate terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT9 -> t93  \nNT14 -> t79  \nNT17 -> t94  \nNT24 -> t62  \nNT28 -> t76 (and also t97?) Let's check.\n\nLooking through the detailed rules, several times 'nt28' appears in the rule with 't' followed by some numbers.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t97  \nIs that correct? Looking back, yes, I see:\n\nIn the grammar, the rule NT28 \u2192 t97 is present. Alternatively, there was another rule for NT28:\n\nWait, no, looking again, the rule for NT28 is:\n\nEarlier, I saw NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 (so a production with two non-terminals). Then further down, do I see NT28 producing a 't' something terminal? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t97\n\nWait, yes, early on in the list:\n\nNT28 -> t8 t97 (Wait, no, let me check exactly. Looking at the initial lines, I see:\n\nWait, no, earlier lines in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the first part:\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT10 NT34  \nNT22 \u2192 NT4 NT6  \nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6  \nThen later in the list, at some point:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t8 t97? Or is that where?\n\nWait, no, looking through the list, the first occurrence is:\n\nAt the end of the list, I see:\n\nNT28 -> t8 t97\n\nWait, actually, looking back, in the production list, there's a line:\n\nNT28 -> NT8 NT3\n\nBut then, further down:\n\nNT37 -> t17  \nSo, I think I might have misread the grammar. Let me go through the entire list more carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar production list is quite long, but to avoid getting stuck, perhaps I should note that every time a non-terminal is immediately followed by a 't' and a number, it's a terminal.\n\nSo looking for NT productions where the RHS is a 't' plus number.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\nHere's a list of all NT rules with possible 't' terminals:\n\n1. NT9 \u2192 t93  \n2. NT14 \u2192 t79  \n3. NT17 \u2192 t94  \n4. NT24 \u2192 t62  \n5. NT27 \u2192 t124, also a production  \n6. NT34 \u2192 t37  \n7. NT35 \u2192 t53  \n8. NT44 \u2192 t114  \n9. NT47 \u2192 t40  \n10. NT55 \u2192 t15  \n11. NT56 \u2192 t112  \n12. NT8 \u2192 t76? Or is it NT36? Wait, no\u2014it depends.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note which NTs produce 't' strings.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t93  \n- NT14 \u2192 t79  \n- NT17 \u2192 t94  \n- NT24 \u2192 t62  \n- NT28 \u2192 t97 (earlier), and also maybe other 't's  \n\nWait, perhaps at the end of the list, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t8 t97  \nSo that's NT28 \u2192 t8 t97, which is a terminal followed by a non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs might have 't's:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT37 \u2192 t17  \nNT7 \u2192 t93  \nNT7 \u2192 t97  \nNT4 \u2192 t91  \nNT40 \u2192 t28  \n\nWait, so NT7 appears twice: once as t93, once as t97. Similarly, NT4 appears as t91.\n\nOkay, so let's map all the NTs with RHS including 't's.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t83, t80, t59, etc. Let's see if any NT combination can produce t83.\n\nLooking at the NTs:\n\nIs there any production that directly yields t83? Looking through the list:\n\nNo NT seems to directly yield t83. Hmm. So either t83 is a combination, or perhaps some non-terminals combine to produce t83.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe the first step is to check if the string can start with t83. If t83 isn't directly produced by any NT, but the first NT production is NT17 \u2192 t94. Wait, no, t94 is not t83.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed from S by splitting into NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the productions to see if any combination of S's productions can derive parts of the string.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complex. Another approach is to look for whether t83 is present in the grammar and whether it can be part of a derivation.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-682","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol, which can produce a terminal. But looking at the provided grammar, I see both S and many NTs (non-terminals) having productions with terminals and non-terminals. So, actually, it's almost Chomsky Normal Form, except that S can produce NTs, which in turn produce terminals and NTs, but the productions with terminals are only in the S or NT terminals that directly produce terminals, not necessarily that all productions have exactly two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, Chomsky Normal Form is strictly that all productions are of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. So in this case, looking at the grammar, most rules have two non-terminals, but some have a mix or a terminal and a non-terminal. For example, S -> NT1 NT1, which seems fine, but 't73' is a terminal. Hmm, so some productions have terminals on the right side. So maybe the grammar isn't exactly in CNF because CNF typically doesn't allow terminals on the right side, except for the start symbol. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, looking closely, actually, I see that many of the productions have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, like NT28 -> NT4 NT6, and some have a terminal. For example, NT14 -> 't79' and NT27 -> 't124'. So these are terminals, meaning that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. That might be a Reduced CNF or a different form. So it's not exactly CNF anymore, perhaps. But the user says it's in Chomsky Normal Form. Maybe I need to clarify that, but perhaps the key is to proceed regardless.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals and possibly non-terminals (but in this case, all are 't' followed by numbers, so terminals). So the input string is made up of t73, t94, etc., all of which are terminals.\n\nTo figure out if the grammar generates this string, I think I need to construct a parse tree for this string according to the grammar. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm, but with the given grammar, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string step by step, seeing if each part can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, I can reverse-engineer the string, seeing if each terminal can be reached through the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me first write down the string:\n\nt73, t94, t21, t105, t100, t5, t131, t80, t79, t52, t66, t107, t107, t31, t14, t34, t3, t8, t42, t83, t19, t83, t122, t17, t36, t45, t80, t102, t41, t87, t131, t4, t45, t100, t42, t59, t105.\n\nSince it's a CFG, and the start symbol is S, which can produce a sequence of two non-terminals (S -> NT1 NT1 or S -> NT50 NT27). So the initial step is that the entire string must be produced by either S => NT1 NT1 or S => NT50 NT27.\n\nSo, to proceed, I can check if the sequence can be split into two parts, each part being a parse for NT1 or NT50 and NT27, respectively. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to see which non-terminals can produce which parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t73. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t73. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that has a production that ends with 't73'. Scanning through the rules:\n\nLooking for 't73' in the rules. I see NT46 -> 't73' and NT35 -> 't105' and NT17 -> 't94', etc.\n\nSo, NT46 can produce 't73'. Let me check the rule for NT46: NT46 -> 't87' or 't73' or 't45' or 't73'? Wait, in the grammar, looking at NT46's productions:\n\nNT46 -> 't87' (I think this might be a typo because in the original grammar, some rules have mixed terminals and non-terminals). Wait, the initial grammar includes lines like NT46 -> NT20 NT8, others like NT46 -> 't87' and others like NT54 -> 't53' etc.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar provided has several rules where non-terminals directly produce terminals. So, for example, NT26 -> 't48', NT17 -> 't79', etc.\n\nSo, for the string's first term 't73', we need to see which non-terminals can produce 't73'. Looking through all the rules:\n\n- NT46 has a production that includes 't73': looking at the rules, I see NT46 -> 't87', but no 't73'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar lines, for example:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, looking for any rule that produces 't73':\n\nLooking through all the productions, I find:\n\n- NT46 -> 't73' (assuming line: NT46 -> 't73'; or checking the given grammar, let me scan.\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\n- NT46 -> 't73'? Let me check the lines again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here's one of the rules: NT46 -> 't73'; and another rule: NT17 -> 't94'; etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the line: NT46 -> 't87'? Or perhaps I miswrote earlier. Let me double-check:\n\nNo, looking back, the grammar lines are as provided. So, I see:\n\nLooking for any 't73' in the productions:\n\nWait, I think in the grammar, I see NT46 -> 't87'; NT33 -> 't87'; NT7 -> 't93'; and others. So, perhaps it's not directly producing t73, but maybe through another production.\n\nWait, perhaps the first thought is incorrect, maybe t73 comes from a production step. Alternatively, perhaps 't73' is produced directly by a NT.\n\nHmm, but looking at the given rules, for example, the only rules that produce terminals are those ending with 't' followed by numbers, but I don't see nt46 -> 't73'. Let me scan the entire grammar:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal is directly replaced by 't73'. I think I see:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT46 -> 't87' (two times)\n- NT4 -> 't91' (I think it's 't91', but no, in the given data, 't91' is NT46 -> 't91'?)\nWait, let's look at each line:\n\n- Line: NT46 -> 't87'\n- Line: NT46 -> 't73'\n- Line: NT46 -> 't45'\n- Line: NT46 -> 't27'\n\nWait, no, now I'm getting confused. Let me parse the grammar step by step.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see for NT46:\n\nLines:\n\nNT46 -> 't87'\n\nNT46 -> 't73'\n\nWait, no, looking at the data provided:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar lines:\n\nWait, perhaps I miswrote. Let me extract all the productions:\n\nIt's a long list, so I need to be careful.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I find that NT46 appears in multiple rules. For example:\n\n- NT46 -> 't87'\n- NT46 -> 't73'\n- NT46 -> 't45'\n- NT46 -> 't27'\n\nWait, so yes, NT46 can produce 't73' directly. Similarly, NT46 can produce 't87', etc.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other non-terminals that can produce 't73', perhaps NT46 is one of them.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't73', which must come from NT46's rule.\n\nSo the first symbol 't73' comes from NT46.

{"custom_id":"request-690","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure and the production rules. The grammar starts with S and has several non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) and terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). Each production is of the form NT -> NT NT, which means each production splits the non-terminal into two other non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t80 t27 t62 t65 t41 t122 t66 t45 t93 t19 t98 t27 t41 t73 t3 t117 t21 t37 t31 t108 t94 t31 t27 t126 t116 t116 t93 t27 t11 t36 t114 t66 t59 t102 t58 t40 t134 t53`.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step of a derivation introduces exactly one terminal symbol. So the number of production steps should match the length of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it has 40 tokens (each 't' followed by a number is a terminal). Each production in the grammar produces two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. So starting from S, each step adds one symbol, and after n steps, there are n symbols in the string. For 40 symbols, we should have 39 productions.\n\nSo, first check: the string length is 40. That means the derivation should have 39 steps. Let me see if all the productions in the string can be connected in a way that generates this structure without any leftover non-terminals at the end.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string according to the grammar. Since parsing can be tricky, I can try to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the grammar's production rules.\n\nGoing through each token:\n\n1. t80: Need to see if 80 is a terminal that appears in the grammar. Checking all the rules, 't8' appears when S is split into NT1 and NT28, giving 't2' and 't8'. Similarly, other terminals in the grammar are single 't' followed by numbers. For example, t79, t27, etc.\n\nWait, I need to check if t80 is a terminal generated anywhere. Looking through the grammar's terminal rules, the highest 't' I see is t135, but t80 isn't directly there. Let me check if t80 could be part of a longer production. No, because all terminals are single letters. So 't80' can't be a single terminal; it must be part of the entire string. But the grammar doesn't generate 't80' as a terminal. So if the string contains t80, that would mean it's impossible, right? Because none of the productions in the grammar directly generate 't80'.\n\nBut wait, looking deeper into the grammar, for example, NT46 can produce 't8', and other NTs might produce combinations leading to multi-digit numbers, but not individual multi-digit tokens because the grammar is CNF. Each production is either a terminal or splits into two NTs. So 't80' would require that a production for some NT directly results in t80, which isn't present. So the presence of t80 as a separate token is a problem because the grammar can't generate that exact token.\n\nSo this might already mean that the string isn't generated by the grammar. But let me double-check other parts in case there's a mistake.\n\nWait, let me see: the production for NT46 is ND (in terminal) or splits into more NTs. The terminal options for NT46 are 't8' and 't27'. There's also a rule NT24 that produces 't11' and 't24' is elsewhere. Wait, maybe another NT produces t80?\n\nLooking through the terminal definitions:\n\nLooking for 't80' in the grammar, I see that some NTs have terminal outputs. For instance, NT14's production ends with 't94', NT7 ends with 't93', 't97', 't94', etc. But none end with t80.\n\nSo t80 as a separate token is not possible in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains a terminal that isn't present as a terminal in any production rule.\n\nWait, to make sure, let's go through all the terminals in the string. For example, t80 isn't present in any production's terminal. Each production for an NT either results in a terminal like t9, t7, t55, etc., but not t80. So indeed, t80 can't be generated.\n\nTherefore, the string contains a token that's not allowed, so it's definitely not in the language.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-689","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the production rules. The grammar start symbol is S, and the string to evaluate starts with t42 and ends with t. Each production rule seems to be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI notice that the production rules have various non-terminals, but some of them eventually lead to terminal symbols labeled 't' followed by numbers. My string consists entirely of terminals, so I need to work backwards from S to see if it can derive the given string.\n\nThe string is: t42 t97 t3 t97 t31 t42 t8 t40 t8 t58 t131 t87 t40 t131 t36 t122 t114 t11 t27 t126 t111 t45 t42 t119 t19 t111 t97 t48 t76 t19 t16 t28 t76 t37 t2 t50 t131 t4.\n\nStarting from S, the production rules are:\nS \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nSo S can produce either NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT1 NT28. Then, NT1 can produce NT25 NT17, as per the rule NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nNow, NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31 (rule NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31). NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 (rule NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6). Wait, this might get into a loop because NT6 \u2192 NT54 followed by NT6 again. But looking at the terminals, t52 appears twice, but I don't see 't54' in the string.\n\nWait, but actually, looking deeper, perhaps NT6 can produce a terminal. The productions for NT6 include NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 and NT6 \u2192 t58. Wait, no, I think I'm getting something wrong here. Let me check: From NT6, the rules include NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 and NT6 \u2192 t58? Wait no, checking the given rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 and NT6 \u2192 t58, nt6 \u2192 t21. Let me double-check the rules provided. Yes, looking back:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58\n\nAnd others, like NT6 \u2192 t120, etc. Wait, more accurately, in the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 t58 is present, and as written here:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58\n\nSo, NT6 can directly produce t58, or it can go into another non-terminal. So, if NT6 is part of a production, it can either continue producing more non-terminals or terminate with t58.\n\nGoing back to NT25, which is NT6 NT31. So when we have NT25, it will produce NT6 and NT31. If NT6 produces t58, then NT31 can produce more.\n\nLooking at NT31: the rules for NT31 include NT117, and others. Hmm, this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the entire string and see if it can be matched by the grammar's structure. The string starts with multiple t42 and t97, which suggests that certain non-terminals produce these.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT22 \u2192 t58 and t76, among others. Also, NT9 \u2192 t97. There are also rules like NT4 \u2192 t91, NT7 \u2192 t93, etc.\n\nWait, to get t42, I need to see where 't42' comes from. Looking through the rules, NT40 \u2192 t28, NT42 \u2192 t2, and other rules. Wait, no, looking more specifically, the rules for NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, which might produce t42.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 \u2192 t94. And NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31, as above.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps a better approach is to consider the terminals in the string and see if they can be matched by the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string starts with t42, which likely comes from NT1, as per NT1 \u2192 t42. Similarly, t97 is produced by NT7 \u2192 t97.\n\nSo let's try to build the derivation. Starting with S, suppose we take S \u2192 NT50 NT27, because maybe NT50 can produce t42 and NT27 can produce t97.\n\nWait, NT50 \u2192 t4, according to the rules, because looking at the rules for NT50: NT50 \u2192 t4. So S would be t4 and t97 from NT50 and NT27. But in the string, the first part is t42 t97, not t4 t97. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, if S \u2192 NT1 NT28, then NT1 could produce t42 and NT28 could produce t97.\n\nLooking at NT1, the rule is NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. Does NT25 produce a terminal? Let's see: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. NT6 can produce t58 or loop. NT31 can produce what? Looking at NT31's rules, it seems complex. Maybe I'm on the wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated by a series of S \u2192 NT1 NT28, then NT1 \u2192 NT42, NT28 \u2192 t97.\n\nWait, looking at NT42: There's a rule NT22 \u2192 t76, t58, but NT42 is a terminal or derived?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, do any non-terminals directly produce 't42'? Let's check. The rules provided don't directly have a production for a non-terminal that produces t42. However, NT1 \u2192 t42 is mentioned, as NT1 \u2192 t42.\n\nSo, yes, NT1 produces t42. So maybe we can have NT1 \u2192 t42, and then NT28 \u2192 t97.\n\nNow, the question is: can NT28 produce t97? Looking at the rules for NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6. Does either NT4 or NT6 produce t97? Looking through the rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t91.\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58 or loops.\n\nSo, NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 would produce t91 and t58, which is not t97. Hmm. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I've got this wrong. Let me look again: NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6. The terminals for NT4 and NT6 are t91 and t58, respectively. So that would produce t91 t58, but our string starts with t42 t97. So that would not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption about S \u2192 NT1 NT28 is correct, but NT28 needs to produce 't97' somehow. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce t97 directly. Yes, looking at the rules, NT7 \u2192 t97, and NT21 \u2192 t1, but also other rules that eventually produce t97.\n\nWait, looking at NT21: the rule is NT21 \u2192 t1, which is a terminal, but that's t1, not t97. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT22 \u2192 t58 and t76. So if NT28 produces NT4 and NT6, and if NT6 can somehow produce t97, but looking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 t58, but perhaps through another route.\n\nWait, maybe NT6 can go through other non-terminals to reach t97. Let me check: NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, and looking at NT54 \u2192 NT27 NT55, then NT27 can produce various things.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT16 NT4, etc. This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT50 NT27. NT50 \u2192 t4, and NT27 \u2192 t97. But in the string, the first two symbols are t42 t97, not t4 t97. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, let me look at the string again: t42 t97 t3 t97 t31 t42 t8 t40 t8 t58 t131 t87 t40 t131 t36 t122 t114 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with determining whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the string to evaluate is: `t111 t53 t24 t108 t45 t78 t102 t93 t87 t28 t66 t80 t131 t53 t50 t100 t117 t83 t8 t1 t34 t3 t100 t27 t126 t45 t62 t84 t41 t36 t52 t107 t27 t59 t108 t124 t62 t14 t87`.\n\nThe grammar is provided in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the starting symbol which can produce terminals. The start symbol here is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol S can expand into two options: NT1 NT1 (wait, no, looking again, it's S \u2192 NT1 NT28 and S \u2192 NT50 NT27). Oh, right, S's first production is NT1 followed by NT28, and the second is NT50 followed by NT27.\n\nBut wait, NT1 and NT28 are non-terminals. So I need to see how they can expand.\n\nLooking at NT1: in the rules, NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. NT25 is another non-terminal, and NT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53. NT44 \u2192 NT38 NT13, and NT38 \u2192 NT102, and so on. This seems to involve multiple steps, possibly leading to terminal symbols, but each step involves non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better approach than expanding each non-terminal, especially since the string contains a lot of t<something> which likely correspond to terminals. So maybe I should check each production to see if it can derive the sequence of terminals given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by combining the right-hand sides of the productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production results in a string of terminals when fully expanded.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t111, which suggests that the first part of the derivation must produce t111. Let's see what productions can result in t111.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only terminal is 't...', and each NT production eventually leads to a terminal. For instance, NT14 \u2192 't94', NT7 \u2192 't97' or 't93', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more efficient to see which non-terminals can directly produce t111. Scanning the grammar, I notice that NT29 \u2192 't53' and 't48'\u2014no t111 there. NT33 \u2192 't79' or 't36'. NT46 \u2192 't24' and 't70' or 't100' etc., but that's for two symbols. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each production in CNF can only derive two symbols at each step, but terminals can only appear at the leaves. So each step either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps the entire string must be derived by a sequence of such productions.\n\nBut the string provided has a lot of terminals, so perhaps each element in the string is a result of an NT's production. So let me try to split the string into segments corresponding to each NT production.\n\nWait, the string is: t111 t53 t24 t108 t45 t78 t102 t93 t87 t28 t66 t80 t131 t53 t50 t100 t117 t83 t8 t1 t34 t3 t100 t27 t126 t45 t62 t84 t41 t36 t52 t107 t27 t59 t108 t124 t62 t14 t87.\n\nThat's 39 tokens. Since the grammar in CNF, each production step either gives two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get 39 terminals, we must have a binary tree where each internal node splits into two, so the number of leaves would be 2^depth or something, but 39 is not a power of 2. Hmm. That might mean the string can't be generated by this grammar because in CNF, the entire expansion must result in a string where the length is a power of 2, starting from S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nWait, wait, let's calculate the length of the string. It's 39 tokens. Now, in CNF, each step can only split into two, so starting from S, each expansion increases the length by 1 in the sense of the number of NTs, but the terminals come from the leaves. So the number of terminals after full expansion is 2^k, where k is the number of splits from S. For example, S can split into NT1 NT28, each of which can split into two, etc.\n\nBut in this case, the number of terminals is 39, which is not a power of two. The nearest powers are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). 39 is between them and not a power of two. So unless some NTs can produce multiple terminals in a single step, but in CNF, each production is only two symbols. Therefore, the total number of terminals must be a power of two.\n\nTherefore, a string with 39 terminals cannot be generated by this grammar. So the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

In this case, the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t3, t58, etc., up to t131. The non-terminals are all the other capital letters like S, NTx, etc., based on the rules provided.\n\nThe goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by following these production rules step by step. I think the best approach is to use a parsing strategy, like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, maybe a more manual approach is feasible.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the string as tokens for clarity:\nt3, t58, t50, t31, t98, t78, t34, t82, t84, t89, t38, t131, t59, t81, t58, t134, t24, t80, t40, t40, t45, t24, t79, t122, t41, t78, t109, t5, t69, t76, t16, t94, t3, t59, t15, t124, t17, t131, t116.\n\nSince the grammar is CFTN, and the string consists of terminals, the parsing process should consume all these terminals in order through the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the possible initial productions are:\nS \u2192 NT1 NT28\nor\nS \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nLet me check if either of these start the string.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT1 NT28, then the next part should start with NT1 and then NT28.\n\nLooking at NT1:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 \u2192 ... wait, looking at the rules, NT6 has a rule: NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which is a right recursion. That can be rewritten using the epsilon-removal or by using a look-ahead approach. Alternatively, maybe in the string, t6 is not present, but in the string there's t58 and t76 but no t6, so perhaps NT6 is not used here. Alternatively, looking at the grammar, perhaps NT6 can produce t6 directly, but looking through the rules, I don't see any production where NT6 \u2192 t6, but in the rules, I do see:\n\nLooking through the given rules, under NT6: 'NT6 -> t54 NT6' which suggests it can produce t54 and another NT6, perhaps leading to an infinite loop, but looking at the provided rules, I see that some terms are terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, in the rules, I see that some capital letters later have terminals:\n\nFor example, NT35 \u2192 't105', and others like NT14 \u2192 't79', etc. So perhaps some of the NT rules can produce terminal symbols directly.\n\nWait, but looking through the rules, I can see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58 (Wait, under NT46, which is a different non-terminal).

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. It's quite extensive with various non-terminals and terminals. The string we need to check is a series of terminals: t19 t123 t69 t81 t135 t131 t117 t119 t4 t91 t126 t131 t84 t124 t28 t16 t83 t28 t117 t134 t27 t50 t134 t21 t53 t79 t17 t8 t97 t117 t131 t41 t45 t107 t89.\n\nSince Chomsky Normal Form only allows for two non-terminals in the right-hand side of any production, any derivation path from the start symbol S to the string must consist of rules that produce two non-terminals step by step, ultimately leading to the terminals.\n\nI remember that the standard way to check this is to see if the number of symbols in the string is a power of two plus one. The initial string has 48 symbols. Let's calculate 2^n = 48. Hmm, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, so 48 isn't a power of two. That suggests the string can't be generated by the grammar because each step in the derivation would cause the number to double, and from S, the string would only have lengths 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, etc. Since 48 isn't in that sequence, it's impossible for the grammar to generate a string of length 48.\n\nTo elaborate, starting from S, the first step would give two symbols (like NT1 NT28). Each symbol is two non-terminals, so each step would multiply the number of symbols by two and add one. So, starting from 1 (S), next step 3, then 7, 15, 31, 63, etc. Since 48 isn't in this progression, the string cannot be generated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look at the production rules.\n\nLooking for NT6 \u2192 ... , I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58\n\nSo if the first token is t28, that's part of NT6, but NT6 can only produce t58.

Hmm, this is getting messy. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar uses 't' tokens as terminal symbols.

Each non-terminal in the grammar can produce a 't' and a number, or other non-terminals.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to parse this.

{"custom_id":"request-726","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form and a string that I need to check if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. The string is `t11 t3 t73 t37 t27 t28 t70 t87 t84 t1 t8 t45 t109 t114 t5 t123 t84 t98 t42 t81 t107 t8 t81 t102 t89 t45 t134 t52 t112 t114 t15 t123 t48 t114 t116 t29 t73 t19 t82 t11 t28`. \n\nFirst, I'll unpack the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see a lot of production rules where non-terminals expand into other non-terminals or terminals (like t11, t28, etc.). Some of the production rules involve terminals, such as NT46 \u2192 't8', which means NT46 directly produces the terminal 't8'.\n\nThe string given consists of a series of terminals: t11, t3, t73, etc. My task is to determine if there's a derivation from the start symbol S that can produce this exact string.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, I need to see how it can expand. Looking at the first two rules:\n\nS -> NT1 NT1\nWait, no, looking again, the rules are S -> NT1 NT28 and S -> NT50 NT27. So S can expand into two different combinations. Let's see:\n\n1. S can produce NT1 NT28\n2. S can produce NT50 NT27\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't11'. Let me check which non-terminals can derive to 't11'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT24 \u2192 't11' is one such production. So if at any point in the derivation, we have NT24, it can produce 't11'.\n\nContinuing, the second token is 't3'. Looking for NTs that can produce 't3'. I see NT53 \u2192 't3' is one of the rules. So we'd need NT53 to produce 't3'.\n\nThird token is 't73'. Checking for NTs that produce 't73', NT47 \u2192 't47' but that doesn't help. Wait, no, looking for 't73', perhaps NT46 \u2192 't73'? Wait, no, I don't see NT46 \u2192 't73' in the grammar. Wait, looking back, yes: NT27 \u2192 't73' appears.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT47 is used in some production rules producing 't3', but I need 't73'. Hmm. Let me check all terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's NT44 \u2192 't114'? No, wait, in the productions, I don't see any NT rule producing 't73' except NT47 \u2192 't73' isn't listed. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT36 \u2192 't87' and NT53 \u2192 't3'. There's NT27 \u2192 't73' somewhere? Or is it NT47? Let me check the production rules:\n\nWait, no, I think I misread. In the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT... produces 't73' except perhaps I'm misremembering. Wait, let me scan through:\n\nNo, the string has t73 as the third token. So I think in the grammar, perhaps NT38 \u2192 't73'? Wait, I don't see NT38 \u2192 't73'. Let me look through all the rules.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check all the production rules that are terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules in the grammar, I see entries like:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't87'\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT47 \u2192 't73'\n- NT7 \u2192 't93'\n- NT17 \u2192 't79'\n- NT27 \u2192 't73'\n- NT17 \u2192 't24'\n- NT53 \u2192 't105'\n- NT29 \u2192 't14'\n- NT19 \u2192 't126'\n- NT46 \u2192 't76'\n- NT112 \u2192 ...? No, it's all two-terminals except for 't's.\n\nWait, I'm seeing that there's NT27 \u2192 't73' and also NT47 \u2192 't73'? Let me check again. Looking through the list:\n\nOh, I see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't73'\n\nSo that's correct; NT27 directly produces 't73'. So the third token is 't73', which can be derived from NT27.\n\nSo putting it together, so far, after three steps, the string starts with NT24 \u2192 't11', then the next NT is NT3 producing 't3', then NT27 \u2192 't73'. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit overwhelmed; maybe I should construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to try to find a sequence of productions that can generate the given string. Since the string is quite long, it would be impractical to do a full derivation, so instead, perhaps I can check if each terminal in the string can be derived by some non-terminal, and that the structure is possible through the grammar.\n\nFirst, S must expand into two non-terminals, say A and B. So the string must be a sequence of terminals that can be produced by AB.\n\nLooking at the string: First token is 't11', which comes from, say, NT1 (I think NT24 \u2192 't11').\n\nThen 't3', which could be NT53. Then 't73' comes from NT27, and so on. Wait, but let me map each part into possible non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to go through the string and see if each token can be matched by a non-terminal, ensuring that the entire string can be generated.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can look for whether each terminal in the string appears in the grammar as a terminal, and whether the derivation can be constructed.\n\nLooking at the string again: the first token is t11. In the grammar, NT24 \u2192 't11' is present.\n\nSecond token: t3. In the grammar, NT53 \u2192 't3' is present.\n\nThird token: t73. NT27 \u2192 't73' is present.\n\nFourth token: t37. Looking for NT that derive to 't37'. The grammar has NT44 \u2192 't37'? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nYes, NT44 \u2192 't37' is present.\n\nFifth token: t27. NT47 \u2192 't27' is present.\n\nSixth token: t28. Looking for NT that can produce 't28'. In the grammar, NT46 \u2192 't28' is present.\n\nSeventh token: t70. Looking for NT70. The grammar has NT45 \u2192 't70' as one of the rules.\n\nEighth token: t87. NT36 \u2192 't87' is present.\n\nNinth: t84. Looking for t84, which is perhaps from NT17 or another. NT41 \u2192 't84' is present.\n\nTenth token: t1. Looking for NT1. NT41 \u2192 't84', but wait, is the last token 't1' in the string? Let me check:\n\nThe string is: t11 t3 t73 t37 t27 t28 t70 t87 t84 t1 ... yes, so after 't87' is 't84', then 't1', then 't8', etc.\n\nLooking for NT1. Oh, in the grammar, NT31 \u2192 't117' but that's not it. Wait, I might have missed: looking for NT that can produce 't1' in the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, look for 't1' in the terminals. I see that:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't84'\nNT33 \u2192 't79'\nWait, but I don't see any 't1' in the grammar. So how can we get 't1' in the string? That's suspicious because I don't find any production that results in 't1'.\n\nWait, does that mean the string can't be generated by the grammar at all, because 't1' isn't a terminal in the grammar?

{"custom_id":"request-719","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar problem to solve. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a form where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t2 t78 t131 t102 t42 t36 t79 t69 t59 t124 t38 t102 t41 t2 t82 t2 t53 t2 t2 t14 t98 t124 t69 t14 t3 t119 t62 t37 t109 t48 t63 t76 t111 t109 t14 t37 t87 t123 t37 t134 t78. \n\nFirst, I think I should process this string step by step according to the grammar rules. Starting from the start symbol S, which branches into S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. \n\nLet me break down the string into parts that might correspond to these branches. The first t2 is the start, so maybe the first option, S \u2192 NT1 NT28, which I think leads to a certain parsing.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t2, t78, which I think are results of specific NT productions. I recall that NT32 is one of the non-terminals, and so is NT15 and NT6. Let me see the relevant productions:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13\n- NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n\nWait, but NT6 is used in NT32 and when NT15 is used. But in the string, t2 is involved as well. Hmm, maybe I should look for where NT26 and NT20 are involved since those are also connected.\n\nLooking at the string again, after t2 comes t78 which is likely from NT47. But looking at NT47, it's actually a terminal 't3', as per the grammar: NT47 \u2192 't3'. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals convert to terminals. For example, NT47 is set to 't3'. So if the string includes t3, that would correspond to NT47.\n\nBut in the string, I don't see a t3 immediately. Wait, the string starts with t2, t78, etc. Maybe I should consider that some of these are part of the NT productions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Each production is a non-terminal, so the string must be built by expanding these non-terminals and reaching the terminals.\n\nLet me try to split the string into parts that correspond to the rules. The string is quite long, so perhaps I can find key points where the non-terminals occur.\n\nThe first symbol is t2, which I think is from NT6. Because in the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t2 t120, but wait, looking at the grammar rules, NT6 is 't58' later, but also appears as a rule: NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 and NT46 \u2192 NT6 ... Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.\n\nWait, let me look at NT6. From the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT46 \u2192 NT6 NT37\n- NT6 \u2192 t58\n- Also, from NT26: NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45\n- NT14 \u2192 NT24 NT0\n- NT45 \u2192 t28\n\nWait, but t2 is from NT21, perhaps? Or some other NT.\n\nWait, looking back, NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, which may be used to produce t2 as in the string.\n\nWait, another approach is to look for the production rules that directly lead to the string. The string has a t2 at the beginning, so let's see what produces t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 t29, NT21 \u2192 t3, NT26 \u2192 t48, NT14 \u2192 t79, NT32 \u2192 t66, NT32 \u2192 t108, NT14 \u2192 t24, etc. Perhaps t2 is produced by NT28 via NT28 \u2192 t8, but looking at the rules, no NT28 is defined as a terminal. Wait, checking the grammar again:\n\nI see, under NT28, it's used in other productions but doesn't directly produce terminal. Instead, let's see t2 is in the string, which is part of NT6. Wait, in the grammar, NT6 has a production: NT6 \u2192 't58', but I also see that NT21 \u2192 t3 and NT4 \u2192 t91, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should go step by step. Let's try to parse the string:\n\n1. Start with the entire string as S.\n\nThe grammar has S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Let's try both options.\n\nFirst, let's try S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nSo, NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nNT6 can be either NT54 NT6 or t58.\n\nIf we take t58 for NT6, so NT6 \u2192 t58.\n\nThen NT31 \u2192 NT117, but I don't see NT117 defined. Wait, looking at the grammar, there's NT31, which can go to NT50 or NT39.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck.

Let's think of the string as a sequence of symbols that are the concatenation of the expansions of the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar is a symbol that can produce other symbols.

However, looking at the string, the first symbol is t2, not t58. Hmm, maybe NT6 here produces a sequence of t's.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t58 only directly, unless it can be expanded further.

{"custom_id":"request-736","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is quite complex with multiple production rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens like 't16', 't11', etc. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way of structuring CFGs where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol does not appear on the right-hand side of any production. The end-of-string symbol is usually not present in the grammar, but in this case, the grammar includes terminals as part of the productions, so perhaps 't' followed by numbers are the terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the productions start with uppercase letters (like S -> NT1 NT28) and sometimes have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. For example, some rules like NT36 -> NT56 NT10 convert non-terminals to other non-terminals, but others like NT28 -> NT4 NT6 or NT28 -> NT8 NT8 have terminals as part of the right-hand side. Wait, no\u2014looking closer, I see 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. So for example, NT44 -> NT8 NT38 is a production without terminals, but NT14 -> 't79' is a production with a terminal. Similarly, NT29 -> NT49 NT14 also includes a terminal.\n\nWait no, actually in CNF, all productions have exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. But here, some productions go beyond that. For example, looking at the grammar, I see a production like NT46 -> NT20 NT8, where 8 is a number, but in this context, I think the numbers are part of the terminals, so each 't' followed by a number is a separate terminal symbol. But wait, in the string provided, all tokens start with 't' followed by a number, like 't16', 't11', etc. So perhaps 't' followed by a digit is a terminal, and the digits themselves are not part of the grammar's terminals but rather part of the string's tokens.\n\nSo in the grammar, any production that outputs a non-terminal symbol would generate more non-terminals, while a production that outputs a terminal symbol would generate the corresponding 'tX' token. \n\nBut wait, the grammar has production rules like S -> NT1 NT28, which are non-terminals, so the start symbol S generates non-terminals, and each non-terminal is broken down until it reaches terminals, which are 'tX' symbols.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of these 'tX' symbols. The question is whether the string can be generated by the grammar, i.e., the string corresponds to a derivation starting from S and expanding all non-terminals into terminals, resulting in this sequence.\n\nGiven the complexity of the grammar, directly trying to derive the string step by step would be very time-consuming. Instead, I might consider using the concept of parsing or the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is given and the string is long, perhaps a better approach is to consider the structure of the grammar and check if the string is composed of the right symbols and can be generated through the productions.\n\nAnother thought: since the string is made up entirely of terminals (all start with 't' and ends with numbers), each step in the derivation must replace non-terminals with either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production applied must either expand into two non-terminals or into a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it has 30 tokens. Each expansion reduces the number of symbols by 1 each time a terminal is added. For example, starting with S (1 symbol), each production application that replaces a non-terminal would either keep the count same (if replacing one non-terminal with two non-terminals) or increase it (if replacing one with two, increasing by 1 each time). However, when you replace a non-terminal with a terminal, the count decreases by 1.\n\nSo the problem is about checking whether this string can be built by a series of such replacements. But with 30 tokens, that suggests a derivation that started from S and went through 30 steps, each time either increasing or decreasing the count. The challenge is to see if it can fit.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see the structure of the string. Each 'tX' token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. But I don't see any production rules that produce a 'tX' except those that have terminals on the right-hand side. For example, NT44 -> NT8 NT38 is a rule without terminals, but NT14 -> 't79' is a rule that produces a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the grammar, most non-terminals do not produce terminals, except for specific cases. So, in this case, the only way to get a 'tX' token in the string is through rules that have a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't16'. Looking at the grammar, is there a production for any non-terminal that can produce 't16'? Let's check the rules. For example, looking for any rule ending with 't16'. \n\nWait, in the grammar, the only production with 't16' is NT10 -> 't50' is another production, but nothing obvious. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT21 -> 't3', NT29 -> 't48', etc. Hmm, I don't immediately see a 't16' as a terminal in any production.\n\nWait, looking through the production rules, I see that NT10 -> 't2' is a production. Also, NT17 -> 't94', NT46 -> 't8', and so on. So, each terminal symbol is defined by a production rule that directly gives it.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, each 'tX' token must correspond to a production where that symbol is generated. Therefore, starting from S, which is NT1 NT28, to derive 't16', we must find a way where one of the non-terminals in the derivation path eventually produces 't16'.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, I notice that NT21 -> 't3' and NT48 -> 't120', etc. But none of the rules produce 't16' directly. So, perhaps 't16' is not present in the grammar at all. That would mean that the string cannot be generated because 't16' is not a terminal that any production can produce.\n\nWait, but in the initial production rules, S is NT1 NT28. NT1 is defined as NT1 -> NT25 NT17. Let's see if any of these can lead to 't16'.\n\nLooking at NT1's production, it goes to NT25 NT17. Then, NT25 -> NT6 NT31, and NT17 -> 't94'. So, from NT1, we have NT25 NT17 \u2192 NT6 NT31 and 't94'. Then, NT6 is a non-terminal, so it can produce 't58', as per NT6 -> 't58'. So, expanding NT1 NT28:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT28 \u2192 (NT25 NT17) (NT28)\n\nNow, NT28 is in the rule: NT28 -> NT4 NT6 or NT28 -> NT8 NT8. Let's see the options.\n\nIf we take NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't91'; NT6 \u2192 't58'.\n\nSo NT28 \u2192 't91' 't58'.\n\nAlternatively, NT28 \u2192 NT8 NT8:\n\nNT8 is a non-terminal, which has a production NT8 \u2192 't102', so NT28 \u2192 't102' 't102'.\n\nBut in the string, the first 't16' occurs, so perhaps we need a path somewhere where 't16' is generated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me list all the production rules that have terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are the terminal productions (each line starting with NTx -> followed by something with 't'):\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT4 \u2192 't91'\n- NT21 \u2192 't3'\n- NT7 \u2192 't93', 't97', 't94'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124', 't17'\n- NT24 \u2192 't62', 't29'\n- NT22 \u2192 't58', 't40'\n- NT10 \u2192 't2'\n- NT48 \u2192 't119', 't50'\n- NT15 \u2192 't48', 't56' (wait, no, 't56' is another production)\n- NT29 \u2192 't53', etc.\n\nWait, but in the rules, NT7 has multiple 't' productions,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar seems to fit this form because all rules are either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. \n\nNext, my goal is to see if the string can be generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of symbols ending with `t119`, which indicates it's a terminal string since all symbols are terminals except if they were non-terminals. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production generates a string of terminals. The process will involve breaking down the string into parts that correspond to the possible productions. \n\nI'll start by looking for the longest possible start. But another approach is to walk through the string step by step, trying to match it with the production rules. Alternatively, I can consider the reverse direction, trying to reduce the string to the start symbol S by applying the inverse of the productions.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals and terminals. The non-terminals in the grammar are S, NT1, NT2, NT3, etc., up to NT56 and others. The actual symbols in the string are things like 't41', 't79', up to 't119'. So all the symbols in the string are terminals except for those that might have been non-terminals in the grammar. Wait, actually, in the grammar, all the NT symbols are non-terminals, and each production replaces them with other symbols. The string provided has only 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. So in the string, there are no non-terminals\u2014only terminals. \n\nIn CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the steps to derive the string would involve using leftmost derivations where each step replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut wait, the string is all terminals. So how can the grammar generate a string of terminals? Because in CNF, the left-hand side is a non-terminal, and each production is applied until all symbols are terminals.\n\nBut in this case, the string is a terminal string. So we need to see if it can be derived starting from S.\n\nLet me try to approach this by trying to parse the string from the start. Since the grammar is in CNF, the start symbol S can only be derived into two non-terminals. From the first production of the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT28\n\nSo the string should start with NT1 and NT28 being expanded into some sequences of terminals. Let's see the string: the first symbol is 't41'. So 't41' must be the terminal symbol derived from NT1 or NT28.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT1 and NT28, I'll check which can derive to 't41'. \n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT1 \u2192 NT47 NT28\n- NT1 \u2192 NT31 NT3\n- NT1 \u2192 NT13 NT9\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT15\n- NT1 \u2192 NT46 NT24\n- NT1 \u2192 NT21 NT15\n- NT1 \u2192 NT47 NT14\n- NT1 \u2192 NT39 NT24\n- ... and so on.\n\nNone of these directly produce 't41'. Hmm. Let's look through all the NT rules to see which can produce 't41'.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, for example, NT54 \u2192 't53' and 't6', but 't53' is a terminal and 't6' is another. The production NT54 \u2192 't53' 't6' would produce 't53 t6'. But I don't see a rule that directly produces 't41'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the NT rules more carefully. Let's list all NTs and see if any have 't41' as a directly produced terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT1: all rules are B1...B2\n\nNT2: B1...B2\n\nNT3: NT6 NT3\n\nNT4: NT21 NT15\n\nNT5: Not shown in the provided grammar; wait, in the given list of NTs, I don't see a list for all, but to make it manageable, I'll check which NT rules produce 't41'.\n\nLooking at the given grammar rules, I see a rule: NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT10, and another NT41 \u2192 NT56 NT49.\n\nBut none of these produce 't41' directly. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, in the grammar, each NT's rules are of two non-terminals. So for example, NT53 has:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT53 NT47 (this seems redundant, perhaps a mistake, but in any case, it's two non-terminals on the right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at this incorrectly. The terminal strings in the provided grammar seem to be cases where the production right-hand side includes a terminal. Like NT41 \u2192 NT40 NT36: wait no, let me recheck.\n\nWait, according to the provided grammar, for NT4 it's: NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some rules where the right-hand side includes a terminal. Wait, perhaps in the grammar, I should check the rules. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking again, the grammar has some lines that have a 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\nNT36 -> NT56 NT10\n\nNT6 -> NT54 NT6\n\nNT45 -> NT40 NT36\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided rules, the right-hand sides are all combinations of NTs except for some that end with a 't'. For example:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't28' which is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in fact looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't40' as a terminal followed by another terminal? Wait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait no, the grammar provided has a number of rules where the right-hand side is a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal, or non-terminals only. For example, looking for any occurrence where a production has a terminal on the right-hand side. \n\nWait, let me scan through the provided grammar rules:\n\nYes, for example, the line NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45. Then there's a rule for NT45: NT45 \u2192 't8' 't93' \u2192 't8 t93'. Similarly, NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3 and other combinations, but wait, some rules end with 't' followed by another 't' or 't's, which are terminals. \n\nWait, looking at the end part of the grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 't50', which is a terminal. So the production NT0 is a terminal. Similarly, NT46 \u2192 't8' is a terminal, and NT7 \u2192 't79' is a terminal.\n\nWait, so some of the production rules in the grammar produce one or two terminals, not just non-terminals. Wait, but in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a single terminal. So in this grammar, the right-hand side is two symbols which can be non-terminals or terminals. So the problem arises when a production has a terminal followed by another terminal, which would create a two-symbol production, which is allowed.\n\nWait, for example, the production NT6 \u2192 't54' 't6' would produce 't54 t6'.\n\nSo in that case, the parse involves breaking the string into parts that can be generated by applying these rules. Let's first note that the string given starts with 't41', which must be the first symbol derived from either NT1 or NT28, as per S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nSo 't41' must be generated by NT1 or NT28. Let's check whether any of the NT1's productions produce 't41' in one step.

{"custom_id":"request-745","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t29 t97 t100 t63 t34 t128 t128 t84 t98 t52 t66 t128 t73 t100 t102 t24 t131 t122 t29 t114 t112 t14 t108 t79 t4 t17 t112 t4 t2 t16 t97 t38 t52 t117 t105 t119 t38 t126 t19 t97 t21 t76 t80` and the grammar has a bunch of productions that define how symbols can be combined to form strings.\n\nFirst, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This simplifies the analysis a bit because in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string provided starts with `t29`, `t97`, etc. So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the provided productions.\n\nLet me try to map out the steps.\n\nStarting with S, in the grammar, S can produce either NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t29`. Let me check which productions produce `t29`.\n\nLooking through the provided productions, I see that:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't105'\n- NT46 \u2192 't29'\n- NT39 \u2192 't48'\n- NT41 \u2192 't52'\n- NT18 (Wait, the user hasn't provided that, so maybe it's not)\nWait, but in the user's grammar data, under the NTs, I see NT46 \u2192 't29'. So yes, NT46 can produce 't29'.\n\nWait, the NT transitions look complicated, but perhaps I can find a path from S to the given string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be broken down into parts that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right using the grammar's productions.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' probably corresponds to a terminal symbol, and the numbers are non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nGiven that, the entire string is a single sentential form, so it must be derived directly from S.\n\nSo, looking at the start symbol S, and the given string, the first step would be to see if S can produce the first few symbols.\n\nLooking at the first token `t29`. From the grammar, NT46 \u2192 't29', as per the data: `NT46 \u2192 't29'`. So, perhaps the first symbol is part of NT46.\n\nWait, no. S goes to NT1 NT1, NT50 NT27. So, S's immediate expansions are NT1 and NT1, or NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t29`. Let's see which starting point would allow that.\n\nIf the expansion starts with S \u2192 NT50 NT27, then the left-hand side is NT50 and the right-hand side is NT27.\n\nLooking into NT50 productions, I see that NT50 \u2192 't4' and NT50 \u2192 't58' (but wait, that's a typo; looking again, NT50 \u2192 't4' (from the data: NT15\u2192t48, but perhaps I miscounted).\n\nWait, no: looking in the data, under NT50, I see `NT50 -> 't4'` and `NT50 -> 't65'`. So NT50 can produce t4 or t65. T4 isn't the first symbol, which is t29, so maybe that's not the starting expansion.\n\nAlternatively, if the first two non-terminals are NT1 and NT1, then each would produce some strings. Do we have any NT1 productions? Looking at the data, I see NT1 has `NT1 \u2192 't84'`, among others. Wait, but let me confirm.\n\nLooking at the grammar data:\n\n- NT1: 't84' is one option, but let's check all NT1 productions. The data shows for NT1:\n\n   NT1 \u2192 't25', NT1 \u2192 't47', NT1 \u2192 't28', etc. Wait, let me get more precise.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nWait, under NT1, I see `NT1 \u2192 't69'`, `NT1 \u2192 't131'`, etc. So that's not matching the first symbol `t29`.\n\nSo the first NT1 doesn't produce `t29`. So if the first part of S is NT1 NT1, the first symbol could not be `t29`. So perhaps the starting expansion is S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nWait, no\u2014if the first symbol is `t29`, that would require that the first NT50 or NT27 can produce that symbol. But NT50 can only produce 't4' and 't65'. NT27 can produce 't100' or 't24', according to the data.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't124' and `NT27 \u2192 't17'`. Wait, no\u2014looking back, the data for NT27 is:\n\nWait, the data shows:\n\n\"ND27 \u2192 't100' : Wait, no.

Let me go through the list.\n\nLooking at each NT:\n\nLooking for NT27:\n\n- Line 18: NT14 \u2192 NT24 NT0\n- Line 19: NT27 \u2192 NT38 NT33\n- Line 22: NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\n- Line 23: NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nSo, yes, in the data, NT27 \u2192 NT38 NT33 and NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4.\n\nWait, but that's not producing 't29'. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT50 NT27, where NT50 is 't4' and NT27 is 't24'. But in the string, the first token is t29. Hmm, this doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I got something wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two elements are more complicated. Perhaps the string is a concatenation of two sequences, each derived from NT50 and NT27 respectively.\n\nWait, in the initial S expansion, S can produce NT50 NT27, where NT50 is a node and NT27 is another. So each of these would then expand into sequences of terminals and symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first t29 comes from expanding a deeper node.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe it's better to approach this by breaking down the string into segments that can be generated by specific production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map the structure of the string to see if it can be generated through the productions.\n\nWait, but another approach is to count the number of tokens in the string and see if they match S's expansion, which is S \u2192 NT1 NT1 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, there are 30 tokens. Hmm, but that might not help immediately.\n\nWait, let me check how the productions could generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the grammar is a tree, so each 't' must correspond to a path through the productions.\n\nLooking at the first part: `t29 t97 ...`.

So, the grammar here is structured that way, all the non-terminals produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI think the first step is to parse the string using the grammar's productions. Since the string is a series of terminals (the parts between the 't' commands), I need to see if the grammar can derive this sequence starting from S.\n\nI recall that in a CNF grammar, the number of symbols in the sequence (excluding the start symbol S) equals twice the height of the parse tree minus one. Let me check the length of the string. The string has 38 tokens (since each 't' is followed by a number and they're all separate, so the string is split into 38 parts). So, 38 = 2h - 1 \u2192 h = (38 + 1)\/2 = 19.5. Wait, that can't be. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the string: 't84 t4 t37 t28 t82 t16 t120 t135 t124 t19 t38 t124 t48 t87 t21 t114 t89 t50 t63 t70 t38 t63 t63 t111 t36 t97 t58 t134 t114 t116 t40 t105 t59 t94 t21 t14 t63 t5 t40 t79 t28 t128 t122'\n\nWait, actually, the string is a single token sequence of 38 terminal symbols. So, n = 38. In a derivation starting from S, which is a non-terminal, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we reach terminals. The number of symbols (terminals) in the string is equal to the number of terminal symbols, which is 38.\n\nIn a CNF, the maximum length of a string derived from a non-terminal A is 2^h, where h is the height of the tree. But since we start with S, the total number of terminals would be 2^h - 1, because S is the root and contributes to the height.\n\nWait, let me think again. If h is the height, then the number of terminals is 2^h - 1. So, 2^h - 1 = 38 \u2192 2^h = 39. Taking log2(39) \u2248 5.28, which isn't an integer. That suggests that the height h is around 5, but 2^5 -1 =31, which is less than 38. 2^6 -1 =63, which is way more than 38. So 38 is not achievable with a CNF grammar, meaning that the string cannot be derived from S.\n\nWait, is that correct? Or am I making a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nIn a CFG in CNF, the number of non-terminals decreases until you reach terminals. At each step, each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, leading to a binary tree structure. The total number of terminal symbols is 2^h -1, where h is the height. Since 38 isn't one less than a power of two, it's not possible to derive a string of length 38.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol S can produce a string with a certain number of terminals, so if 38 is not in the form 2^h -1, then it's impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, could there be another way? Maybe through different production rules that include some terminals earlier on. But in CNF, all productions are A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So if you have a production that has a mix like A\u2192aBC, it's not CNF. Therefore, all terminals must appear only at the leaves, and the height h gives the number of steps from S to the terminals.\n\nGiven that, the number of terminals must be 2^h -1, which 38 is not, I think.\n\nWait, let me think of it step by step.\n\nLet's say at each step, the number of symbols (terminals and non-terminals) grows exponentially. Starting with S, which is a non-terminal. S can produce two non-terminals, say A and B. Then A can produce two non-terminals, etc. Each time you have a non-terminal, it can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the number of symbols at each level doubles, but if a non-terminal produces a terminal, that branch ends.\n\nBut in the case where all productions are non-terminals expanding into non-terminals, the total number of terminals is 2^h -1. So if h=5, 31 terminals. h=6, 63 terminals. Since the string has 38, which is between 31 and 63, it's not possible because 38 can't be expressed as 2^h -1.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's a bit extensive with many productions. But when I glance through the right-hand sides, I spot some terminals like 't41', 't84', etc. That tells me that the language generated by this grammar includes these terminal strings as part of the derived strings.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t41 t84 t24 t109 t108 t31 t131 t36 t105 t62 t52 t31 t14 t4 t131 t16 t112 t38 t111 t91 t80 t21 t62 t40 t63 t19 t19 t134 t37 t14 t135 t66 t124 t82 t15 t111 t134 t81 t28 t91 t8 t63 t4 t3`. \n\nWait, at the beginning, there's 't41 t84 t24...'. I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, let's think about how the string is built.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't41'. Looking at the grammar, I see that 't41' appears in some productions. Let me check the rhs of S and other non-terminals to see where 't41' can come from.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that NT41 has two different rhs: NT41 \u2192 NT56 NT49 and NT41 \u2192 NT6 NT46. Wait, no, looking back, I think I might have misread. Let me check again:\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, I don't see 't41' directly in NT41. Wait, the user wrote a long list, but perhaps I should parse it step by step.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I notice several lines:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT45 \u2192 't8' (wait, that's NT45 \u2192 't8'? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't28' (Wait, no, sorry, looking for 't41').\n\nWait, scanning through, I see NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT10 (line 16), and then NT19 \u2192 't78' (line 14), and NT10 \u2192 't50' (line 23). Hmmm, so perhaps NT41 can produce sequences involving those.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it starts with 't41', so 't41' must be a terminal that's a result of some NT production. Let's see if any non-terminals directly produce 't41'.\n\nLooking at the rhs of all productions, I don't immediately see 't41' as a result of any single production. So perhaps 't41' can be part of a longer chain production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the initial string could be the result of multiple symbol productions, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S. Each production for S is either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. Both these productions produce two non-terminals, each of which would then have to be expanded into terminal strings.\n\nThe first production S \u2192 NT1 NT28 would produce strings where the concatenation of NT1 and NT28's derived strings equals the given string.\n\nLet me check if the string can be split into two parts that match NT1 and NT28 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't41', which suggests that the first part might start with NT1 \u2192 t41 followed by some other terminal. Let me check where 't41' appears in the grammar.\n\nI see that NT41 has two productions: \n\nNT41 \u2192 NT6 NT46 (line 15)\nNT41 \u2192 NT47 NT4 (line 21)\n\nWait, but looking at the lines the user provided, let me check. For example, in the given grammar:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT1 NT28\nLine 2: S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nLooking through all the productions, I need to find any NT that produces 't41' directly.\n\nWait, in the given list, I see in line 16: NT41 \u2192 't19' 't10' (line 51, maybe?) Wait, no, let's parse each line carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed that.

Looking at the grammar, terminal 't4' appears in several places. For example, NT17 \u2192 t94, which isn't t4. Wait, NT38 \u2192 t102, NT47 \u2192 t3, NT28 \u2192 t76, etc. But I don't see 't4' directly. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, NT14 has a production NT14 \u2192 t79, which is not 't4'. NT8 is 't102', so not helpful. Hmm, looking through the grammar, 't4' isn't a direct terminal. Wait, maybe it's through a production. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the only production that ends with 't4' is NT17 \u2192 t94. Wait, no. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me check all the productions ending with a terminal:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t6 t3 \u2192 t42\nNT17 \u2192 t7 t94\nWait, none of these result in 't4'. Hmm, that's a problem. But wait, let's look at the production NT28 \u2192 t76, which is 't76' as per the grammar. In our string, 't4' appears at the start.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. Oh, in the grammar, some rules have terminals in a way that's not directly obvious. For example, NT6 \u2192 t54 t6, so that's 't54' followed by 't54' again each time, because NT6's production is recursive. But 't4' isn't appearing in any of the terminals except perhaps in more complex cases.\n\nWait, maybe 't4' is produced by a different NT. Let me check all the rules again quickly:\n\nLooking through, I see NT30 \u2192 t62, NT46 \u2192 t112, NT7 \u2192 t93, t97, t94, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe 't4' is a result of a chain of productions where the intermediate steps result in 't4' somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar rules. Let me try to list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, 't4' is present in:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t94\n- NT17 \u2192 t94\n- NT33 \u2192 t79\n- NT42 \u2192 t2\n- NT44 \u2192 t114\n- NT45 \u2192 t73\n- NT46 \u2192 t112, etc.\n\nWait, I'm not finding 't4' as a terminal. But in the string, 't4' appears at the start. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps 't4' is a part of a larger production.\n\nLet's think differently. Let me try to parse the string step by step, building from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string starts with t4, but looking at the grammar, S can produce NT1 and NT1, or NT50 and NT27.\n\nIn the first production, S \u2192 NT1 NT1. Looking at NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17 or NT47 \u2192 t3\n\nWait, so NT1 can produce a sequence that starts with NT25 and NT17. NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nLooking at NT6 \u2192 t54 NT6. So this would produce infinitely, but perhaps in the string, after t4, it's part of a larger sequence. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by multiple applications of the grammar rules. Let me try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt4 t120 t59 t109 t98 t69 t82 t80 t124 t58 t66 t123 t91 t126 t4 t82 t70 t107 t97 t24 t98 t107 t119 t17 t4 t1 t93 t76 t11 t1 t1 t120 t45 t119 t102 t19 t36 t122 t53 t59 t84 t114 t63 t94\n\nWait, 't4' appears multiple times. Let me look for parts where 't4' occurs.\n\nFirst 't4' is the first symbol. Let's see if this can be part of a production. Looking at NT1:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17 or NT47 \u2192 t3.\n\nBut 't4' isn't produced by NT1. Looking at other NTs, perhaps NT45:\n\nNT45 \u2192 t73.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't4' is part of a larger sequence. For example, maybe some NTS produce t4 t something else.\n\nWait, looking at the production NT36 \u2192 t87 AND the rest, but I can't see a way to get 't4' here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't4' is part of a production that's nested deeper. For example, NT45 \u2192 t73, but maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, let's consider that perhaps the string was generated, and in the parsing, each NT step is correctly followed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't4', the next few symbols are t120, t59, t109, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps 't4 t120' is part of some production. Let's see if any NT produces 't4 t120'.\n\nLooking in the grammar, let's see:\n\nLooking for a production where combining two NTs gives us 't4' followed by something.\n\nFor example, NT3 \u2192 NT6 t3, but t3 is further split into t6 and t3, which could go on infinitely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't4' is followed by t120. Let's see where t120 comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's find all NTs that produce t120.\n\nLooking through the grammar, t120 appears in NT36 \u2192 t87 (no, that's t87). Wait, checking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT36 \u2192 t87, not t120. Similarly, NT24 \u2192 t122 (no), NT8 \u2192 t102, etc. Hmm, I'm not seeing a production that gives t120.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me check all the NTs that produce t120.\n\nLooking through all the production rules in the grammar:\n\nI don't see any production that ends with t120. All terminals are things like t9, t10, t17, t24, t26, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, in the NT15 node, there's NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up NTs and symbols. Let me check each terminal in the string.\n\nThe string has t4, t120, t59, t109, t98, etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only NTs that produce terminals are as follows:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't91'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't102'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't107'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-758","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that might make parsing easier, although I don't know if that's necessary here.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string we're supposed to evaluate: `t48 t105 t52 t80 t78 t45 t52 t59 t29 t109 t100 t36 t134 t45 t89 t36 t76 t100 t4 t69 t17 t27 t5 t41 t31 t8 t78 t78 t21 t66 t37 t19 t126 t120 t11 t45 t70 t31 t81 t45 t45 t36 t123 t131`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of multiple tokens, each labeled with a number and a 't' prefix. I also see that the grammar includes rules that produce these tokens. For example, some rules directly produce 't' followed by a number, like `NT46 -> 't8'`, `NT17 -> 't94'`, etc.\n\nThe task is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce `NT1 NT28` or `NT50 NT27`. So, the string must start with the symbols derived from NT1 and NT28, or NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t48`. I need to see if `t48` can be derived from either NT1 or NT28, or NT50 or NT27.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that NT46 -> 't8', but `t48` isn't directly. Wait, I'm looking again. Let me list all rules that produce 't' tokens:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT46 \u2192 't8' (and others, but perhaps more relevant for 't48' need to check)\n- NT21 \u2192 't3' \u2192 but that's not helpful.\nWait, perhaps 't48' isn't directly a terminal. Hmm, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces 't48' directly. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the rules include things like NT48 \u2192 't24', so 't48' is a terminal only if it's listed as a production. Looking through the rules, I don't see a production that directly gives 't48'. Hmm, that's a problem because if the first token is 't48' and no rule produces that, then the grammar can't generate this string. But I should double-check the grammar to ensure I didn't miss it.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't16', NT23 \u2192 nothing, NT26 \u2192 't50', NT27 \u2192 't124', NT29 \u2192 't116', NT35 \u2192 't7', etc. Wait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through each rule and see if any of them produce 't48' or 't76' etc.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT46 \u2192 't8'\n- NT6 \u2192 't54'\n- NT21 \u2192 't3'\n- NT35 \u2192 't17'\n- NT7 \u2192 't93', 't97', etc.\n- NT46 \u2192 't8' and 't27' as well.\nWait, I'm not seeing 't48' being produced directly. Hmm. So that would mean that the first token 't48' isn't present in any of the productions. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Maybe 't48' is part of a larger production. For example, in the rules for non-terminals, does any rule have 't48' as part of its derivation?\n\nLooking at the production rules, for example:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't87', but that's not helpful.\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that can derive 't48', I see:\n\nLooking for any NT where the production includes 't48' in its right-hand side.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't54'\n- NT21 \u2192 't3'\n- NT35 \u2192 't87'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT44 \u2192 't89'\n- NT26 \u2192 't50' and 't48'\nAh! Wait, in the rule for NT26: `NT26 -> NT14 NT45`. Then, looking at if NT14 or NT45 can produce a 't48'? Wait, NT14's rule is `NT14 -> NT24 NT0`, and NT24 is `NT24 -> NT40 NT17`. This might not help.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT45: `NT45 -> 't73'`. So, no direct 't48' but maybe through derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The string starts with 't48', which, if it's a terminal, must be produced directly by a rule.

{"custom_id":"request-759","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a context-free grammar (CFG) is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either a single terminal, a single non-terminal, or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the grammar provides several productions starting from S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is long, but let's look at its components: it's a sequence of tokens like 't38' and numbers. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string should be composed of terminals, and possibly non-terminals at higher levels.\n\nI realize that using a top-down approach (like the CYK algorithm) would be efficient here. The CYK algorithm parses strings into the grammar by checking if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, the CYK table could be massive. However, since the string is provided, I can attempt to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me list the steps I took:\n\n1. **Identify the start symbol and string length**: The startsymbol is S, and the string has 33 tokens.\n\n2. **Initialize the CYK table**: I create a table where rows represent the symbols (from 0 to 32) and columns represent the non-terminals. Initially, all entries are empty.\n\n3. **Fill the table for single symbols **: For each position 'i' in the string, I check the grammar to see which non-terminals directly produce that symbol.\n\nFor example, symbols like 't93' are directly produced by some non-terminals. So, I mark the corresponding cell in the table with those non-terminals.\n\n4. **Fill the table for longer sequences **: Once the single symbols are filled, I move on to filling the table for sequences of two symbols, then three, etc., using the productions.\n\nThis involves checking if any non-terminal A can produce the current sequence, given that it can be broken down into two non-terminals B and C, which themselves produce parts of the sequence.\n\n5. **Check if the start symbol S can produce the entire string**: The final step is to check if S (start symbol) can produce the entire string, which is indicated by the cell (0, 32) in the CYK table containing S.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complex, and without actually drawing the table, it's challenging. Maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each token can be derived from some production. Given that the string is quite long, perhaps it's more efficient to check for each token whether it can be the left-hand side (LHS) of some production and whether the right-hand side can generate the corresponding parts.\n\nFor instance, the first token is 't38'. I look through the grammar to find if any production rule has 't38' as its terminal. If I can't find it directly, I check if the non-terminal on the left can produce a sequence that includes 't38' when considering its productions.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see some rules that produce terminals. For example, one of the rules is 't74: NT46 -> 't41'', etc. But looking through the tokens, I don't see all the required terminals, so I might be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains some ambiguous parts where a single symbol can be derived in multiple ways, requiring careful tracking of possibilities.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use a different strategy, like trying to find the derivation step by step.\n\nStarting with the string: `t38 t31 t84 t21 t134 t62 t98 t134 t63 t42 t89 t108 t8 t1 t40 t40 t63 t42 t19 t105 t69 t124 t79 t45 t19 t128 t40 t3 t15 t79 t15 t17 t120 t80 t78 t58 t91 t4 t14 t11 t3 t76 t97 t27 t123` \n\nI notice that the string starts with 't38'. I need to find a production rule that produces this symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a rule where a non-terminal directly expands to 't38'. So, perhaps 't38' must be derived from a non-terminal that has a production containing it and the other required symbols.\n\nLet me check the grammar rules. I see that some NTs expand to combinations of symbols that include 't's.\n\nFor example, NT38 might produce something like 't38' somehow, but the provided grammar doesn't have a simple NT -> 't38' rule.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see rules like:\n\n- NT44 -> 't114'\n- NT28 -> 't76'\n- NT7 -> 't93'\n- NT7 -> 't97'\n- NT22 -> 't58'\n- NT27 -> 't124'\n- NT47 -> 't41'\n- And so on.\n\nI don't see any NT directly producing 't38'. So, perhaps 't38' is part of a larger expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built from multiple substitutions, but I don't see symbols breaking down step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is entirely built from non-terminals that can produce 't's, but I'm not catching any straightforward path.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to consider that each symbol must be either a terminal or derived from a non-terminal that can produce that symbol and others in the sequence.\n\nGiven how complex the grammar is, and the length of the string, it's plausible that the string cannot be derived because either some symbols are missing, or the production chains can't form.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, many of the 't's are produced, but I can't see a 't38' directly. So, perhaps the string includes at least one 't38' that's not directly produced.\n\nAlternatively, if the production rules for non-terminals include 't38' in their expansions, but looking through, I don't see any.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that this string is not generated by the given grammar because of the presence of 't38' which isn't directly produced by any production in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-772","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar, which is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: \n\n`t79 t105 t78 t82 t116 t16 t65 t59 t116 t128 t69 t38 t37 t14 t14 t16 t116 t3 t116 t27 t19 t14 t24 t8 t114 t69 t83 t11 t19 t38 t122 t134 t52 t58 t40 t40 t100 t128 t66 t63 t53 t27 t16 t131 t122 t120`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a CNF grammar is structured so that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, and the start symbol S only appears on the left. Also, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, and the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions are all in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT28, which fits A \u2192 BC since NT1 and NT28 are non-terminals. Similarly, each rule is between two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nEach production ends with NT or a terminal. The NT rules are all pairs of non-terminals leading into a terminal, which suggests that the grammar is a straight-line grammar, possibly a right or left recursive one.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have a lot of rules that produce terminals. For instance, `NT46 \u2192 't8'`, `NT35 \u2192 't105'`, `NT7 \u2192 't93'`, etc. Each terminal in the string would correspond to a production that directly emits that terminal.\n\nSo, I can think of the string as a sequence of these terminal symbols, and I need to check if the grammar can derive this sequence starting from S.\n\nTo do this, I can model the derivation as a sequence of replacements, each time moving from one non-terminal to another, until all symbols are terminals. Alternatively, I can reconstruct the parse trees step by step, ensuring that each step only produces the correct symbols.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to check the start symbol S and see if it can produce a sequence that includes all the elements in order. Since S is a non-terminal and only appears in the left-hand sides of productions, I need to see which path from S can generate all the tokens.\n\nBut S is the start symbol, which is initially the only symbol. So I need to see how S can derive the string through a series of productions. Each internal node (non-terminal) in the parse tree would represent a production, and the leaves would be the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be represented as a concatenation of symbols derived from the grammar. Let's consider each token in the string and see which rule produces it.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n\n`t79 t105 t78 t82 t116 t16 t65 t59 t116 t128 t69 t38 t37 t14 t14 t16 t116 t3 t116 t27 t19 t14 t24 t8 t114 t69 t83 t11 t19 t38 t122 t134 t52 t58 t40 t40 t100 t128 t66 t63 t53 t27 t16 t131 t122 t120`\n\nLet's map these to the corresponding productions:\n\n- `t79` comes from `NT35 \u2192 't79'`\n- `t105` comes from `NT35 \u2192 't105'`\n- `t78` comes from `NT46 \u2192 't78'`\n- `t82` comes from `NT42 \u2192 't82'`\n- `t116` comes from `NT17 \u2192 't116'`\n- `t16` comes from `NT14 \u2192 't16'\n- `t65` comes from `NT10 \u2192 't65'\n- `t59` comes from `NT19 \u2192 't59'\n- `t116` (again) from `NT17 \u2192 't116'\n- `t128` comes from `NT43 \u2192 't128'\n- `t69` comes from `NT47 \u2192 't69'\n- `t38` comes from `NT9 \u2192 't38'\n- `t37` comes from `NT28 \u2192 't37'\n- `t14` comes from `NT26 \u2192 't14' and also from NT14, but NT26 is involved here\n- `t14` again from NT26\n- `t16` from NT14\n- `t116` from NT17\n- `t3` comes from NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- `t116` from NT17\n- `t27` comes from NT50 \u2192 't27'\n- `t19` from NT21 \u2192 't19' (Wait, looking at the grammar, is there a rule for NT21 \u2192 t19?

Scanning through, it seems none of the rules directly produce 't19' except perhaps in the terminals, but I don't see 't19' as a direct terminal. Wait, maybe I misread earlier.

Oh, that clarifies things. So 't19' comes from NT9.\n\nSimilarly, 't19' in the string is followed by 't14', which would be NT31, perhaps.\n\nWait, this is crucial.

{"custom_id":"request-773","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems all productions follow this structure. For example, S -> NT1 NT15 is a typical CNF production.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is: `t28 t89 t122 t3 t52 t37 t2 t16 t34 t76 t45 t119 t80 t37 t63 t116 t4 t14 t107 t89 t70 t48 t52 t34 t79 t126 t107 t42 t98 t91 t112 t70 t89 t27 t24 t82 t84 t128 t31 t16 t37 t116 t31 t29 t91 t59`.\n\nEach token here is 't' followed by a number, which must correspond to some production rule ending with that string. My task is to trace the derivations from the start symbols to see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nStarting with the top-level non-terminal S. According to the grammar, S production is S -> NT1 NT15 or S -> NT50 NT27. So the string must start with one of these two.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't28'. Let's see which production ends with 't28'. Scanning the grammar, I see NT28 -> NT4 NT6, but wait, actually, looking again, NT28 is in the production S -> NT50 NT27. Hmm, wait, maybe I need to find where 't28' appears.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see NT28 -> NT4 NT8, right? Wait, let me check the provided grammar. Yes, line: NT28 -> NT4 NT6. Wait, wait, no, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the production for NT28: NT28 -> NT4 NT6. So the string starts with 't28', which comes from NT28. So NT28 must be part of the derivation.\n\nBut wait, wait, in the grammar, NT28 is defined as NT4 NT6. So 't28' is derived from NT28.\n\nSo S must derive to a production that includes NT28. Looking at the start productions S: either NT1 NT15 or NT50 NT27. Neither of these directly produce t28. Wait, but NT28 is part of the right-hand side of S? Wait, no, the start productions are S -> NT1 NT15 or S-> NT50 NT27. So the first step is to have S produce something that can generate t28.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me approach this differently. The string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to find a derivation path where the entire string is produced starting from S and using the productions.\n\nEach production in the grammar is a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals until we get to terminals. So we need to build the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can reverse the process and see if the string can be reduced according to the grammar's productions.\n\nBut this might be complicated because the grammar has many non-terminals. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by seeing if I can split it into parts that match the productions.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nt28 t89 t122 t3 t52 t37 t2 t16 t34 t76 t45 t119 t80 t37 t63 t116 t4 t14 t107 t89 t70 t48 t52 t34 t79 t126 t107 t42 t98 t91 t112 t70 t89 t27 t24 t82 t84 t128 t31 t16 t37 t116 t31 t29 t91 t59.\n\nThe first token is t28. Looking at the production rules, I see that NT28 -> NT4 NT6. So if we can generate t28 from NT28, then the rest should follow.\n\nWait, but in the start productions, S starts with S -> NT50 NT27 or S-> NT1 NT15. These don't directly give t28, so perhaps S must first produce something that eventually includes t28.\n\nWait, maybe the first production S is S-> NT50 NT27. Let's assume that. So S would first split into NT50 and NT27. Now, looking at the grammar, NT50 -> NT14 NT15, right? Because looking at the productions, line: NT50 -> NT14 NT15. So NT50 becomes NT14 and NT15.\n\nSimilarly, NT27: from the grammar, line: NT27 -> NT39 NT16. So now the string starts as t28... Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be built by expanding the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the entire string as a concatenation of the right-hand sides of the productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a binary split, so the string can be built by repeatedly splitting into two parts.\n\nBut with the given string, let's try to split it into parts that correspond to productions.\n\nWait, another approach is to check if each 't' corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. In the grammar, some NTs have productions that produce a single terminal. For example, NT7 has NT7 -> t7, but in the provided grammar, it's actually NT7 -> NT24 NT6 and others. Wait, no, looking closely, the grammar has lines like NT7 -> t7 or NT17 -> t94, etc. Wait, some lines are conflicting.\n\nWait, no, wait, in the provided grammar, some lines have 't' followed by a number, like NT27 -> t24 (wait, in the grammar, line: NT27 -> NT24 NT14. Wait, that's a production, not a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the right-hand side of the productions are sometimes terminal strings. For example, line: NT26 -> NT14 NT45. Or NT36 -> t87? Wait no, looking more carefully, the lines that have 't' are like:\n\nFor example, NT7 -> t93, or NT46 -> 't87' and so on.\n\nWait, more clearly, some productions have the right-hand side as a single terminal, like NT7 -> t93, which is a production that produces the terminal t93.\n\nSo, for example, if a step in the derivation produces t28, that must come from a production where the right-hand side ends with t28.\n\nLooking back, the only production that ends with t28 is NT28 -> ... Wait, in the provided productions, I see NT28's production is NT28 -> NT4 NT6, but looking through all the productions, is there a production that directly outputs a 't' followed by a number that's a production ending?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead look for each token in the string and see if it can be generated by some production.\n\nStarting with t28. Looking for a production where the right-hand side is t28. Wait, in the provided grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces t28. Because all productions for non-terminals result in two non-terminals, except some that might produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking for any production X -> t28. Scanning the grammar, I don't think there is such a production. For instance, looking at NT3 -> t42, but no production for NT128 or something. So perhaps each 't' corresponds to a production that directly ends with that t.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that some non-terminals have productions ending with a single terminal:\n\nFor example:\nNT28 -> NT4 NT6\nSo that's a production where t28 is generated.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 -> NT24 NT14, and so on.\n\nBut in the provided string, t28 is the first token, so the first step would be to have a production that directly outputs t28.\n\nWait, but none of the productions directly produce t28 as a terminal. Instead, t28 is part of the non-terminal NT28. So to generate t28, we'd have to have NT28 produce t28,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-782","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is quite long, and the grammar has a lot of productions. I remember that CNF grammars are special because every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The string is made up of tokens like 't40', 't79', etc. Looking at the grammar, I see that some productions directly expand to terminals, like S \u2192 NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, and NT4 \u2192 't91'. So each rule either breaks down non-terminals or produces a terminal.\n\nThe string given starts with 't40 t79...'. So, let's see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree should be a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal, except for the leaves, which are terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's defined as:\nS \u2192 NT1 NT28\nand another option S \u2192 NT50 NT27, but the first one seems to have more potential relevance. Let's take S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nSo, the first step in the derivation is replacing S with NT1 NT28. Now, let's check what NT1 and NT28 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n\nSo, NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17 and NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6. Now, NT25 and NT4 also need to be expanded.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\nNT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15\n\nSo, NT25 expands to NT6 NT31, and NT4 expands to NT21 NT15.\n\nNow, checking these, NT6 is a terminal that can be 't54 NT6' but wait, actually looking back, the productions for NT6 are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which would mean it's recursive unless it produces a terminal. Hmm, but there's a 't58' rule for NT6: NT6 \u2192 't58'. So, NT6 can be either recursive (if the grammar allows) or 't58'.\n\nBut in the string, we have a 't58' early on. Let's see the first part of the string: the first element is 't40', which might correspond to NT4's expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I should backtrack. Let's consider the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model the grammar as a parse tree and see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nLet me start from the beginning of the string:\n\n1. 't40'\nLooking at the grammar, 't40' is produced by NT40. Checking the productions, NT40 \u2192 't28' (from 'NT45 \u2192 't28'). Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't28'\n\nBut in the string, the second token is 't79', which is different. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list out the initial productions that generate terminals to see how they look.\n\nLooking at the productions, some NT's produce terminals like:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't91'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't93'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't97'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't78'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't117'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't81'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't65'\n\nAnd so on. So, a lot of NTs produce single terminals or have longer chains.\n\nSo, each token in the string corresponds to the result of a production either being a terminal or a combination of non-terminals.\n\nLet's consider the first part of the string: 't40 t79...'\n\nLooking at the string, 't40' suggests that some production at the highest level of the derivation generates 't40'. However, looking back at the grammar, I don't see any production that directly results in 't40'. All the productions for non-terminals seem to end in terminals that are numbers like t24, t65, t58, etc., but not 't40' directly.\n\nWait, maybe it's not the start symbol that produces 't40', but another non-terminal higher up in the parse tree. Let me think: perhaps 't40' is a result of a non-terminal that has production rules that include 't40'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check which non-terminals can produce 't40':\n\nFrom the productions, NT48 \u2192 't24', NT24 \u2192 't29', NT29 \u2192 't48', which forms a cycle: NT24 \u2192 t29 \u2192 NT29 \u2192 t48 \u2192 t24? Wait, no, let me look carefully.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't40':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT38 \u2192 't102', NT33 \u2192 t79, etc. Hmm, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't40'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing 't40'. So, maybe the first token, 't40', comes from a non-terminal that eventually expands to 't40' through a series of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't40' is part of a non-terminal expansion that includes multiple steps.\n\nLet me try to see which NTs can produce 't40'. Wait, the only way 't40' could appear is if one of the NTs in the grammar has a production that results in 't40', which doesn't seem to be the case here because all the 't's are much higher or specific lower numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong things. Let me think: maybe the string is derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. The first step we considered was S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nNT1 is 'NT25 NT17', and NT28 is 'NT4 NT6'.\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string should correspond to the symbols produced by NT1 and NT28 in the derivation.\n\nLooking at NT1 \u2192 't78' (from NT1 \u2192 't78') and NT28 \u2192 't58' (from NT28 \u2192 't58').\n\nSo, the first two tokens should be 't78 t58'.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is 't40', so that would not match. This suggests that the derivation starting from S would have first symbols 't78 t58' at the beginning, which doesn't match the string provided.\n\nTherefore, either the string is not produced by this grammar, or perhaps I am misunderstanding the expansion.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm considering the wrong starting point. Maybe S expands to another production that begins with a different NT.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol S has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nWe considered the first one. What about the second one?\n\nS \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nNow, let's look at NT50 and NT27.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT50 \u2192 't4' (from NT50 \u2192 't120'? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, under the grammar, let me re-examine the productions for NT50:\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\nNT50 \u2192 't4'\n\nYes, that's one of the productions. So NT50 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 \u2192 't128' (from NT27 \u2192 't128').\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string should be 't4 t128'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't40 t79...', so that would not match.\n\nTherefore, the only possible starting productions for S are S \u2192 NT1 NT28 (which starts with 't78 t58') or S \u2192 NT50 NT27 (which starts with 't4 t128'), but neither matches the given string.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string starts with a deeper expansion that eventually leads to these terminals.\n\nWait, but the entire string is generated by S, so the first step would have to produce these starting symbols. Since neither S's expansion matches the string's starting 't40' nor 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-785","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to check if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is `t24 t128 t122 t102 t73 t52 t97 t17 t109 t42 t11 t84 t124 t94 t8 t81 t69 t28 t63 t42 t76 t100 t112 t123 t59 t69 t122 t117 t45 t27 t89 t16 t66 t122 t31 t111 t122 t42 t102 t102 t27 t58 t50 t70 t109 t73 t27`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except for the terminals, which can't be split further. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S branches into NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So the start symbol S leads to two non-terminals, each of which will eventually produce the entire string.\n\nThe string starts with `t24`, so that's a terminal. I need to see which non-terminal can produce t24. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT22 has a production to `t24`. So, starting from S, it can produce two non-terminals, one of which is NT22. Let me check the productions for NT22. There are a couple of options: `NT22 -> NT40 NT45` and `NT22 -> NT10 -> NT24`. Wait, no, looking back, I think for NT22, the productions are `NT22 -> NT42 NT14` and `NT22 -> NT22 -> NT40 NT45`, but the user listed multiple NT22 productions, which might be multiple ways, but the key one is `NT22 -> t24`. So one branch would be t24, and another would need to produce the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but actually, the initial production is S -> NT1 NT28. So the first step would be to split into NT1 and NT28. The string starts with t24, so maybe NT28 is responsible for that. Let me check the productions for NT28. Looking at the grammar, NT28 can be `NT4 NT6` or `t24`. So NT28 can produce either a combination of two non-terminals or t24 directly. So if NT28 produces t24, that's good, but then the rest of the string would have to come from NT1. \n\nWait, so the input starts with t24, which could be generated by NT28. Let me see: NT28 can produce t24, so the first part is done. Then the next element is t128. So after t24, the next is t128, but the NT28 can only produce t24 or NT4 NT6. So if NT28 is producing t24, then the rest of the string starts with t128, which would have to come from NT1.\n\nLet's look at NT1's production. The grammar has NT1 -> NT25 NT17 and NT1 -> other options, one of which is `t84`. So NT1 can either produce two non-terminals or `t84`. The string after t24 is t128, so that can't be `t84`, so NT1 must produce two non-terminals here. Looking at NT1's productions, I see `NT1 -> t84` but also `NT1 -> NT47`. Hmm, maybe I missed one. The user provided the list, so let me check: Yes, NT1 has `t84` and `NT47`.\n\nWait, but I'm now thinking, if after t24 (produced by NT28), the next is t128, which isn't a terminal in NT1, unless NT1 produces NT128 somehow. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule for NT1 to produce something that leads to t128. Let's check all the productions for NT1:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, NT1's productions are:\nNT1 -> NT25 NT17\nNT1 -> NT47\nNT1 -> t69\nNT1 -> t84\n\nSo t128 isn't directly produced by NT1. Therefore, after t24 (from NT28), the next t128 must come from NT1. But NT1 can't produce t128 directly. So is there a way for NT1 to produce t128 through some sequence of productions? Let me check all NTs that can produce t128.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only terminal I see is `t128` in NT24, and others like NT24 in `t128` but wait, looking at the list, the grammar has:\n\nNT24 -> t122\nNT22 -> t24\nWait, looking more carefully, the grammar has multiple entries. Looking for t128:\n\nIn the user's grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 -> t24\nNT128: Wait, actually, looking more closely through the user's grammar, I don't see any rules that produce t128 directly. Looking through each production:\n\nLooking at the user's list, I see:\n\n- `t128`? Wait, no. The string has t128 as the second element. So does any non-terminal produce t128?\n\nLooking at the productions, NT22 can produce t24, NT24 can produce t122, NT23 isn't mentioned, and NT128 isn't present. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check the bottom of the list. The user's grammar includes:\n\nNT22 -> t24\nNT47 -> t4\nNT8 -> t102\n...\nWait, going through the entire list, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes t128. The strings like `t122`, `t128`, etc., are part of the given string.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar. The user's grammar is given as:\n\nThe production rules include lines like:\n\nNT7 -> t93\nNT7 -> t97\nNT46 -> t8\nNT17 -> t94\nNT27 -> t124\nNT24 -> t122\nNT22 -> t58\nNT10 -> t2\nNT55 -> t112\nNT24 -> t62\nNT46 -> t27\nNT1 -> t84\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Checking again, at the bottom of the user's list:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT22 has `t24`\n- NT47 -> t4\n- NT17 -> t94\n- NT27 -> t124\n- NT24 -> t122\n- NT22 -> t58\n- NT10 -> t2\n- NT55 -> t112\n- NT24 -> t62\n- NT46 -> t27\n- NT1 -> t84\n- NT47 -> t73\n- NT28 -> t97\n- NT44 -> t114\n- NT24 -> t122\n- NT46 -> t100\n- NT16 -> t83\n- NT13 -> t135\n- NT46 -> t14\n- NT7 -> t79\n- NT38 -> t53\n- NT36 -> t59\n- NT44 -> t89\n- NT55 -> t15\n- NT54 -> t81\n- NT46 -> t15\n- NT38 -> t34\n- NT14 -> t4\n- NT1 -> t78\n- NT47 -> t114\n- NT1 -> t5\n- NT31 -> t117\n- NT42 -> t80\n- NT10 -> t42\n- NT55 -> t36\n- NT15 -> t87\n- NT43 -> t89\n- NT17 -> t63\n- NT24 -> t11\n- NT0 -> t126\n- NT32 -> t108\n- NT22 -> t128\n- NT29 -> t116\n- NT1 -> t2\n- NT47 -> t4\n\nWait a minute, I think I've been overlooking that.

{"custom_id":"request-796","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me think through this step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC and A \u2192 terminal. Each production has either two non-terminals or one terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit that structure since all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of terminals: t21 t83 t29 t97 t89 t111 t53 t16 t2 t97 t120 t82 t135 t105 t38 t126 t111 t65 t58 t102 t134 t16 t70 t98 t108 t63 t31 t122 t87 t34 t1 t52 t66 t65 t19 t83 t37 t52 t58 t34 t123 t87 t15.\n\nMy goal is to trace this string back through the grammar using the productions. I think the approach here is to start from the beginning of the string and see if I can form the entire string by successively applying productions. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has two productions: S \u2192 NT1 NT10 and S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So the first symbol in the string must be a result of one of these starting points. Let me check the string: it starts with t21, t83, etc. \n\nLooking at the productions starting from S, the first part is either NT1 or NT50 in the first component. So NT1 leads to t21 (from NT1 \u2192 t21) and NT10 leads to t58 (from NT10 \u2192 t58). Wait, but the first symbol in the string is t21, which would be NT1, and the next would be something else, but in the string, after t21 is t83. Let me check if t83 is connected.\n\nWait, looking at NT1's productions, I see NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31, and from earlier productions, NT6 can lead to t58. Hmm, maybe that's not the path. Alternatively, looking at NT10, which leads to t58, but that's not matching the second part of the string. Maybe starting with S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nNT50: looking up the productions, NT50 \u2192 NT20 NT4. NT20 \u2192 NT38 NT33 and NT4 is NT21 NT15. Hmm, this seems a bit more involved. Maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the string and see where each terminal can be generated from. For example, t21 is only from NT1 \u2192 t21. So in the production S \u2192 NT1 NT10, t21 must come from NT1. Then, the next symbols should be the result of NT10 producing t83.\n\nLooking at NT10, the productions are NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT15 or NT15. Wait, no, the NT10 productions: from the grammar, it's NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT15 (from the section \"NT10 -> NT50 NT15\") and also possibly others? Wait, the given grammar doesn't explicitly list all of NT10's productions, so I need to refer back.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, for NT10, I see NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT15. But is that the only production? I'm not sure. Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT10 -> NT50 NT6 (I think?), wait no, let me look at the given productions to see what NT10 can produce. From the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- Line 1: S->NT1 NT10\n\n- Line 2: S->NT50 NT27\n\n- Then, looking for NT10: in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT50 -> NT20 NT4\n\nNT20 -> NT38 NT33\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, for NT10, the only production I see is in the part where NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT15. Wait, actually, looking at line ... let me check each NT10 production:\n\nWait, I need to look for \"NT10\" on the left side of the production. Let me scan through:\n\nYes, I see \"NT10 -> NT50 NT15\" which is line:\n\n\"NT10 -> NT50 NT15\"\n\nSo NT10 can produce NT50 and NT15. So from NT10, we can get to NT50 and NT15. Now, what does NT50 produce?\n\nLooking for NT50: productions like \"NT50 -> NT4 NT31\", \"NT50 -> NT16 NT6\", or others? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through, for NT50, I see:\n\n- NT50 -> NT4 NT31\n\n- NT50 -> NT8 NT6 (I think from NTEGral's part?)\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, \"NT50 -> NT4 NT31\" (line: NT50 -> NT4 NT31), and also \"NT50 -> NT8 NT6\" (I think, yes, because I see \"NT8 -> ...\".\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT50:\n\n- Line 14: NT45 -> NT46\n\n- Line 15: NT35 -> NT10 NT38\n\n- Line 16: NT26 -> NT50 NT48\n\nWait, here's the relevant part: NT50 is used in productions like S->NT50 NT27. So looking for NT50's productions, I see:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT4 NT31\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n\nSo from NT50, it can produce either NT4 NT31 or NT8 NT6.\n\nFrom the given string, starting with t21 (NT1), then the next is t83. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the string starts as t21, t83, t29, t97... So after t21 is t83. But if S \u2192 NT1 NT10, then the first symbol is from NT1 \u2192 t21, and the second symbol comes from NT10. From NT10, we can go to either NT50\u6216 NT15.\n\nWait, but let's think about the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parse the string step by step, trying to match the productions.\n\nLet me consider the entire string as a list and see if I can derive it.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt21 t83 t29 t97 t89 t111 t53 t16 t2 t97 t120 t82 t135 t105 t38 t126 t111 t65 t58 t102 t134 t16 t70 t98 t108 t63 t31 t122 t87 t34 t1 t52 t66 t65 t19 t83 t37 t52 t58 t34 t123 t87 t15.\n\nWait, that's a long string. Let me see if I can group these into non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be broken down into segments that correspond to the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t21. From the grammar, which non-terminal produces t21? Looking back, the productions for NT1 include NT1 \u2192 t21.\n\nYes, so the first symbol is t21, which comes from NT1. So the first part is NT1.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT1 NT10.\n\nThus, the next symbol must come from NT10.\n\nNT10 has the productions NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT15 or NT15. Let's see, what could produce t83.\n\nLooking at NT50, it can produce t8? Wait, wait, let me see. NT50 can be NT50 \u2192 NT4 NT31 or NT8 NT6.\n\nWait, but t83: do any of the non-terminals produce t83? Looking through, perhaps NT27 produces t105, but not t83. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building parse trees.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to list all possible non-terminals and see what they can produce. Let me try that.\n\nFor example, NT1 can only produce t21.

{"custom_id":"request-792","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite complex with multiple production rules, and the string to check is a series of tokens.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem. CNF grammars have all production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. The string in question is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT1 NT50 and S \u2192 NT4 NT27. So from S, we can derive either NT1 NT50 or NT4 NT27. Each of theseNT symbols may have further productions.\n\nSince the string starts with 't73', I wonder which NT could produce that. Looking through the rules, I notice that NT46 has a production NT46 \u2192 't8'. Hmm, 't8' is in the string\u2014specifically, the 17th token. That suggests that one of the non-terminals in the chain might produce 't8\".\n\nWait, but let's see if 't73' is possible. Looking through the production rules, I don't see a direct production where NT produces 't73'. Instead, NT45 is 't73'. So how can we get 't73'?\n\nWait, NT45 \u2192 't73' is a production. So looking at the rules, does NT45 appear in any production? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, yes, NT45 has the production NT45 \u2192 't73' (I found this after scanning through some rules). So to get 't73', the NT must be NT45.\n\nNow, where is NT45 in the grammar? The start symbols and other NTs need to be traced.\n\nWait, the string starts with t73, which is NT45. Then, looking at the next token, t65. Let's see what NTs can lead to t65. Scanning through the rules, I find NT21 \u2192 't1' and NT10 \u2192 't2'. Not t65. Let me check other NTs... Oh, NT15 has NT15 \u2192 't48'. Not matching t65. Hmm, perhaps a combination of NTs leading to t65.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production for NT26 has NT26 \u2192 't48'? No. Wait, looking back, I see NT14 \u2192 't79', which isn't helpful. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by a sequence of NTs, each producing another NT until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, another approach: since each step in CNF replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal, perhaps I can parse the string by breaking it down token by token, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if each terminal can be matched by some production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a top-down parsing using the given CFG.\n\nBut this might get complicated given the number of rules. Let me see if there's a more efficient way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for the production rules that can lead to the given string.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t73, which is the result of NT45 \u2192 't73'. So the first part must involve a production where one of the NTs is NT45.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol S has two options: S \u2192 NT1 NT50 or S \u2192 NT4 NT27. So to get NT45, perhaps we need to derive from NT4 or NT27.\n\nLooking at the options after S:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT1 NT50. So NT1 and NT50.\n\nNT1 has a production NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6.\n\nWait, NT6 can produce 't21' (from 't54 NT6') but also from NT6 \u2192 't120'? No, wait, I think NT6 has production NT6 \u2192 't120'. So maybe NT6 can produce t120, but the string has t21, t42, etc.\n\nThis might be getting too tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the string is too long and complex to derive step by step, so I should look for possible errors or inconsistencies.\n\nWait, looking at NT46: it has several productions, including NT46 \u2192 't4', 't8', 't14', etc. Wait, in the string, after 't73' comes 't65'. So is there any production involving the concatenation of two NTs that can produce 't65'?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts where each part is generated by a single NT.\n\nWait, for example, if 't73' comes from NT45, what's next? 't65' could be a terminal from some other NT. Let's check the productions for NT25: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31, and NT6 \u2192 't24' (from NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6'? Or does NT6 have a production to a terminal?\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6', so that's not a terminal, but NT6 also has NT6 \u2192 't120' (I think I saw that in the rules, possibly from NT6 \u2192 NT46 or something else. Wait, looking back: Yes, in the rules, NT6 has NT6 \u2192 't120' and NT6 \u2192 't58' elsewhere?\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT6, I see several rules, including NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6', which is a recursive rule, and others leading to terminals. For example, looking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 't21' and NT6 \u2192 't120', so 't6', 't54', etc.\n\nSo 't6' can come directly from NT6 if there's a production NT6 \u2192 't6'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules: I don't see any production where NT6 goes directly to 't6'. Wait, in the rules, under NT6, there's NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6' (I think) and NT6 \u2192 't21', and also NT6 \u2192 't120'.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I don't see any rule where NT6 produces 't6' as a terminal. So 't6' can't be directly produced by NT6. Hmm, so this might be a problem.\n\nWait, then how can 't6' appear in the string? Because none of the NTs directly produce 't6'. Unless perhaps I made a mistake in looking through the productions.\n\nWait, wait, looking back at the rules: there's a rule NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6' and then other rules, but no NT6 \u2192 't6'. So that's an issue. That would mean 't6' cannot be produced by the grammar. But wait, 't6' is not even in the string given. So the string has 't73' followed by 't65', which I need to check where they come from.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake in transcribing the rules. Let me make sure. Looking back:\n\nUnder NT6, the rules are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't54 NT6'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't58'\n\nAnd others. Wait, so no, 't6' isn't produced by NT6. So in the string, the token is 't63' (I think I'm mixing up the tokens). Wait, in the given string, the tokens are:\n\nt73, t65, t24, t82, t124, t58, t31, t42, t81, t40, t63, t19, t87, t87, t128, t63, t109, t8, t63, t45, t89, t4, t41, t27, t108, t34, t2, t50, t63, t70, t82, t83, t120, t59, t17, t114, t128, t116, t109, t21, t41, t41, t3, t31, t66, t128, t117, t135.\n\nWait, let's look for other problematic tokens, like 't6'. But in this string, I don't see 't6' except in the given tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-804","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier. Let me break down what I know and how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a set of production rules, all of which are in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the single terminal 't'. The start symbol is S, and the terminals in the string are all 't' followed by numbers, like t128, t73, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t128 t73 t40 t19 t105 t109 t73 t112 t58 t63 t89 t15 t111 t128 t53 t24 t112 t4 t81 t31 t126 t94 t91 t27 t62 t108 t81 t116 t124 t62 t82 t41 t52 t8 t16 t63 t34 t112 t15 t38 t81 t14 t48 t24 t36 t1 t135 t82 t119`.\n\nSo, each token is a terminal, and I need to determine if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production introduces exactly one non-terminal, and each non-terminal is derived from exactly two other non-terminals (except possibly the start symbol if it's directly a terminal, but in this case, it's not).\n\nGiven that, the number of symbols (excluding non-terminals) in the string must be equal to 2^n, where n is the number of productions, but wait, actually, in CFGs, each production increases the length exponentially. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, starting from S, each step doubles the number of symbols. So the total number of symbols in any derived string will be 2^n, where n is the number of productions needed.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think. Each time you use a production, it replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols increases by one each time you apply a production. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So the initial step (assuming S directly produces the string) would have two symbols. Then, each NT would need to be derived. But in this string, the number of symbols is more than two, so S must go through a series of productions expanding each NT until we get to all terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look for the possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t128. So the first symbol is t128, which is a terminal. Let's see which production rules produce 't128'. Looking through the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce 't' followed by numbers, like NT22 \u2192 t58, NT48 \u2192 t24, etc. So, to get t128, we need to find which non-terminals produce t128.\n\nLooking at the grammar, line by line:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t29\n- NT6 \u2192 t54\n- NT47 \u2192 t41\n- NT13 \u2192 t16\n- NT55 \u2192 t45\n- NT46 \u2192 t27\n- NT17 \u2192 t94\n- NT27 \u2192 t58\n- NT41 \u2192 t4\n- NT56 \u2192 t134\n- NT34 \u2192 t123\n- NT22 \u2192 t128 (Wait, no, line 22's rule is NT22 \u2192 t58. So where does t128 come from? Looking through all the rules, I don't see a direct rule for 't128'. Hmm, that's a problem. Let me scan all the production rules for any NT that directly produce t128.\n\nWait, checking all lines for production rules:\n\nLooking through each line: NT22 \u2192 t58, NT24 \u2192 t29, NT6 \u2192 t54, NT47 \u2192 t41, NT17 \u2192 t94, NT55 \u2192 t45, NT46 \u2192 t27, NT13 \u2192 t16, NT55 \u2192 t45, NT41 \u2192 t4, NT56 \u2192 t134, NT34 \u2192 t123, NT22 \u2192 t128? Wait, looking again:\n\nLine 22: NT22 \u2192 t58\n\nWait, maybe I missed a rule. Let's check line numbers beyond that. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t128. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps t128 is derived through a series of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps t128 can be derived via a path in the grammar. Let me check if there's a sequence that leads to t128.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, perhaps one of the non-terminals produces t128:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t102\n- NT56 \u2192 t134\n- NT20 \u2192 t16\n- NT10 \u2192 t2\n- NT48 \u2192 t62\n- NT6 \u2192 t58\n- NT46 \u2192 t27\n- NT17 \u2192 t94\n- NT22 \u2192 t58\n- NT46 \u2192 t134\n\nNo, I don't see any rule that produces t128 directly. So perhaps 't128' is not directly produced by any NT in the grammar. Therefore, if the string contains t128, it must have been derived from a non-terminal that eventually produces it through several steps.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-800","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. \n\nFirst, let me look at the string and the grammar rules. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token seems to correspond to a rule in the grammar. For example, rules like NT3 -> 'tX', where X are numbers, and rules like S -> NT1 NT28, which would produce tX tY sequences.\n\nThe string in question is: `t40 t65 t73 t59 t119 t11 t87 t11 t131 t52 t45 t41 t97 t126 t73 t78 t112 t41 t116 t1 t120 t128 t17 t17 t105 t63 t94 t107 t89 t50 t53 t108 t109 t14 t37 t40 t109 t53 t114 t108 t37 t2 t128 t19 t52 t17 t31 t79 t65`.\n\nI need to parse this string using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the parse would involve applying a production rule that splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals, and each terminal corresponds to a production where a non-terminal produces a single terminal.\n\nLet me start by noting that the top-level rule is S -> NT1 NT28 or S -> NT50 NT27. So the root of the parse tree would be S, and it would split into two non-terminals: NT1 and NT28, or NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first tokens are t40, t65, etc. Let's try to see if the string can start with S -> NT1 NT28.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT1: From the grammar, I see NT1 -> NT25 NT17. So NT1 is split into NT25 and NT17.\n\nFor NT25, the rule is NT25 -> NT6 NT31. So NT25 becomes NT6 and NT31.\n\nNT6 has two rules: NT6 -> NT54 NT6 and NT6 -> 't58'. So either NT6 is split into NT54 and NT6, or it's a terminal 't58'. Looking at the string: the first token is t40, then t65, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step using the rules.\n\nLet me list the string tokens again: t40, t65, t73, t59, t119, t11, t87, t11, t131, t52, t45, t41, t97, t126, t73, t78, t112, t41, t116, t1, t120, t128, t17, t17, t105, t63, t94, t107, t89, t50, t53, t108, t109, t14, t37, t40, t109, t53, t114, t108, t37, t2, t128, t19, t52, t17, t31, t79, t65.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Let me try to see if they can fit into the grammar, starting from S.\n\nFirst, S can produce NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t40. Let's see which rule ends with 't40'.\n\nLooking through the rules: NT54 -> 't53', NT33 -> 't79', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the start symbol S and see if the string can be divided accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down parsing approach with the given string.\n\nStarting with S, it must produce either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. Let's consider S -> NT1 NT28 first.\n\nSo, from S, the first production is NT1 and NT28.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: t40, t65, etc. Let's see if there's a path where NT1 and NT28 can produce these tokens.\n\nLooking at NT1: The rule is NT1 -> NT25 NT17.\n\nSo, NT1 is split into NT25 and NT17.\n\nNow, looking at the string, after S, the first two tokens are t40 and t65. So perhaps NT25 and NT17 produce these. But wait, let me check if NT25 or NT17 can produce 't40' or 't65'.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT25 -> NT6 NT31.\n\nLooking for where NT6 or NT31 produce t40 or t65.\n\nNT6 has rules: NT6 -> 't58' or NT6 -> NT54 NT6.\n\n'nt6' can produce 't58', but it's also a recursive rule. Checking if anywhere in the string we have 't58', which is token 2 in the string (t65 is token 1, then t73, etc.: wait, wait let me recount.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me index the tokens properly:\n\n1: t40\n\n2: t65\n\n3: t73\n\n4: t59\n\n5: t119\n\n6: t11\n\n7: t87\n\n8: t11\n\n9: t131\n\n10: t52\n\n11: t45\n\n12: t41\n\n13: t97\n\n14: t126\n\n15: t73\n\n16: t78\n\n17: t112\n\n18: t41\n\n19: t116\n\n20: t1\n\n21: t120\n\n22: t128\n\n23: t17\n\n24: t17\n\n25: t105\n\n26: t63\n\n27: t94\n\n28: t107\n\n29: t89\n\n30: t50\n\n31: t53\n\n32: t108\n\n33: t109\n\n34: t14\n\n35: t37\n\n36: t40\n\n37: t109\n\n38: t53\n\n39: t114\n\n40: t108\n\n41: t37\n\n42: t2\n\n43: t128\n\n44: t19\n\n45: t52\n\n46: t17\n\n47: t31\n\n48: t79\n\n49: t65.\n\nWait, I think I'm conflating the positions. The first token is t40 (position 1), then t65 (position 2), t73 (3), t59 (4), etc.\n\nSo S starts with NT1 (position 1: t40) and NT28.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try another approach. Since the entire string must be generated by the grammar, perhaps I can represent it as a tree where each step follows the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to check if the string can be split into a sequence of symbols that correspond to the right-hand sides of the production rules.\n\nLooking at S, it's either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. Let's think about the first alternative: S -> NT1 NT28.\n\nNT1 is NT25 NT17, and NT28 is NT4 NT6.\n\nWait, NT28's rule is NT28 -> NT4 NT6.\n\nSo, the production for S would be NT25 NT17 NT4 NT6.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Wait, no: the overall production is S -> NT1 NT28 \u2192 NT25 NT17 NT4 NT6.\n\nSo the S production in that case would generate four non-terminals: NT25, NT17, NT4, NT6, but since NT4 and NT6 are non-terminals, we have to split each of them further.\n\nThis is getting complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-812","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given grammar generates the string provided. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is useful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals (non-terminals never take terminals, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a).\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that non-terminals are denoted by uppercase letters, and terminals start with lowercase letters. The starting symbol is S. The string given is a series of lowercase tokens, like t107, t109, etc. So the problem is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should note that each production in the grammar is a step. The number of symbols in the string should correspond to the number of steps in the derivation. Since it starts with S, which is a single symbol, a fully expanded string will have 2^n - 1 symbols if all intermediate non-terminals are expanded. Here, the string has 32 symbols, so 2^n - 1 = 32 \u2192 2^n = 33. Hmm, that's not a power of two. Maybe some non-terminals are left unexpanded, so the actual number of symbols can be more than 2^n-1. But this might complicate things. Maybe it's easier to model the process step by step.\n\nBut perhaps instead, I should build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be matched. Alternatively, convert the grammar into a parse table and try to parse the string, but that might take time.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to decompose the string into the possible production sequences. Let's see.\n\nThe string is: t107, t109, t102, t70, t65, t134, t100, t14, t62, t134, t14, t111, t53, t1, t82, t114, t17, t37, t4, t131, t126, t27, t79, t134, t37, t82, t109, t34, t1, t24, t62, t109, t107, t94, t69, t83, t80, t2, t120, t38, t105, t52, t98, t31, t73, t120, t111, t58, t79, t24.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Let me see if they can be grouped into the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the production for S:\nS \u2192 NT1 NT28\nSo, the string should start with two tokens derived from NT1 and NT28.\n\nLooking at NT1 and NT28, let's see what productions they have.\n\nLooking at NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17 (from production NT1 -> NT25 NT17). Hmm. Also, looking further up, NT1 is used elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all productions where NT1 appears. From the given grammar:\n\nNT1 -> NT25 NT17 (line 1)\nAlso, looking through the list, I see NT1 appears in NT46's production: NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT27? Wait, I don't see NT1 listed further. So perhaps NT1 only has one production, which is \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 (line 2). Let me confirm: Yes, line 2 says NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT1 NT28 \u2192 (NT25 NT17) (NT4 NT6). So the first two tokens would be t for NT25 and t for NT17.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is t107. So if S \u2192 NT1 NT28, then the first token is t corresponding to NT1, which is t107. Then the second token is t109. So let's check: what produces t107 and t109.\n\nLooking through the NTx entries, let's see which NTs have t107. Looking at the list, for NT6, line 66: NT6\u2192t120? Wait, no. Wait, looking through each NT and their productions:\n\nLooking for NT that can produce t107.\n\nLooking through all entries for each NT:\n\nLooking for NT where a production ends with t107. Let's see:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t3\n- NT24 \u2192 t11\n- NT31 \u2192 't117'\n- NT32 \u2192 't66'\n- NT33 \u2192 't79'\n- NT34 \u2192 't37' etc.\n\nWait, this seems tedious. Let me go more systematically.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t107:\n\nLooking through each line where a production ends with t107.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT6 has a production: NT6\u2192t58 (line 60: NT6 \u2192 t58)\n- NT66: looking for NT66, but in the grammar, NT66 doesn't exist. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, in the grammar, line 60: NT6 \u2192 t58\nLine 32: NT32 \u2192 't66'\nLine 60: NT6 \u2192 t58\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar. From the initial user message:\n\nThe grammar starts with S\u2192NT1 NT28 and so on.\n\nThen for NT36: line 34 says NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6?\n\nWait, actually, perhaps some of the entries are hard to follow. Maybe I should list all NTs and their productions, focusing on which NTs can produce the given tokens.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t107:\n\nCheck each line where a production for a NT ends with t107.\n\nLooking through the user's grammar:\n\nLooking for 't107' in the right-hand side (RHS) of productions. Let's see:\n\n- Line 15: NT0 \u2192 't126' (Wait, no, looking at line 10: NT30\u2192't111'; line 15: NT10 \u2192 't2'; perhaps not.)\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier.\n\nLooking at all RHS entries, I see:\n\n- NT50: lines 4 and 5: e.g., NT50 \u2192 t4, t50.\n\nWait, line starting with \"NT56 \u2192 ...\" might have: line 60 is NT6 \u2192 t58.\n\nLooking for t107:\n\nGoing through the RHS of each production:\n\nLooking for 't107'. In the provided grammar, the RHS includes:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15\n- NT6 \u2192 t58 (line 60)\n- NT8 \u2192 t102.\nWait, looking through the lines, the user wrote a long list.\n\nWait, in the initial list, looking for 't107':\n\nIt seems from lines:\n\nLet's scan through the RHS:\n\nLooking at NT46's productions:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT0 NT22 (line 46)\n- NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT8 (line 47)\n- NT46 \u2192 NT14 NT10 (line 48)\n- NT14 \u2192 ... (various)\nWait, looking for 't107' in RHS:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I find in line 70: NT53 \u2192 NT49 NT54 \u2192 but that's not t107. \n\nAnother place: line 10: NT10 \u2192 't2' etc. Let me make a better approach.\n\nPerhaps the NTs that can produce t107 are among the NTs in the grammar. The string's first token is t107, which must come from an NT. So we need to find which NT production has 't107' as the terminal.\n\nLooking again through the RHS:\n\nFind any production where RHS is t107.\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\nLooking for RHS containing 't107':\n\n- Line 10: NT10 \u2192 't2'\n- Line 15: NT21 \u2192 t3\n- Line 24: NT22 \u2192 't58'\n- Line 31: NT31 \u2192 't117'\n- Line 32: NT32 \u2192 't66'\n- Line 33: NT33 \u2192 't79'\n- Line 34: NT34 \u2192 't37' etc.\n- Line 40: NT40 \u2192 't28'\n- Line 41: NT41 \u2192 't4' (and more)\nWait, perhaps I missed 't107' in the RHS somewhere.

{"custom_id":"request-10","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the string \"t28 t76\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. Context-free grammars (CFGs) have a start symbol, non-terminals, terminals, and production rules. The given grammar starts with S, and the productions are all either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, actually, looking closer, I see that some rules might produce a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like NT37 -> 't94'. Wait, no, the production for S is NT1, which might have further splits. But let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So looking at the grammar, some rules seem to have terminals on the right-hand side, like NT46 -> 't27', but I think NT46 has multiple productions, so perhaps the string in question is a terminal string, and maybe some non-terminals can be expanded into that.\n\nBut the string given is \"t28 t76\". So two terminals: t28 and t76. So I need to see if S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nStarting with S, which has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo the string must begin with either NT1 or NT50 followed by NT28 or NT27, respectively. Since our string starts with 't28', let's see where 't28' can come from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that NT28 has a production: NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6. Hmm, that's two non-terminals. Also, is there any production that produces 't28' directly? Let me check all the productions for terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT9 \u2192 't93', NT14 \u2192 't94', NT24 \u2192 't29', etc. Wait, does any non-terminal directly produce 't28'? Checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the given productions, let me see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't58'\n- NT47 \u2192 't41'\n- Hmm, looking more carefully. There's NT16 \u2192 't83' and NT36 \u2192 't37' wait, no. Let me scan all terminal outputs:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT46 -> 't27' (once)\n- NT7 -> 't93'\n- NT17 -> 't94'\n- NT24 -> 't29'\n- NT46 -> 't76' ... Wait, at the bottom, looking through:\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have some rules where non-terminals produce terminals, like:\n\n- NT46 -> 't27'\n- NT28 -> 't76' ?\n\nWait, checking each rule. Let me go through each production and look for any that produce 't28' directly. Hmm, I see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see several where a non-terminal is assigned a terminal:\n\n- NT46 -> 't27' (twice)\n- NT45 -> 't28'\n- NT27 -> 't124'\n- Wait, wait.

{"custom_id":"request-17","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the string \"t69 t97\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. It seems like it's built using several non-terminals (like S, NT36, NT28, etc.) and terminals (like t69, t97, etc.). Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a single terminal. That means the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of each rule have at most two symbols.\n\nThe target string is \"t69 t97\". Splitting this, it's two tokens: \"t69\" and \"t97\". So the string has to be derived from the start symbol S in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce two options:\n\n1. NT1 NT28\n2. NT50 NT27\n\nSo, \"t69 t97\" needs to come from one of these two paths. Let me check each possibility.\n\nFirst, let's see if \"t69\" matches any non-terminal. Looking through the rules, I see NT46 -> 't69'. So, \"t69\" can be produced by NT46. Similarly, \"t97\" appears as a terminal in NT12 -> 't97'? Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, I see several rules where terminals are on the right side. Let me list them:\n\nNT17 -> 't94'\nNT29 -> 't48'\nNT46 -> 't8'\nNT17 -> 't94'\nNT27 -> 't124'\nNT24 -> 't29'\nNT22 -> 't58'\nNT10 -> 't2'\nNT55 -> 't112'\nNT24 -> 't62'\nNT46 -> 't27'\nNT14 -> 't79'\nNT26 -> 't48'\nNT13 -> 't16'\nNT55 -> 't45'\nNT9 -> 't19'\nNT29 -> 't48'\nNT28 -> 't76'\nNT41 -> 't4'\nNT32 -> 't66'\nNT10 -> 't50'\nNT34 -> 't37'\nNT47 -> 't40'\nNT21 -> 't3'\nNT36 -> 't87'\nNT6 -> 't58'\nNT47 -> 't41'\nNT50 -> 't4'\nNT15 -> 't48'\nNT29 -> 't14'\nNT6 -> 't21'\nNT49 -> 't109'\nNT33 -> 't79'\nNT36 -> 't120'\nNT38 -> 't102'\nNT39 -> 't131'\nNT14 -> 't58'\nNT20 -> 't16'\nNT10 -> 't17'\nNT48 -> 't70'\nNT27 -> 't116'\nNT30 -> 't111'\nNT43 -> 't69'\nNT43 -> 't27'\nNT42 -> 't82'\nNT6 -> 't120'\nNT1 -> 't28'\nNT33 -> 't36'\nNT8 -> 't102'\nNT10 -> 't65'\nNT21 -> 't1'\nNT38 -> 't123'\nNT15 -> 't93'\nNT4 -> 't91'\nNT40 -> 't28'\nNT26 -> 't98'\nNT32 -> 't59'\nNT19 -> 't126'\nNT46 -> 't76'\nNT56 -> 't134'\nNT3 -> 't42'\nNT45 -> 't73'\nNT28 -> 't97'\nNT44 -> 't114'\nNT24 -> 't122'\nNT46 -> 't100'\nNT16 -> 't83'\nNT13 -> 't135'\nNT46 -> 't14'\nNT7 -> 't79'\nNT38 -> 't53'\nNT36 -> 't59'\nNT44 -> 't89'\nNT55 -> 't15'\nNT54 -> 't81'\nNT46 -> 't15'\nNT38 -> 't34'\nNT14 -> 't4'\nNT1 -> 't78'\nNT47 -> 't114'\nNT1 -> 't5'\nNT31 -> 't117'\nNT42 -> 't80'\nNT10 -> 't42'\nNT55 -> 't36'\nNT15 -> 't87'\nNT43 -> 't89'\nNT17 -> 't63'\nNT24 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't126'\nNT29 -> 't31'\nNT50 -> 't38'\nNT25 -> 't107'\nNT6 -> 't119'\nNT32 -> 't108'\nNT22 -> 't128'\nNT29 -> 't116'\nNT1 -> 't2'\nNT47 -> 't4'\n\nWait, the string is \"t69 t97\". From S's options:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT1 NT28\n\n- NT1 -> 't69' (since looking through the rules, NT46 -> 't69')\n- NT28 can produce 't97' via NT28 -> NT46?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check each path.\n\nFirst, check if \"t69\" is a terminal and how it can be generated. Looking for a non-terminal that reduces directly to \"t69\". From the rules, I see NT46 -> 't69'.\n\nSo, to produce \"t69\", we need NT46.\n\nThen, the other part is \"t97\". Looking for a non-terminal that produces \"t97\". Let me check each rule:\n\nNT17 -> 't94' \u2192 nope.\nNT27 -> 't124' \u2192 nope.\nNT24 -> 't29' \u2192 nope.\nNT46 -> 't8' \u2192 nope.\nNT29 -> 't48' \u2192 nope.\nNT28 -> 't76' \u2192 nope.\nNT44 -> 't114' \u2192 nope.\nNT4 -> 't91' \u2192 nope.\nNT40 -> 't28' \u2192 nope.\nHTHink I'm missing something here. Maybe I should look for which non-terminals can produce \"t97\".\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT28 -> 't97' directly. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT6\n\nBut in another rule, I see:\n\nNT28 -> 't97'\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the given grammar, I think I might have miswritten some parts. Let me re-express the rules properly.\n\nLooking again, the rules for NT28: NT28 -> NT4 NT6 and NT28 -> 't97'? Or is 't97' another production?\n\nWait, no. Looking through the grammar, I don't see \"t97\" as a terminal. For instance, I see:\n\n\"NT28 -> NT4 NT6\" and in another line, \"NT28 -> 't87'\". Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking carefully, I think I might have miswrote. Let me list all NT28 rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT6\n- NT28 -> 't97'\n\nWait, no, I don't think so. Let me go back.\n\nWait, in the provided rules:\n\nLooking for 't97', I don't see it. Wait, actually, in the list, there is:\n\nNT22 -> 't58'\nNT29 -> 't29'\nNT24 -> 't29'\nNT22 -> 't128'\nNT30 -> 't111'\nNT43 -> 't69'\nNT34 -> 't37'\n...\nLooking further, I don't see \"t97\" as a terminal. So perhaps \"t97\" is a terminal? Or maybe I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, perhaps \"t97\" is a terminal. If that's the case, I need to check if any rule produces 't97' as a terminal.

The start symbol is S, and the string should be derived by replacing all non-terminals with terminals using these rules.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the start symbol is S, which is initially on the left-hand side of the first production: S \u2192 NT1 NT1 NT28. Wait, no\u2014actually, looking again, the grammar has S producing NT1 NT1 NT28 and NT50 NT27, among others. So S can derive different things, but since CNF only allows two non-terminals on the right, I need to see if S can start the derivation.\n\nWait, actually, the initial productions from S are S -> NT1 NT1 NT28 and S -> NT50 NT27. Each of these is S producing three non-terminals because NT1, NT28, NT50 are non-terminals. But in CNF, each production can only have two non-terminals. So that might be a problem because these productions from S have three parts. Hmm, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the base cases where a single terminal is produced. So if a production like S \u2192 NT1 NT1 NT28 is given, that's not in CNF because it's producing three non-terminals. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps this is a more complex case, or maybe it's allowed because of the way the grammar is structured.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem statement says the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which strictly requires each production to have at most two non-terminals on the right. So if S \u2192 NT1 NT1 NT28 is a production, it's violating CNF, which makes me think I might have misread the grammar. Let me double-check the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see lines like S \u2192 NT1 NT1 NT28, which can't be correct for CNF because CNF requires each production to have either one terminal or two non-terminals. So perhaps the user made a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar's form. Alternatively, maybe the grammar is using more than two symbols on the right but allowed because it's in a broader form, but no, the problem states it's in CNF, so I must stick with that.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the grammar is right-weak, but no, right now, I have to assume it's in CNF, so perhaps I should treat each production as it is, even if it's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should check if the string `t4 t81 t91` can be generated regardless of how S is derived. Perhaps even if S can't directly produce the string, but through intermediate steps, the string can be generated.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about how to generate the string `t4 t81 t91`. The string consists of three tokens: t4, t81, t91. So the derivation needs to produce three terminals, which in this case are three t's with different numbers. \n\nStarting from S, which is at the top. From the given productions, S can go to NT1 NT1 NT28, which would produce three non-terminals, then each of those can be expanded further. Alternatively, S can go to NT50 NT27\u2014let's check those.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nSo S can be replaced by NT50 and NT27. Then, let's see what each can produce.\n\nLooking for NT50: in the grammar, I see NT50 -> 't4'. So NT50 directly produces 't4'. That's one terminal, which matches the first token in our string.\n\nNext, NT27: looking at NT27's productions. I see NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16 (earlier production). Then, NT39 can be either NT20 NT24 or NT15 NT39. Let me see the options.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to see if we can derive 't81' and 't91' from the other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but let me process NT50 first. NT50 \u2192 't4' directly. So from NT50, we get 't4', which is the first token in our string.\n\nNow, we need to get the other two tokens, 't81' and 't91', from the remaining part. The remaining part comes from NT27. Let me see NT27's productions.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16.\n\nSo to get 't81' and 't91', perhaps we can derive from NT27.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16.\n\nSo let's see NT39 and NT16.\n\nLooking at NT39: the productions are NT39 \u2192 NT20 NT24 and NT39 \u2192 NT15 NT39.\n\nWait, but NT39 is on the left, and we're trying to get to a terminal. So perhaps we need to expand NT39 into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT27 can be expanded further. NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16.\n\nLet me check what NT16 can produce. NT16 \u2192 NT10 NT34.\n\nThen, NT10 is in the grammar: NT10 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo NT10 \u2192 't2', which would produce 't2' as the second token? Wait, but our string is 't4 t81 t91', so the second token is 't81', not 't2'. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let me think again. From NT27, we get NT39 and NT16. Let's see if we can find a way for NT39 and NT16 to produce 't81' and 't91'.\n\nWait, let's look for all possible terminal options.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several NTs that produce terminals.\n\nFor example, NT50 \u2192 't4' (as we saw). Other NTs:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't28'.\n- NT1 \u2192 't25'.\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'.\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'.\n- NT27 \u2192 't16' (wait, no, looking at NT27's production: NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16. Wait, does NT27 produce a terminal directly? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT27 is defined as:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16.\n\nIs there any production that directly produces a terminal for NT27? Looking through the provided productions, I don't see NT27 \u2192 a terminal. So NT27 has to be derived into other non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT27 can reach a terminal through some path.\n\nHmm, let's try to get 't81' and 't91' as the next two tokens.\n\nLooking through the grammar, there are some NTs that produce terminals:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't105' (but our string needs 't81' and 't91').\n- Wait, NT35 also produces 't105', but that's different.\n- NT14 \u2192 't79' (but we need 't81').\n- NT45 \u2192 't73' (no, the production is NT45 \u2192 't73').\n- NT26 \u2192 't58' (no).\n- Let me scan the productions for terminals:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't63' (no).\n- NT24 \u2192 't62'.\n- NT46 \u2192 't4'.\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'.\n- NT15 \u2192 't48'.\n- NT55 \u2192 't15'.\n- NT32 \u2192 't66'.\n- NT14 \u2192 't79'.\n- NT26 \u2192 't58'.\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'.\n- NT47 \u2192 't40'.\n- NT38 \u2192 't102' (but we need 81 and 91).\n- NT39 \u2192 't131'.\n- NT41 \u2192 't42'.\n- NT1 \u2192 't25'.\n- NT22 \u2192 various.\n- Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a terminal for 81 and 91.\n\nWait, let me see if any NT produces 't81' or 't91' as a terminal. From the provided list, I don't see NTs that produce 't81' or 't91'. The closest is NT46 producing 't8'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-34","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t69 t102 t102\" is generated by the given CFG. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals. The given string consists of three tokens: t69, t102, and t102. So the string has a length of 3 tokens, meaning the parse tree must have a depth such that the root (S) expands to two symbols, which then expand further until we get the three t tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly map to 't' followed by a number. For example, NT41 -> 't84', NT35 -> 't37', and so on. So, when a production like NTx -> 'ty', it's a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string \"t69 t102 t102\" is a sequence of three terminals. Since CFGs can generate strings of terminals directly from the start symbol through intermediate steps, I need to see if S can generate this sequence.\n\nThe start symbol is S. From the grammar, S can produce NT1 NT50 or NT50 NT27. So, two possible initial expansions:\n\n1. S -> NT1 NT50\n2. S -> NT50 NT27\n\nI need to see if either of these can lead to the target string.\n\nLet's consider the first option: S -> NT1 NT50. \n\nLooking at NT1, in the grammar, I see NT1 -> NT25 NT17. So NT1 expands into two non-terminals. Then, each of these can further expand.\n\nNT25 -> NT6 NT31.\nNT6 can expand into 't58' and NT31 can expand into 't117'.\n\nSo, NT1 expands to two non-terminals that result in 't58' and 't117'.\n\nThen, NT50 can expand into 't4' and NT... Hmm, looking at NT50, in the grammar it's written as NT50 -> NT15 NT50? Wait, no, looking back, I think I miscounted.\n\nWait, the grammar has several rules. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS is the start symbol, producing NT1 NT50 or NT50 NT27.\n\nNT1: NT1 -> NT25 NT17.\n\nNT25 -> NT6 NT31.\n\nNT6: NT6-> NT54 NT6. Wait, that looks like a left recursion because NT6 can produce NT54 followed by NT6. So, this would be an infinite loop. Wait, but production rules in Chomsky Normal Form are non-terminals to two non-terminals without epsilon, but this is not left recursive if NT54 is a terminal or not.\n\nWait, looking back, NT6 is a non-terminal with a production NT6 -> NT54 NT6, which is a left recursion. That's problematic because it can lead to infinite loops and isn't allowed in standard CFGs, right? Or is it? Wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A -> BC, but if B or C is a terminal, it's allowed. But in this case, NT54 is also a non-terminal because looking at the grammar, NT54 is defined as NT14, but let me check.\n\nWait, NT54 -> NT14 NT6? Or is it another rule.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 has a production? Let me scan the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT56 -> NT20 NT17, etc. Hmm, I'm not seeing an explicit rule for NT54. Wait, maybe NT54 is a typo because in other rules, like NT46: NT46 -> NT20 NT8, etc. Wait, perhaps NT54 is actually a terminal, like NT6. Because in some rules, like NT6 -> 't58', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, the grammar lists several 't' followed by a number. So, looking through the rules, I see NT7 -> 't93', NT14 -> 't79', and so on. So, 't' symbols are terminals.\n\nSo, some NTs directly map to 't' symbols. So for example, NT6 has a production to 't58' or to NT54 NT6.\n\nWait, if NT6 can produce 't58' and also the problematic NT54 NT6, which would be a left recursion if NT54 is treated as a non-terminal. But perhaps NT54 is a terminal? Let me check if NT54 is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT14 -> 't4', and other rules where NT6 is a terminal, like NT6 -> 't58', but NT54 may not have a production. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see an explicit rule for NT54, so that would mean NT54 is a terminal? Or perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe NT54 is a non-terminal that has a rule somewhere else.\n\nWait, let me look carefully. For example, NT46 -> NT20 NT8. So, NT8 is further defined as 't102' in the rules. So, NT8 -> 't102'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, one of the tokens is 't102', which would come from NT8.\n\nGoing back to NT6: NT6-> NT54 NT6, but if NT54 is a non-terminal, this leads to a left recursion. Left recursion in CFGs can be problematic but can be handled using techniques like left factoring or by converting to a non-left-recursive form, but here I'm just trying to see if the grammar can generate 't102 t102'.\n\nWait, perhaps in this grammar, NT6 is a left-recursive non-terminal, which would make the grammar ambiguous and not in the correct form, but the given grammar is supposed to be in Chomsky Normal Form. So, maybe the initial NT6 rule is written in a left-recursive way, which is not typical in Chomsky Normal Form. So, perhaps I need to rewrite it as NT6 -> NT54 NT6, which allows for left recursion, but in practice, in parsers, left-recursive rules can be converted to right-recursive using the standard method by introducing a new rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this specific grammar, the left recursion is not an issue because it will produce an infinite loop, but since the string ends, we can have a finite number of steps.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the tokens are finite: three t symbols. So, how can S generate this with left recursion? Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a way to directly expand S into the three t tokens by following the productions.\n\nLet me try the first path: S -> NT1 NT50.\n\nNT1 expands to NT25 NT17, which is production NT1 -> NT25 NT17.\n\nNT25 -> NT6 NT31 (from the grammar).\n\nNT6 -> 't58' or NT54 NT6.\n\nWait, so if NT6 is 't58', then NT25 would produce 't58' and NT31.\n\nNT31, looking at the grammar, has a production: NT31 -> 't117'. So, NT31 would produce 't117'.\n\nSo, when NT1 is expanded, we get 't58' followed by 't117'.\n\nNow, let's look at NT50. From the grammar, NT50 can produce 't4' or the production NT50 -> NT15 NT50. Wait, so if NT50 is 't4', then NT1 -> NT25 NT17 would expand to 't58 t117' and then NT50 being 't4' would give 't58 t117 t4', which is 't58 t117 t4', but the target is 't69 t102 t102', which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT50 is not a terminal. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT50 -> NT15 NT50. So, that's a left-recursive production. So, NT50 would produce something else.\n\nBut our target string has 't102 t102'. So, maybe the second option is better: S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nSo, S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nNT50 -> 't4'?

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most productions seem to follow this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT1 or another NT. Each of these NT's should further break down into smaller components.\n\nThe string I'm given is `t120 t117 t24 t76`. Each token (like t120) is a terminal, so in the derivation, each of these should appear at the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nLet me start by analyzing each terminal in the string:\n\n1. t120: I need to find which rule produces t120. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13 and NT13 \u2192 NT43 NT26, NT26 \u2192 NT50 NT48, etc. Wait, but some productions directly produce t120? Let me check: actually, in the grammar, NT32 is defined as NT15 NT13, but looking for where t120 comes from, I think I might have missed it. Wait, perhaps it's generated by NT32 \u2192 something that eventually becomes a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at NT32's production: NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13. NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15. Hmm, but that leads to a loop because NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17, which then goes to NT7 \u2192 t93. Wait, but NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13. Let me check NT15 and NT13.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for rules that produce t120 directly. I think in the grammar, NT22 \u2192 NT25 NT14 and NT46. Wait no, looking at the rules, every production seems to go deeper. I think perhaps t120 is produced by NT6, because NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6. But that's a left recursion, which might not be the case here. Alternatively, NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13, which might ultimately lead to t120.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to build the string step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think about what each production can generate. Since the string is four terminals, we need a derivation that produces these four in order.\n\nLet me try to see if each terminal can appear in order. \n\nLooking at t120: Does any rule directly produce t120? Or, more likely, it's produced by a non-terminal, which in turn has rules leading to it.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13. Then, NT13 \u2192 NT43 NT26. NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3, but NT8 might not lead to anything. Alternatively, NT13 \u2192 NT24 NT0. Hmm, NT24 can produce t29 or t62 or maybe t122. Let me check NT24's productions: NT24 \u2192 NT40 NT17, but I think NT24 as a non-terminal can produce various things. Wait, looking again, I see that NT24 \u2192 't62' directly. So, if NT24 \u2192 t62, then NT24 can directly produce t62, which is t62 in the string. So, wait, but our string has t24, which is lower case 't' 24. Hmm, but in the grammar, some NTs have terminals like t8, t17, etc. So, maybe NT24 is such a case.\n\nWait, hold on. In the grammar, some NTs have direct terminal productions, but looking here, in the provided rules, I don't see a rule where NT24 directly produces a terminal. Instead, for example, NT24 \u2192 t62 (from the rule NT24 -> 't62'). So, NT24 can directly generate t62. Similarly, NT33 \u2192 t79, etc.\n\nLooking at the string `t120 t117 t24 t76`, I need to see how each of these can be produced.\n\nLet's start with t120. So, we need a rule that produces t120 as a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, does any of the NTs directly produce t120? Looking through, I don't see a rule where t120 is a terminal. So t120 must be produced by a non-terminal that ultimately leads to t120 through a chain.\n\nLooking at possible NTs that could produce t120: perhaps NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13. Let's trace:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13\n\nNT15 can produce NT56 (which leads to t7, and t21?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, NT13 \u2192 NT24 NT0. So:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13 \u2192 (some derivation) \u2192 t120.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for which NTs ultimately produce the given terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t120 is produced by NT32. Let me check NT32's production: NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13. Then, NT15's productions: NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15 (left recursive, which might not be productive unless it terminates somewhere else). Alternatively, NT15 \u2192 NT20 NT34.\n\nWait, NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17, which leads to NT17 \u2192 't94' or NT17 can produce other things. Similarly, NT34 \u2192 NT36 NT32, which loops back to itself if not terminated.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should start from the string and work backward, seeing which NT rules can produce these terminals.\n\nThe string is t120 t117 t24 t76.\n\nLet's consider each symbol:\n\n1. t120: Must come from an NT that eventually leads to it.\n2. t117: Similarly.\n3. t24: Perhaps NT24, which can produce t62 or t122, but looking at the grammar, I think NT24 can produce T62. Wait, no, the rule is NT24 \u2192 't62' directly, right?\n4. t76: From the grammar, NT28 \u2192 t76. Because looking at the rule NT28 \u2192 't76' directly. So t76 is a direct terminal.\n\nWait, that's a key point. NT28 \u2192 t76. So the last symbol in the string is t76, which is directly produced by NT28 (rule 8: S \u2192 NT28 is involved, but also NT28 directly produces t76 via another rule). Wait, no, looking back at the initial grammar lines, I see:\n\nLooking at the end of the provided grammar:\n\nNT28 -> 't76'\n\nYes, so NT28 can directly produce t76. So that's a direct terminal.\n\nSo, t76 is directly produced by NT28.\n\nMoving backward, the string is four terminals, so the derivation tree must expand S into four non-terminals generating each of these symbols.\n\nSo, the last step would be from S \u2192 NT1 NT28, so S expands into two non-terminals, NT1 and NT28. Since the string has four symbols, NT28 must generate two symbols, while NT1 must generate the first two.\n\nWait, that's assuming that NT28 can generate two symbols. Let's check NT28's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT28 has multiple rules, including NT28 \u2192 't76'. That's a direct production. But there might be other rules for NT28, like:\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's not clear if NT28 also has another production, but from the initial lines, it seems that the first rule for NT28 is S \u2192 NT28 which is S expands into NT28. However, in the given grammar, after the initial list, I see:\n\nNT28 -> 't76' as a rule.\n\nSo, NT28 can directly produce 't76', and that's it. Then, in the string, the last symbol is t76, so that's okay.\n\nBut for the preceding symbols, the string is t120 t117 t24.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe string is t120 t117 t24 t76.\n\nSo, after NT28 generates t76, the rest (t120 t117 t24) must come from NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-58","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string `t84 t3 t93 t119` can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It's quite extensive with multiple productions, all either starting with NT or the start symbol S. The right-hand sides of these productions are either terminal symbols ('t' followed by a number) or other non-terminals combined with 'and's. But wait, in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, most of them are of the form NT -> NT1 NT2, which fits CNF because each production has two non-terminals on the right side and no terminals. However, some productions have 't' followed by a number, which are terminals. That means the grammar allows for terminals in the right-hand sides, but in standard Chomsky normal form, all productions have non-terminals. Maybe the grammar provided includes both, which is okay as long as it's in modified Chomsky normal form, which allows terminals in the right-hand sides. So I think the grammar is in CNF because all productions are of length two.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t84 t3 t93 t119`. Each token is a terminal. The question is whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try to see how the string could be broken down. Each 't' is a terminal, so each has to be matched exactly by a production that assigns that terminal. Let's look at the productions that result in terminals. For example, NT46 -> 't8', NT17 -> 't94', etc. Each terminal is associated with specific non-terminals that produce it.\n\nSo, the string has four terms: t84, t3, t93, t119. Let's see where each of these can come from.\n\nLooking at the productions, 't8' comes from NT46, 't94' from NT17, 't93' from NT15, and 't119' from NT47.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, we need a derivation that ends in these four terminals in this order.\n\nLet me visualize the process. Starting from S, each step applies a production, eventually producing the string with all terminals. So, starting from S:\n\nS can produce N1 N2, where N1 and N2 are non-terminals. Let's say we pick the first production: S -> NT1 NT28.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to work backward from the string, trying to see if each terminal can be produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the reverse process:\n\nt119 is produced by NT47, which is NT17 (since NT47 -> 't3')... Wait, no, wait the productions for NT47 are two: NT47 -> 't3' and NT47 -> 't114', and another NT47 -> 't40' and NT47 -> 't41'. Wait, looking back, the grammar has NT47 -> 't3', NT47 -> 't114', etc.\n\nWait, the production NT47 is defined as:\n\nNT47 -> 't3'\nNT47 -> 't114'\nNT47 -> 't40'\nNT47 -> 't41'\n\nWait, the last line I see is NT47 -> 't41'? Let me check: Oh, no, in the last entries, I see NT47 is 't3', 't114', etc. Wait, maybe I transcribed it wrong. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar entries are:\n\nNT37 -> 't17'\nNT46 -> 't8'\nNT27 -> 't58'\n...\n\nAt the end, I see:\n\nNT47 -> 't3'\nNT17 -> 't94'\nNT27 -> 't124'\nNT24 -> 't29'\nNT22 -> 't58'\nNT10 -> 't2'\n\nThen later:\n\nNT46 -> 't27'\nNT17 -> 't94'\nNT42 -> 't2'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct myself. The end of the grammar is:\n\n... (a bunch of entries)\n\nThen, towards the end:\n\nNT47 -> 't3'\n\nSo NT47 produces 't3' in one case and other combinations. So t119 doesn't seem directly produced, but perhaps later in the chain.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the last term is t119. Let me see if any NT produces t119.

So that's good.\n\nNow, so t119 comes from NT6, so in the string, the last term is t119, which is produced by NT6.\n\nSo in the right-hand side, the NT must be NT6. So, working backward, the string is [t84, t3, t93, t119], so the last token is t119, which comes from NT6. So, the string up to t119 must come from a production that includes NT6.\n\nBut looking at how the string is built, each step in the derivation builds the string from left to right. So, in the reverse approach, the string is derived by choosing the last production that generates t119, which is NT6. So, the symbol before NT6 must produce t93 followed by t3, which comes from the NT before NT6.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has the structure where each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That makes parsing easier, although I might not need a full parser here since the string is short.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar uses non-terminals NT followed by numbers, and some terminals 't' followed by numbers. The string has these terminals, so the grammar must be able to produce them. Let me see how these terminals can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT41 -> NT42 NT35\n- NT34 -> NT36 NT32\n- NT47 -> NT40 NT36\n- NT21 -> NT37 NT20\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT41 -> NT56 NT49\n- NT35 -> NT53 NT55\n- NT46 -> NT25 NT13\n- NT17 -> 't94'\n\nWait, I see some rules that produce terminals like 't84', 't1', 't112', etc. Let me jot down the rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT46 -> 't8'\n- NT17 -> 't94'\n- NT27 -> 't58'\n- NT45 -> 't29'\n- NT37 -> 't17'\n- NT19 -> 't126'\n- NT24 -> 't62'\n- NT22 -> 't58'\n- NT10 -> 't2'\n- NT38 -> 't102'\n- NT33 -> 't79'\n- NT44 -> 't114'\n- NT32 -> 't66'\n- NT36 -> 't87'\n- NT44 -> 't89'\n- NT4 -> 't91'\n\nHmm, there's 't84' in the string. Let me check where 't84' comes from. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT54 -> NT53\n- NT35 -> NT45\n- NT28 -> NT8 NT8\n\nWait, none of these directly produce 't84'. Let me think if there's a rule that ends with 't84'. Looking again, I don't see any production for 't84' directly. However, the start symbol is S, which is NT1 NT28.\n\nSo, the start string is S = NT1 NT28. Now, what do NT1 and NT28 produce?\n\nLooking at NT1's rules:\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT1 -> NT47\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Looking back, the initial provided grammar has multiple rules for NT1. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar:\n\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT1 -> NT47\n\nAh, okay, so NT1 can go to NT25 NT17 or NT47.\n\nNow, NT25 is another non-terminal. Looking at NT25's rules:\n\n- NT25 -> NT6 NT31\n\nSo NT25 becomes NT6 and NT31.\n\nLooking at NT6:\n\n- NT6 -> NT54 NT6\n- NT6 -> 't58'\n\nWait, so NT6 can produce 't58' directly. So that's good.\n\nBut let's get back to NT1. NT1 can go to NT47 or NT25 NT17.\n\nIf NT1 -> NT47, what does NT47 do?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT47 in the initial grammar provided. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT46 -> NT25 NT13\n- NT17 -> 't94'\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if there's a NT47 production. Looking again, I don't see NT47 in the initial rules, but in the later part, it says:\n\nNT46 -> NT43 NT13\nNT46 -> NT25 NT13\nNT39 -> NT49 NT24\nNT45 -> NT40 NT36\nAnd so on. So I don't see NT47 being defined, which suggests that perhaps NT1 can only go to NT47, which isn't defined, which might be a problem. Wait, did I misread? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial rules for NT1 are:\n\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT1 -> NT47\n\nWait, the initial provided grammar starts with:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT1 NT13\nS -> NT28\nWait, perhaps I need to double-check.

Maybe it's better to list all the NT productions and their corresponding terminals.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't126'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't107'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't124'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't97'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't14' or 't20'\n\nNT32 \u2192 't59'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't10' or other terminals\n\nWait, actually, the grammar is filled with a mix of NT productions and terminals, like NT35 can go to 't105', 't10', 't38', etc. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each NT can only produce one terminal symbol, so let's try to figure out what each NT produces.\n\nLooking at the grammar lines:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't1'\n\nThat's clear.\n\nNT10 \u2192 't2'\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNT14 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't124'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't97'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't14' or 't20'? Wait, NT29 has two productions: NT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24 and NT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39. So maybe it can produce different things, but looking at the terminals, NT29 also has productions leading to 't14' and 't20'? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, in NT29's productions, NT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24 leads to 't24' (since NT24 \u2192 't29'), but wait, NT20 is 't16' and NT24 is 't29', so NT29 as a production of NT20 and NT24 would produce 't16 t29'. But that's not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a confusion because the grammar shows both NT productions and terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 't79', but also other NT productions. So maybe, in the grammar, each NT can either produce a terminal or another NT, leading to multiple steps.\n\nBut the given string is \"t2 t1 t112 t87 t120\". Let's break it down into tokens: t2, t1, t112, t87, t120. So each token is a terminal.\n\nNow, starting with S \u2192 NT1 NT1 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t2. Let's check which NTs produce t2. From the grammar, NT10 and NT14 can produce t2? Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking through all NT productions:\n\nNT1: t1\n\nNT10: t2\n\nNT21: t1\n\nNT22: t58\n\nNT24: t29\n\nNT25: t107\n\nNT26: t48\n\nNT27: t124\n\nNT28: t97\n\nNT29: 't105'? Or does it have t14 and t20?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT35 can produce 't10', 't38', etc. But NT10 is 't2'. Similarly, NT30 is t6 NT48, but that's an NT, so not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT can only go to one terminal. Let's list all NTs that directly map to terminals:\n\nLooking at each NT production, some end with 'tX':\n\nNT1 \u2192 t1\n\nNT10 \u2192 t2\n\nNT17 \u2192 t94\n\nNT22 \u2192 t58\n\nNT24 \u2192 t29\n\nNT26 \u2192 t48\n\nNT27 \u2192 t124\n\nNT28 \u2192 t97\n\nNT35 \u2192 multiple 't's? Let's see: NT35 can go to 't105', 't10', 't38', etc. So NT35 can produce multiple terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is ambiguous because some NTs can produce multiple terminals. So for example, NT35 can produce t105 or t10 or t38.\n\nSo the string starts with t2. Let's see which NTs can produce t2. From the grammar, looking for NTs with t2:\n\nNT10 \u2192 t2\n\nSo the first part is NT10, which would be symbol A.\n\nThen the second token is t1. Looking for NTs that produce t1:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t1\n\nSo next token is t1, which comes from NT1.\n\nSo the first part of the string is generated by S \u2192 NT10 NT1. But wait, S can produce NT1 NT1 as well. So let me see.\n\nIf the first two tokens are t2 t1, that could be NT10 and NT1, which is the production S \u2192 NT10 NT1. But S could also be NT50 NT27, which would produce other terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t2 t1, so maybe following the first production S \u2192 NT10 NT1. Then the string continues with t112 t87 t120.\n\nWait, the grammar in CNF would have each production as a binary split. But each NT is an intermediate symbol that can be further expanded. So we need to see if after producing t2 t1, the next tokens can be produced by the remaining NTs.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string is t2 t1 t112 t87 t120, which is five tokens. So in terms of NTs, it's five NTs. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT1 NT1 would produce 2 NTs, each which needs to expand into their own tokens, so the entire string would need to be generated by a series of productions starting from S, expanding and expanding each NT until you get the tokens.\n\nBut perhaps I should think in terms of the entire string as the concatenation of the right-hand sides of the grammar productions. So each step involves expanding an NT into another pair of NTs or into a terminal.\n\nSo, starting from S, the first step is to split into two NTs. The string is five tokens, so the expansions must produce five NTs, which then expand into terminals.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can trace the string back to S.\n\nLet me try to see the structure.\n\nThe string is: t2 t1 t112 t87 t120.\n\nI think I should parse the string in reverse to see if it can be derived from S.\n\nSo, last token is t120. Looking which NTs can produce t120.\n\nLooking at the NT productions, which NT can produce t120.\n\nLooking through the grammar, if any NT production includes 't120'.\n\nLooking for NT productions that result in 't120', let's see: NT38 \u2192 't102', NT39 \u2192 't131', NT120 might not be present. Wait, from the given grammar, there's 't102', 't123', 't15', etc., but I don't see 't120' directly.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking at NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-97","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string `t4 t131 t123 t135 t123` can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by carefully analyzing the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to understand how the string is structured. The grammar has several production rules, each combining two non-terminals to terminals or other non-terminals. My goal is to see if the string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S through these rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, there are two production rules:\n1. S -> NT1 NT1\n2. S -> NT50 NT27\n\nSo, the string must start with the combination of either NT1 and NT1 or NT50 and NT27. Let's consider the given string `t4 t131 t123 t135 t123`. It's a sequence of 5 tokens, each starting with 't'. I need to map these tokens back to the grammar to see how they could be generated.\n\nI notice that some of the 't' tokens in the grammar are terminal symbols and have specific values. For example, NT46 can generate 't8', NT3 \u2192 't42', NT23 \u2192 't114', and so on. I'll need to trace back how each 't' in the string is produced.\n\nLet me try to match the string step by step. The string is five tokens long. The first token is 't4'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 't94' and NT27 \u2192 't17', but I need to find a non-terminal that can produce 't4'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT46 \u2192 't134', NT36 \u2192 't120', etc. Hmm, I don't immediately see a rule that produces 't4' directly. Wait, maybe it's derived from other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the 't4' is a result of a series of productions. Let me check each production rule to see if any non-terminal can produce 't4'.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't4' except possibly through a chain. However, I notice a rule: NT35 \u2192 't105', which is close to 't135' but not the same. Alternatively, NT37 \u2192 't17', but that's part of the string's sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me list all the terminals in the string: 't4', 't131', 't123', 't135', 't123'.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can map each 't' to their possible originating non-terminals.\n\n- 't4' can come from NT34 \u2192 't37', but that's not exact. Alternatively, NT17 \u2192 't94', which isn't 't4'. Hmm, maybe it's a derived value through other rules. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't4' is part of a larger production. Let me look at the rules where a non-terminal generates 't4' as part of a sequence.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules include NT35 \u2192 't105' and NT37 \u2192 't17', but not directly 't4'. Maybe 't4' is a result of multiple productions. Alternatively, perhaps the string has more steps than I initially thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with S via S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Let's see: NT50 and NT27. From the rules, NT50 \u2192 't4' and NT27 \u2192 't123'. Wait, that's exactly the first two tokens of the string! So 't4' followed by 't123' is produced by NT50 NT27.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT50 NT27, and NT50 generates 't4' and NT27 generates 't123', then the start sequence is 't4 t123'. That matches the beginning of the string.\n\nNow, the string is `t4 t131 t123 t135 t123`. So after 't4 t123', we have 't131', 't123', 't135', 't123'. Let's focus on the middle part.\n\nLet me break this down. The string after S \u2192 NT50 NT27 is 't4 t123', followed by other tokens. So, perhaps the second part of the string is a continuation of NT27 expanding into more non-terminals.\n\nWait, NT27 is derived from S as S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So, the initial production is S \u2192 NT50 NT27, which gives 't4 t123'. Now, where does 't131 t123 t135 t123' come from? These must be the expansions of some non-terminals that NT27 could generate.\n\nLooking at NT27's production rules, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT47 NT28\n- NT27 \u2192 't123'\n\nSo, NT27 can either produce 't123' (a terminal) or split into NT47 and NT28. Let's see, if NT27 is split into NT47 and NT28, each of which can generate further tokens.\n\nLet me explore that possibility:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't114' or NT47 \u2192 NT50 NT13.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT47 can produce 't114' as a terminal, or split into NT50 and NT13.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 can be split into NT8 NT8 (from NT27 \u2192 NT47 NT28, but perhaps I'm mixing up the rules.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT27 has two rules: NT27 \u2192 NT47 NT28 and NT27 \u2192 't123'. So, the string after the initial 't4 t123' could be the expansion of NT27. Let's explore NT27.\n\nIf NT27 is split into NT47 and NT28, then we have NT47 NT28. Let's see what each can produce.\n\nNT47's rule is: NT47 \u2192 't114' or NT50 NT13.\n\nNT28's rules are: NT28 \u2192 NT8 NT8, NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6, NT28 \u2192 't97', etc. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 and NT28 \u2192 't97'. Also, NT44 \u2192 't114' and NT24 \u2192 't29'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to map each token to possible non-terminals.\n\nLet's take 't131'. Looking through the rules, I see NT35 \u2192 't105', NT17 \u2192 't94', NT14 \u2192 't79', NT25 \u2192 't107', etc. Wait, no rule directly produces 't131'. That seems problematic. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the tokens are not in the form of the rightmost derivations but need to be combined step by step. Alternatively, perhaps the string is generated through a series of expansions beyond S.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Let's look at the entire string `t4 t131 t123 t135 t123` and see if each can be matched by some non-terminal.\n\n- 't4' comes from NT50 or NT17, but NT50 directly produces 't4' according to the rules (NT50 \u2192 't4').\n\n- 't131' could come from NT35 or NT33, etc. Looking through the rules, I see NT31 \u2192 't117' and NT46 \u2192 't134'. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for example, NT35 \u2192 't105', but I need 't131'. Maybe the derivation is deeper, and 't131' comes from a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't directly generated by S but by further expansions. Let me try to see if the string can be generated through the given rules.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the entire string structure and see if it matches a possible path through the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see each token in the string and map them to their possible sources.\n\n1. 't4' \u2192 NT50 (NT50 \u2192 't4').\n\n2. 't131' \u2192 Let me look for rules that produce 't131'.

The string is `t78 t17 t123 t36 t48 t119`. Hmm, first thing I notice is that the grammar is pretty long, but I don't have to parse it completely. I just need to see if the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince it's in CNF, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string has six tokens, so the derivation path should correspond to that. Let me think about how the derivation would work step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't78', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals produce 't' strings. Let's check where 't78' could come from. Scanning through the productions, I see several 't8' rules like NT46 -> 't8', NT3 -> 't69', etc. So it's possible that some non-terminal A produces 't8'.\n\nBut wait, 't78' is specific. Let's check if any non-terminal directly produces 't78'. Looking at all the 't' productions, I don't see any 't78's directly. Hmm, maybe it's created through a chain of productions. Since 't78' isn't a terminal itself, it must be generated by a series of steps from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S. Let me look at the productions for S. S can go to NT1 NT17 or NT50 NT27. So the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT1 NT17 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nLet me pick the first option: S \u2192 NT1 NT17.\n\nNow, I need to see if NT1 and NT17 can generate any token. Let's see what NT1 can produce. Looking through, I see NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. So NT1 becomes NT25 and NT17.\n\nThen, NT17: according to the grammar, it can go to NT44 NT53 or NT24 NT0 or NT21 NT15 or NT4 \u2192 something else? Wait, looking back, the NT17 production is:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53 or NT24 NT0 or NT21 NT15 or NTsomething else? Wait, let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT17: It has a couple of rules. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, I see NT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53, NT24 NT0, NT21 NT15, and a couple others. Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT17 being a terminal because all are non-terminals or more rules. So I need to see what NT17 can produce.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT17 has:\n\nNT17 -> NT44 NT53\n\nNT24 -> NT11 NT1\n\nBut let me check NT17. Wait, checking the given productions:\n\n- NT17: NT44 NT53, NT24 NT0, NT21 NT15, etc.\n\nSo NT17 must expand into other non-terminals until it hits a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step, looking at what produces 't78' and working backwards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see that each token in the string corresponds to a production. Since it's six tokens, the derivation tree has a leftmost path of six steps. But since the grammar is in CNF, each step can only have two non-terminals at each level.\n\nWait, but the string is six tokens, so the derivation would have to involve six steps of expanding frontiers, possibly with multiple branches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the starting symbols and see if each token can be derived in sequence.\n\nWait, the string is t78 t17 t123 t36 t48 t119. Let's list them as positions 1 to 6.\n\nSo position 1: t78.\n\nPosition 2: t17.\n\nPosition 3: t123.\n\nPosition 4: t36.\n\nPosition 5: t48.\n\nPosition 6: t119.\n\nI need to see if each of these can be the result of terminal productions in a leftmost derivation.\n\nLooking at position 1: t78. As previously observed, there's no direct production for 't78'. So maybe it's created through a chain, like A \u2192 a, where A is built up by expansions.\n\nWait, but let's think about t36. Looking for 't36' in the grammar, I see that NT6 \u2192 't58', not helpful. Wait, perhaps it's in another NT. Looking back, NT36 -> NT56 NT10, and other productions. Wait, the production NT36 can lead to NT56 and NT10, but maybe NT56 is a non-terminal that can produce a 't' string.\n\nLooking at NT56: NT56 \u2192 't112' or other non-terminals. Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17.\n\nAnd NT20 has several options. Looking at NT56, it's not directly a terminal.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps each of these terminals is produced by a specific NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, I notice some NT's generate specific 't' strings:\n\nNT46 -> 't3'\n\nNT46 -> 't29' (from some other production?), but looking at the given productions:\n\nWait, in the last set of rules, I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't8'\n\nNT46 -> 't27'\n\nWait, in the list provided towards the end, I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't87'\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking through the later parts of the grammar:\n\n- NT56 -> 't112'\n\n- NT47 -> 't3'\n\n- NT1 -> 't69'\n\n- NT41 -> 't52'\n\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n\n- NT54 -> 't53'\n\n- NT14 -> 't79'\n\n- NT26 -> 't48'\n\n- NT13 -> 't16'\n\n- NT55 -> 't45'\n\n- NT9 -> 't19'\n\n- NT29 -> 't48'\n\n- NT28 -> 't76'\n\n- NT41 -> 't4'\n\n- NT32 -> 't66'\n\n- NT10 -> 't50'\n\n- NT34 -> 't37'\n\n- NT47 -> 't40'\n\n- NT21 -> 't3'\n\n- NT36 -> 't87'\n\n- NT6 -> 't58'\n\n- NT47 -> 't41'\n\n- NT50 -> 't4'\n\n- NT15 -> 't48'\n\n- NT29 -> 't14'\n\n- NT6 -> 't21'\n\n- NT49 -> 't109'\n\n- NT33 -> 't79'\n\n- NT36 -> 't120'\n\n- NT38 -> 't102'\n\n- NT39 -> 't131'\n\n- NT14 -> 't58'\n\nHmm, perhaps 't78' is produced by NT1 or NT31.\n\nWait, looking at the early part of the grammar after NT7:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't93' and 't97'\n\nSo NT7 can produce 't93' or 't97', but that doesn't help with 't78'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NTs that produce 't78':\n\nChecking all rules, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't93' and 't97'\n\nBut no NT produces 't78'.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So if the string starts with 't78', and there's no non-terminal directly producing it, perhaps it's impossible.\n\nWait, I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, in the rules provided after NT6:\n\nNT6 -> 't120'\n\nHmm, maybe another path.\n\nWait, maybe it's through a longer chain.\n\nFor example, NT1 could produce NT25 and NT17, and then NT17 could produce NT24 and NT0, and so on.\n\nBut without a direct way to get 't78', it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Perhaps some 't' strings are generated via multiple steps.\n\nLooking again, I see that NT46 can produce 't8' and 't27'. Also, NT17 can produce 't24' and 't0' (as per earlier). Wait, perhaps 't24' can be generated by more rules.\n\nWait, let me try another approach.

Chomsky normal form means each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar uses a mix of NT (non-terminal) and terminal (t) symbols, but looking at the productions, it seems each NT is a variable, and the terminals at the bottom are 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT7 -> 't93' means the non-terminal NT7 can produce the terminal 't93'.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of these terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. Starting with S, I need to see if I can produce this string using the productions provided.\n\nThe string is: t38 t111 t52 t42 t134 t42 t66.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Starting with S (from S->NT1 NT28 or S->NT50 NT27). I'll need to choose one of these productions and see if I can derive the string.\n\nLet me pick S->NT1 NT28 first.\n\nSo, S = NT1 NT28. Now, I need to see how each part can derive their respective parts of the string.\n\nFirst, looking at NT1: from the grammar, NT1 has a production NT1 -> NT25 NT17. So NT1 can become NT25 NT17.\n\nLooking at NT25: it has a production NT25 -> NT6 NT31.\n\nLooking at NT6: production NT6->NT54 NT6. That's a loop, but let's see if NT54 leads somewhere.\n\nNT54: NT54->NT14 NT6. NT14 is a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT14: NT14->NT79, which is a terminal. So NT14->t79.\n\nWait, in the string, we have t38, which isn't in the outputs so far. Maybe this branch isn't leading to t38. Alternatively, perhaps I need a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the other production for S, S->NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at NT50: NT50->NT4 NT34.\n\nNT4: NT4->NT21 NT15.\n\nLooking at NT21: NT21->NT37 NT20.\n\nNT37->NT7 NT33. But 73t is a terminal, but in the string, we have t38, so perhaps this path isn't leading to t38.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider NT1 NT28.\n\nWait, NT28: NT28->NT4 NT6. So NT28 can produce NT4 and NT6.\n\nNT4 is NT4->NT21 NT15.\n\nNT21: NT21->NT37 NT20.\n\nNT37->NT7 NT33. NT33->NT7 NT36. Wait, maybe I should look for another path.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me approach this differently. The string is length 7, each part is a terminal. Each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal.\n\nEach step in the derivation increases the number of symbols, but since terminals are leaves, I need to ensure that each terminal in the string is correctly derived.\n\nEach production is a binary split, so the string must correspond to a parse tree where each node is a production.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is t38. So somewhere in the leftmost derivation, there must be a production that leads to t38.\n\nLet's look for productions that result in t38.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT34->t38. Specifically, NT34's production NT34->NT44 NT38 includes NT38 as a terminal. So NT34 can produce NT44 and NT38, and one of its paths could lead to t38.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part is derived from NT34. Let's try to see how that could work.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t38, so it must come from a production that directly results in t38. However, looking through the grammar, only NT38 has a production NT38->t102 or possibly NT34->... including NT38.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT34-> t38 NT2 (but in the code, looking up, it's more like NT34->NT44 NT38, but perhaps I misread).\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the lines say:\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT6\n\nNT34 -> NT36 NT32\n\nNT34-> NT44 NT38\n\nYes, so NT34 can derive into NT44 and NT38. So for the first symbol t38, perhaps we can take the production NT38 (but isn't NT38 a terminal, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, checking the grammar lines, I see:\n\nLine: NT34 -> NT44 NT38 (so this is part of NT34's productions, but not directly a terminal. The terminals seem to be in lines like:\n\nLine: NT35 -> 't105'\n\nLine: NT7 -> 't93'\n\nSo, 't' symbols are terminals, and NT productions involve other NTs.\n\nSo, perhaps the first symbol t38 comes from NT38, but in the grammar, I need to check if NT38 is a terminal or an NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines where NT34-> ... and so on. The NT38 line is: NT34-> NT44 NT38. So NT38 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. Therefore, t38 must be derived from NT38 via a production that makes NT38 produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only NT38 is in NT34's production, but not in others. So how does NT38 derive to t38? Wait, I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar again, perhaps I have an NT38 somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me look for 't38' as a terminal. The user provided a line: NT34 -> NT44 NT38. So that's part of NT34, not NT38.\n\nWait, maybe elsewhere, is there a NT38 that's a terminal? Looking through the provided grammar lines, I don't see an NT38 that's a terminal. The closest is NT35 -> 't105', but that's NT35.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look further. The line NT34-> 't38' is not present, but perhaps another line like:\n\nWait, in the provided code, I see:\n\nLines like NT38-> 't123', but not NT38->t38.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that t38 is a result of a production from NT38.\n\nWait, perhaps in another part. Let me check.\n\nLooking for 't38' in the given grammar:\n\nI see:\n\n- Line NT38->t102\n\n- Line NT39->t131\n\n- Line NT37->t17\n\n- Etc.\n\nWait, so NT38->t102, and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first part is t38, so how can that happen?\n\nSo for the first symbol t38 in the string, it must be produced by an NT that has a production NT38->'t38'. But looking at the grammar, I don't see an NT38 that leads to t38. Wait:\n\nWait, reviewing the lines:\n\nLine: NT34-> NT44 NT38. So that's NT34 producing NT44 and NT38. But if NT38 can produce a terminal, then t38 is a result.\n\nWait, no, NT38's production is only in one line: NT38->t102, which is another symbol. So how can I get t38?\n\nWait, perhaps in the derivation, we can have a chain where NT34 is split into NT44 and NT38, with NT38 eventually leading to t38, but that's not present in the grammar as per the given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the production. Let me re-examine the lines carefully.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar lines:\n\nLooking for any NT38, I see lines:\n\n- Line 446->NT38\n\nAnd specifically:\n\nNT35 -> 't105'\n\nNT34->NT44 NT38\n\nNT38->t102\n\nNT37->t17\n\nWait, so NT38 has"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a CFG, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A is a terminal. Wait, but looking at the given grammar, some of the productions have terminals on the right-hand side, like NT46 \u2192 't8', NT35 \u2192 't105', etc. Oh, right, those are terminal productions. So the grammar can generate terminal strings, which is what we're looking at here.\n\nThe string we have is a sequence of terminals: t5, t29, t21, t36, t16, t93, t119. So we need to see if this string can be derived by starting with the start symbol S and applying the productions step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which can go to NT1 NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. Hmm, but looking at the productions, the start symbol S seems to be split into two non-terminals, but in the string, we have seven t's, which suggests that each t must correspond to a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nLet me see the terminal productions (looking for 't' followed by numbers). For example, NT46 \u2192 't8', so each 't' could represent a specific non-terminal that has a terminal production.\n\nI think the approach here is to match the string backwards. So starting from the last symbol and working our way back to S. This is sometimes called reverse engineering the parse tree.\n\nLet's list the tokens in reverse order: t119, t93, t16, t36, t21, t29, t5.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions, do any non-terminals produce 't119'? Let me check the list. I see that NT46 \u2192 't8', but wait, I don't see a production for 't119'. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar, I don't see any 't119' directly. Hmm, that's a problem because if the string contains t119, but in the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces t119. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see that NT35 \u2192 't105', NT39 \u2192 't131', NT47 \u2192 't40', etc. But I don't see 't119' being produced. That's odd. So if the string has a 't119', but the grammar doesn't have a production for that, that would immediately mean the string is not in the language, right?\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the user provided all the productions as part of the answer, so maybe I missed 't119' in the productions. Let me go through them again.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't8'\n- NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- NT47 \u2192 't3'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- NT6 \u2192 't54' (but wait, earlier wasNT6 \u2192 't54'? Or was that NT46 \u2192 't58'?) Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking through, NT6 has a production: NT6 \u2192 't58'. So 't58' is acceptable, but 't119' isn't mentioned anywhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in scanning. Let me check every production where RHS is a terminal.\n\nHere's a list:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't8'\n- NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- NT47 \u2192 't3'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- NT6 \u2192 't58' (from NT6's production)\n- NT46 \u2192 't112'?

But since it's a sequence, I should look for a production that breaks down into these tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S starts with either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So, the first two parts of the string, t107 and t89, might be connected to S.\n\nWait, but S produces NT1 NT28, which are non-terminals. Then each NT is further broken down. Let me see what these NTs resolve to.\n\nLet me map each token to its possible non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT46 -> t8, so t8 is a terminal. But our string has t107, which I don't see being directly resolved. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check the productions again. For example, NT6 -> t54 NT6, which is recursive. So maybe t6 is not a terminal but part of a chain leading to a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NTs like NT6 are defined as terminal to itself and a terminal elsewhere. Let me check if t6 is ever produced as a terminal. Looking through the productions, I see NT6 -> t54 NT6, which implies that NT6 can produce a t54 followed by itself, making it a non-terminal rather than a terminal.\n\nSo, t6 isn't a terminal but part of a chain. Therefore, t6 would be resolved into something else, but in our string, we have t107, which is a terminal. How is t107 produced?\n\nLooking back, I see NT47 -> t114. Hmm, but that's not t107. Wait, NT53 can produce some terminals. Looking at NT53, I see two productions: NT53 -> NT29 NT3, and NT53 -> NT49 NT54. But in the provided grammar, NT53 doesn't directly produce t107. Wait, maybe I need to follow the productions deeper.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT35 -> t102. And looking at the rules, NT35 is produced by several non-terminals, but none directly to t107. Hmm, perhaps t107 is a result of a chain of non-terminals leading to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the t107 comes from NT16, but looking at NT16: NT16 -> NT10 NT34. Neither of these resolve to t107. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if any production directly ends with t107. Looking through all the productions, I see NT14 -> t79, NT27 -> t124, NT26 -> t98, etc. I don't see any production that directly results in t107. So maybe t107 needs to be part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, but if a non-terminal can eventually produce a terminal, then perhaps t107 is reachable through a chain. Let's see NT6: NT6 -> t54 NT6. So NT6 eventually can produce t54 followed by more NT6s, but that would make it an infinite loop, which isn't helpful. So perhaps t6 can't produce a terminal, but maybe somewhere down the line, a non-terminal like NT15 can produce t58, which is t6, which is part of a chain that might resolve to other terminals.\n\nBut this seems a bit tangled. Alternatively, maybe the string is trying to represent a certain sequence of productions. Let me try to parse the string from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t107. If that's part of a production, maybe it's the result of some NT. Let me check the productions again. Oh, looking at the rules, I see NT47 -> t114 and NT53 -> NT54 NT47. Hmm, but none of these result in t107.\n\nWait, maybe t107 comes from NT37, but NT37 -> t94. No, that's T94. Alternatively, NT38 -> t102, as I saw earlier. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps t107 comes from NT17: NT17 -> t94. But no. Alternatively, NT29 can produce t48, which is t19. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t107 comes from NT27, which has a production \u2192 t124. No, that's T124.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me consider the entire string as the result of a derivation starting from S. So the string is a sequence of terminals, which must be generated step by step by S's productions.\n\nLet me try to see the structure. The string has 8 tokens, so maybe it's a derivation of a certain length. Let me think about the starting symbol S, which can split into two non-terminals. Either S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT1 NT28, then each of those can split further. NT1 can be \u2192 NT25 NT17, and NT28 can be \u2192 NT8 NT8. Wait, NT28 -> NT8 NT8. So each NT28 becomes two NT8s.\n\nThen, looking at NT8: there's a rule NT8 -> t2. So each NT8 would produce t2. So if S \u2192 NT1 NT28, then the production would be NT1 NT28 -> NT25 NT17 NT8 NT8.\n\nThen, NT25 -> NT6 NT31, so NT25 is NT6 NT31. NT6 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal?\n\nWait, NT6 seems to be defined as NT6 -> t54 NT6, which is NT6 -> t54 followed by NT6. So NT6 can't directly produce a terminal; it's recursive. So unless there's a way for NT6 to eventually produce a terminal, but looking through the rules, I don't see any path from NT6 that results in a terminal without recursion. So NT6 would never terminate, meaning it can't produce a terminal. Therefore, any production involving NT6 would result in an infinite loop, which can't happen in a valid derivation.\n\nWait, but in our string, we have t54, for example, in NT36: NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10. Wait, but NT36 is \u2192 NT56 NT10. If NT56 can produce t53, then NT36 could lead to some terminals. Hmm, NT56 \u2192 t53 and NT10 \u2192 t2. So NT56 NT10 would be t53 and t2, so that production would produce t53 t2.\n\nBut in our string, we have t107, which is present in the second position. Maybe I'm going down a different path. Perhaps it's better to consider the entire string and see if it can be broken down into valid productions.\n\nLet me try to see if the given string can be produced by any sequence of productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t107 t89 t69 t4 t11 t42 t41 t97.\n\nFirst, let's see if these terminals can be connected via the grammar. Let's try from the end.\n\nThe last token is t97, which from the grammar, I see NT77 is involved in some productions, but looking at the rules, NT97 is produced by some NT? Wait, checking the rules, I see that NT29->t97 is not present, but looking at the string, t97 is the last token.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see that NT35 -> t93, but that's T93, not T97. Similarly, NT37 -> t17, which is T17. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find which NTs can eventually produce T97. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces T97. So maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe it's reached via another path.\n\nWait, perhaps T97 is part of a production chain. Let me check NTs that produce T41 or T42, as they are in the string.\n\nLooking at NT42, production is NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-133","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string \"t38 t53 t122 t58 t36 t53 t36 t87\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it seems it's a set of production rules where the start symbol S can produce combinations of other symbols, ultimately leading to terminal symbols (those in lowercase, like 't') and others. The goal is to see if the string can be derived by applying these rules step by step.\n\nThe string consists of the following terminals: t38, t53, t122, t58, t36, t53, t36, t87.\n\nI notice that some of these terminals, like t53, t58, t36, t87, appear multiple times. Also, other symbols like NT1, NT3, etc., are present in the grammar, which are non-terminals.\n\nI think I should try to parse the string into the possible non-terminal symbols that could generate each part. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, the initial symbol is S->NT1 NT28 or S->NT50 NT27. So the string must start with something that can derive from either of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first term is t38. But in the grammar, 't38' is a terminal. I need to see where 't38' comes from. Wait, according to the grammar, 't38' is only present in the production rules of some NT symbols. For example, NG44->t114, NG24->t122, etc. So 't38' must come from a production rule that has t38 as a result. Looking at the grammar, I see NG44->t114, NG24->t122, NG36->t120, NG38->t102, NG39->t131, NG38->t34, etc. Wait, no production rule directly gives 't38'. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I see:\n\n- NG28 -> NG4 NG6. Then NG6 can be NT6, which eventually leads to 't58' or others.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t38. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me recheck the grammar rules.\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NG44->t114, NG24->t122, NG36->t120, NG38->t102, NG39->t131, NG38->t34, NG47->t40, NG16->t2, etc. Oh, wait, I think I missed 't38' in the list. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production rules for 't38' are:\n\n- NG38 -> t34\n- NG38 -> t102\n\nWait, no, t38 isn't directly a terminal. So how does t38 appear in the string? That suggests that in the derivation, one of these production rules with t38 as a result must have been used. But looking at the given grammar, I don't see any rules where t38 is directly produced. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. The user provided a long grammar with many production rules. Let me scan through to see if any non-terminal produces t38.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NG38: No, it only goes to t34 and t102.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Are the numbers part of the terminals? It seems so, as all entries like 't38' are terminals. So, if t38 is a terminal in the string, it must be generated by some rule that directly produces 't38'. But in the given grammar, I don't see any production rule that directly produces t38. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the rules. In the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for t38 as a terminal, I don't see any production that produces t38. So that would mean the string cannot be produced by the grammar because one of the initial symbols (t38) is not present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've overlooked something. Let me check through all the production rules to see if any directly produce t38.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- S: Produces NT1 and NT28. Then NT1 is split into NT3 and NT13. NT3 produces 't6' and NT13 produces 't16'. Neither of these yields t38.\n\nWait, maybe not. NT13 is 't16' according to the rule:\n\n- NT13 -> NT43 NT26\nWait, no, looking at the user's grammar, it's:\n\n- NT13 -> NT43 NT26\n- NT35 -> ...\n- Wait, here's a rule for NT26:\n\nIn the user's grammar, the relevant rule for NT26 is:\n\n- NT26 -> NT14 NT45\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting myself confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSince the string starts with t38, which is a terminal, we need to find a production rule that directly outputs t38. But in the given grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces t38.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the closest is NG38 -> t34 and NG38->t102. But 't38' itself doesn't appear as a direct production. So this suggests that the grammar doesn't produce the string because t38 is not present in any single-step production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Are all the non-terminals processed correctly? Or maybe the problem is that the initial symbols don't include t38.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the string is supposed to be a sequence of NTs that derive into t38. But in the given grammar, none of the non-terminals produce t38. So the string contains t38, which can't be derived from any of the grammar's rules. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to check is `t38 t109 t122 t17 t123 t102 t42 t48 t53`.\n\nFirst, I remember that to check if a string is in the language defined by a CFG, one common approach is to use the pumping lemma or to try to derive the string or build a parse tree. But with the size of the grammar and the string, manually trying to parse it might be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or key factors that can help me decide.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies the parsing a bit, but it also means that all productions are two symbols on the right side. However, in this grammar, some non-terminals have productions that result in terminals, which might complicate things.\n\nLooking at the given string: `t38 t109 t122 t17 t123 t102 t42 t48 t53`. All the terms end with 't', which suggests they're terminals.\n\nI recall that in a CNF grammar, any string in the language has a derivation where each step introduces exactly one terminal symbol, except for the initial steps where we expand non-terminals. Since all the terminals here are 't' followed by numbers, it's important to see if these can be derived from the given productions.\n\nLet me look through the productions to see if any of the terminals are directly produced by the start symbol S.\n\nFrom the grammar, S is expanded as:\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n- S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nNeither of these directly produce a terminal, so S must go through two non-terminals. Then each of those can be expanded further. For example, NT1 and NT28.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT1:\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n\nAnd NT28:\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n\nHmm. NT25 and NT4 and NT6 are non-terminals. Let's see where these can go.\n\nNT6 has a production: NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 | NT45 | NT47 | NT61 etc. Wait, looking through the productions, I notice that NT6 \u2192 't58' is one of the productions. Wait, looking again: the user might have made a typo because the provided productions for NT6 are several, like NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, etc., but looking further, I see that NT6 can expand to 't58' via NT29 \u2192 't29', and NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6', but also NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 't119'. Wait, no\u2014the user provided a list where some lines are like NT36 \u2192 't87', NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6', but there's also NT9 \u2192 't19'. Wait, in the initial list, there was a line `NT7 -> 't97'`, and others.\n\nWait, the productions for NT6 include a line that says NT6 \u2192 't58'? Let me check the list again. I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see these lines towards the end:\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\nWait, actually, scanning through the productions, there is a line: `NT26 -> NT48` but no direct 't58' for NT6. Wait, no, in the list, I see:\n\nWait, looking back, the user's list includes:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't8' line? Wait, actually, the list seems to be truncated. Let me check the entire list again.\n\nLooking at the productions, I can see lines like `NT46 -> 't8'` and others, but perhaps each line is a production for a non-terminal. So, for NT6, checking for any terminal productions: looking for any rule where NT6 goes to a terminal.\n\nLooking through, I see that NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 NT45. But that's still a non-terminal. Wait, perhaps some non-terminals can produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, for example, looking at NT7: no, wait, looking through:\n\nWait, NT14 \u2192 't79', but that's non-terminal NT14. Let me check for any non-terminal that directly produces a 't' token.\n\nLooking for any production of the form NTx \u2192 'tXXX':\n- I see NT29 \u2192 't29' (line: `NT29 -> 't102'`, no, wait, checking, there's `NT29 -> 't29'` and others, but perhaps I'm misremembering. Wait, in the provided list, there's a line `NT25 -> 't107'`? Wait, let me verify:\n\nLooking through the list again, I see lines like:\n- NT33 -> 't79'\n- NT15 -> 't48'\n- NT46 -> 't7'\n- And others. Wait, perhaps it's better to scan through the list methodically.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's list includes:\nFor NT29:\n- NT29 -> 't102' line? Or perhaps I should find any NT productions that result in 't'.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for 't' followed by numbers, like 't38', which is one of the terminals in our string.\n\nLooking through the grammar for any production where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal: looking for any line like NTn -> 't...'.\n\nIn the list, I see NT46-> 't8', NT7-> 't93', NT7-> 't97', NT46-> 't29', wait, let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT35-> 't105'\n- NT7 -> 't93'\n- NT7 -> 't97'\n- NT46-> 't8'\n- NT24-> 't120' but wait, in the list I see NT24 -> 't29' maybe?\n\nWait, looking for 't' followed by numbers and letters? Wait, the grammar seems to have many 't's followed by numbers.\n\nLooking through, I notice a line `NT35 -> 't105'`. So NT35 directly produces 't105'. Similarly, NT7 can produce 't93' and 't97'.\n\nAlso, looking for NT that directly produce terminals including the ones in our string:\n\nOur string is `t38, t109, t122, t17, t123, t102, t42, t48, t53`.\n\nSo looking at each 't' in the string and seeing if there's a production for that NT directly.\n\nt38: Does any non-terminal have a production to 't38'? Looking through the list, I don't see any production where NTn \u2192 't38' directly. So that's a problem because in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, except perhaps for the initial steps where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nWait, but in a strictly CNF, if a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, then that could be a step in the derivation. So, for example, if NT16 \u2192 't2', that would be a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT21 -> NT37 NT20\n- NT24-> 't29'\n- NT4-> 't91'\n- NT14->'t79'\n- NT17->'t63'\n- NT20->'t65'\n- NT10->'t2', etc.\n\nWait, for 't38', is there any NTn->'t38'? Scanning the list, I don't see any direct production. Hmm. So without a production for 't38' directly, how do we get 't38' into the string?\n\nWait, it's possible that 't38' is derived indirectly through a series of productions. Let's see how.\n\nLooking through the grammar, perhaps 't38' is the result of a chain of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, for example, perhaps NT38 can be derived into terminals. Wait, but looking through the productions, is there any NT that can produce 't38'? Or perhaps, is 't38' a result of a production where a non-terminal is expanded into a terminal and another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps we can look for where 't38' is the left-hand side or right-hand side of a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains 't38' and other 't's that are directly derived from their non-terminals. Let's consider each part of the string and see if it can be matched through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

The grammar and the string are quite long, which means there's a lot to unpack here. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol can also have a special case like A \u2192 \u03b5 for the empty string, but in this grammar, I don't see any empty productions, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of productions from the start symbol S down to various other symbols like NT1, NT3, etc., and some lead directly to terminals (like 't28', 't17', etc.). The string to evaluate is `t28 t17 t89 t4 t134 t48 t53 t81 t119`. \n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by this grammar. Since the grammar is CNF, I can use theCYK algorithm to check parsing, but since this is a manual process, I'll try to trace through how the string could be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT1 NT1. That means S generates two non-terminals. So the string must start with symbols derived from NT1 and then NT1. But our input string starts with t28, so that means the first symbol t28 must come from some NT1 production.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT44 \u2192 t44 is probably about another production. Wait, no, looking more carefully, there's an NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 and NT28 \u2192 t8. Oh, wait, no, under NT28, the productions are NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 and NT28 \u2192 t8. But the string starts with t28, which isn't directly an output of any NT28 production. Wait, let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list of rules. Let me look for any NT that can produce t28. Scanning through the list, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT28 \u2192 t8\n\nAh, okay, so NT28 can produce 't8'. But the string starts with 't28', which is not 't8'. So that doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, no, the string starts with 't28', which is literal 't' followed by '28', which would imply a production that outputs 't28'. Scanning the grammar, I see production rules where some non-terminals output specific terminals. For example, NT46 \u2192 't87', NT33 \u2192 't79', etc.\n\nWait, let me check each production to see if any of them produce 't28'. Looking through the list:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT28 \u2192 t8\n\nSo no NT28 rule leads to 't28'. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with 't28', so it must have a production that leads to that. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait a second, looking through the list, I notice that there are some rules where the production is written as 'X Y Z' and sometimes 'X Y' or 'X'. But in the provided grammar, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce 't28'. So perhaps the string doesn't match any derivation path, meaning it's not possible for the grammar to produce such a string starting with 't28'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the rule for NT28. Let me look again:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\nand NT28 \u2192 t8.\n\nSo indeed, no NT28 \u2192 t28. That suggests that the string starts with 't28', which isn't possible because the grammar doesn't have any rule that produces 't28' directly. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me not jump to conclusions. Maybe there's an indirect way. Let me look for any rule where a non-terminal can generate 't28' via another production. But looking at the list, all the 't' productions are specific. For example, NT28 produces 't8', another non-terminal like NT46 produces 't87', etc. So if the first symbol is 't28', it must come directly from a non-terminal that can produce 't28', which doesn't exist.\n\nSo, unless I made a mistake in parsing the grammar, 't28' cannot be generated by any of the non-terminals given. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a non-terminal that leads to 't28' indirectly. Let's see. Are there any non-terminals that can produce 't28' via other productions? Scanning through, I don't see any. Each non-terminal seems to either produce terminals like 't7', 't9', 't10', etc., or other non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the string starts with 't28', which isn't directly produced by any rule in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-172","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. I have to determine if the string `t4 t53 t1 t134 t102 t42 t38 t94 t112 t87` is generated by the given grammar. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have each production rule as A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in CNF because all right-hand sides have exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, some have two terminals, like NT35 -> 't93' or NT46 -> 't8'. So those would be productions where both symbols are terminals, meaning those non-terminals directly produce a single terminal symbol.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals: t4, t53, t1, t134, t102, t42, t38, t94, t112, t87. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which in CNF can produce NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So each step of the derivation alternates between the two. Let's think about how the string is built.\n\nEach production step takes two symbols (non-terminals), and each symbol in the string must be matched by some rule. So the idea is to parse the string, seeing if each step can be expanded according to the grammar.\n\nLet's try to build the parse tree.\n\nThe string is t4 t53 t1 t134 t102 t42 t38 t94 t112 t87. Let's count the number of symbols: 10 symbols. Since each production contributes either two non-terminals (which will be each further expanded) or a terminal, the length of the derived string will be 2^(n) -1, where n is the number of steps. But our string has 10 symbols, which isn't a power of 2 minus one (since 2^4-1=15, 2^3-1=7). So this suggests that maybe the string isn't a direct derivation. Alternatively, perhaps some of the non-terminals are producing terminals directly, so the structure is a mix of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each expansion is a binary tree, so the number of nodes is 2^n -1, where n is the depth of the tree. However, the string length could be any number, as some production steps might involve terminals. But perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to find the leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, since each non-terminal can only produce two symbols, and each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, etc., perhaps I should look for sequences where the symbols match the production rules.\n\nLet me list the productions that result in terminals:\n\nNT3 -> t6 t3 \u2192 t6 t3 | something else? Wait, the productions are like NT1 -> t6 t17 etc. Wait, some of them have 't' as the result.\n\nSo I need to check the possible sequences that can produce the given string.\n\nLet's start by considering the start symbol S. S can be NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nSo let's take S \u2192 NT1 NT28. The derived string starts with the symbols from NT1 and NT28. Similarly for S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nBut the given string starts with t4. So let's see which non-terminals produce t4.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT4 -> NT21 NT15 \u2192 but t8 is produced by NT28 -> t8 NT8. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the given grammar.\n\nLooking for 't4' in the productions:\n\nI see NT17 \u2192 t94, which is 't94', not 't4'. Wait, no, wait, some of these have 't's. Wait, the productions that produce 't's seem to be in the form of NTx -> t followed by something.\n\nLooking for where a production results in a single 't':\n\nFound several, like NT33 -> 't93' etc., but not 't4'. Let me look for any 't4' in the productions.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for example, NT46 -> t8, but that's 't8'. I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't4'. Similarly, NT17 -> t94, which is a different t-value.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because in the given string, the first symbol is 't4', which would have to be directly produced by a non-terminal that has a rule NTx -> t4. Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't4'. So this suggests that the given string cannot be derived from the grammar because the first symbol is 't4', which cannot be produced by any production rule in the grammar.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The given grammar is:\n\nNT36 -> NT56 NT10\nNT28 -> NT4 NT6\nNT16 -> NT10 NT34\nNT32 -> NT15 NT13\nNT17 -> NT44 NT53\nNT34 -> NT44 NT38\nNT43 -> NT8 NT3\nNT41 -> NT42 NT35\nNT4 -> NT21 NT15\nNT26 -> NT14 NT45\nNT22 -> NT35 NT34\nNT20 -> NT43 NT50\nNT46 -> NT20 NT8\nNT14 -> NT31 NT37\nNT22 -> NT40 NT45\nNT29 -> NT26 NT14\nNT9 -> NT35 NT46\nNT25 -> NT6 NT31\nNT0 -> NT31 NT50\nNT3 -> NT6 NT3\nNT13 -> NT43 NT26\nNT30 -> NT6 NT48\nNT53 -> NT29 NT3\nNT56 -> NT20 NT17\nNT26 -> NT50 NT48\nNT21 -> NT37 NT20\nNT14 -> NT24 NT0\nNT27 -> NT39 NT16\nNT24 -> NT40 NT17\nNT39 -> NT49 NT24\nNT37 -> NT7 NT33\nNT53 -> NT53 NT47\nNT28 -> NT8 NT8\nNT33 -> NT28 NT15\nNT41 -> NT19 NT10\nNT29 -> NT20 NT24\nNT29 -> NT15 NT39\nNT6 -> NT54 NT6\nNT45 -> NT40 NT36\nNT13 -> NT19 NT9\nNT46 -> NT47 NT28\nNT35 -> NT53 NT55\nNT41 -> NT19 NT10\nNT24 -> NT40 NT17\nNT39 -> NT49 NT24\nNT37 -> NT7 NT33\nNT53 -> NT53 NT47\nNT28 -> NT8 NT8\nNT33 -> NT28 NT15\nNT36 -> NT120\nWait, I think I've made a mistake. Let me re-examine the NT productions for any that produce 't4'.\n\nLooking through all the left-hand sides (NTx), I see that none of them directly produce 't4'. The productions that result in 't' values are things like NT33 -> 't93' or NT46 -> 't8'. So NT46 can produce 't8', NT33 can produce 't93', but none produce 't4'.\n\nThis suggests that 't4' is not a terminal in this grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because the first symbol is 't4', which isn't possible.\n\nBut wait, maybe 't4' is a part of another non-terminal's production. For example, in NT36 -> NT56 NT10. So if NT56 can produce 't4', then NT36 could produce 't4 NT10' or something. But looking back, NT46 can produce 't8' or 't17' or other 't's, but no 't4'. So unless there's a rule that produces 't4' directly, it can't be part of any string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the productions to see if any NT directly produces 't4'.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nNT17 -> t94 (t94)\nNT27 -> t124\nNT24 -> t29\nNT22 -> t58\nNT10 -> t2\nNT46 -> t8, t27, t79, etc.\n\nNo, none of them produce 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the provided grammar, all the productions seem to fit this form. \n\nNext, I need to analyze the productions to see how they might derive the given string. However, the string consists entirely of terminal symbols, so I\u2019d need to work backwards from it, checking if each terminal can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me list the string with their positions:\n\n1. t4\n2. t109\n3. t122\n4. t65\n5. t34\n6. t126\n7. t45\n8. t128\n9. t27\n10. t53\n\nI remember that in context-free grammars, the derivation starts from the start symbol S and follows the production rules until only terminals remain.

Let me check if any of the longer productions might split into parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT50 \u2192 t4, so t4 could come from NT50. Similarly, NT35 \u2192 t105, which would produce t105. Let me see:\n\n- t4: Could be NT50 \u2192 t4.\n- t109: Looking at the rules, NT46 \u2192 t109? Wait, no. Wait, looking again: NT46 has a production where some go to t109? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT46 appears a couple of times, like NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT17, and also other times. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT20 NT8 (from line 46 \u2192 t20 and others), but that doesn't directly give t109. Hmm. Wait, let me see if any NT's production includes t109. \n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT56 \u2192 t112, NT53 \u2192 t29, etc. Hmm, maybe it's better to try to figure out which NTs can produce the given t's.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n- t4: NT50 \u2192 t4\n- t109: Looking at the rules, NT46 \u2192 t109? Let me check: Oh, perhaps looking at NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT17, and so on, but that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t109 is from a terminal in a deeper production. Maybe NT56 \u2192 t17, but that's for NT56. Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some production leads to t109 via multiple steps. Maybe NT46 can produce t109 through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, but t109 seems specific. Let me check if it's produced directly by any NT.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17 \u2192 t91, no.\n- NT33 \u2192 NT79, but no t109.\n- NT46 \u2192 t20, etc.\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the rules carefully.\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\nNT45 \u2192 t73, NT47 \u2192 t40, NT28 \u2192 t76, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps t109 is part of a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe the string is too short, and perhaps each t comes directly from an NT.\n\nWait, starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT28\n\nSo the top-level productions are S splits into NT1 and NT28. Let's see what these produce.\n\nLooking at NT1's rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17 \u2192 t91. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider that S \u2192 NT1 NT28, and then each of NT1 and NT28 can split further.\n\nBut the given string is 10 t's, which suggests that the derivation has several steps. Let me think about how the length grows.\n\nIn the start symbol S, it's two NTs. Each NT can expand into two NTs or a terminal. The string has 10 t's, so maybe the derivation is something like S \u2192 NTs \u2192 ... \u2192 10 t's.\n\nBut each step can add more t's if the NTs expand to terminals. So perhaps let's simulate a possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t4 t109 t122 t65 t34 t126 t45 t128 t27 t53 corresponds to a path where each NT eventually expands to a terminal. \n\nBut wait, let's consider the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, the only way to get a string is by replacing non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me try to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from some NT.\n\nLooking for t4: As I noted, NT50 \u2192 t4. So t4 could come from NT50.\n\nt109: Does any NT produce t109? Looking through the production rules, I don't see any NT \u2192 t109. However, maybe t109 can be derived through multiple steps. For example, maybe some NT with two children where one of them is NT and the other is a terminal. Let's think: The NTs that produce terminals include NT7 \u2192 t93, NT7 \u2192 t97, etc. Wait, but t109 isn't directly produced by any NT, so perhaps it's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps t109 is part of a production chain. For example, perhaps some NT produces t109 via another NT. Let me check if any production rule includes t109 in their right-hand side.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nThe only t's in the rules are t4, t50, t27, t29, t105, t35, t91, t73, t40, t3, t17, t94, etc.\n\nI don't see t109 anywhere. So maybe t109 is not produced by any NT. Hence, the string can't be derived, because it contains a terminal (t109) that's not produced by any rule.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at all the NT production rules, I don't see t109 appearing in any. So, any NT that needs to produce t109 would fail, making the string invalid.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because t109 is not a terminal produced by any rule.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains t109, which is not produced directly by any rule in the grammar. Hence, it's impossible for the string to be generated.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-197","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t38 t111 t80 t50 t102 t42 t112 t42 t87 t126 t19`. \n\nFirst, I should recall how context-free grammars work. The grammar consists of production rules, and the string must be derived by expanding the start symbol S using these rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that some non-terminals (like NP, T1, etc.) can produce two terminals, which suggests that the grammar is generating terminal strings. Each production in the grammar has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two terminals on the right, except for the base cases where a single terminal is produced.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I should parse the string from the start symbol. Usually, a top-down parser would be used for this, but since I'm doing it manually, I'll try to find a leftmost derivation path.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t38. I need to see where t38 is defined. Scanning the grammar, I find that t38 is the output for NT44 \u2192 NT8 NT38. So, the first part of the string should be derived from NT44 \u2192 NT8 NT38. That would make t38 the last symbol, so before that, we need to derive NT8.\n\nWait, actually, in the string, the first token is t38. So the leftmost derivation should start with t38, meaning that the leftmost symbol in the string must come from a terminal production. Looking at the grammar, t38 is a production rule: NT44 \u2192 t8 NT38, or wait, actually in the grammar, I see multiple entries for t38. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n- NT44 \u2192 t88 (Wait, no, I think I misread. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the grammar has several rules ending with 'tXXX'. For example:\n\n- NT44 -> NT38 NT13 \u2192 which doesn't end with t.\n- NT24 -> t29.\n- NT4 -> t91.\n- NT45 -> t73.\n- NT28 -> t76, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing NT with the terminals. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some of them produce a 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t29\nNT4 \u2192 t91\nNT45 \u2192 t73\nNT28 \u2192 t76\nNT8 \u2192 t102\nNT3 \u2192 t42\nWait, no, actually in the grammar, the rules are written with NT followed by numbers, sometimes with two NTs. The terminal symbols are when a rule produces a string that starts with 't' followed by digits. So for example, looking at the production rules ends with 'tXXX', like:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t29\nNT46 \u2192 t24\nNT14 \u2192 t4\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to list out which rules produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, each production where the first symbol is a terminal (without non-terminals on the left) is a terminal production.

The string is `t38 t119 t24 t27 t38 t24 t109 t65 t59 t48 t16`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or terminals. So every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps in parsing the string by breaking it down step by step.\n\nThe given grammar has several productions, but I notice that many of them expand non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT28, which suggests that the starting symbol S will eventually derive the string by expanding through these non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with `t38`, which I assume is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, many non-terminals have productions that result in 't' followed by another number, like t9, t24, etc. So, I should check if the production chains for these t's exist in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by identifying each token and seeing their possible origins. Let's list them again: t38, t119, t24, t27, t38, t24, t109, t65, t59, t48, t16.\n\nLooking at t38, I see a production: NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6, NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15, NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17, NT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50, NT28 \u2192 NT8 NT8. Hmm, that doesn't directly give a 't38'. Wait, there's a production for NT24: NT24 \u2192 NT11 NT29, NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14, and so on. Perhaps another path.\n\nWait, let me check the productions more carefully. I notice that NT38 \u2192 NT44 NT32, NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13, etc. Hmm, perhaps it's better to look for t38 directly. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6, which might not give 't38'.\n- NT24 \u2192 NT11 NT29, which might not be t38.\n- NT38 is a terminal, but looking at the grammar, I see that NT38 isn't a terminal but is used in productions. Wait, in the grammar, is there a production that results in 't38'?\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I see that several of the NTs expand into terminals like 't93', 't97', etc., but I don't see a direct 't38' production. Hmm, that's odd. Did I misread the grammar? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user listed the grammar and the string, but perhaps I missed where t38 is derived. Let me look for any NT that can expand into t38. Hmm, I see in the grammar, NT38 is a terminal, but I don't see any production that ends with t38 except in the string itself. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the last few rules:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3\n- NT24 \u2192 NT11 NT29\n- NT39 \u2192 NT49 NT24\n- NT37 \u2192 NT7 NT33\n- NT17 \u2192 NT94\n- etc.\n\nWait, I see that NT24 \u2192 NT11 NT29, and NT29 can expand into NT26 NT14, and so on, but perhaps t38 comes from somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, every step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, because each production breaks down one non-terminal into two. The string has 11 tokens, which is odd, but that's okay because the starting symbol S has two non-terminals, and in each step, we add more, but the number of terminals can be 2^k, where k is the number of splits. So 11 is a bit tricky, but maybe it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of terminals should be equal to twice the number of non-terminals minus one, but I might be overcomplicating.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t38 t119 t24 t27 t38 t24 t109 t65 t59 t48 t16`.\n\nLet's see the possible steps. Starting from S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nSo the first symbol should come from NT1, and the second from NT28.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nFirst token: t38. So NT1 must derive to t38.\n\nLooking for a production where NT1 \u2192 something that can result in t38. From the grammar, NT1's productions are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT1 \u2192 NT47\n- NT1 \u2192 NT24 NT2\n- NT1 \u2192 NT28 NT35\n- NT1 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT1 \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT1 \u2192 etc.\n\nWait, none of these directly produce t38. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again for NT1.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT1 \u2192 't25' and other terminals? Wait no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the user listed NT1 productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT1 \u2192 NT47\n- NT1 \u2192 NT24 NT2\n- NT1 \u2192 NT28 NT35\n- NT1 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT1 \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT1 \u2192 't69'\n- etc.\n\nWait, I don't see a production that ends with t38. But the first token in the string is t38, so this must be derived from NT1. That implies that the grammar has some production for NT1 that leads to t38. But from the given productions, I don't see that. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, or perhaps the production is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t38 is derived from a longer chain. Let's check if any of the non-terminals can expand into t38. Looking through, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6, which then can expand further.\n- NT24 \u2192 NT11 NT29, which goes on.\n- NT38 is not present as a terminal in any production except in the string itself.\n\nWait, perhaps the string contains a sequence that comes from a production chain that results in t38. Alternatively, perhaps I need to look at how other tokens are derived and see if they can connect.\n\nLet me try another approach: let's see if each token in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first token, t38. Maybe it's produced from NT28 or another non-terminal. Looking at NT28's production: NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6. Then, perhaps NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, and NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15, and so on. Looking further, NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17, which then \u2192 NT43 NT50. Hmm, not giving t38.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the token t38 comes from a different non-terminal. Let's see NT38 in the grammar: looks like there's a production NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT35 and others, but I don't see a direct path to t38.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all NTs that end with 't' and see their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT productions that result in terminals are:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't8' 't8'\n- NT44 \u2192 't44' 't32'\n- NT32 \u2192 't15' 't13'\n- NT15 \u2192 't56' 't15'\n- NT56 \u2192 't20' 't17'\n- NT20 \u2192 't43' 't50'\n- NT43 \u2192 't8' 't3'\n- NT45 \u2192 't28' 't8'\n- NT38 \u2192 't44' 't32'\n- NT24 \u2192 't11' 't29'\n- NT29 \u2192 't26' 't14'\n- NT46 \u2192 't20' 't17'\n- NT14 \u2192 't79' 't46'\n- NT27 \u2192 't39' 't16'\n- NT35 \u2192 't53' 't55'\n- NT53"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-217","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out whether the string is in the language defined by this grammar.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form means. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form:\n\n1. A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols.\n2. A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal symbol and a is a terminal symbol (including the empty string for some variations, but in the standard CNF, it's just terminals).\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I can see that it's in CNF because all the production rules either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT1, or some NT \u2192 tX where tX is a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t4 t111 t52 t2 t123 t79 t89 t109 t81 t41 t65 t66.\n\nEach part of the string seems to be separated by spaces, so presumably, they are separate symbols. The grammar's productions sometimes produce terminals (like 't8'), but in the provided grammar, I notice that some terminals are multi-character, like 't87', 't105', 't17', etc.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of tokens, each starting with 't' followed by two digits. So each token is a separate terminal string, right? So to parse the string correctly, each token like 't4', 't111', etc., represents a terminal symbol.\n\nHowever, looking back at the grammar, it's not immediately clear which combinations of terminals are possible. Some grammar rules produce exact terminals, like NT46 \u2192 't8', NT17 \u2192 't94', etc. So these indicate that 't8', 't94', etc., are terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to check is: t4 t111 t52 t2 t123 t79 t89 t109 t81 t41 t65 t66.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nOne approach is to use a top-down parsing method, perhaps recursive descent parsing, which is typical for CNF grammars because of the absence of left recursion and other complexities.\n\nBut before diving into parsing, maybe it's better to list out the possible terminals that the grammar can generate. Some of these are given as:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't8'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT4 \u2192 't91'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28'\n- NT26 \u2192 't48'\n- NT13 \u2192 't16'\n- NT55 \u2192 't45'\n- NT9 \u2192 't19'\n- NT29 \u2192 't48', 't14', etc.\n- NT15 \u2192 't48'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29', 't62', etc.\n- NT46 \u2192 't53', 't76', etc.\n- NT33 \u2192 't79', 't131', etc.\n- NT38 \u2192 't102', 't34', 't114', etc.\n- NT14 \u2192 't58', 't24', etc.\n- NT27 \u2192 't7', 't124'\n- NT35 \u2192 't10', 't55', 't17', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't93', 't79', etc.\n- NT22 \u2192 't58', 't128'\n- NT10 \u2192 't2', 't42'\n- NT48 \u2192 't62'\n- NT43 \u2192 't69', 't27', etc.\n- NT41 \u2192 't52', 't19', etc.\n- NT55 \u2192 't112', 't45', etc.\n- NT20 \u2192 't4', 't50'\n- NT32 \u2192 't66', 't36'\n- NT19 \u2192 't116', etc.\n- NT42 \u2192 't82', 't2', etc.\n- NT38 \u2192 't102', 't53', etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 't94', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT47 \u2192 't3', etc.\n- NT21 \u2192 't3', etc.\n- NT50 \u2192 't4', 't17'\n- NT15 \u2192 't93', 't48', etc.\n- NT29 \u2192 't48', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT47 \u2192 't41', etc.\n- NT54 \u2192 't119'\n- NT33 \u2192 't79', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all the terminal symbols present in the grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string is composed of terminals, so we'll have to see if it can be derived from S.\n\nThe given string has multiple 't's followed by numbers. These look like the terminals in the grammar. Let's look at the productions to see how 't's are generated. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see lines like `NT7 -> 't93'` and others, but I don't see 't8' being generated by any other NT except NT17: `NT17 -> 't94'`. Hmm, but looking through the grammar, I notice `NT28 -> 't76'` and `NT44 -> 't114'`, among others. Wait, actually, I might have missed some 't's.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at each production and see which NTs generate 't' strings. Let's go through the rules:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n- NT17 -> 't94' \n- NT14 -> 't79'\n- NT28 -> 't76'\n- NT44 -> 't89'\n- NT4 -> 't91'\n- NT40 -> 't28'\n- NT33 -> 't79'\n- NT36 -> 't87'\n- NT47 -> 't3'\nWait, no, 't' endings seem to be part of larger strings, but some NTs directly produce 't' followed by numbers, like `NT46 -> 't8'`. But perhaps more straightforwardly, NT7 generates 't93' and others, but I'm not seeing a 't8' except in NT46.\n\nWait, let me list the productions that generate terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't93', 't97', 't94', 't79', etc. But looking more carefully, I see NT8 doesn't produce anything yet. Wait, in the grammar, there's NT46 -> 't8' and NT42 -> 't2', among others. Wait, no, let me check the provided grammar again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see a few lines like:\n- NT28 -> 't76'\n- NT44 -> 't114'\nBut nothing directly giving 't8' as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Looking again through the provided rules, I notice NT17 -> 't94', NT46 -> 't8', NT42 -> 't2', and others. So 't8' comes from NT46, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps the string contains 't21', 't117', etc. Let me break down the string:\n\nThe string is: `t21 t117 t89 t87 t131 t42 t4 t40 t3 t48 t53 t21`.\n\nEach 't' is followed by a number, which I think represents the stack of symbols or steps. But maybe each number corresponds to a terminal count or a non-terminal's output.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' is part of a production's derivation. Let me try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps this string is built by the grammar step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two steps. So possibly, the string's length is 12, which would mean that the parsing would require 11 steps if it's a leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, but each production contributes two symbols (since CNF requires A \u2192 BC), so the number of steps would be equal to the number of symbols minus one. For a string of 12 symbols, that would be 11 productions, which seems possible, but maybe not.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I need to generate the string by the grammar. Let me check if the entire string is possible.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27. Wait, in CNF, S would be split into two non-terminals. So the first step is S \u2192 ... then the next step would be each of those non-terminals producing their respective symbols.\n\nWait, in the given string, the first two 't's are t21 and t117, but the grammar's productions don't include that. Wait, looking back, I see that in the grammar, several NTs produce strings like 't8', 't2', etc. Maybe these are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string is derived by a series of productions. Let me check if each t can be reached.\n\nAlternatively, let me see the production chain:\n\nSuppose I start with S \u2192 NT53 NT56.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce NT53 and NT56. Then NT53 produces NT10 and NT46. Wait, looking at the production rules:\n\nLooking at NT53's rules: Hmm, looking through, I see rules for NT53 like `NT53 -> 't105'`. Wait, does NT53 ever generate t53? I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking carefully at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT44 \u2192 't114'\n- But for NT53, check the rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT53 -> NT29 NT53 (left recursion)\n- NT53 -> NT29 NT3\n- So maybe NT53 can be split into NT29 and NT3, where NT29 and NT3 produce 't's.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\n- NT29: Check if it ever produces t as a string.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\n- NT26 \u2192 NT50 NT48\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT48 \u2192 't46'\nSo NT29 \u2192 NT26 \u2192 NT50 't4' and NT48 't46', so NT29 produces t4 t46.\n\nBut in the string, we have 't131' and other large numbers. Maybe I'm missing some.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since the string has 't21', which might correspond to NT1 (looking back, NT1 produces certain strings), or perhaps it's generated by a longer derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to identify what each part of the string could correspond to.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if 't21' can be generated. Looking at NT21, in the grammar:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT20\n- NT37 \u2192 NT7 NT33\n- NT7 \u2192 't93' etc.\n\nSo NT21 would produce NT37 and NT20, which then go on to produce 't93' and other 't's.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first tokens are t21, t117, etc. Maybe each of these is a 't' followed by a number, but as terminals or from non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers following 't' are steps in a parse tree, indicating how many lefts have been taken, but that's getting too detailed for me right now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into two parts, each generated by S \u2192 NT1 NT1 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nWait, but how? Let's see: the string starts with t21, so perhaps S splits into NT1 and NT1 or NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the start, if S \u2192 NT1 NT1, then both NT1's should generate parts of the string.\n\nSo the string is 12 tokens, so split into 6 pairs or something. Alternatively, each step of production divides each non-terminal into two parts.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps the string cannot be generated because of the way the non-terminals split.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to check for ambiguity in the grammar. Since S can produce either NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27, and the string starts with t21, which might come from NT1 or NT50.\n\nSo perhaps S \u2192 NT1 NT1, then each NT1 produces a part of the string.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT54 \u2192 NT14 NT\nWait, perhaps I should track possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the possible ways the string can be derived. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that many non-terminals eventually lead to terminals, often through a series of rules. Some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals, and others are passed on through multiple steps.\n\nThe string has several `t` terms: t58, t117, etc. Each of these must be derived from the starting symbol S. The grammar starts with S, so I need to trace how the starting symbol can generate these `t` terms.\n\nI notice that S has two productions: NT1 NT50 and NT50 NT27. Since the string starts with `t58`, I need to see how that can come from S. Looking at the rules, NT50 eventually leads to `t42`. Let me check: NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT50. Wait, that seems recursive. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me retrace:\n\nLooking up NT50 in the grammar: NT50 -> NT15 NT50. Oh, that's a recursive production. So S can produce NT50 NT27, which would mean S\u2192NT50 NT27.\n\nNow, NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT50, but I don't see NT15 leading directly to t. Wait, no\u2014looking again, NT15 is S \u2192 NT15 NT50, but then NT15 also has a production: NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT6. Let me trace NT15:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT56 NT6.\nNT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17.\nAnd NT20 has several productions. Let's see NT20:\nNT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50 or NT43 NT50.\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right path.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should approach it step by step. Let's consider the starting point S and the possible ways to reach the given string.\n\nThe string starts with `t58`. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t58.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT46 \u2192 t46 in some cases. For example, NT46 sometimes leads to 't7', 't8', etc. But I'm looking for t58. Scanning the rules, I see NT46 has multiple productions that lead to 't's, but none directly. Wait, no\u2014wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the rules for NT26: NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45. NT35 \u2192 NT26 NT14. NT42 \u2192 t82? Not sure. Let's see where `t58` comes from.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions, some non-terminals directly produce t-like strings. For example, NT54 \u2192 t54, but I don't see any t58. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see lines like:\n- NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45\n- NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 (which is recursive)\n- NT49 \u2192 t109\n- NT39 \u2192 t102\nHmm, looking for where the string starts with t58. Checking the rules, I can't find a non-terminal directly producing t58.\n\nWait, maybe it's not a direct production. Maybe it's generated through a chain of productions. Let's consider the possible steps.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT50 NT27, and NT50 produces NT15 NT50, maybe we go deeper. Alternatively, if NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT50, this seems like an infinite loop, so perhaps it's better to consider another path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT46 NT27 or something else, but in the given grammar, S only has NT46 as that production. Wait, no, the grammar says S \u2192 NT1 NT50 OR NT50 NT27. So it can't directly produce NT46 unless through another route.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's try to build the string backward and see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nThe string is t58 t117 t123 t69 t117 t79 t36 t28 t87 t116 t42 t102 t102.\n\nStarting from the last part:\n\n- The last t102 could come from NT39 (since NT39 can produce 't102'). How does NT39 produce t102? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT39 has one production: NT39 \u2192 t102. So that's straightforward. So the last part t102 comes from NT39.\n\nNow, the string ends with two t102, so the last part is two t102s. So before that, we have NT39 produced twice.\n\nBut how does NT39 get into the string? Let's see if any non-terminal can produce NT39 followed by another NT39.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT39 has production NT39 \u2192 t102, which is terminal. So the only way is if a non-terminal produces NT39 followed by another NT39. Or maybe a non-terminal like NT10: NT10 \u2192 NT21 NT34, and then NT21... Hmm, I don't see a production that ends with two NT39s.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler: if the last two symbols are t102 t102, they must come from a production that generates two NT39s. So perhaps a production like NT39 \u2192 something that can end with two NT39s. But looking through the rules, I don't see any rule where NT39 is produced in a way that leads to another NT39. Instead, NT39 is a terminal.\n\nSo the last t102 must come from NT39, so the production for that symbol is NT39 \u2192 t102. Similarly, the previous symbol is NT39, so somewhere in the string, we have a sequence that produces NT39 twice. But since NT39 is a terminal, the production for that is just t102, so the prior non-terminal must produce NT39 in a way that eventually leads to t102.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production is NT39 itself, but since it's a terminal, it can't have children. So any NT39 must be the base symbol.\n\nSo the string ends with two 't102's, which suggests that in the parse tree, the last two symbols are NT39. So perhaps the two NT39 rules are both produced from a parent rule that somehow has NT39 in two places. But in reality, in the grammar, the only way is if a non-terminal has a rule that produces NT39 NT39, but looking at the rules, I don't see any such rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it's because NT39 is a terminal, and thus the only production is t102, so the two 't102's must come from two different NT39 symbols. So their parent must produce NT39 on both sides. So maybe a rule like NT10 \u2192 NT21 NT11, but no, that's guesswork.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first NT39 is part of a chain that leads to t102, and the second is the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parent of the last part is NT50 or another symbol that ends in t102.\n\nThis is getting complicated, maybe I should approach this systematically.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each part of the string and see how they can be derived.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t58. Looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t58. So perhaps t58 comes from a non-terminal that eventually leads to t58.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 (recursive) and NT53 \u2192 t7, NT56 \u2192 t8, etc. Wait, wait\u2014looking at the rules, NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45, but I don't see any t58.\n\nWait, perhaps t58 comes from NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6. But that's recursive, leading into t54 and more NT6s, which don't terminate with t58.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's from NT46: NT46 has several productions, some leading to 't's. For example, NT46 \u2192 t7, NT8,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t53 t21 t117 t53 t135 t34 t79 t122 t42 t40 t40 t91 t119`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, I can ignore the start symbol S and focus on the other productions.\n\nI can see that the grammar has NT symbols as non-terminals and t followed by numbers as terminals. For example, NT16 \u2192 NT10 NT34, and some non-terminals directly produce terminals like NT45 \u2192 't87'.\n\nThe string provided consists of terminal symbols, each starting with 't' followed by a number. So, I need to see if I can derive this string starting from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the start symbol is S, I should check if S can derive this string. Looking at the productions of S, it can go to NT1 NT1 1 28 or NT1 NT50, where T1 28 and T50 are non-terminals. So, each step will involve replacing these non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nI need to construct a parse tree or a sequence of productions that results in the given string. Let's break down the string into parts. The string is: t53, t21, t117, t53, t135, t34, t79, t122, t42, t40, t40, t91, t119.\n\nThis is 13 symbols long, which is quite long. But perhaps I can find a pattern or see if each 't' corresponds to a production that can be traced back to S.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to see if each 't' symbol is generated by some NT rule, and then see how they combine. For example, t53 is a terminal; looking at the grammar, I see NT53 has multiple production rules, some of which produce 't' strings.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT53 has:\n- NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3\n- NT53 \u2192 NT53 NT47\n- NT53 \u2192 NT22 NT51 (wait, but in the given grammar, does NT22 have something?)\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I notice that NT22 is only present in some production rules, but in the given context, I don't see a production for NT22 that leads to a terminal. Let's see:\n\nFrom the user's grammar, I have to parse all the productions. Let me try to map which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nFirst, let me look for any non-terminals that directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46\nBut NT35 maybe produces a terminal, etc. Wait, it's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this recursively, checking if each 't' in the string can be generated by some NT.\n\nLet me consider the last symbol in the string, t119. What NT can produce t119? Looking through the grammar, I see NT54 \u2192 't53' and NT56 \u2192 't112', etc. Maybe some NTs have productions ending in 't' and terminal?\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't48' appears in some productions, like NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15, but also NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT15, etc. Wait, actually, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15, and some others, but some NTs have rules leading to terminals:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, I see:\n\nNT50 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo, NT50 can generate t4, which is a single 't'. Similarly, NT35 \u2192 't102' and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look for each 't' in the string and see if it's generated by a non-terminal that can derive a string ending with 'tX'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each 't' symbol in the string must correspond to a production where the non-terminal on the left can derive that 't' symbol.\n\nBut since Chomsky Normal Form uses production rules that are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, each production for a non-terminal either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, that means that in the parse tree, each node is either a single terminal or an internal node with two children. So the string must be a result of replacing all non-terminals down to terminals, each replacement step involving replacing a non-terminal with two others or a single terminal.\n\nGiven that, let's see the string length: 13 symbols. So the parse tree must have 13 leaf nodes. Since each production can produce either two non-terminals or one terminal, the number of symbols can help determine the structure.\n\nBut without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to build the parse tree. Maybe it's better to check if each 't' can be rewritten step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down approach using the grammar to see if the string can be generated from S.\n\nLet me start by considering S as the start symbol. S can produce NT1 NT1 28 or NT50 NT28.\n\nLet's suppose S \u2192 NT1 NT1 28. Then NT1 28 should produce the string. NT1 28 is itself a non-terminal, so it would produce two other non-terminals, which would in turn produce the symbols of the string.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT50 NT28. Then NT50 and NT28 would each produce parts of the string.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it starts with t53, so one of these non-terminals must produce t53.\n\nLooking at NT53, its productions include NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3. Maybe NT29 and NT3 produce t29 and t3 respectively? But in the grammar, I don't see a direct rule for NT3 to produce t33, for example.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar more carefully. Looking for NTs that produce 't' followed by a number:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find NT35 \u2192 't102', NT45 \u2192 't73', NT33 \u2192 't79', NT6 \u2192 't58', NT22 \u2192 't58', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me see again:\n\nThe grammar includes:\n\nNT35 \u2192 't102'\nNT45 \u2192 't73'\nNT33 \u2192 't79'\nNT6 \u2192 't58'\nNT22 \u2192 't58'\nNT7 \u2192 't79'\nNT7 \u2192 't84'\nNT46 \u2192 't73' (multiple times)\nNT53 \u2192 't87' (multiple times)\nNT6 \u2192 't119' (wait no, looking for 't' symbols)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a key point: each 't' in the string must be generated by a production where the non-terminal can produce that exact 't' as a terminal.\n\nBut in CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, for example, NT46 \u2192 't87' is a direct production that generates 't87'.\n\nSimilarly, maybe some other non-terminals can produce 't53', etc.\n\nSo, looking for non-terminals in the grammar that have a production directly producing 't53', 't21', etc.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t97\n- NT30 \u2192 t111\n- NT41 \u2192 t40\n- NT47 \u2192 t100\n- NT7 \u2192 t93, t79? Wait, looking back, the user's grammar has:\n\nWait, user's grammar:\n\nLooking again:\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the productions where a non-terminal directly produces a 't' symbol:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't87' (twice)\nNT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46 (does that produce 't'?)\nWait, no.

Oh, looking again, NT10 -> NT50 NT17? No, in the initial list: NT10: NT25 NT50, NT34: NT7 NT32, etc. Wait, maybe I need to look for productions that result in terminals.\n\nLooking for any production that directly results in a terminal, but in this grammar, I notice that several non-terminals like NT46, NT4, etc., have rules that eventually lead to terminals like 't'. For example, NT41 -> 't87', NT54 -> 't53', etc.\n\nSo the strategy is to trace the string backward from the start symbol S, expanding non-terminals step by step until we reach the root S. Alternatively, I can try to see if the given string can be derived from S by expanding non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t38 t111 t80 t45 t17 t34 t102 t126 t65 t34 t76 t53 t50 t37. Let's note that the string is a sequence of terminals; we need to see if they can be formed by the grammar.\n\nStarting from the beginning: t38. Let's see if any non-terminals produce 't38'. Looking at the productions, NT35 has a rule where it can produce 't10' and 'NT34', but wait, looking through all the productions, I see that NT34 can produce 't37' (from NT34 -> 't37'). Hmm, maybe NT34 is part of the chain.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. NT34 has the rule: `NT34 -> NT44 NT32` and `NT34 -> NT36 NT38`? No, wait, in the initial list, NT34 is `NT34 -> NT44 NT38` and `NT34 -> NT36 NT32`. Wait, actually in the provided grammar, NT34's productions are:\n\n- NT34 -> NT44 NT38\n- NT34 -> NT36 NT32\n\nSo, NT34 can expand into NT44 and NT38. Neither of these are terminals yet. But then, looking further, NT44 has `NT44 -> NT38 NT13`. NT38's production is `NT38 -> 't123'`? Wait, no, from the provided list:\n\nLooking for NT38 in the productions, I see that NT38 has `NT38 -> 't123'`, `NT38 -> 't102'`, and `NT36 -> NT56 NT10`. Wait, no, no: Let's check the entire list for 't' terminals.\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT41 -> 't87'\n- NT53 -> 't105'\n- NT35 -> 't10' (Wait, no, wait, looking back: the lines say, for example, NT35 -> 't105', etc.)\n\nWait, the initial list is quite long. Let me scan for any production that results in a terminal. I spot:\n\n- NT41 -> 't87'\n- NT54 -> 't53'\n- NT14 -> 't79'\n- NT26 -> 't48'\n- NT46 -> 't8'\n- NT27 -> 't124'\n- NT24 -> 't29'\n- NT22 -> 't58'\n- NT10 -> 't2'\n- NT55 -> 't45'\n- NT9 -> 't19'\n- NT29 -> 't48'\n- NT28 -> 't76'\n- NT41 -> 't4'\n- NT32 -> 't66'\n- NT10 -> 't50'\n- NT34 -> 't37'\n- NT47 -> 't40'\n- NT21 -> 't3'\n- NT36 -> 't87'\n- NT6 -> 't58'\n- NT47 -> 't41'\n- NT50 -> 't4'\n- NT15 -> 't48'\n- NT29 -> 't14'\n- NT6 -> 't21'\n- NT49 -> 't109'\n- NT33 -> 't79'\n- NT38 -> 't123'\n- NT14 -> 't58'\n- NT20 -> 't16'\n- NT10 -> 't17'\n- NT48 -> 't70'\n- NT27 -> 't116'\n- NT30 -> 't111'\n- NT43 -> 't69'\n- NT43 -> 't27'\n- NT42 -> 't82'\n- NT8 -> 't102'\n- NT10 -> 't65'\n- NT21 -> 't1'\n- NT38 -> 't123'\n- NT15 -> 't93'\n- NT4 -> 't91'\n- NT40 -> 't28'\n- NT26 -> 't98'\n- NT32 -> 't59'\n- NT19 -> 't126'\n- NT46 -> 't76'\n- NT56 -> 't134'\n- NT3 -> 't42'\n- NT45 -> 't73'\n- NT28 -> 't97'\n- NT44 -> 't114'\n- NT24 -> 't122'\n- NT46 -> 't100'\n- NT16 -> 't83'\n- NT13 -> 't135'\n- NT46 -> 't14'\n- NT7 -> 't79'\n- NT38 -> 't53'\n- NT36 -> 't59'\n- NT44 -> 't89'\n- NT55 -> 't15'\n- NT54 -> 't81'\n- NT46 -> 't15'\n- NT38 -> 't34'\n- NT14 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't78'\n- NT47 -> 't114'\n- NT1 -> 't5'\n- NT31 -> 't117'\n- NT42 -> 't80'\n- NT10 -> 't42'\n- NT55 -> 't36'\n- NT15 -> 't87'\n- NT43 -> 't89'\n- NT17 -> 't63'\n- NT24 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't126'\n- NT29 -> 't31'\n- NT50 -> 't38'\n- NT25 -> 't107'\n- NT6 -> 't119'\n- NT32 -> 't108'\n- NT22 -> 't128'\n- NT29 -> 't116'\n- NT1 -> 't2'\n- NT47 -> 't4'\n\nWait, I think I may have miscounted some.

{"custom_id":"request-252","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar is in CNF, so each production on the left is a non-terminal, and on the right, it's either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t4 t131 t65 t59 t112 t48 t102 t42 t122 t126 t28 t16 t94 t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see there are both non-terminals and terminals involved. The terminals are the ones with t followed by a number, like t4, t131, etc. The non-terminals are things like S, NT36, NT28, and so on.\n\nI remember that for a string to be in the language, it should be possible to derive the string from the start symbol using the productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can perform a leftmost derivation, where at each step, the leftmost non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLet me start by looking at the given string and see how it might break down. The string starts with t4, which is a terminal. In the grammar, I look for any production that has t4 as a result. Scanning through the productions, I noticed that NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10, which eventually might lead to a t via NT6, but that's not it. Wait, no, maybe I should look for a production that directly gives a terminal.\n\nLooking further, I see some productions like NT35 \u2192 't105', NT37 \u2192 't17', etc. So each of these is a production that results in a single terminal.\n\nSo, the string starts with t4. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t4. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any production where A \u2192 t4. So the first symbol in the string, t4, must come from a production where A \u2192 B t4 C, or something, but in CNF, each production is only two non-terminals or a terminal. So the only way to get t4 is if there's a production where A \u2192 ... t4 ... Or wait, no, because in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each production only expands to two non-terminals or a terminal, which is only one symbol.\n\nWait, that means that the first symbol t4 must come directly from a production where a non-terminal A produces t4. So I'm looking for A \u2192 t4. But looking at the grammar provided, I don't see any production like that. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check again. The given grammar has NT46 \u2192 't8' and some other terminal outputs. So, for example, NT46 can produce t8, t102, etc. But I don't see any production that directly produces t4. So does that mean that the string can't start with t4? Or perhaps I missed a production.\n\nWait, let me look carefully. Hmm, I see NT47 \u2192 't3', but that's a separate production. NT17 \u2192 't94'. NT27 \u2192 't124'. NT24 \u2192 't29'. NT46 \u2192 't8' and 't87', 't24', etc. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT46 can be t24 or t87, but I don't see t4 as an immediate terminal.\n\nSo, if the first symbol is t4 and there's no production that directly gives t4, then the string cannot be generated. Because in the leftmost derivation, the first symbol must come directly from A \u2192 t4, but since it doesn't, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe the t4 comes from something like NT46 \u2192 t24 and then from t24 leading to something else. No, because in the string, the first symbol is t4. So, unless there's a production that directly produces t4, the string can't start with t4.\n\nIn the grammar, the only terminals are those with the 't' prefixes, and none of them are t4. So, for example, NT4 \u2192 't91', NT31 \u2192 't117', NT19 \u2192 't126', etc. So, no production gives t4 directly. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe the first symbol t4 comes from a longer production, but in CNF, all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So unless there's a production for a non-terminal that directly produces t4, the string starting with t4 can't be generated. So since such a production doesn't exist, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol S is a non-terminal, so I can only directly produce terminal sequences. The process will involve replacing non-terminals step by step.\n\nMaybe I should try to construct a possible derivation. Let's try to look for the top-level productions. Since S can produce either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27, the string must start with either NT1 followed by NT28 or NT50 followed by NT27.\n\nLooking at the string's first two tokens: t38 and t53. I don't immediately see NT1 or NT28 as these. Wait, in the grammar, NT1 is a non-terminal. The NT1 production is in the grammar, but I'm not sure which token matches which.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each production's right side consists of non-terminals or terminals. The NTs and terminals are all separate. So, perhaps each non-terminal in the string is to be matched via the productions.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules to find where t38 appears. Looking at the grammar, I see that several rules end with a terminal, such as:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 NT102 (but wait, in the grammar provided, the rules are like NT38 \u2192 some combination. Wait, no, in the grammar provided by the user, there are rules that end with terminals. Let me check:\n\nFor example, NT38 \u2192 NT102 seems not to be in the provided grammar. Wait, let's scan the grammar:\n\nLooking for tokens like 't38', 't53', etc., in the right-hand side:\n\nOh, I see that several rules produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46\n- NT24 \u2192 NT40 NT17\n- And so on. Hmm, perhaps I need to map each token to the possible production that ends with that terminal.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, each production ends with a terminal except for those that produce NTs. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nSo, for example, some rules produce 't' followed by a number, like 't2', 't102', etc.\n\nI think I need to map each token to the non-terminal that can produce it, perhaps looking for a production that starts with that NT and the terminal is the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the string and see if it's a sequence of terminals produced from S through a series of non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to perform a top-down parsing, trying each possible production and seeing if the string can be matched.\n\nLet me try starting with S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT1 NT28, then the string starts with NT1 and the next part is NT28.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t38, which should correspond to NT1. Let me check if NT1 can produce t38. Looking in the grammar, yes:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17.\n\nWait, that's a two-step production. So, NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. But to produce a terminal, perhaps this chain continues until a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let's instead consider that each non-terminal can produce a terminal, so the string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the string to reverse-engineer the possible productions.\n\nFor example, starting from the end of the string, the last token is t87. Let's see what NT produces t87.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT87 isn't directly present, but let me check the productions:\n\nLooking at NT7 \u2192 't93' and 't79', etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see that ND7 \u2192 t93, t97, etc. So maybe NT7 can produce t87? Wait, not directly in the given rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's instead look through the right-hand sides of the productions to see which ones end with a specific token.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to think recursively. For each token in the string, determine which non-terminal can derive it, and then see how the rest of the string can be built from that.\n\nBut this might take a long time manually. Maybe I should look for patterns or look at the string.\n\nWait, the string has t38 as the first token, then t53, which is one of the early non-terminals. Let me check if any NT produces t53.\n\nLooking at the grammar's right-hand sides, I see:\n\n- NT53 can produce NS168? Wait, I'm not seeing 't53' as an immediate result. Wait, in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see that NT53 has some productions, for example:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT4 NT21\n- NT14 \u2192 NT14 NT20\n- Among others. Hmm, perhaps t53 is not a terminal but a non-terminal. Wait, no, in the string, t53 is a terminal, so it must be produced by a production that ends in t53.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at each production's right-hand side, I see:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't48' and 't14', etc.\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, let's look at each production in the grammar.\n\nLooking for the terminal 't53' on the right-hand side:\n\n- None of the rules in the grammar end with 't53' directly, except possibly in one rule provided by the user in the initial grammar:\n\nLooking back, I see that in the provided grammar, there's a production:\n\n- NT46 -> 't87'\n- NT47 -> 't3'\n- But also, in the grammar, looking for production NT53, I don't see any production that ends with 't53', so perhaps I need to check if my earlier list is wrong.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided in the user's message, the rules after:\n\nLooking through all the lines, I don't see any production that ends with t53. Hmm. So perhaps t53 is a non-terminal and therefore it's a variable that can be replaced, but then the string would include a non-terminal, which it's not present\u2014wait, no, in the string, all tokens are t's followed by numbers, meaning they are terminals.\n\nWait, but wait, in the initial grammar, some of the lines end with 't' and numbers. For example:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46\n- NT45 \u2192 't87'\n- Also, elsewhere, lines have 't' followed by a number, such as 't2', 't102', etc.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I should check if any production on the right-hand side ends with a terminal. Wait, in the initial problem, the provided grammar's right-hand side ends with some 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, one production is NT45 \u2192 't87'.\n\nWait, here's a production:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3\n\nWait, that's not ending with a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-279","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t38 t109 t122 t2 t102 t42 t4 t123 t16 t109 t81 t2 t87 t126 t19\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the given string. The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string is a sequence of terminals (like 't38', 't109', etc.), which I assume are the words that the grammar can generate.\n\nThe grammar rules are in Chomsky normal form, meaning each rule is either of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see that many non-terminals have other non-terminals as their components, and some expand to terminals directly.\n\nThe string provided starts with 't38', which I need to trace back through the grammar. Looking at the rules where terminals appear, I notice a few key production rules that introduce terminals:\n\n- NT24 -> 't29'\n- NT46 -> 't27'\n- NT1 -> 't69'\n- NT41 -> 't52'\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n- NT56 -> 't112'\n- NT28 -> 't76'\n- NT44 -> 't114'\n- NT46 -> 't14'\n- NT7 -> 't93'\n- NT27 -> 't124'\n- NT24 -> 't62' (Wait, this seems different from the earlier NT24)\n- NT29 -> 't48'\n- NT45 -> 't73' (Wait, earlier it was 't73')\n- NT55 -> 't15'\n- NT38 -> 't102'\n- NT33 -> 't79'\n- NT37 -> 't7' (Hmm, but in the string 't17' appears)\nWait, I think I need to check all the string tokens against the grammar.\n\nWait, the string token has 't17' but looking at the rules, I see that 't17' comes from NT17->'t94', which isn't present. Alternatively, maybe I should start building a parse tree from the string.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So maybe I can work backward from the string. Each token in the string should come from a rule that directly produces it.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt38, t109, t122, t2, t102, t42, t4, t123, t16, t109, t81, t2, t87, t126, t19.\n\nLet me go through each token:\n\n1. t38: Looking at the rules, NT38->t102. So t38 is not directly produced by a terminal rule. Wait, no, in the rules provided, some terminals appear like:\n\nWait, the string has 't38'. In the rules, I see NT38 is on the left side of some productions. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT38 as a terminal. Instead, I see NT38 -> t102, which is a terminal. So NT38 isn't producing t38 directly; rather, t102 is. So 't38' might not be present in the expansion, which is a red flag. Unless t38 appears in the grammar through another path.\n\nWait, checking further, perhaps t38 is derived from some NT. Looking at the rules, I see NT28 -> t8, t28: Wait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT28 has rules like NT28 -> NT4 NT6, NT28->NT8 NT8, etc. So t28 isn't a terminal; it's derived from other rules.\n\nAlternatively, looking for t38, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Checking the rules, I don't see any NTs that directly produce t38. The closest is NT38 -> t102, so t38 isn't a terminal but a non-terminal. Therefore, the string has 't38' which is a non-terminal, so the string can't be correct because it has 't38', which is not a terminal. Or wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in the problem, the string is given as a sequence of tokens. So if a non-terminal is used, it's probably because it's part of the expansion, but in this case, the string itself contains 't38', which would have to be a terminal if present in the grammar. Or perhaps 't38' is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the non-terminals and terminals. The string is just a sequence of symbols, and some of them are terminals (like t38, t109, etc.), while others are non-terminals, but I need to check if the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nBut given that 't38' is in the string and in the rules, NT38 \u2192 t102. So 't38' is a non-terminal, and in the string, that's not allowed. Unless the string uses 't38' as a terminal, which isn't in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because it contains 't38', which isn't a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nWait, but looking again, the grammar has all the 't' tokens on the right-hand side. For example, NT45 \u2192 't73' (assuming 't73' is written as 't15' in the transcript? Wait, in the provided grammar, I see NT45->'t73' and other 't's like 't93', 't97', etc. So the string has 't38', which isn't present in any terminal production.

{"custom_id":"request-299","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string to evaluate is \"t4 t53 t97 t76 t27 t4 t114 t48 t29 t126 t42 t93 t53 t76 t48 t87\".\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I see that the rules produce terminal strings, some are terminals, others are still in NT (Non-Terminals). So the string is a sequence of terminals, which should be derivable from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27, etc. So each non-terminal is replaced by two other non-terminals, except some that directly produce terminals like T8, etc.\n\nThe given string is \"t4 t53 t97 t76 t27 t4 t114 t48 t29 t126 t42 t93 t53 t76 t48 t87\". That's a sequence of 16 't' terms, each representing a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some terminals are single-character, like 't8', 't102', etc. But in the string, all are single-letter t followed by numbers. So maybe each terminal is of the form \"tX\", where X is a number.\n\nSo perhaps each \"tX\" is a separate terminal symbol, and the string is a sequence of these.\n\nThe approach would be to parse the string using the grammar's production rules. However, since the grammar is in CNF, it's a right-branching context-free grammar, which is efficient for parsing but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to build the parse tree step by step, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the given string.\n\nBut that might take a lot of steps, so perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, I can check each terminal in the string to see if it's produced by any rule.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the production rules end with terminals. For example, NT7 -> 't93', which is a production from NT7 to the terminal t93. Similarly, NT46 has several production rules: NT46 -> NT28 NT56, but also NT46 -> 't8', etc.\n\nSo each terminal in the string corresponds to a terminal production.\n\nNow, the string is a series of terminals, so each should correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nLet's list the terminals in the string:\n\nt4, t53, t97, t76, t27, t4, t114, t48, t29, t126, t42, t93, t53, t76, t48, t87.\n\nWait, but looking at each of these, I can check if they appear in the production rules as terminal symbols. For example:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't93'\n- NT4 \u2192 't91'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124' and 't102' (multiple productions)\n- NT24 \u2192 't62', 't29', etc.\n- NT46 \u2192 t24, but also terminal rules like t87, etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, each term is like 't53'\u2014do these correspond to any terminal in the grammar?\n\nWait, let's list out all the terminal rules in the grammar:\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't8' \n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124' and 't102'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29', etc.\n- NT46 \u2192 't24', 't13', etc.\n- Many more: 't97', 't93', etc.\n\nLooking for 't53' in these. Wait, do I see any terminal being NT53? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar's terminal rules, I don't immediately see any 't53' production. The closest is NT53 \u2192 't105' and 't3'.\n\nWait, but NT53 appears as a terminal only in other productions like NT44 \u2192 NT38 NT13, etc. But the terminal 't53' is not explicitly listed in the provided grammar's rules. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Scanning through the provided grammar rules, the terminals are:\n\n- t87 is a terminal, as well as others like t93, t76, etc. Wait, but looking for t53: I don't see it listed as a terminal. The closest is NT53 -> 't105' and 't3', as per the rules. So t53 itself is not a terminal, but perhaps it's produced by some other rule.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t53 twice. So if t53 is not a terminal, but a non-terminal, that might be a problem. But that would mean the string was generated with a non-terminal, but in our case, the string consists of terminals.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the grammar's terminal production rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124' and 't102'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29', 't62', 't11', etc.\n- NT38 \u2192 't102' and 't89'\n- NT39 \u2192 't131', 't116'\n- NT8 \u2192 't102'\n- NT10 \u2192 't65'\n- NT21 \u2192 't1'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT41 \u2192 't28'\n- NT55 \u2192 't15'\n- NT6 \u2192 't21', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing t53 in the terminal productions. Is there a rule where NT53 \u2192 't53'? No, according to the provided rules, NT53 is a non-terminal that produces 't3' or 't105'. So NT53 cannot produce 't53' itself. So 't53' is a terminal, which would have to be produced by an NT that directly produces it, but from the grammar, I don't see that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in scanning. Let me look carefully through the entire provided grammar's terminal rules:\n\nLooking for 't53' in the terminals:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't102', 't89'\n- NT44 \u2192 't89', 't13'\n- NT53 \u2192 't105', 't3'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76' (but in the string, it's t76)\n- NT41 \u2192 't5', 't102' (from NT41 \u2192 't8')\nWait, wait, the provided grammar has a production NT41 \u2192 't5' and 't102'?\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nThe provided grammar includes, in part:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't119'\n- NT36 \u2192 't87'\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine all the rules to see if 't53' is produced directly.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, NT53 is present as:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't105'\n- NT53 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo no, the rule NT53 \u2192 't53' is not present. So t53 must be a terminal, but not in any production rule as a terminal. So how can the string contain 't53' if it's a terminal and the grammar doesn't have a production for t53?\n\nThis suggests that either the string is invalid, or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the grammar and production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread a rule. Let's look again for any rule that ends with 't53'.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't102', 't89'\n- NT36 \u2192 't87'\n- NT44 \u2192 't89', 't13'\n- NT53 \u2192 't105', 't3'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76', 't89' (Wait, in the provided grammar, NT28 has rules: 't4','t87' is one,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t4 t58 t24 t52 t2 t34 t126 t109 t53 t112 t117 t4 t105 t114 t102 t102`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, or a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string must be derivable from S using these rules. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some terminal symbols are in uppercase letters (like T9, T10, etc.), and others are lowercase t followed by numbers (like t4, t58, etc.). Each of these lowercase symbols probably corresponds to a terminal in the string.\n\nI notice that the grammar has a lot of production rules. For example, S -> NT1 NT28, meaning S can produce two NTs, each of which can further produce more symbols. Each NT is a non-terminal that eventually leads to a sequence of terminals or other NTs.\n\nThe string given starts with t4, which in the grammar maps to NT1 at production S -> NT1 NT28.

{"custom_id":"request-317","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to analyze. Let me break down what I have and think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's recap what the problem is asking. I have a grammar with various production rules, each starting with a symbol on the left and expanding into other symbols on the right. The start symbol is S, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of t-... tokens. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe grammar is quite long, with multiple production rules. Each symbol on the left is expanded into two symbols on the right, except for the terminals, which are the 't' strings. So, the non-terminals are things like S, N, T, etc., and the terminals are sequences starting with 't'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t119 t117 t89 t89 t4 t114 t116 t42 t40 t112 t48 t109 t122 t42 t40 t91 t21.\n\nHmm, the string is a sequence of t-numbers, which I think are the terminals in the grammar. So, the task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or terminals, but terminals are single symbols. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, in this case, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals or terminals. But terminals are 't' followed by numbers, which can't be further expanded because they don't have production rules. So any terminal in the string must appear directly in some production rule.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again, I notice that some of the rules have terminals on the right side, like NT46 \u2192 't8', etc. So, the 't' strings are terminals, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string begins with t119, so I need to check if there's a production rule that directly has t119 on the right. Looking through the grammar, yes, for example, NT56 \u2192 't112', NT46 \u2192 't53', etc. But when I look for 't119', I don't see any production directly producing it. Wait, let me scan:\n\nLooking through the grammar, most of the rules have 't' numbers, but for example, NT33 \u2192 't79', NT47 \u2192 't40', etc. Hmm, where is t119? Wait, in the list, I see NT31 \u2192 't117', which is in the string. Also, looking for other 't' numbers:\n\nLooking through the grammar, at the end, I see NT29 \u2192 't48' and NT32 \u2192 't66'. Wait, I don't see 't119' appearing directly. But maybe it's part of a production. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT14 \u2192 't79', NT26 \u2192 't98', NT32 \u2192 't66', etc. Wait, looking back, is there any production where t119 is on the right?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any 't119' as a result. Wait, perhaps the string is derived through multiple steps. Each step in the parse must choose a production rule, and the string is a concatenation of terminals produced by these rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to build the parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, so the parse tree would be binary and left-most derivation. So, starting from S, each step expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut given the string is long, it might be easier to break it down into segments that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me see: the string starts with t119. Since t119 is a terminal, in the derivation, it must be produced by some non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminal's production rule includes t119?\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT114 \u2192 't93' and 't114', but I don't see t119. Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me check all the rules again carefully.\n\nWait, looking through the production rules, the following are some examples:\n\nNT14 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't98'\n\nNT32 \u2192 't66'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't102'\n\nWait, perhaps 't119' is part of a longer production. Since everything is in CNF, every step must split into two symbols.\n\nWait, so the initial S expands into NT1 NT1 and then each NT expands.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar. For example, each pair of symbols in the string corresponds to the two symbols in a production rule.\n\nBut wait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each step of the derivation would introduce two new terminals. So the total number of terminals should be equal to the number of steps plus one. Wait, that can't be right because each production is of two symbols, so the length grows by one each time.\n\nWait, let me think: starting from S, which is a non-terminal, each expansion replaces it with two symbols. So if S expands to NT1 NT28, then each of those could expand further. The total number of terminals depends on how many times each non-terminal is expanded.\n\nWait, maybe an alternative approach: the given string has 16 tokens, which is even. Since each production leads to two symbols, the number of symbols should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions. Wait, but the initial S is one symbol, and each step increases the number of symbols by one. So the number of symbols after k productions is k+1.\n\nWait, no, in a binary expansion, each step replaces one symbol with two. Starting with 1 symbol, after 1 step: 2, after 2 steps: 4, etc. So for a string of length N, the number of productions is N-1, but since each step increases the length by 1, the length must be 2^k after k steps starting from 1. But 16 tokens would require 15 steps, which isn't possible because 2^4=16. So maybe the string is 16 symbols, so it's possible because the initial step would take S to 2 symbols, then each of those to 2, etc., leading to 16.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to look for the sequence of symbols in the string and see if each can be formed by the grammar.\n\nSo the string is: t119, t117, t89, t89, t4, t114, t116, t42, t40, t112, t48, t109, t122, t42, t40, t91, t21.\n\nThat's 16 symbols. Let me think about how to derive this.\n\nFirst, find t119. Since t119 is at the beginning, it must be derived from a non-terminal that has a production to t119 as part of its expansion. But looking at the grammar rules, I don't see t119 as a terminal. So perhaps it's an intermediate symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps t119 is part of a longer production. For example, a non-terminal might have a production that includes t119 and another symbol, which is then further expanded. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, none of the non-terminals have a direct production that includes t119. Wait, perhaps t119 is generated by a chain of expansions. Let me think: could any production lead to t119 through multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to see if the string can be divided into segments that match the productions.\n\nWait, another approach: parse the string from the end backwards.\n\nLooking at the end, the last few symbols are t91 and t21. So, maybe the last part of the derivation ends with S \u2192 NT1 NT17, but wait, the last symbol is t21. Hmm, perhaps it's the production NT21 \u2192 t1 (from NT17 in the grammar? Wait, wait, in the grammar, I see NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT20. So that's producing two symbols. Then, each of those symbols would be further expanded.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.

{"custom_id":"request-316","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t107 t63 t3 t102 t21 t53 t119 t21 t58 t120 t120 t58 t42 t4 t24 t93 t21` and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, context-free grammars in CNF have rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is two terminals, except for the start symbol. Looking at the grammar, every production seems to follow that structure with two terminals or non-terminals on the right side, so that's good.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string according to the grammar. The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI should start by looking for the start symbol S in the grammar. From the rules, I see S can produce NT1 NT10 or NT50 NT27. So the derived string should begin with these combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t107, t63, t3,... but I'm not sure if they connect back to S. Maybe I need to break it down step by step.\n\nWait, the string starts with t107. Let's see which rules could produce t107. Looking through the productions, I noticed some rules ending with t, but many produce t's. For example, looking at NT50 -> 't4', NT15 -> 't48', etc. Wait, actually, some non-terminals have productions to specific t-values. Like NT15 -> 't48' which is t48. But t107 is a terminal, so is there a production that leads to t107?\n\nLooking more carefully, I see NT25 -> 't107'. Oh, right, so NT25 can produce t107. So somewhere in the derivation, we might have NT25 on the left side.\n\nBut where does NT25 come from? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any production that has NT25 on the right side except in NT25->'t107'. So to get t107, the previous step must have been a production where NT25 appears on the left.\n\nWait, let me backtrack. The string starts with t107, so the previous non-terminal must be NT25. So before t107, there's another symbol that becomes NT25. So let's say the string is built as ... t25 t107 ...\n\nBut wait, before t25, maybe a non-terminal that expands to both t25 and another symbol. Let's see, for example, NT33 -> 't79' but we have t79 somewhere else maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the string and see all the t's and their positions. Let's list them all:\n\n1. t107\n2. t63\n3. t3\n4. t102\n5. t21\n6. t53\n7. t119\n8. t21\n9. t58\n10. t120\n11. t120\n12. t58\n13. t42\n14. t4\n15. t24\n16. t93\n17. t21\n\nHmm. I think I should start from the beginning and try to match each token with possible expansions in the grammar, moving from left to right, trying to find a derivation path.\n\nStart with t107. The possible expansions: looking for non-terminals that expand to t107. From the grammar, I see NT25 -> 't107'. So that suggests that the rule used is S -> NT25 something? Wait, no. S's rules produce two non-terminals. So unless we're in the middle of a larger expansion, perhaps the string starts with a symbol that begins with S expanding into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a series of productions. Let's model it as a parse tree, trying to see if each token can be generated starting from S.\n\nLet me list the string tokens again:\n\nt107, t63, t3, t102, t21, t53, t119, t21, t58, t120, t120, t58, t42, t4, t24, t93, t21.\n\nLet me see what these tokens correspond to in the grammar.\n\nt107: Only NT25 -> 't107'.\n\nt63: Looking through the grammar, is there any rule that produces 63? Hmm, maybe. Let's check NT64 for t62? Or perhaps NT24? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals have t-values. Let me check:\n\nNT26 -> 't48'\n\nNT19 -> 't58'\n\nNT0 -> 't50'\n\nNT7 -> 't24'\n\nNT1 -> 't25'\n\nNT3 -> 't42'\n\nWait, but t63 is not appearing in the t-values listed. Maybe I misread the grammar; perhaps looking again...\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nNT47 -> 't3'\n\nWait, that's t3. So NT47 can produce 't3'.\n\nt63: Hmm, is there a non-terminal that can produce t63? Wait, t63 is t62 shifted perhaps, but I don't see any rule with 't63'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe t63 comes from a particular non-terminal? Let me see: NT17 -> 't94', which is t94. Wait, but t63 isn't there. Maybe another path.\n\nWait, maybe the string is not built correctly. Or perhaps I need to look deeper. Maybe through some chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe it's better to approach this with a context-free grammar parser, but since I can't do that right now, I need to simulate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is longer than what's possible with the given grammar. Since each step in the production adds two symbols, perhaps I need to count the total number of symbols and see if it's a possible derivation from S.\n\nThe string has 17 tokens. Since S is the start, and each production step doubles the number of symbols (since each rule produces two parts), the length of the derived string should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions. However, this starts with S-> NT1 NT10, which adds two symbols, then each of those could be NTs that add more symbols, etc. So the total number of symbols after all productions is not necessarily a power of two, but depending on the structure.\n\nBut 17 is not a power of two minus one (since 2^n -1 would be 15, 31, etc.), so perhaps the string length is longer, but the grammar allows for that, as long as the expansion is correct.\n\nWait, but the string is given as a sequence of symbols, so each step adds one symbol, but in the grammar, each production adds two symbols. No, wait. The string is the entire expansion, each step adds symbols based on the rule. Each rule is applied as a substitution, potentially increasing the string length.\n\nWait, perhaps the length of the string is determined by the number of steps taken from S. Each application of a rule increases the string length by one (since from one symbol to two). So if we start with S, which is one symbol, then after one step, it's two symbols, then three, then four, etc. So the total string length should be an odd number after each substitution, but in this case, the string has 17 symbols, which is odd. That might be okay.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's sufficient. It's more important to see whether the sequence can be generated step by step.\n\nLet me try to map the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: t107 t63 t3 t102 t21 t53 t119 t21 t58 t120 t120 t58 t42 t4 t24 t93 t21.\n\nFirst token is t107, which must be derived from NT25. So somewhere in the expansion, we have NT25. Let's look at how NT25 can be expanded. In the grammar, I see NT25 -> 't107', so that's the only production for NT25. Therefore, before t107, there must be a non-terminal NT25.\n\nSo the string must look like ... NT25 t107 ... But in the given string, the next token after t107 is t63. So before NT25, there's another token, which would be something that eventually becomes NT25. Wait, but that can't be because t107 is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky normal form. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol seems to be S because the first two productions are S -> NT1 NT50 and S -> NT50 NT27. So S is the starting point.\n\nThe string to check is: `t4 t53 t17 t89 t38 t16 t114 t48 t131 t58 t53 t53 t53 t21 t81 t120 t42 t93`.\n\nI remember that each production in the grammar eventually reduces to terminal symbols. So every non-terminal in the string must be replaced by two other symbols, following the grammar rules.\n\nLet me see the end of the string to backtrack. The last symbol is t93. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT7 -> 't93' and NT17 -> 't93'. Also, NT47 -> 't3' and other symbols might lead to t93. Wait, t93 could come from NT7 or NT17.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first production is S -> NT1 NT50. So S would start by expanding into NT1 and NT50. Let's see what NT1 can produce. Looking up in the grammar, NT1 -> NT25 NT17.\n\nNow, NT25 -> NT6 NT31, and NT6 -> NT54 NT6. Hmm, that seems like it could lead to cycles. Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT6 has two productions: NT6 -> NT54 NT6 and NT6 -> 't58'. Wait, but when I look back at the grammar, it's listed as NT6 -> NT54 NT6 and also NT6 -> 't54 NT6'. Wait, actually, no, looking again, it's NT6 -> 't54 NT6' but from the provided grammar, I see that NT6 has two rules? Or perhaps I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT6 -> NT54 NT6\nNT6 -> 't58'\n\nAh, so NT6 can be either NT54 NT6 or 't58'. So when we see a t58 in the string, it's produced by NT6.\n\nIn our string, the early parts include t4, t53, t17, etc. Let me try to find where t4 comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t4 is from NT4 -> 't91' and NT39 -> 't131', and others like NT24 -> 't29', but also NT46 -> 't14' and NT15 -> 't48'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the terminals are: t10, t2, t4, t5, t8, t16, t17, t19, t21, t22, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t29, t31, t32, t33, t35, t36, t37, t38, t39, t40, t41, t42, t43, t44, t45, t46, t47, t48, t50, t53, t55, t56, t58, t60 (I think), but looking at the given grammar, the terminal symbols are t10, t2, t4, t5, t8, t16, t17, t19, t21, t22, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t29, t31, t32, t33, t35, t36, t37, t38, t39, t40, t41, t42, t43, t44, t45, t46, t47, t48, t50, t53, t55, t56, t58, t6, and others. Hmm, the grammar ends up producing terminals like t4, t53, t17, etc.\n\nSo the string is a series of terminals: t4, t53, t17, t89, t38, t16, t114, t48, t131, t58, t53, t53, t53, t21, t81, t120, t42, t93.\n\nI'll try to map this string to the grammar by starting from the start symbol S and expanding step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT50 (S's first production)\n2. NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n3. NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n4. NT6 \u2192 't58' or NT54 NT6. Looking at the string, the first t is t4, so let me see where that comes in.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's break down the string into parts and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking for t53, which could come from NT50, as NT50 \u2192 't50' but also from other productions? Wait, in the grammar, looking at NT50, do I see any production that leads to t53? Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT50 producing t53. Instead, NT50 is only in S's productions as S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So S produces NT50 NT27, and NT50 is used there. Hmm, maybe t50 comes from NT50.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t4 comes t53, then t17. Let me think about how these might fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each terminal in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that ends up producing that terminal through multiple steps. Let me try to map this in reverse.\n\nThe last symbol is t93. As I saw earlier, t93 is from NT7 and NT17. Let me assume it comes from NT17. Then, I can backtrack using NT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- The last step is NT17 \u2192 t93 and NT53.\n\nNow, the symbol before t93 is t58. Let's see if t58 is from NT6, which can be NT54 NT6 or 't58'. So let's take t58 as 't58' from NT6.\n\nContinuing backward, before t58 is t42. Let's see where t42 comes from. Looking at the grammar, t42 is from NT24 \u2192 't29' (from earlier, wait, no: in the grammar, I think NT24 is NT24 \u2192 't29', but according to the detailed grammar provided, at the bottom, NT24 has multiple definitions, one of which is 't29'. Alternatively, looking earlier, I think I made a mistake. Let's re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking carefully, I see lines like:\n\nNT24 -> 't29'\nNT46 -> 't14'\nNT46 -> 't27'\nNT22 -> 't128'\nNT46 -> 't46'\nWait, no, actually, in the later parts of the grammar, there are definitions that have 'tX' like NT46 -> 't73', but in the detailed lines, it's written as:\n\nLooking at the detailed grammar, towards the end:\n\nNT46 -> 't73' I think? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the detailed grammar provided:\n\nNT46 -> 't8'\nNT...\n...\nNT46 -> 't27'\n...\nNT16 -> 't83'\n...\nNT42 -> 't2'\n...\nNT24 -> 't29'\n...\nSo, NT42 can produce t2, which is one of the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of the non-terminals and their productions to better track this.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe it's better to see whether the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's non-terminal productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to model the string as a series of steps in the grammar. Let's assume S \u2192 NT1 NT50, so the first two elements of the string should be generated by NT1 and NT50.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t4. So where can t4 come from? Let's look at the grammar. \n\nLooking for productions that result in 't4', I see in the grammar NT4 \u2192 't91',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-332","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure. The string in question is `t107 t114 t93 t120 t24 t2 t45 t128 t58 t42 t4 t62 t119 t36 t27 t38 t48 t21`. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the string into individual components: t107, t114, t93, t120, t24, t2, t45, t128, t58, t42, t4, t62, t119, t36, t27, t38, t48, t21. \n\nI notice that the grammar has several terminals (like 't8', 't93', 't58', etc.) and non-terminals (like S, NT36, NT53, etc.) in the productions. Some of the non-terminals are transformed into these terminal strings. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some NT symbols directly produce terminal tokens. For example, NT6 can produce 't58', and NT7 can produce 't93'. These look like they might be part of the string's tokens.\n\nI'll start from the start symbol S and see if the string can be parsed step by step. The grammar starts with S -> NT1 NT28 or S -> NT50 NT27. So the first step would produce two non-terminals: NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t107. Let's see which non-terminals can produce that. From the grammar, NT25 can produce 't107', so maybe S starts with NT25. Wait, no. S's options are NT1 and NT28. So the first symbols after S would be NT1 and NT28. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at which non-terminals can generate the tokens in the string. Let's see:\n\nt107: only NT25 can produce this.\nt114: looking at the grammar, NT24 produces 't114'. \nt93: NT15 can produce 't93'.\nt120: NT22 can produce 't120'. \nt24: NT11 can produce 't24'.\nt2: looking at the grammar, NT2 can produce 't2'.\nt45: NT23 can produce 't45'.\nt128: NT22 can produce 't128'. \nt58: NT6 or NT25 can produce this, but since we're parsing from S, perhaps it's from NT25. \nt42: NT14 can produce 't42'.\nt4: NT4 can produce 't4'.\nt62: NT23 can produce 't62'.\nt119: NT17 can produce 't119'.\nt36: NT12 can produce 't36'.\nt27: NT9 can produce 't27'.\nt38: NT41 can produce 't38'.\nt48: NT10 can produce 't48'.\nt21: NT1 can produce 't21'.\n\nWait, the last token is t21. From the grammar, NT1 can produce 't21', so that fits. So the string seems to have tokens produced by various NTs. Now, I need to see if these NTs can be connected through the grammar rules.\n\nBut it's a bit complicated because the string is a sequence of tokens, which are the results of the NTs' productions. The grammar defines how the NTs can expand into other NTs or terminals. Each step in the derivation replaces a single NT with two NTs or a terminal. So the entire string is a series of terminal symbols, each produced by an NT.\n\nWait, but in a typical CFG, the derivation starts with S and replaces non-terminals until all are terminals. Here, the string is a direct leftmost derivation, assuming that each NT directly produces a terminal in the string. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the string represents the derivation in reverse, meaning each step combines two NTs into one until reaching S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is the sequence of symbols in the parse tree. Either way, I need to see if there's a way to derive this string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the tokens form a valid parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two symbols. So each token in the string must be the result of a binary expansion. Let me try to map the possible NTs to tokens:\n\nt107 is produced by NT25. So in the derivation, there must be a NT25 that expands into t107.\nt114 is produced by NT24.\nt93 is produced by NT15.\nt120 is produced by NT22.\nt24 is produced by NT11.\nt2 is produced by NT2?\nt45 is produced by NT23.\nt128 is produced by NT22.\nt58 is produced by NT6 or NT25. Since here, if we have NT25 expanding into t107, but it's followed by t114, which is NT24, maybe NT25 is generating the first token, then it's split into NT24 and something else.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to see if the string can be derived by the grammar step by step. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe first token is t107. From the grammar, the only NT that can produce this is NT25. So in the derivation, S must expand into something that includes NT25 as the first symbol. Looking at S's options, S can be NT1 and NT28, or NT50 and NT27. If the first NT is NT25, but S is NT1 and NT28, perhaps NT25 is one of the terminal symbols in the first NT1. Alternatively, perhaps the first NT is NT50 and NT27, but NT50 can produce 't38' and 't39', or 't39' and 't24'. Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider each token in the string and see which NTs they can come from, then see if they can be connected through the grammar. But this might take a long time.\n\nWait, another thought: since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So the entire string must have been derived by a series of such splits. Each split would replace a non-terminal with two others, until all are terminals.\n\nGiven that, the number of symbols in the string must be a certain length based on the number of splits. For a CFG in CNF, the number of symbols in the string should be (number of productions) + 1. For example, the start symbol S would generate two symbols, then each of those could generate two each, etc. But I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, the length of the string must be equal to a certain power of 2. Let me count the tokens in the string: t107, t114, t93, t120, t24, t2, t45, t128, t58, t42, t4, t62, t119, t36, t27, t38, t48, t21. That's 18 tokens. For a CFG in CNF, the possible lengths are 2^n, starting from 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. But 18 is not a power of 2. Hmm, that might indicate an error.\n\nWait, maybe the string can be split into parse trees. For example, the string could be built by combining non-terminals step by step. Let me try to group the tokens:\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t107, t114. Maybe they come from NT25 and NT24, which are connected through S's rule. NT25 produces t107, and NT24 produces t114, so S would be NT1 and NT28, where NT1 -> NT25 and NT28 -> NT24? Wait, no, because S's production is NT1 and NT28. So S would be NT1 and NT28 expanding into their children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated by a series of productions applied in a certain order. But maybe the string length doesn't fit, as 18 is not a power of 2, which might mean it's invalid.\n\nWait, wait. The length of the string is 18, which can be expressed as 16 +2."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some production terminals are listed, like 't87', 't105', 't93', 't2', 't58', 't65', etc. These are the base productions where a non-terminal (NT) directly produces a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me list all the NTs that produce terminals:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't8'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT46 \u2192 't8'\n- NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- NT14 \u2192 't79' (Wait, no, NT14 \u2192 't79' is written, so NT14 can produce t79)\n- NT26 \u2192 't62'\n- NT46 \u2192 't27'\n- NT1 \u2192 't69'\n- NT41 \u2192 't52'\n- NT48 \u2192 't24'\n- NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- NT47 \u2192 't3'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT41 \u2192 't4'\n- NT32 \u2192 't66'\n- NT10 \u2192 't50'\n- NT34 \u2192 't37'\n- NT47 \u2192 't40'\n- NT21 \u2192 't3'\n- NT36 \u2192 't87'\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT47 \u2192 't41'\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT15 \u2192 't48'\n- NT29 \u2192 't14'\n- NT6 \u2192 't21'\n- NT49 \u2192 't109'\n- NT33 \u2192 't79'\n- NT36 \u2192 't120'\n- NT38 \u2192 't102'\n- NT39 \u2192 't131'\n- NT14 \u2192 't58'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT10 \u2192 't17'\n- NT48 \u2192 't70'\n- NT27 \u2192 't116'\n- NT30 \u2192 't111'\n- NT43 \u2192 't69'\n- NT43 \u2192 't27'\n- NT42 \u2192 't82'\n- NT6 \u2192 't120'\n- NT1 \u2192 't28'\n- NT33 \u2192 't36'\n- NT8 \u2192 't102'\n- NT10 \u2192 't65'\n- NT21 \u2192 't1'\n- NT38 \u2192 't123'\n- NT15 \u2192 't93'\n- NT4 \u2192 't91'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28'\n- NT26 \u2192 't98'\n- NT32 \u2192 't59'\n- NT19 \u2192 't126'\n- NT46 \u2192 't76'\n- NT56 \u2192 't134'\n- NT3 \u2192 't42'\n- NT45 \u2192 't73'\n- NT28 \u2192 't97'\n- NT44 \u2192 't114'\n- NT24 \u2192 't122'\n- NT46 \u2192 't100'\n- NT16 \u2192 't83'\n- NT13 \u2192 't135'\n- NT46 \u2192 't14'\n- NT7 \u2192 't79'\n- NT38 \u2192 't53'\n- NT36 \u2192 't59'\n- NT44 \u2192 't89'\n- NT55 \u2192 't15'\n- NT54 \u2192 't81'\n- NT14 \u2192 't4'\n- NT1 \u2192 't5'\n- NT31 \u2192 't117'\n- NT42 \u2192 't80'\n- NT10 \u2192 't42'\n- NT55 \u2192 't36'\n- NT15 \u2192 't87'\n- NT43 \u2192 't89'\n- NT17 \u2192 't63'\n- NT24 \u2192 't11'\n- NT0 \u2192 't126'\n- NT29 \u2192 't31'\n- NT50 \u2192 't38'\n- NT25 \u2192 't107'\n- NT6 \u2192 't119'\n- NT32 \u2192 't108'\n- NT22 \u2192 't128'\n- NT29 \u2192 't116'\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n- NT47 \u2192 't4'\n\nNow, let's look at the given string: `t4 t81 t17 t34 t79 t134 t134 t112 t16 t24 t102 t1 t134 t48 t53 t120 t48 t63 t48`.\n\nI can try to find a path from the start symbol S through the grammar, applying the productions to generate this string.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols: t4 and t81.

So no direct t4. Hmm, so where does t4 come from?\n\nWait, looking at NT38 \u2192 t102, which is not t4. Another option is NT28 \u2192 t76, but not t4. OR maybe NT46 \u2192 t8, not t4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, let's check the terminal productions again. I see NT1 \u2192 't69' and 't28'. So no NT directly produces t4. But in the string, the first symbol is t4. So unless the first NT is NT1 which can be followed by another production, but since NT1 only directly gives t69 or t28, it seems impossible for t4 to come directly.\n\nWait, but wait.

{"custom_id":"request-350","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which usually makes parsing easier, but I can't parse it right now. I'll have to see if I can break down the problem differently.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. They all are either terminals (like 't' followed by a number) or non-terminals. The non-terminals seem to be combining in specific ways, perhaps leading to sequences of 't' strings when expanded.\n\nThe provided string is: `t107 t114 t31 t21 t58 t120 t53 t81 t120 t58 t53 t21 t119 t81 t119 t42 t3 t102 t102`.\n\nI notice that this string consists of multiple 't' parts. Each 't' followed by a number is likely to be a terminal produced by a non-terminal in the grammar. So, I need to check if the sequence of these 't' terms can be generated by the start symbol S through a series of derivations.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production rules start with NT. Each production rule for S and other non-terminals seem to lead into other non-terminals until eventually, they produce these 't' terms.\n\nI should try to see if each part of the string can be matched by the grammar. But with so many non-terminals and production rules, this will take time.\n\nLet me try to list out what each non-terminal might produce:\n\n1. S -> NT1 NT28\n   The non-terminals NT1 and NT28 each produce certain sequences.\n\nLooking at NT1's production:\n- NT1 can go to NT25 NT17. Hmm, not sure about those. Wait, there's a rule for NT17: NT17 -> NT44 NT53. Then NT44 and NT53 might produce more sequences.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should track specific 't' terms. Let me see which non-terminals produce which 't's.\n\nLooking for 't107': There's a rule NT25 -> NT6 NT31. NT6 is 't58' as per NT6 -> 't58'. So NT25 would be something else. Wait, check NT25.\n\nWait, NT25 can produce NT6 NT31, which is 't58' and NT31. NT31 has NT32 and others. NT32 is 't108'. But the string starts with t107, so perhaps we have a chain leading from something else.\n\nWait, maybe looking for rules that directly produce 't's.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT46 -> 't8' (Wait, no, NT46 has a rule 't87'. Wait, actually:\n\nLooking more carefully, some non-terminals directly produce 't' terms. For example:\n\nNT36 -> 't87'\n\nNT6 -> 't58'\n\nNT46 -> 't76'\n\nNT56 -> 't112'\n\nNT47 -> 't4'\n\nNT14 -> 't79'\n\nNT28 -> 't76'\n\nWait, I'm looking for 't107'. Let's see where 't107' comes from.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, maybe NT25 produces 't107'? Let's check NT25:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT25: NT25 -> NT6 NT31. Then NT6 -> 't58', and NT31 can go to NT32 NT21, etc.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me search for which non-terminal directly produces 't107':\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't107'. Wait, maybe it's derived further down.\n\nWait, maybe the derivation is such that a non-terminal reduces to 't107' through several steps.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if each 't' in the string is accounted for by a production chain.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which splits into two non-terminals, say A and B: S -> AB.\n\nEach of these A and B must then produce a sequence of 't's. So the overall string is A's sequence concatenated with B's sequence.\n\nLooking at the string, it has 20 't's. Let me count them:\n\nt107, t114, t31, t21, t58, t120, t53, t81, t120, t58, t53, t21, t119, t81, t119, t42, t3, t102, t102.\n\n20 't's. So, the grammar must split into two parts that produce 10 or 10+10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each non-terminal produces a certain number of 't's.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: each production in the grammar is two non-terminals, and the string can be seen as a tree where each node splits into two parts until we reach a terminal.\n\nWait, but the string is a flat list of terminals, so it's a linear sequence. That suggests that each split might occur on certain points, building the string.\n\nBut maybe the string can be broken into two parts that each correspond to the two non-terminals of the S rule.\n\nFor example, S -> NT1 NT28, so the string should consist of the expansion of NT1 followed by the expansion of NT28.\n\nLet's see: the full string is 20 't's. Let me consider the first few and see if they can correspond to NT1 and then NT28.\n\nBut without knowing exactly which non-terminal produces which part, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if each production leads to a specific 't' when fully expanded.\n\nBut I think this is going to take a long time, as each rule depends on others.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if any of the 't's are directly produced by some non-terminal, and then see if the structure before and after can be built from other productions.\n\nFor instance, the last 't' is t102. Looking at the grammar for 't102':\n\nIn the production rules, I see NT14 -> 't79', but not 't102'. Wait, looking for 't102':\n\nLooking, for example, at NT39: NT39 -> 't131'. No, that's not it. Wait, perhaps NT8 -> 't102'?\n\nLooking: NT38 -> 't102', yes! So NT38 can produce 't102'.\n\nSo, the last two 't's are t102 t102. So, does any production rule end with NT38 twice? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT38 is a terminal? No, it's a non-terminal. Because in the grammar, NT38 has rules, but within the string, 't102' appears. So, the last two 't's must come from two NT38's.\n\nSo, the end of the string is NT38 -> 't102' followed by NT38 -> 't102'.\n\nSo, that suggests that the grammar must have two NT38s at the end. So, the expansion for S must have the last part lead to NT38 NT38.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the last two 't's come from a single NT that expands into two 't's, but I don't see such a rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last part is a single NT that expands into a string ending with two 't's.\n\nWait, let me check NT14: NT14 -> 't79', but that's one 't'.\n\nLooking, is there any non-terminal that directly expands into 't102'? Yes, NT38: NT38 -> 't102'.\n\nSo, to have 't102 t102' at the end, you'd need a production that goes to NT38 and then another NT38. But in the grammar, does any rule have NT38 on the left-hand side?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT38, it seems NT38 is a non-terminal, not a terminal, but in the string, it's 't102', a terminal. So, NT38 must expand into 't102'.\n\nIs there a non-terminal that can produce 't102' followed by 't102'?

The grammar is structured in CNF, meaning every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nI notice that the string starts with `t38`. Let me check if there are any non-terminals that directly produce `t38`. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT38 has a production `NT38 -> NT44 NT32`, `NT38 -> NT44 NT13`, and `NT38 also has `NT38 -> NT44 NT32 | NT44 NT13`, but I don't see a rule where NT38 directly produces `t38`.\n\nWait, are there any rules with `t38` as a terminal? Yes, looking at the end of the grammar:\n\n- `NT44 -> t114`\n- `NT46 -> t76`\n- `NT32 -> t66`\n- And others, but I don't see a rule where NT38 directly produces `t38` or other `t` values.\n\nWait, maybe there is a mistake. Let me scan the grammar again. Yes, I see that under `NT0`: `NT0 -> NT31 NT50`. Not helpful.\n\nWait, the string has `t38`, `t81`, etc. Let me check each non-terminal to see if they can produce these. For instance, `t81` appears in multiple grammar rules:\n\n- NT49: `NT49 -> t109` (No)\n- NT35: `NT35 -> t37`, `t10`, etc. (No)\n- NT17: `t94` (No)\n- Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each non-terminal for terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT6: `NT6 -> t54 NT6` and `NT6 -> t54 t6`. Hmm, wait: `NT6 -> t58`? No, let me check again. Actually, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through all the definitions, I see several non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT46 -> 't7' \u2013 wait, no, looking again: \n\nWait, the last few rules in the grammar are:\n\n- NT46 -> 't8' \u2013 No, actually, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the last few lines:\n\n- NT46: has `t73`, `t27`, etc.\nWait, perhaps I'm lost. Maybe it's better to approach this systematically.\n\nThe string is a series of `t` terms, which represent terminal symbols that the grammar can produce. To check if the string is in the language, we can try to parse it using the grammar.\n\nThe string is of length 20. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production applies to a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, the number of productions needed would be logarithmic in the length, but since parsing manually is tedious, perhaps it's better to simulate the process.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of the parse tree. Each non-terminal split produces two parts, either non-terminals or terminals. So, for each `tX` in the string, we need to find a non-terminal that can produce it directly or through a chain of productions.\n\nLet me check each `t` in the string:\n\n- `t38`: Does any non-terminal have a production to `t38`? Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT38 has production to NT44 and NT32, or NT44 and NT13. So, it doesn't directly produce `t38`. Checking other non-terminals:\n\nLooking for any rule where NT38 appears in the RHS and the RHS is a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, I see rules like NT45 -> 't87', but that's NT45 directly producing 't87'. Similarly, there are other rules with 't' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the point. Each non-terminal that produces terminals does so directly. So, I need to list all non-terminals that have at least one production ending in a terminal.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I can list them:\n\nFrom the grammar lines:\n\n- NT45 -> 't87' \u2013 so NT45 produces 't87'\n- NT24 -> 't29'\n- NT19 -> 't79' (Wait, no, looking again: NT19 has `t79` in some rule?)\nWait, the grammar lines:\n\nLooking for any production that has a terminal on the RHS, not as a part of another production.\n\nWait, I think I need to list all non-terminals that produce terminals directly:\n\n- NT46 -> 't76'\n- NT35 -> 't59'\n- NT36 -> 't87'\n- NT6 -> 't54 NT6' \u2013 no, because it's followed by another NT.\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT6 appears as NT6 -> 't54 NT6' and 't54 t6'. Hmm, perhaps NT6 can produce 't54' followed by 't54 NT6', which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note all terminals in the RHS of the productions:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT4 -> 't91'\n- NT15 -> 't48'\n- NT29 -> 't48'\n- NT6 -> 't54 NT6' and 't54 t6' \u2192 so 't54' is a terminal part.\nWait, 't54' is a terminal in NT6's production.\n\nBut in the string, I have t53, t58, etc. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to attempt to parse the string step by step, seeing if the grammar can generate it.\n\nThe string is: t38 t81 t97 t36 t69 t38 t102 t119 t53 t81 t81 t119 t120 t81 t120 t119 t42 t38 t94 t93.\n\nEach token is a terminal that must be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens:\n\n1. t38\n2. t81\n3. t97\n4. t36\n5. t69\n6. t38\n7. t102\n8. t119\n9. t53\n10. t81\n11. t81\n12. t119\n13. t120\n14. t81\n15. t120\n16. t119\n17. t42\n18. t38\n19. t94\n20. t93\n\nNow, each of these must be the result of a production. Let's attempt to assign non-terminals to these t's.\n\nStart with the first token, t38. To get t38, there must be some rule in the grammar where a non-terminal A produces t38. Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see any such rule. For example, NT38 is defined as NT44 followed by NT32 or NT13, so NT38 can't produce t38 directly. So, perhaps t38 is produced by a non-terminal that's derived through other steps.\n\nWait, maybe t38 is produced by a non-terminal that is part of a longer chain. For example, maybe some non-terminal that eventually reduces to t38. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider how the grammar's starting symbol S can derive the string. S is initially the root.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n- S -> NT1 NT28\n- S -> NT50 NT27\n\nSo, any derivation starts with either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nAssuming T38 is produced by NT38, which is not directly producing t38, but let's see. NT38 is used in NT38's production, but perhaps through another path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's sequence can be broken down into parts where each part is a subtree of the parse tree.\n\nBut this approach might take too long manually. Maybe I should consider using a stack-based approach to see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an easier way.

It's a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, most of the productions seem to have non-terminals on both sides, except for some like `NT45 -> 't8'`, `NT46 -> 't24'`, etc. So, these are the terminals.\n\nThe main non-terminal is S.

Let me check each production correctly.)\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nI'll scan each production for when the RHS simplifies to a single terminal (ignoring other non-terminals). \n\nWait, in the provided grammar, many productions have non-terminals on both sides. So, perhaps the terminals are only those that appear as right-hand sides of non-terminals directly. So, looking at each production, if the RHS is a single terminal, then that production is the only way that non-terminal can produce that specific terminal.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, many are in the form NT -> NT NT, so only some produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT45 -> 't8' \u2192 so NT45 can produce 't8'.\n- NT46 -> 't24' \u2192 NT46 can produce 't24'.\n- NT17 -> 't94' \u2192 Because there's a production NT17 -> 't94' in the given.\n- NT28 -> 't76' \u2192 Wait, no, checking: NT28 has production NT28 -> 't76'? No, in the given grammar, I don't see NT28 -> 't76'; perhaps I'm confusing.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the given productions:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- `NT45 -> 't8'`\n- `NT46 -> 't24'`\n- `NT38 -> 't102'` (Wait, no, looking at the full list, I don't see any NTs directly generating 't38'. Let me check.)\n\nI need to check all productions to see if any produce a single character. Let me make a list:\n\n- NT45 -> 't8' \u2192 produces t8\n- NT46 -> 't24' \u2192 t24\n- NT38 -> 't102' \u2192 Hmm, wait, no, checking through all the provided productions, perhaps some other NTs maybe generate t38. Wait, let me look through a few:\n\nWait, looking further, I notice:\n\n- NT43 -> NT8 NT3 \u2192 both are non-terminals\n- NT38 doesn't have a direct production to t38; perhaps it's generated via multiple steps. Wait, perhaps 't38' comes from NT38 being part of a production chain.\n\nWait, I might be overcomplicating this. Perhaps instead of trying to track how each t is generated, I should attempt a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet's list the string again: `t38 t109 t28 t114 t14 t119 t42 t114 t2 t120 t112 t89 t38 t94 t89 t38 t63 t93 t89 t98`\n\nSince S is the start symbol, and S has productions:\n\n- S -> NT1 NT28\n- S -> NT50 NT27\n\nEach of NT1, NT28, NT50, NT27 must be expanded into sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps the initial part is derived from NT1 or NT50 or NT27, etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as a parse tree and see if the given string is a valid derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the entire process as a series of productions.\n\nWait, maybe this is too long, but perhaps I can find the relevant productions that can generate each token in the string, considering that each token is the result of a production.\n\nWait, let me make a list of the productions that directly generate terminals:\n\n- NT45 -> 't8'\n- NT46 -> 't24'\n\nAdditionally, let's look for other NT productions where the RHS includes these terminal cases, but that seems unlikely because most RHS of NTs are pairs of NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps 't109' comes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-398","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and string are pretty complex, so I'll need to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CFG) consists of productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. The provided grammar fits this because each production starts with a single non-terminal on the left, and the right-hand side is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to verify is: `t38 t131 t42 t123 t76 t134 t93 t53 t126 t109 t81 t40 t15 t114 t76 t87 t111 t4 t42 t17 t108`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t38, which is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce these t's. For example, NT33 -> t79, and NT44 -> t89, which are terminals. But I need to see how t38 is generated.\n\nLooking through the productions, I find NT38 -> t102, NT47 -> t40, NT14 -> t79, but wait, I don't see a direct production for t38. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, NT38 is defined as NT44 NT13. Then NT44 is NT38 NT13, and NT13 is NT43 NT26. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which can produce NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. I'll assume the first production, so S => NT1 NT28. Now, NT1 is defined as NT25 NT17. NT25 is NT6 NT31, and NT6 is NT54 NT6. Wait, that's an issue because NT6 can produce a string that starts with t54, but t54 is a terminal. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree from the string backwards. Since the string starts with t38, I'll look for productions that result in t38. From the grammar, NT38 is NT44 NT13, and both NT44 and NT13 have their own productions.\n\nNT44 is NT38 NT13, which leads to an infinite loop unless I find a way to break it. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to find the correct productions that lead to the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for each t in the string and see if there's a production path that generates it. Let's take the first t38. Looking for a production that directly results in t38: NT38 -> NT44 NT13. But then I need to see how t44 and t13 are generated.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT38 is defined as NT44 NT13, which is a chain. That doesn't seem right because that would mean NT38 is producing non-terminals, not terminals. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking closely, I see that NT38 is actually defined as NT44 NT13, but in the productions, I don't see NT38 -> t. So perhaps t38 is not a terminal but a non-terminal. That's a contradiction because in the string, it's 't38' which is a terminal symbol in the input string. That would mean there's a problem because, according to the grammar, t38 isn't a terminal.\n\nWait, this suggests I might have misread the grammar. Let me recheck the productions:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any that directly produce NT38 as a terminal. For example, NT38 is defined as NT44 NT13, which are non-terminals. So that would mean t38 isn't a terminal in the grammar. But the string has t38, which would make it invalid according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Maybe some of these non-terminals eventually derive into terminals, but in this case, from what I can see, the only way to produce a terminal is via direct productions. Since NT38's only production is to NT44 NT13, which are also non-terminals, that would mean t38 can't be produced as a terminal. So any string containing 't38' would automatically be invalid according to the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing a production that I thought wasn't there. Let me scan again. Oh, here's NT38: it's defined as NT44 NT13. So no direct terminal production. So that means t38 is not part of the language. Therefore, the string containing t38 can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made an error in looking. Let me check each NT for terminal productions. For example, NT36 -> t87, right? So some non-terminals have terminal productions. But others, like NT38, don't. So since t38 appears in the string, the string is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-393","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Looking at the grammar, all the rules seem to follow this structure, so that's a good start.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t38 t109 t28 t123 t126 t102 t42 t38 t28 t94 t58 t42 t112 t8 t31 t21 t81 t58 t120 t42 t83`.\n\nIn CNF grammars, terminals and non-terminals alternate starting with a non-terminal. So each step in the derivation starts with a non-terminal and expands into two non-terminals, which eventually lead to terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if I can derive it starting from the initial symbol S.\n\nThe initial symbol is S. Looking at the grammar, S can produce two options: NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nSo, starting with S, let's see if we can produce the given string.\n\nFirst, let's look at the given string and see which symbols appear. The terminals are t38, t109, t28, t123, t126, t102, t42, t38, t28, t94, t58, t42, t112, t8, t31, t21, t81, t58, t120, t42, t83. \n\nI notice that the first symbol is t38. Let me check which productions lead to t38.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see productions like NT32 -> NT15 NT13, NT15 -> NT56 NT15, etc. Wait, maybe I should look for rules that directly produce t38.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT38 is a non-terminal? Or are those t's part of the terminal symbols? Wait, the production rules all end with NT followed by numbers, like NT36 -> NT56 NT10, etc. Then there are rules like NT47 -> 't8', so some NTs produce 't' followed by a number, which are terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, when a rule ends with a string like 't8', that's a terminal symbol. So for example, NT47 -> 't8' is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT38 has several rules, but let me check NT44, NT43, etc. Wait, perhaps looking for any non-terminals that produce t38 directly.\n\nWait, I see that NT47 -> 't8', and there are rules like NT28 -> 't76', NT38 -> 't102', etc. Hmm, maybe NT38 can produce 't102' or other 't's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to parse it by checking each step.\n\nLet me start by considering the first two symbols: t38 and t109.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each expansion step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the entire string is built by expanding S into two non-terminals, each of which then expand into pairs, and so on until all are terminals.\n\nSo, the initial step is S -> NT1 NT28 or S -> NT50 NT27. Whichever is the case, the string must be a combination of expansions from one of these or the other.\n\nBut given the string length is 20, let's see how many symbols would be generated. Each production step increases the count by one. So starting from S (1 symbol), each expansion doubles the count? Wait, no: each non-terminal becomes two, so if you have a string of length n, you need n-1 splits.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of parsing the string back to the start.\n\nLet me see, t38 is the first symbol. Let's check if any rule produces t38 as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT44 -> t114, NT38 -> t102, etc. Alternatively, some rules might have t38 as a terminal? Wait, in the grammar, I don't see any rule where the production ends with t38. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules: NT34 -> t37, NT48 -> t102, NT44 -> t37, wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps NT44 has a production that leads to t38? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT44 -> NT38 NT13, but is any production for NT38 leading to a 't'? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking at NT38's rules, I see NT38 -> t102, which is a terminal. Hmm, so NT38 can produce t102. But the first symbol is t38, so unless there's a production where NT38 produces t38 directly, which I don't see.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the production rules. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nLooking carefully, I notice that some rules have the form NT... -> 't...', which I think means the NT directly produces that terminal. For example:\n\nNT47 -> 't8'\n\nNT28 -> 't76'\n\nNT38 -> 't102'\n\nSimilarly, NT24 -> 't11'\n\nOther rules like NT38 -> 't102' produce a terminal.\n\nSo, to get t38 as the first symbol, there needs to be a production where a non-terminal directly produces t38, but I don't see any such rule.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing one. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT35 -> NT10 NT38\n\nWait, this is a production where NT35 becomes NT10 and NT38. So if NT38 can produce a terminal, that's a possibility.\n\nSo, S can expand to NT1 NT28, and then each of those can expand further.\n\nBut let's see. Let's try to find a possible expansion that starts with t38.\n\nLooking at the rules, is there any NT that directly produces t38? From the given rules, I don't see NT38 -> t38.\n\nBut wait, in the rules, I see NT38 -> t102 and NT28 -> t76, etc. So, the initial step of S cannot directly produce t38 as the first symbol because none of the direct productions for S start with t38.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t38, then there must be a way S can expand into some NTs that eventually derive to t38.\n\nBut looking at S's productions, S can only expand into two non-terminals, which are NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27. Let's check NT1 and NT50 and NT27 for possible derivatives leading to t38.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if any of the non-terminals can derive t38.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT38 can produce t102 and also expand into other NTs. For example, NT38 can expand into NT28 NT8, or NT44 NT53, etc.\n\nSo, from NT38, you can get t102 or non-terminals.\n\nIf I need to derive t38, I need a production where some NT leads directly to t38, but I don't see that. Wait, maybe through multiple steps. Let's see.\n\nFor example, suppose NT38 expands into NT28 and NT8. Then NT28 can be further expanded. Wait, but let's track down the full string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S must expand into NT50 and NT27, and NT50 can produce some sequence that eventually leads to t38.\n\nSo, let me explore the possibility of S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nNow, NT50 can produce NT4 NT31 or NT10 NT34.\n\nLet's see if NT4 or NT31 can lead us closer.\n\nNT4 -> NT21 NT15 (producing non-terminals), and NT21 produces NT37 NT20. NT37 is a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT50 -> NT10 NT34.\n\nSo, NT10 -> NT2 NT50, but that might lead into cycles. Maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other option for S is S -> NT1 NT28.\n\nNT1 can produce NT25 NT17 or NT47 NT22.\n\nLooking at NT17: from the grammar, NT17 can produce t24 (as in NT17 -> t24). So maybe NT17 can produce a terminal symbol.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-418","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF is a form where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to follow this structure, so that's a good start.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t81 t28 t114 t89 t38 t62 t42 t119 t102 t102 t87 t123 t91 t58 t27 t38 t63 t134 t48 t112 t93`.\n\nI notice that the string consists entirely of 't' followed by numbers. The grammar has several production rules that directly produce these terminals. For example, NT45 \u2192 't87', NT35 \u2192 't105', etc. So some of these 't' terms are terminals produced directly by the non-terminals.\n\nHowever, other 't's are part of the left-hand sides of production rules. For instance, NT47 \u2192 't3', so NT47 can produce 't3'. But in the given string, I don't see any 't3' directly, so maybe that's not the way.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing a string using a context-free grammar typically involves using a method like recursive descent or something similar. But since this is a bit complex, I'll try to break it down.\n\nLet me list the symbols in the string and see which non-terminals can produce these:\n\n1. t4: Looking at the grammar, NT47 \u2192 't3', but 't4' doesn't seem to be directly produced by any rule. Wait, looking deeper, NT46 \u2192 't87', which is 't87', but 't4' isn't there. Hmm, perhaps 't4' is part of a production rule. Looking back, I see a line: NT17 \u2192 't94', but that's not 't4'. Maybe 't4' isn't directly produced, unless it comes from a longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps 't4' is part of a longer non-terminal symbol. Let me check. Looking at the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't91', but that's not helpful. NT41 \u2192 't52', not helpful. NT42 \u2192 't2', which is 't2', but that's not 't4'.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the string is such that it can be broken down into a series of production rules.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be generated step by step. For that, I can start by trying to split the string into parts that match the grammar's left-hand sides.\n\nLet's see the first token: t4. So the start symbol S must eventually derive into a string that includes t4. S starts as S -> NT1 NT28. So S would derive into two non-terminals, which would produce the symbols t4 and another, for example.\n\nWait, but how does S split into NT1 and NT28? Let me see: S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So S produces two parts. Let's see what NT1 and NT28 can produce.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, and NT17 can produce 't94'. NT28 is a non-terminal that splits into NT4 NT6. Wait, no, looking at the given rules, NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 is not correct. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6.\n\nWait, yes, that's correct. So S \u2192 NT1 NT28, which becomes NT1 and NT4 NT6.\n\nThen, looking at NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, and NT17 can be 't94' or other rules. Similarly, NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, and so on. This seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can try to see if the entire string can be generated by such a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent each 't' in the string as a terminal and see which non-terminals can generate them.\n\nWait, the first 't4' in the string suggests that somewhere in the derivation, there's a non-terminal that produces 't4'. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a rule like NTx \u2192 t4. Instead, some rules produce multiple terminals, like NT47 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't91', etc. The only way to get 't4' as a terminal is if some non-terminal can produce it directly, but it doesn't look like any rule is set that. So perhaps t4 isn't in the language, and thus the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Looking through the rules again:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't105', 't102', 't124', 't66', 't50', etc.\n- NT28 \u2192 't76', 't123', etc.\n- NT46 \u2192 't134', 't48', 't53', etc.\n- NT35 \u2192 't36', 't42', etc.\n- Others like NT4 \u2192 't91', NT41 \u2192 't52', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't4'. So if the string has 't4', it can't be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go through each production step by step to identify which non-terminals produce terminal 't' values.\n\nStarting from the bottom, looking at each production:\n\n1. NT36 -> NT56 NT10\n2. NT28 -> NT4 NT6 \u2192 Wait, looking back, \"NT28 -> NT4 NT6\" is correct? Or is it another value? Let me check the list again:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT6.\n\nWait, so does NT4 produce a terminal? Looking through the NT4 production: \"NT4 -> NT21 NT15\". So NT4 is non-terminal, meaning it can only produce non-terminals, not terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT6's production is \"NT6 -> NT54 NT6\", so NT6 also leads to a loop of non-terminals until it reaches a terminal. But wait, looking at NT6's production, it says \"NT6 -> NT54 NT6\" which is an infinitely regressive rule unless NT54 has a terminal.\n\nWait, let's check NT54's production: \"NT54 -> NT21 NT50\". NT21 and NT50 are non-terminals. So NT6 can only go deeper into non-terminals. So perhaps NT6 \u2192 ... eventually leads to a terminal, but perhaps in this case, does any of them end up with a terminal?\n\nWait, in looking through the NTs, perhaps NT24 is another case. Wait, looking for any NT that either ends with a terminal or points to a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT24: Its production is \"NT24 -> NT6 NT29\". Both NT6 and NT29 are non-terminals. Wait, NT29 has productions: \"NT29 -> NT20 NT24\" and \"NT29 -> NT15 NT39\". So NT29 is NT20 NT24 or NT15 NT39. NT20 is \"NT20 -> NT38 NT33\", which are non-terminals. NT39 is \"NT39 -> NT49 NT24\". So this seems like a loop without reaching a terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think differently. The string starts with 't38', so the first part of the string is 't38' and 't53'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't38'?\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT38 is not a production; wait, I don't see NT38 in the list. Wait, perhaps a typo. Wait, I see NT8 in the list.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, perhaps I should check where 't' strings appear. I see:\n\n- NT35 -> 't53'\n- NT24 -> 't62'\n- NT38 -> 't89'\n- NT39 -> 't131'\n- NT14 -> 't79'\n- NT27 -> 't124'\n- NT24 -> 't29' [Wait, no, earlier entries: \"NT24 -> NT6 NT29\" \u2192 non-terminals]\n- Others like NT33 -> 't79' [No, \"NT33 -> NT79 NT...\" \u2192 not terminal]\n- Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT29 -> 't48' and 't14'. So maybe NT29 can produce 't48' or 't14'. But in the string, after 't38', the next token is 't53'. So I need to get 't53' at some point.\n\nLooking for where 't53' comes from. Looking at NT35's production: \"NT35 -> NT53 NT52\" and \"NT35 -> NT56 NT3\". Wait, in the list, I see:\n\n- NT35 -> NT53 NT55? Wait, let me check the exact lines.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLine 4:\n- NT36 -> NT56 NT10\nLine 5:\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT6\nLine 6:\n- NT16 -> NT10 NT34\nLine 7:\n- NT26 -> NT14 NT45\nLine 8:\n- NT22 -> NT35 NT34\nLine 9:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-438","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to test. I need to determine whether the string is generated by the grammar. Okay, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has each production rule either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I can see that all the productions either have two non-terminals on the right-hand side or one terminal. So that's good, it fits CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t81 t17 t34 t79 t34 t76 t134 t112 t87 t114 t109 t81 t114 t114 t16 t89 t116 t21 t42 t40 t134 t48`. It looks like each element is a terminal symbol, presumably 't' followed by a number. So the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Starting with S, I should be able to expand it step by step until I get the string. Since it's a tree structure, each production can be broken down further until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that certain non-terminals expand into terminals. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT50 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10, but NT56 can go to NT20 NT17, and so on, until it might produce a terminal t.\n\nBut instead of trying to map out every possible expansion, which seems overwhelming, maybe I can look for terminals and see how they might have been produced from the rules.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string and see if any of the productions directly match them:\n\n- t4\n- t81\n- t17\n- t34\n- t79\n- t76\n- t134\n- t112\n- t87\n- t114\n- t109\n- t81 (again)\n- t114 (again)\n- t114 (again)\n- t16\n- t89\n- t116\n- t21\n- t42\n- t40\n- t134 (again)\n- t48\n\nI need to see if these terminals correspond to any of the terminals in the grammar. Looking back, I see that NT46 \u2192 t8, NT56 \u2192 t112, NT7 \u2192 t93, etc. Wait, but in the grammar, NT28 is involved in some terminals, like t97, t87, etc.\n\nI think a better approach is to see if each sequence of terminals can be traced back through the productions to S.\n\nLet me consider each terminal. Starting from the left:\n\nThe first terminal is t4. Looking at the grammar, NT1 does that. NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. Hmm, so I need to see what NT25 and NT17 produce.\n\nLooking at NT25's production: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. So NT6 and NT31. NT6 \u2192 t54 NT6, and NT31 \u2192 NT117. Wait, NT46 \u2192 t117? Or is it another one.\n\nWait, looking at NT31, in the grammar, I see NT31 \u2192 NT117. But wait, NT117 is not a non-terminal in the given grammar. Let me check: The grammar ends at certain points, but it seems NT31 is a non-terminal as it has productions. Wait, looking back, the grammar doesn't mention NT117, so perhaps that's a terminal. But in the given grammar, many of the higher-numbered non-terminals (like NT112, NT109) are actually terminals, because their productions in the grammar end up producing a single t followed by a number. \n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, NT46 \u2192 't87', right? Because I see NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10, and NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17, which leads to some terminals. Wait, but some productions are direct terminals, like NT46 \u2192 't87', which is terminal. So that would mean NT46 is a terminal symbol? Or is it a non-terminal that produces a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT46 is a non-terminal because it's on the left, and one of its productions is NT46 \u2192 't87', which is a terminal. So if NT46 produces 't87', but in another production, it might also produce something else. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT46 has two productions: one is NT35 NT37, and another is 't8'. So NT46 can be either a combination or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking back, it's specified that some of these non-terminals produce terminals, like in the given list, NT46 can be 't87' or other things. Wait, but in the list, NT46 is given as 't8', 't27', 't76', 't112', etc., so perhaps each NT has multiple productions, some involving non-terminals and some involving terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nStarting with S, which can expand into NT1 NT50 or NT50 NT27. Let's pick one path. Suppose we take S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nNow, NT50 has a production: NT50 \u2192 NT43 NT50 or NT50 \u2192 't4'.\n\nIf we take NT50 \u2192 't4', that's our first terminal. So we're on track for the first 't4'.\n\nNow, moving to NT27: NT27 has several productions. Looking back, NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16. So let's see: NT39 and NT16.\n\nNT39 can produce NT49 NT24. So NT49 and NT24.\n\nNT49: according to the grammar, NT49 \u2192 't109'.\n\nNT24: according to the grammar, NT24 \u2192 't40'.\n\nSo combining these, we get 't109' 't40' as part of NT49 and NT24.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second term is 't81', which isn't matching. Hmm, maybe I took the wrong path earlier.\n\nAlternatively, at NT27, instead of going to NT39 NT16, maybe another production. Let's see: NT27 also has a production NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4. So let's try that.\n\nNT54: according to the grammar, NT54 \u2192 't81'. Great, because the second terminal in the string is 't81'.\n\nSo, starting again with S \u2192 NT50 \u2192 't4', then NT27 \u2192 NT54 \u2192 't81'.\n\nNow, the third and fourth terminals are 't17' and 't34'. Let me see what comes next. After the 't81', what's produced next? Wait, the string is t4 t81 t17 t34..., so after t81, the next is t17.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT50 \u2192 't4', then NT27 \u2192 NT54 \u2192 't81', then the next symbol. But wait, S \u2192 NT50 NT27, so after getting 't4' from NT50, we have NT27 to expand to produce 't81', but then we're done with S, so the next symbol should come from NT27's expansion. So after 't4', it's 't81', and then what comes next? The third symbol is 't17', but after 't81', the next would be the end of NT27's expansion. So perhaps the next expansion is a new non-terminal? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, maybe the first time S produces NT50 NT27, which is then S \u2192 NT50 (t4) followed by NT27 (t81). So after t4 t81, the next symbol would have to come from further expansions. But wait, the next symbol is t17. Hmm, that's not matching my current expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after t4 t81, there's another non-terminal to expand that produces t17. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe after the initial S \u2192 NT50 NT27 \u2192 t4 NT27, and then NT27 is expanded further to produce t81, but then we have another NT somewhere.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can be a terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, the right-hand side can be at most two non-terminals, but terminals are allowed as well. Hmm, looking at the grammar, I see that some rules have terminals on the right, like S \u2192 NT6 NT46, and then NT46 \u2192 't8', and so on. So the grammar allows for terminals to appear, which means it's a CFG that can generate strings with terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t69 t1 t102 t42 t38 t114 t123 t79 t94 t93 t131 t42 t41 t27 t4 t34 t16 t31 t119 t42 t48 t53 t21`.\n\nSo the first step is to see if each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal production in the grammar. But looking at the grammar, NT symbols (like S, NT1, etc.) are non-terminals, and some of them have productions that result in terminals. For example, NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 't94'. So, I think each 't' must be the result of a production from some NT symbol to a terminal.\n\nTherefore, to process the string, I can start from the start symbol S and see if it can derive the given string by expanding each non-terminal step by step, replacing them with the appropriate terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, but doing this manually for a string of length 25 is going to be time-consuming. Maybe I can break it down step by step, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet me list the string parts for easier handling:\n\nThe string is: t69, t1, t102, t42, t38, t114, t123, t79, t94, t93, t131, t42, t41, t27, t4, t34, t16, t31, t119, t42, t48, t53, t21.\n\nI need to see if these terminals appear in some order as leaves of the derivation tree.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I can see if any production rules directly produce these 't's.\n\nFor example, NT24 \u2192 't29', but t29 is not in the string. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look for 't87' which is produced by NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 and also some of its descendants. Let's see if any NT symbols in the grammar have 't87' as a terminal. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10. NT56 is derived into 't56' or not? Wait, looking at NT56, there's NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17, and then NT17 \u2192... I know NT17 \u2192 't94'. So, NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17 \u2192 NT20 't94'. Then NT20 is NT43 or NT50. Let me see NT43: NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3. NT8 is not shown as a terminal, but wait, does any NT have a production for some t? Let me look again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT46 \u2192 't8', and NT47 \u2192 't3', and NT17 \u2192 't94', etc.\n\nLet me make a list of NT symbols that directly produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't56 NT20' or maybe more steps. Wait, NT56 is only in the production, for example:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT56 is in the production: NT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50, and NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3, etc. So it's not a direct terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking through the entire grammar, the only direct terminals are:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- NT26 \u2192 't48', 't14', 't50'\n- NT28 \u2192 't8' (from NT28 \u2192 't8')\n- NT46 \u2192 't73', 't87', etc. For example, NT46 has some rules:\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT8\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n- NT46 has many other rules, but some result in terminals.\n\nFor example, NT46 \u2192 't87' (from NT46 \u2192 NT46 NT28?)\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, for NT46: \n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT8\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n- NT46 \u2192 NT49 NT28 (I think I might have missed this earlier, let's check again: yes, in NT46, I see a rule NT46 \u2192't8', another \u2192't24', etc. Wait, no, let me look again:\n\nNo, looking carefully, NT46 has:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT8\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n- NT46 \u2192 't100' (from NT46 \u2192 't100')\nWait, perhaps I need to recheck all the NT symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the 't' in the string and see if they appear in the grammar as terminals. So:\n\nIn the string: t69, t1, t102, t42, t38, t114, t123, t79, t94, t93, t131, t42, t41, t27, t4, t34, t16, t31, t119, t42, t48, t53, t21.\n\nLooking for these in the grammar terminals:\n\n- t1: Does any NT produce 't1'? Looking at the grammar, I don't see 't1' as a terminal. So unless some production from another NT can derive 't1'.\n\n- t2: Produced by NT10.\n\n- t4: NT7, but is there a direct rule? Looking at NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6. So 't4' must come from another NT.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step using the leftmost derivation.\n\nLet's start with S, which can be derived into either NT1 NT51 or NT50 NT27. Hmm, actually, looking at the given grammar, S's productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT51 (but not in the given grammar). Wait, in the given grammar, I think I have:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions, but let me see the beginning:\n\nThe grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT1 NT28\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nLooking, yes, S has two productions: S -> NT1 NT28 and S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nSo S can be expanded into either NT1 followed by NT28 or NT50 followed by NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't69'. Let's see if that can come from one of these.\n\nLet's consider the first production: S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nLet's see if NT1 can derive a sequence starting with 't69'.\n\nLooking into the NT1 productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. NT25 is: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31. So NT25 expands to NT6 and NT31.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 and NT6 also can produce 't59' via NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which could produce t3. Wait, maybe I should list all the possible terminals for each NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if each 't' can be mapped to a NT production.\n\nLet me create a hash map of NT symbols to their possible terminal sequences:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT1: NT25 NT17\n- NT2: NT6 NT3 (t3), NT54 NT6 (which could have 't59' if NT54 expands)\n- NT3: 't6' and 't3' (from NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10: if that's not a terminal, but wait, no, 't6' is from NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which is a recursive production)\nWait, this might take too long. Maybe I should instead check if each 't' in the string appears somewhere as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the NT symbols, the direct terminals are:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't87', 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-458","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier, although I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Each rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except when a terminal is present, which in this case seems to be a bunch of 't' followed by numbers. Wait, looking closer, most of the right-hand sides are two non-terminals except for some like NT46 -> 't27' and NT9 -> 't93'. So the terminals are these 't' followed by numbers. That makes sense.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t58 t117 t114 t53 t102 t102 t102 t36 t63 t87 t28 t89 t89 t38 t11 t21 t81 t58 t42 t41 t114 t42 t114 t76.\n\nSo, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar. The start symbol is S. The initial productions from S are either NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27. Wait, the actual productions are S -> NT1 NT1? Or wait, looking back, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT1 NT1\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nWait no, in the problem statement, the first two lines after the grammar are:\n\nS -> NT1 NT1\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nWait, let me check the user message again:\n\nGrammar: S-> NT1 NT1, S-> NT50 NT27, etc.\n\nYes, so S can produce either NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t58. So maybe the string starts with the term 't58'. Now, looking into the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce a terminal. For example, NT26-> NT14 NT45, but also looking at the end of the user's message, I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't87'\nNT56 -> 't112'\nNT47 -> 't3'\nNT6 -> 't58'\n\nWait, hold on. Let me parse the grammar correctly. Actually, in the user's message, the grammar seems to be written in a way where each line is a production, so the left-hand side (LHS) is on the left of the arrow, and the right-hand side (RHS) is on the right. But some RHS have multiple symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. For example, looking at the end:\n\nNT33 -> NT79\n...\nNT25 -> 't107'\nNT6 -> 't119'\nNT32 -> 't108'\nNT22 -> 't128'\nNT29 -> 't116'\nNT43 -> 't69'\nNT43 -> 't27'\n...\nNT54 -> 't53'\nNT35 -> 't79'\nNT24 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't126'\nNT29 -> 't31'\nNT50 -> 't38'\nNT25 -> 't107'\nNT6 -> 't119'\nNT47 -> 't114'\n...\nNT46 -> 't76'\n\nWait, looking more carefully, at the very end of the user's grammar, I see some lines that have 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT26 -> 't14', NT46 -> 't76', NT25 -> 't107', etc.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string. The string is: t58, t117, t114, t53, t102, t102, t102, t36, t63, t87, t28, t89, t89, t38, t11, t21, t81, t58, t42, t41, t114, t42, t114, t76.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nNow, starting from S, which can produce either NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27.\n\nI think I'll approach this by working backwards, trying to match the string from the end. Each non-terminal in the grammar can produce some terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLet's look at the last token in the string, which is t76. Looking at the grammar, NT76 is not present. Wait, but looking through, some non-terminals have 't' productions. For example, NT46 -> 't76'.\n\nSo, t76 could be produced by NT46.\n\nLooking at the production, NT46 -> t76.\n\nSo, the last part of the string is ... t76.\n\nSo, the last part must be NT46.\n\nSo, the string ends with ... t76. Let's think about that: the last rule applied is S-> a production that ends with NT46 on the right-hand side. So, the last part must be generated by NT46.\n\nSo, if the last token is t76, then before that in the string, there must be the symbols that lead to NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, before t76, the tokens are: t58, t41, t114, t42, t114, t76.\n\nWait no, the string is:\n\nt58 t117 t114 t53 t102 t102 t102 t36 t63 t87 t28 t89 t89 t38 t11 t21 t81 t58 t42 t41 t114 t42 t114 t76.\n\nWait, let me count the tokens correctly. I'll list them in order:\n\n1. t58\n\n2. t117\n\n3. t114\n\n4. t53\n\n5. t102\n\n6. t102\n\n7. t102\n\n8. t36\n\n9. t63\n\n10. t87\n\n11. t28\n\n12. t89\n\n13. t89\n\n14. t38\n\n15. t11\n\n16. t21\n\n17. t81\n\n18. t58\n\n19. t42\n\n20. t41\n\n21. t114\n\n22. t42\n\n23. t114\n\n24. t76.\n\nSo, the last part is t76, which comes from NT46.\n\nNow, before that, the previous token is t114 (position 23), then t42 (22), t41 (20), t58 (18), t42 (19?), wait no. Let's clarify. Wait, the string in the problem is:\n\n`t58 t117 t114 t53 t102 t102 t102 t36 t63 t87 t28 t89 t89 t38 t11 t21 t81 t58 t42 t41 t114 t42 t114 t76`\n\nSo, positions 1 to 24.\n\nSo the last symbol is 24: t76.\n\nThe token before that is position 23: t114.\n\nSo, before t76, we have t114, and the two symbols before that are t42 and t41, followed by t58, t42, t114, t42, t114.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this as a derivation. Let's see the steps.\n\nThe top-level S can produce either NT1 NT1 or NT50 NT27.\n\nSo, let's consider both options.\n\nFirst, S -> NT1 NT1.\n\nEach part (NT1 and NT1) can be further expanded.\n\nAlternatively, S -> NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, it ends with t76, so the last part must be generated by NT46 (since NT46 -> t76).\n\nSo, the last symbol t76 must come from NT46.\n\nTherefore, in the derivation, we must have something like NT46 -> t76, which is at the end.\n\nNow, for S -> NT50 NT27, let's see:\n\nIf S produces NT50 followed by NT27, then we need to see if NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-451","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is `t4 t53 t79 t102 t102 t123 t36 t123 t126 t2 t102 t100 t4 t24 t117 t93 t79 t21 t42 t4 t87 t53 t36 t87`, and the grammar consists of a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) works. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This structure makes it easier to parse strings and analyze the derivation process.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that it's a set of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) produces two other non-terminals. The terminals are all the 't' followed by numbers, like t9, t53, and so on.\n\nThe string starts with t4 and ends with several ts. I need to see if this string can be generated by following the grammar's production rules. \n\nTo approach this, I'll try to map the string step by step through the grammar. Each step would involve replacing the start symbol S with two non-terminals, then recursively replacing those until we get to the terminals in the string.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should look for a pattern or see if the string can be broken down into parts that fit the grammar's rules. Let me check the string:\n\nt4 t53 t79 t102 t102 t123 t36 t123 t126 t2 t102 t100 t4 t24 t117 t93 t79 t21 t42 t4 t87 t53 t36 t87\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of ts, and each 't' corresponds to a specific rule in the grammar. For example, looking at the rules, t4 can be generated by NT22, t53 by NT41, etc. But to see how this all connects, I might need to reverse-engineer the steps:\n\n1. The string starts with t4, which is terminal and generated by NT22 (from the grammar, NT22 \u2192 t4). So the first rule could be S \u2192 NT22 NT10 or something else, but looking at the grammar, S is the start symbol. Wait, S is a non-terminal and its productions are S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. But the string starts with a terminal, so we must derive from S step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to build a parse tree starting from S. Let me try to see how S can derive a string starting with t4.\n\nLooking at the rules for S: either S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. \n\nIf the string starts with 't4', where does that come from? Let's check the rules for non-terminals that produce t4.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT22 \u2192 't4', because in the rules, NT22 is defined as NT22 \u2192 t4. So t4 is a terminal and is produced by NT22. \n\nBut in the grammar's S rules, S is split into two non-terminals. So for the string to start with t4, one of the non-terminals derived from S must produce t4. \n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT1 NT28. NT1 has a rule NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, and NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31, etc. Alternatively, S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Let's see where NT50 and NT27 go.\n\nNT50: looking at the grammar, NT50 \u2192 't4'. So S \u2192 NT50 (which gives t4) and NT27.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT50 NT27, then the first terminal is t4 (from NT50). Now, we have to process the rest of the string as the result of NT27.\n\nLooking at NT27's production: NT27 \u2192 NT29 NT16. So NT27 splits into NT29 and NT16.\n\nNT29: rules like NT29 \u2192 NT41 NT79, or others. Wait, looking at NT29: from the grammar, I see multiple rules: NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14, and others. Let me check the exact rules:\n\nLooking through, I spot:\nNT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\nNT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39\nBut I need to find where a rule leads to NT27's split. Wait, actually, let me retrace.\n\nWait, let me step through the first step:\n\nThe string starts with t4. That's from S \u2192 NT50 NT27. NT50 \u2192 t4. Now, the rest is the string starting after t4, which is t53 t79 t102 t102 t123 t36 t123 t126 t2 t102 t100 t4 t24 t117 t93 t79 t21 t42 t4 t87 t53 t36 t87.\n\nSo the next non-terminal after S's first step is NT27. Let's see what NT27 produces.\n\nLooking at NT27: the production is NT27 \u2192 NT29 NT16. So NT27 splits into NT29 and NT16.\n\nLooking at NT16: The rules for NT16 are NT16 \u2192 NT10 NT34. So NT16 becomes NT10 and NT34.\n\nNow, the string after t4 is t53, so next term is t53. That must come from either NT29 or NT16. But NT16 can't produce t53 directly because NT16's productions are NT10 and NT34, which produce terminals as follows:\n\nNT10's production is NT17 and NT34. Hmm, complex. Let's see what each step could produce.\n\nWait, this approach is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should consider building the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to simulate the process of generating the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nLet's start from S: S \u2192 NT50 NT27 (since we observed S \u2192 NT50 produces t4, and the string starts with t4).\n\nNT50 \u2192 t4. So we have t4 so far.\n\nNow, NT27 is the next part to process.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT29 NT16.\n\nSo NT27 generates two new nodes: NT29 and NT16.\n\nNow, we need to process NT29 and NT16.\n\nFirst, process NT29:\n\nLooking for NT29's rules in the grammar. From the rules:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\nNT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39\nNT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24\nNT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a production that leads to the next term in the string, which is 53.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24. Then NT20 can produce t45 or t40. Hmm, that might not directly lead to 53.\n\nAlternatively, NT29 \u2192 NT41 NT79: looking through, see if any of these match. Wait, checking NT29's rules, one is NT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39 and another is NT29 \u2192 NT41 NT79? I don't see that. Wait, checking the grammar rules, I see:\n\nWait, looking back, in the rules, I don't see NT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39 and NT29 \u2192 NT41 NT79? Wait, no. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT29:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\nNT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39\nNT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24\nNT29 rules also include NT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39 and NT29 \u2192 NT41 NT79? No. Wait, maybe I got the rules wrong.\n\nWait, in the original grammar provided, under NT29, the rules are:\n\n- NT29 -> NT26 NT14\n- NT29 -> NT15 NT39\n- NT29 -> NT20 NT24\n- NT29 -> NT15 NT39\n- NT29 -> NT41 NT79\n- NT29 -> NT15 NT39\n\nWait, I see multiple rules for NT29 in the grammar provided.

It consists of a series of production rules for various non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.), splitting some of them into two parts, and some have terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). Some non-terminals directly produce terminals, which probably are the end conditions of the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t107 t102 t126 t19 t87 t109 t11 t120 t53 t53 t53 t21 t119 t42 t41 t28 t63 t120 t102 t102 t48 t89 t38 t93 t120.\n\nI notice that each token in the string is a terminal, so in the grammar, these must be generated by productions where a non-terminal directly produces the terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the productions that directly produce terminals are:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t58\n- NT22 \u2192 t58 (Wait, no: checking the grammar... let me double-check.)\nWait, in the grammar provided, the rule NT6 \u2192 t58 is listed. Similarly, NT15 \u2192 t48, NT29 \u2192 t48, etc. Some have t102, t107, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, the grammar has several rules that directly produce terminals. For instance:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t87\n- NT28 \u2192 t76, also NT28 \u2192 t8 (from NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 and then NT4 and NT6 produce other things, but then in the string, t28 appears. Hmm, that might require more steps).\n- NT10 \u2192 t2\n- And others. Let's list all the direct terminal productions from the grammar:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT6 \u2192 t58\n- NT45 \u2192 't8' (Wait, no: From the list,NT46 has t8, but let me check line by line.)\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me go through each rule that ends with a terminal (without further non-terminals).\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58\nNT29 \u2192 t48\nNT6 \u2192 t54 NT6 (this produces a string, not a terminal)\nNT48 \u2192 t93?\nWait, no, looking at the rules, I think some have mixed. Let me list only the direct terminals:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT1 (non-terminal)\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT1 (non-terminal)\n3. NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10 (non-terminals)\n4.

NT39 \u2192 NT49 NT24 (non-terminals)\n33. NT37 \u2192 NT7 NT33 (non-terminals)\n34. NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT55 (non-terminals)\n35. NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17 (non-terminals) - Wait, this is same as rule 26.\n36. NT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24 (directly? Wait, looking at the grammar: NT29's rules are line 18 and 19.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, NT29 has two rules:\n18. NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\n19. NT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24\nWait, no; looking back, the grammar provided has:\nNT29:\n18. NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\n19. NT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24\n\nSo rule 18 produces NT26 and NT14, which are non-terminals. Rule 19 produces NT20 (non-terminal) and NT24 (non-terminal). So I think rule 18 was a typo because NT29 is supposed to have NT26 NT14 and NT20 NT24.\n\nBut regardless, NT20 and NT24: for example, NT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50, NT24 \u2192 etc.\n\nThen looking for direct terminals, perhaps NT35, NT9, etc. Some rules like NT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46, so non-terminals again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let's go back.\n\nIn the grammar, any rule where the right side doesn't contain any non-terminals (only terminals or single non-terminals that eventually produce terminals) is a direct production.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So some of these grammar rules have two non-terminals, which would not be in CNF. Wait, but the provided grammar is given as a context-free grammar, not necessarily in Chomsky Normal Form. Wait no, the user stated it's in CNF. Let me check: in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT1 NT1 is acceptable, as it's two non-terminals.\n\nBut some rules have three parts, like NT34 \u2192 NT44 NT38 NT13 (wait, looking at the rules, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the provided grammar. Let me re-examine the initial grammar.\n\nThe beginning says the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me look at how the rules are structured.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT1 NT1, S \u2192 NT50 NT27, etc.\n\nThen NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10, which is two non-terminals, acceptable as CNF.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\u2014also two non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, other rules seem to vary between two non-terminals or, for some, a non-terminal followed by a terminal. Wait, no\u2014that would imply a production of B C where one is a non-terminal and one is a terminal. Is that allowed in CNF? Because in CNF, it's supposed to be A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals. So if a production is A \u2192 aB, that's not CNF.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, let me find if any rules have a mix of terminal and non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nStarting from NT35:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT55 NT22 (two non-terminals), seems good.\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT49 NT24\u2014also two non-terminals.\n\nLooking into lower symbols, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me scan:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t58 (terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. \n\nFirst, I notice that the string consists of tokens that end with 't' preceded by a number. For example, 't38', 't53', etc. Looking at the grammar, I see that some of these are terminals (like 't37', 't93', etc.), while others have 't' followed by numbers that point to specific productions. \n\nLet me list out all the 'tX' tokens in the string and see if I can find their corresponding productions or if they result in a terminal (like 't' followed by a specific terminal string).\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that certain non-terminals produce strings that end with 't8', 't10', 't2', etc. For instance, NT35 -> NT53 NT55; NT53 -> 't29' and NT55->'t112'. So, NT35 would produce 't29 t112'. Wait, but in the string, I see 't53' and 't81'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go step by step.\n\nI need to parse the given string as a sequence of symbols and see if it can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either substitutes a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI think this parsing can be done using a recursive descent approach, or by constructing a parse tree. But since it's complex, maybe I can do a top-down approach trying to derive the string from the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to look for the sequence of 't's and see if they match the possible terminals from the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the 't's with their numbers and see their possible productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some 't's are produced by specific non-terminals:\n\n- NT24 -> 't29'\n- NT7 -> 't24'\n- NT17 -> 't94'\n- NT79 comes from some rules like NT45->'t28', but wait, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, in the terminal part, I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't8'\n\nNT45 -> 't28'\n\nNT35 -> 't102'\n\nHmm, wait, maybe I should list each 'tX' and see which non-terminals they come from.\n\nLet me go through each token in the string:\n\nt38: So, I need to find which NT produces 't38'. Looking through the grammar's terminal rules, I see NT41 -> 't52', NT34 -> 't36', NT89 from NT43, etc. Hmm, I don't recall any NT directly producing 't38'. Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nI see NT47 -> 't3' \u2192 t3.\n\nNT42 -> 't2' \u2192 t2.\n\nNT48 -> 't24'.\n\nNT53 -> 't29' and 't47' (from NT53->'t47').\n\nWait, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think about the overall structure of the grammar and see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the allowed substitutions.\n\nWait, the given grammar's start symbol is S, which breaks down into S->NT1 NT1 and S->NT50 NT27. So, the initial step is to split S into two parts: NT1 and NT1, or NT50 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols must correspond to the terminals generated by NT1 or NT50 and NT27.\n\nWait, but NT1 produces NT25 NT17, which are non-terminals, unless those have terminal rules. Let me check NT25:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT25 -> NT6 NT31. Both are non-terminals. So NT25 must be parsed further.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is 't38', which is a terminal. So maybe the first production is NT1 producing a terminal. Wait, no, because NT1 has a rule NT1-> NT25 NT17, which are both non-terminals. So the first symbol would have to come from NT25 or NT17, which are non-terminals, but the string starts with 't38', a terminal. So perhaps the start symbol S must be expanding in a way that generates the first 't38' as part of the terminal sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I should not be starting from S and trying to derive the entire string step by step but instead look at each 'tX' and see if they can be matched by any of the terminal rules.\n\nLet me try to map the string into possible grammar productions.\n\nThe string is: t38 t53 t3 t102 t120 t53 t81 t58 t58 t53 t81 t21 t42 t4 t114 t34 t36 t24 t48 t53 t21 t24 t52 t42 t48.\n\nThat's 24 tokens, all starting with 't'. Hmm, so each token is part of a terminal production. Let's try to match each 'tX' to a non-terminal that produces it.\n\nLooking at the list of terminal rules, I can see that some NTs produce specific 't's:\n\n- NT7 -> 't24' (twice in the list)\n- NT24 -> 't29'\n- NT46 -> 't8', 't27', 't100', etc.\n- NT56 -> 't112'\n- NT41 -> 't52'\n- NT34 -> 't36'\n- NT29 -> 't48', etc.\n\nHmm, but wait, we need to find if each 'tX' is a terminal generated by some NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT21 is defined as:\n\nNT21 -> NT37 NT20.\n\nWait, those are non-terminals, so NT21 won't produce a terminal directly. Instead, each NT will eventually have to produce a string of terminals or end as a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NTs do have terminal outputs. For example, NT45->'t28' and some others. Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, it's written as NT45 -> 't28'\u2014wait, is that correct? Let me see.\n\nYes, looking back:\n\nThe grammar list had:\n\nNT45 -> 't28'.\nNT46 -> 't8'.\nNT47 -> 't3'.\nNT7 -> 't24', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT45 -> 't28' means that NT45 produces the terminal 't28' as a single token.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 -> 't8' and 't27' are two different rules? Wait, no, in the grammar, for NT46, the rule is:\n\nNT46 -> NT20 NT8,\n\nand then in the terminal rules:\n\nNT46 -> 't8' and 't27'.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Is NT46 a terminal or a non-terminal? Because in the grammar, it's possible for a non-terminal to have both a production to two non-terminals (like NT46-> NT20 NT8) and also a terminal production.\n\nBut in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions on the right-hand side are non-terminals except for the base cases, but wait, no: Chomsky Normal Form requires that every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because it simplifies parsing.

The terminals are strings of 't' followed by numbers, which are the symbols we're trying to produce.\n\nMy goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation would involve each step replacing a non-terminal with two others until all symbols are terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't81'. So I need to see which non-terminals can derive 't81'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT49 and NT45 have rules that include 't81'. Let me check NT45: `NT45 -> 't87'` and `NT45 -> 't28'`. Hmm, not quite. But looking at NT39, it has `NT39 -> NT29 NT41` and `NT39 -> NT15 NT39`. I need to find which NT can produce 't81'.\n\nWait, let me look again. Wait, in the grammar, NT119 is present? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see a production where NT46 \u2192 't87' and also NT46 has some other rules. Maybe I need to look further down.\n\nWait, actually, looking for symbols in the string: t81 appears multiple times. So I need to find where t81 can be generated. From the grammar, looking for any production that ends in 't81'. Checking the rules, I see:\n\n- NT25 -> 't107' and also 't58'? No, not 't81'.\n- NT50 -> 't42' but also NT50 -> 't16' and other rules. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar includes NT47 -> 't41' and also NT47 \u2192 't40 NT13'? No. Wait, perhaps I should check where 't81' appears.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the productions, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't94' and 't24' perhaps? No, not 't81'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Alternatively, perhaps 't81' is derived through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that follow the productions. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is 't81'. Looking at the grammar, which NT can produce 't81'? Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't28 NT26' and 't8 NT26'?

For example, NT17 \u2192 't24' and also 't94'. And NT45 \u2192 't87' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps t81 comes from NT47. Looking at NT47: It has a production `NT47 -> 't3'` but also `NT47 -> 't3' NT17` and `NT47 -> 't40 NT13'`. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for 't81' in any of the right-hand sides.\n\nWait, looking again, I see a production: NT37 \u2192 't17' and another NT7 \u2192 't93' and 't97', etc. Hmm, but I don't see any production that ends with 't81'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Hmm, but not t81.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if any of the terminals can branch further.\n\nWait, perhaps t81 comes from NT53. Looking at NT53's productions: NT53 \u2192 't29 NT3' and 't37 NT53'.\n\nWait, but 't81' isn't there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've missed it entirely. Maybe it's not possible to generate 't81', which would mean the string isn't in the language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t81 is a terminal, so it's just a single symbol that must be produced by a production that has a symbol that produces 't81'.\n\nLooking again, from the grammar rules, I don't see any production that directly produces 't81'. So perhaps 't81' cannot be generated by any non-terminal, which would imply that the string is invalid, hence the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the grammar doesn't have a production for 't81', so any occurrence of 't81' in the string would make it invalid.\n\nSo, that must mean the string is not in the language generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-497","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of symbols, and each symbol is presumably a terminal in the grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side and sometimes variables on the right, but not empty. Wait, actually, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Wait, but looking at the grammar, I see a mix. Some rules have two non-terminals on the right, others have a terminal. That's fine as long as all terminals are single symbols. Let me check if the productions are either of two non-terminals or terminals. All the right-hand sides seem to be either two non-terminals or a single terminal like 't87', 't93', etc., so the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe string to check is: `t38 t81 t1 t102 t53 t53 t21 t58 t53 t21 t42 t38 t102 t135 t123 t97 t112 t93 t28 t24 t42 t134 t34 t36 t94 t87`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can think of each step as replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. But since all terminals are 't' followed by some number, and the rules don't seem to have any terminals other than in S, wait, no: looking at the grammar, the terminals are all the 't' followed by numbers. For example, S initially is defined as NT1 NT28, which are non-terminals. Then, each of these non-terminals expand into other non-terminals until they reach a terminal string, which are these 't' symbols.\n\nSo the first thing is to parse the string as a series of terminals and see if there's a way to derive it by expanding the non-terminals recursively.\n\nBut this can get complex because the grammar is quite large. Maybe I should start by looking at the string and see if I can break it down into smaller parts that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, we can think of the string as a parse tree where each node is a production that eventually produces a single terminal. Each path from the root to a leaf in the parse tree corresponds to a production, and all the leaves are the terminals in the string.\n\nGiven the size of the string, it's going to be a deep parse tree. But perhaps I can use a stack-based approach similar to how we parse in CNF grammars using the Earley algorithm, or perhaps a recursive descent parser with memoization.\n\nWait, given the time constraints, maybe I can try a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol S and trying to match the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the string is a concatenation of right-hand sides of the productions. Wait, since each production is two symbols, the string length should correspond to the number of symbols in the parse tree.\n\nLet me count the number of 't's in the string:\n\n1. t38\n2. t81\n3. t1\n4. t102\n5. t53\n6. t53\n7. t21\n8. t58\n9. t53\n10. t21\n11. t42\n12. t38\n13. t102\n14. t135\n15. t123\n16. t97\n17. t112\n18. t93\n19. t28\n20. t24\n21. t42\n22. t134\n23. t34\n24. t36\n25. t94\n26. t87\n\nSo 26 symbols. Let's see, each production starts the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces the number of symbols by one or something? Wait, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for each terminal symbol in the string, it must correspond to a production that is a terminal. For non-terminals, they could expand into other symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the string and see if it can be broken down into products of the grammar rules. So, from the start, S is NT1 NT28. Each NT can eventually be a terminal. So the string is the concatenation of NT1 and NT28, each of which is a sequence of terminals connected via productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider each position in the string as a non-terminal that needs to be expanded, but this might get too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a table-driven parsing approach, building the parse table and then processing the string accordingly. But that would require understanding all the possible productions, which might be tedious.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for patterns in the string that match the productions. Let's look at the string:\n\nt38, t81, t1, t102, t53, t53, t21, t58, t53, t21, t42, t38, t102, t135, t123, t97, t112, t93, t28, t24, t42, t134, t34, t36, t94, t87.\n\nIs there a way to split this into segments that correspond to the left-hand sides of the productions? For example, each pair of symbols could potentially be a production, but the string has an odd number of symbols? Wait, no, 26 symbols, which is even, but each production produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, perhaps the total number of symbols produced would be 2^n, where n is the number of steps? Hmm, this might not directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start matching the string from the start.\n\nThe start is S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So the string should start with NT1 followed by NT28.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the string starts with NT1 followed by NT28. But NT1 and NT28 are sequences leading to t38, etc.\n\nBut since the entire string is a terminal sequence, perhaps it's better to look for the top-level expansion.\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n\nAnd NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n\nWait, NT6 \u2192 't120' (from the grammar) which is a terminal 't120'? But in the string, the first symbol is t38. Hmm, perhaps this is diverging.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the entire string can be generated by S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate a recursive descent parser, keeping track of the current position in the string.\n\nLet me start by defining S as the first symbol, which is two non-terminals: NT1 and NT28.\n\nSo, to match the string, I need to have S expand to NT1 followed by NT28. Therefore, the entire string should be the concatenation of NT1 and NT28 expansions.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts: part1 is the expansion of NT1, part2 is the expansion of NT28.\n\nBut how to split part1 and part2? Because both NT1 and NT28 can generate multiple symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the entire string as a single expansion of S, and see if we can parse it as NT1 followed by NT28.\n\nBut without knowing how to split, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the productions that produce t38, the first symbol, and see if it fits any rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many productions result in 't' followed by a number:\n\nFor example, NT36 \u2192 't87', NT6 \u2192 't58', etc.\n\nChecking the first symbol, t38: looking for a production that results in t38. Let me scan through the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I notice that for example, NT33 \u2192 't79', NT36 \u2192 't87', NT44 \u2192 't42', etc.\n\nWait, I can see that some rules result in t38. Let's check: looking at the productions, I see NT44 \u2192 't114', NT6 \u2192 't58', NT47 \u2192 't40', etc. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps NT33 \u2192 't79', NT34 \u2192 't36', NT38 \u2192 't123', etc. I can't find a production that results in t38 directly.

Hmm, the string is `t69 t17 t53 t79 t102 t79 t94 t16 t102 t102 t42 t48 t48 t21 t24 t82 t42 t123 t120 t119 t58 t81 t81 t58 t42 t87 t21`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar has production rules that are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that structure since each rule's left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe task is to check if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol, which here is S. The given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So the string should start with either NT1 or NT50 followed by NT28 or NT27 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t69. Let me check the productions of NT1 and NT50.\n\nLooking up the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT34\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce NT1 followed by NT28 or NT50 followed by NT27.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t69. So is t69 a terminal, and which non-terminal does it come from? Let me look up in the grammar if any non-terminal directly produces t69.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT46 \u2192 't8' and 't87', NT17 \u2192 't94', but looking at the end productions, I see NT17 \u2192 't94' and other rules like NT38 \u2192 't102', but I don't see an immediate rule that produces t69 except for NT36 \u2192 't87' and NT4 \u2192 't91', etc. Wait, let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't8' 't87'\n- NT47 \u2192 't3' 't41' etc.\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT36 \u2192 't87'\nWait, looking for t69. Hmm, in the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces t69. But in the detailed breakdown, under NT46, there's NT46 \u2192 't87' and 't8' and 't87' again. Wait, but I'm not seeing t69 in any direct productions. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, in the detailed productions, I see:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't87' from two separate rules: one says 't87' and another 't87' again, but no direct rule for t69.\n\nWait, no, looking at the full grammar, I only see NT46 \u2192 t87 from two different productions. So perhaps t69 isn't directly produced by any non-terminal, which makes me think that maybe the first token, t69, should come from a non-terminal that does produce t69.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, is there any rule that allows a non-terminal to produce t69? Let me scan the rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6\n- NT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46\n- NT10 \u2192 NT50 NT17\n- NT13 \u2192 NT43 NT26\n- NT14 \u2192 NT24 NT0\n- NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15\n- NT17 \u2192 NT94\n- NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT20\n- NT24 \u2192 NT46 NT17\n- NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n- NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45\n- NT27 \u2192 NT50 NT4\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\n- NT33 \u2192 NT54\n- NT40 \u2192 NT26 NT48\n- NT41 \u2192 NT42 NT35\n- NT42 \u2192 NT26 NT45\n- NT44 \u2192 NT28 NT19\n- NT45 \u2192 't40' and 't13'\n- NT46 \u2192 't8' and 't114', etc.\nBut I don't see any rules that produce t69. Hmm. That's a problem because the first token is t69, and if no non-terminal directly produces t69, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar. But wait, perhaps t69 is generated through a series of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking; maybe one of the non-terminals does produce t69. Let me double-check the entire grammar.\n\nLooking through the entire list, I don't see any non-terminal that produces t69 except for S. Wait, no. Wait, NT24 has 't17' and 't82', etc., but no t69. Hmm. That's a problem.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I missed it. Let's go through the entire list again:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT9\nWait, no, in the given grammar, I don't see NT3 defined\u2014no, the grammar starts with S and NT1, etc.\n\nWait, the given grammar's rules are as follows:\n\nThe user provided a long list of production rules, some of which have terminal outputs like 't7', 't93', 't102', etc.\n\nBut I don't see any rule that produces t69. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps t69 is part of a longer production. Let me think: maybe NT36 \u2192 't87' is part of some chain that leads to t69. Or perhaps through a series of steps.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, the first token is t69. So for the string to be generated, the derivation must start with a non-terminal that produces t69, but in the given grammar, there is no such non-terminal.\n\nWait, unless somewhere in the productions, a non-terminal A produces t69 via other steps.

This grammar is already in that form, as I see all the rules are two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to check is \"t4 t81 t3 t16 t53 t16 t112 t112 t93 t111 t16 t24 t109 t81 t120 t120 t58 t53 t119 t58 t42 t4 t53 t36 t63 t112 t87\". Each 't' followed by a number is probably a terminal symbol.\n\nMy goal is to see if there's a way to derive this string from the start symbol S. The grammar has S as the start symbol, which is a non-terminal that eventually needs to generate this string.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use the CYK algorithm because it's designed for context-free grammars in Chomsky normal form to test membership. But manually doing CYK might be time-consuming, so perhaps I can look for patterns in the productions that could generate this string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree step by step would help. Let's see. The string starts with t4, t81, etc. So perhaps I should look for which non-terminals can produce these.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n- S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT16 \u2192 NT10 NT34\n- NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13\n- NT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53\n- NT34 \u2192 NT44 NT38\n- NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3\n- NT41 \u2192 NT42 NT35\n- NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15\n- NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT35 NT34\n- NT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50\n- NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT8\n- NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT37\n- NT22 \u2192 NT40 NT45\n- NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\n- NT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46\n- NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n- NT0 \u2192 NT31 NT50\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT13 \u2192 NT43 NT26\n- NT30 \u2192 NT6 NT48\n- NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3\n- NT56 \u2192 NT20 NT17\n- NT26 \u2192 NT50 NT48\n- NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT20\n- NT14 \u2192 NT24 NT0\n- NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16\n- NT20 \u2192 NT38 NT33\n- NT44 \u2192 NT38 NT13\n- NT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24\n- NT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT45 \u2192 NT40 NT36\n- NT13 \u2192 NT19 NT9\n- NT46 \u2192 NT47 NT28\n- NT35 \u2192 NT53 NT55\n- NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT10\n- NT24 \u2192 NT40 NT17\n- NT39 \u2192 NT49 NT24\n- NT37 \u2192 NT7 NT33\n- NT53 \u2192 NT53 NT47\n- NT28 \u2192 NT8 NT8\n- NT33 \u2192 NT28 NT15\n- NT36 \u2192 NT120 NT2\n- NT38 \u2192 NT102 NT102? Wait, no wait: looking back, NT38's productions aren't listed, but wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking again, NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6, then NT28 is part of the start rule. But in the productions, NT38 is mentioned in NT36 \u2192 NT38 NT10, NT35 \u2192 NT38, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if each production I need is present. The problem is my list might not be complete, but I think the user provided all the rules, so I can proceed.\n\nWait, in the start rules:\n\nS can be NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, if S is NT1 NT28, then maybe the string starts with t4 (if NT1 is 't4'), then NT28 would have to produce the rest. Alternatively, if S is NT50 NT27, then the string starts with t81 and t16.\n\nSo let's check the initial part. The string starts with t4, which suggests NT1 might produce t4. Looking at the grammar, let me see which NTs can produce 't4'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT4 appears, and its production is NT21 NT15. So NT4 itself is a terminal 't4'.\n\nWait no, looking back, I think NT4's rules are:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, but that's a production rule. Wait, in the list, the NT4 production is: NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15. Wait, that's another non-terminal, so NT4 isn't a terminal.\n\nHmm, that can't be right because in the string, we have t4, which would have to come from a terminal symbol.\n\nSo perhaps NT4 is a non-terminal that can produce 't4' through a production. But looking through the given rules, I see that NT4's production is NT21 NT15, which would require another two non-terminals, so unless those produce terminals, NT4 itself is not a terminal. So 't4' must come from another NT.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT4's production is NT21 NT15, which are two more NTs. So perhaps I need to find NTs that can produce t4, t81, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for NTs that can derive the string when combined with the start rules. Let's consider that the start symbol S can split into two parts, each generating the first and second halves of the string.\n\nThe string length is 27 elements. So perhaps the first part is the first 13 or so, and the second part is the rest, each generated by the first and second parts of S's rule.\n\nWait, let me see: if S splits into two parts, S \u2192 NT1 NT28, let's assume the string is split as [t4, t81, t3, t16, t53, t16, t112, t112, t93, t111, t16, t24, t109] and [t81, t58, t53, t81, t120, t120, t58, t53, t119, t58, t42, t4, t53, t36, t63, t112, t87]. Wait, no, the string is t4 t81 t3 t16 t53 t16 t112 t112 t93 t111 t16 t24 t109 t81 t58 t53 ... etc. Wait, that's a 27 tokens, so maybe the split is uneven.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be generated in steps. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a path from S to the string using the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the start S can split into two NTs, say NT28 and NT50.\n\nWait, S can be NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t4. Let me check the NT1 production for that.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT1 is involved in production S \u2192 NT1 NT28 and also in other productions, like NT13 \u2192 NT43 NT26, etc. But I'm not sure if NT1 can produce t4.\n\nLooking for NT1's production: looking through all rules, I don't see an immediate production for NT1 except in the rules like S \u2192 NT1 NT28. Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Looking elsewhere, perhaps NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, and NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT20, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to track"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-537","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols. There's also a start symbol and some terminals, which I assume are indicated by the 't' followed by a number.\n\nFirst, I'll note the two starting productions: S \u2192 NT1 NT28 and S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So, to generate the string, the parse tree must start with either S splitting into NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27. Since the string starts with 't38', which is a terminal, I'll need to see which non-terminals can derive to 't38'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT38: NT38 \u2192 NT44 NT13. So, NT38 can split into NT44 and NT13. Now, I should check if either NT44 or NT13 can produce more terminals or if they can further split.\n\nFrom the list, NT44 \u2192 NT38 NT13. Hmm, that's circular because NT44 and NT13 are dependent on each other. Wait, maybe I need to find if there's a terminal in either NT38 or NT44 or NT13 that leads to 't38'. Let me check the productions for NT13.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT19 NT9. NT19 is another non-terminal, but checking NT19's productions, I don't see any that produce terminals. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46. Hmm, that's another path. Let me look at NT46.\n\nNT46 has several productions: some with NT20, NT14, NT47, etc. Let me check NT46 \u2192 NT27, which is another non-terminal. NT27 has a production \u2192 NT124, which is a terminal in the string. However, the string starts with 't38', so maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production was S \u2192 NT50 NT27. NT50 is another non-terminal. Checking NT50's productions, NT50 \u2192 NT43 NT50, which looks recursive. Also, looking at NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT50. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if NT50 can derive to 't38'.\n\nLooking through the list, NT50 doesn't have a production to a terminal, so perhaps this path isn't correct either.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's take the first part of the string: 't38 t53 t1 t16 t53 t126 t4 t70 t79 t42 t4 t45 t3 t1 t16 t24 t102 t79 t89 t14 t119 t42 t4 t87 t21 t109 t81 t87'.\n\nThe string starts with 't38'. So the start symbol S must split into two non-terminals whose concatenation can produce 't38...'. From S's productions: S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nBut S can only split into NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27. Neither of these produce 't38' directly. So, the string starts with 't38', which means it's the result of a derivation where one of the non-terminals from S's split directly produce 't38'.\n\nWait, do any of the non-terminals NT1, NT28, NT50, or NT27 produce 't38'? Let me check their productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. Neither of these seems to produce 't38'.\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6. Again, no terminals here.\n- NT50 \u2192 NT43 NT50 or NT15 NT50. Both recursive.\n- NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16, NT43 NT53 or NT54 NT4.\n\nLooking further, in NT27's productions, there's NT43 NT53. NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3 or NT27 NT28. Neither produces terminals. Wait, I'm stuck. None of these seem to produce 't38' directly.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm looking at the wrong non-terminals. Let me check if any other non-terminals can derive to 't38'. Looking elsewhere, NT38 \u2192 NT1 NT6. NT1 and NT6 aren't producing 't38', but wait, maybe through further derivations.\n\nWait, NT44 \u2192 NT38 NT13. So if NT44 can produce 't38' somehow, but looking at NT38 again, it's NT44 and NT13, which then require further breakdown. This seems like an infinite loop and won't produce a terminal.\n\nAnother approach: check the entire string and see if 't38' appears in any production. Scanning through the string: 't38', 't53', 't1', 't16', etc. I don't see any productions for NT38 that would directly or indirectly produce all these.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the very start: the string starts with 't38', and looking through the possible non-terminals, I don't see any that can directly produce 't38' as a terminal. All the productions for NT1, NT2, etc., produce other non-terminals, not terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is invalid because it starts with 't38', which isn't a terminal, but a non-terminal that can't be derived in one step from the start symbol's productions. Therefore, the answer must be No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe a different starting production?

{"custom_id":"request-532","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps because certain parsing methods and algorithms can be applied, like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing it manually, I'll try to find a way to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the productions start from S. The string we need to check is a sequence of terminals: t4, t120, t24, t102, t58, t42, t4, t123, t89, t98, t134, t112, t112, t48, t109, t62, t81, t21, t42, t40, t3, t41, t114, t109, t65, t112, t65, t59.\n\nI notice that many of the productions in the grammar transform a non-terminal into two non-terminals, and some directly into terminals (like NT3 \u2192 t7, etc.). So, each symbol in the string should be reachable from the start symbol through these productions.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree for the string. The string starts with t4, so the first symbol is t4. Looking at the grammar, I need to find a production that directly produces t4.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t91\nNT6 \u2192 t58\nNT47 \u2192 t3\nNT17 \u2192 t94\nNT7 \u2192 t93, t97\nNT24 \u2192 t29\nNT22 \u2192 t58\nNT10 \u2192 t2\nNT55 \u2192 t45\nNT28 \u2192 t76\nNT13 \u2192 t16\nNT46 \u2192 t112\n...and so on.\n\nWait, looking for t4 directly. The only production for t4 is NT4 \u2192 t91. So, the first symbol t4 must come from NT4 \u2192 t91, meaning NT4 is the non-terminal. But how? Looking back, the start symbol is S, which produces NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27. Let me check the productions.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. So, the first production would involve NT1 and NT28. But the first symbol is t4, which comes from NT4 \u2192 t91. Hmm, that suggests that the first symbol is from a non-terminal NT4. How does that fit into the initial production?\n\nLet me think. Maybe NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, and so on, building up from the start. So perhaps the initial steps are expanding the non-terminals in S, which produce more non-terminals, which eventually produce the terminals.\n\nBut perhaps instead of building the parse tree, I can look for the sequence of terminals in the string and see if they can be generated in order.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the terminals appear in a way that could correspond to the start symbol's expansion. Let's try to find a chain from S that could lead to the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find if the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t4, t120, t24, t102, t58, t42, t4, t123, t89, t98, t134, t112, t112, t48, t109, t62, t81, t21, t42, t40, t3, t41, t114, t109, t65, t112, t65, t59.\n\nT4 is the first symbol. From the productions, NT4 can go to t91, but how does that fit into the start symbol which starts with NT1 and NT28?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all productions that result in terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t6 NT3. Hmm, that's a recursive production leading to more NT3, which would produce t6 again, but t6 is another terminal.\n\nWait, no, NT3 produces t6 NT3, which is a terminal followed by a non-terminal. So, that would result in an infinite loop unless it's expanded into something else. But looking at other productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t24 NT6\n\nWait, maybe I'm not looking correctly. Let me scan all the productions for terminals:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT44 \u2192 t114\nNT45 \u2192 t73\n...\nNT46 \u2192 t112\nNT3 \u2192 t6 NT3 (so t6 followed by NT3)\nWait, t6 is a terminal, and NT3 is a non-terminal that produces t6 again? That seems like an infinite loop unless there's another route.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go through each production and note if it directly produces a terminal:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t91 (terminal)\nNT7 \u2192 t93, t97\nNT46 \u2192 t112\nNT40 \u2192 t28\nNT26 \u2192 t98\nNT49 \u2192 t109\nNT24 \u2192 t29\nNT14 \u2192 t79\nNT22 \u2192 t58\nNT10 \u2192 t2\nNT55 \u2192 t45\nNT28 \u2192 t76\nNT41 \u2192 t4\nNT8 \u2192 t102 (Wait, NT48 is something else, let me check NT14: NT14 \u2192 t79)\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake. The productions for NT8 and others may need to be carefully checked.\n\nWait, looking again, for example, NT34 \u2192 t37, NT44 \u2192 t89, NT35 \u2192 t102, etc. So, for example, NT34 can go to t37 or t38 or other terminals?\n\nWait, no, let me check each terminal in the productions.\n\nLooking at each production and seeing if it ends with a terminal or two.\n\nNT6 \u2192 t54 NT6: t54 is a terminal, so NT6 produces t54 followed by NT6, which can be further expanded.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 \u2192 t91, which is terminal, but how does that fit into S which is NT1 NT28.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is to expand S into NT1 and NT28, then each of those can expand into more non-terminals and eventually terminals.\n\nLet me try to map possible production steps.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nNT1 can be expanded as NT25 NT17.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT25 NT17 NT28.\n\nNow, NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT6 NT31 NT17 NT28.\n\nNT6 \u2192 t54 NT6: So this becomes t54 NT6 NT31 NT17 NT28.\n\nSimilarly, NT31 \u2192 NT15 NT39.\n\nSo further expanding:\n\nt54 NT6 NT15 NT39 NT17 NT28.\n\nNT6 \u2192 t54 again, so t54 twice.\n\nt54 t54 NT15 NT39 NT17 NT28.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15: so t54 t54 NT56 NT15 NT39 NT17 NT28.\n\nNT56 \u2192 t20 NT17: so t54 t54 NT20 NT17 NT15 NT39 NT17 NT28.\n\nContinuing, NT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50.\n\nSo t54 t54 NT20 NT43 NT50 NT15 NT39 NT17 NT28.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT43 and NT50, and NT43 can go to NT8 NT3.\n\nSo this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for the order of terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t4, t120, t24, t102, t58, t42, t4, t123, t89, t98, t134, t112, t112, t48, t109, t62, t81, t21, t42, t40, t3, t41, t114, t109, t65, t112, t65, t59.\n\nI notice t120 appears.

The grammar and the string are provided, so I'll need to carefully analyze both to make a conclusion.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal symbol is replaced by exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. This structure is helpful for parsing and for algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S, which has two productions: S -> NT1 NT28 and S -> NT50 NT27.

Wait, the grammar's productions either produce terminals or non-terminals. Let me check: looking at the productions, some of them produce terminal symbols like NT7 -> 't93', NT7 -> 't97', etc. So, I need to see if the string tokens can be derived through these rules.\n\nBut first, I should list out the productions more clearly.

Each one must be derived from some production rule. Let me start by identifying which terminals are present in the string and see if they can be obtained from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see production rules that directly produce t102, t65, t120, t16, t28, t36, t109, t89, t10, etc. Wait, but the given string also has t131, t120, t134, t93, t126, t53, etc. Let me check which of these terminals are directly produced by the grammar.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that NT45 -> 't73', NT17 -> 't94', NT27 -> 't124', NT24 -> 't29', NT46 -> 't27', NT14 -> 't79', etc. But I don't see 't109' being directly produced.

For example, NT46 -> 't27', 't114', 't27', 't3', etc. Oh, interesting. So NT46 can produce t27, t114, t3, etc. So, in the string, we have t38, which is a terminal, but I don't see NT38 producing t38. Wait, maybe I'm looking elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar production rules, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't58', 't21', etc. But I need to see if any non-terminal can produce t38. Looking through all the productions, I don't see any production like NT38 -> 't38' or something similar. So that's a problem because t38 must be a terminal, but I don't see it being directly produced in any production, so perhaps the string contains a terminal that's not present in the grammar, making it impossible for the grammar to produce the string. But wait, in the grammar, many rules produce terminals, but I don't see a rule where NT38 produces t38.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see 't38' being directly produced. The closest is NT24 -> 't29', NT46 -> 't114', etc., but not t38. So that suggests that t38 cannot be produced by the grammar, making the entire string not derivable. But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through the entire grammar again to ensure I didn't miss a production that creates 't38'.\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\nNT28 -> 't76', 't8', 't76'\n\nWait, no. Let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, no NT produces 't38'. The productions for NT7 include some terminals, but not 38. So, perhaps t38 is not in the grammar, making the string impossible.\n\nBut wait, maybe I look through all the NTs and their possible productions. Let me list all NTs and their possible terminal outputs:\n\nNT9 -> 't19' (from NT9), 't17'\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nThe grammar has NT37 -> 't17', NT7 -> 't93', NT7 -> 't97', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the production rules more carefully. For instance, NT7 -> 't93' and 't97', so these can generate those terminals. Looking for t38, I don't see any NT that produces 't38' directly.\n\nWait, looking deeper, perhaps I overlooked NT38. Let me check all the rules again. Scrolling through the list:\n\nNT24 -> 't29', etc.\n\nBTW, is there a production rule for NT38? Let me check all the NTs.\n\nFrom the list, I see NT14 -> 't79', NT15 -> 't48', NT28 -> 't76', etc. Wait, but I don't see any rule that starts with NT38. So, 't38' might not be in the terminal symbols of the grammar, which would mean that the string is not generated.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the end of the list, I see:\n\nNT45 -> 't73'\n\nNT35 -> 't53'\n\nNT37 -> 't17'\n\nNT7 -> 't93'\n\nNT7 -> 't97'\n\nNT46 -> 't109'\n\nWait, here I see NT46 -> 't109', which is one of the first tokens in the string. So t109 is allowed.\n\nBut t38 is in the second position. How can t38 be derived if no NT produces it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's generated via multiple steps. For example, if one NT can produce another NT, and so on until we reach a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps t38 is an intermediate in a longer derivation. Let me see if any NT can produce t38 after some steps.\n\nLooking through the grammar, is there a way to reach t38 through a chain of productions?\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible via some indirect route, but given that in the provided grammar, none of the NT rules produce 't38' as a terminal, I think that t38 cannot appear in any string derived from this grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo, and the string should be 't39' or something else. But as given, 't38' is not a terminal in the grammar's rules.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-558","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm presented with a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a specific string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar is quite extensive with many non-terminals and terminals. The string given is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to determine whether this string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF has two main characteristics: each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to follow CNF correctly since all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t93 t79 t89 t4 t123 t3 t53 t97 t48 t63 t48 t53 t21 t112 t112 t48 t123 t89 t38 t24 t109 t81 t40 t40 t4 t48 t53 t119`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of multiple 't' followed by numbers, which are likely terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of the string would follow a leftmost derivation, where each step expands a single non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut parsing such a large string directly would be complex. Instead, I can try to identify which non-terminals correspond to each terminal and see if the overall structure makes sense.\n\nLet's break down the string into individual terminals:\n\n1. t5\n2. t93\n3. t79\n4. t89\n5. t4\n6. t123\n7. t3\n8. t53\n9. t97\n10. t48\n11. t63\n12. t48\n13. t53\n14. t21\n15. t112\n16. t112\n17. t48\n18. t123\n19. t89\n20. t38\n21. t24\n22. t109\n23. t81\n24. t40\n25. t40\n26. t4\n27. t48\n28. t53\n29. t119\n\nEach of these is a terminal symbol. Now, I need to map these terminals back to the non-terminals that could produce them, using the productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice several productions that directly map to terminals:\n\n- NT0 -> NT31 NT50\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT2 -> T? (Wait, I should check all productions.)\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT3\nWait, I need to look for productions that have a single terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nI see:\n- NT7 -> 't79' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see)\nWait, let's go through each production line:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\n- NT7 -> 't93' (Yes)\n- NT7 -> 't97'\n- NT0 -> 't65' (Wait, no, looking for NT productions that have terminals as RHS)\nWait, in the provided grammar, there are several productions that map NT symbols to terminals:\n\nLooking carefully:\n\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n- NT2 -> NT41 NT15\nWait, no, perhaps I should list all the terminals in the productions.\n\nWait, it's given as a long list, but each line is NT -> something.

Wait, looking at the lines again.)\nWait, I need to parse each line to see if any production ends with a single terminal.\n\nLooking:\n- Line: NT7 -> 't93' \u2192 so NT7 produces 't93'\n- Line: NT7 -> 't97' \u2192 NT7 can produce 't97' as well.\n- Line: NT17 -> 't94' \u2192 NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- Line: NT22 -> 't58' \u2192 NT22 \u2192 't58'\n- Line: NT24 -> 't29' \u2192 NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- Line: NT46 -> 't24'\n- Line: NT47 -> 't40'\n- Line: NT14 -> 't79' \u2192 NT14 \u2192 't79' (so 't79' corresponds to NT14)\n- Line: NT45 -> 't28' (so NT45 \u2192 't28')\n- Line: NT40 -> 't28' (NT40 \u2192 't28')\n- Line: NT48 -> 't24'\n- Line: NT15 -> 't48'\n- Line: NT29 -> 't48'\n- Line: NT56 -> 't112' \u2192 NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- Line: NT6 -> 't54' (Wait, no: Line says NT6 -> 't54 NT6'?

The string is: `t84 t122 t119 t36 t69 t4 t102 t21 t42 t38 t53 t126 t31 t42 t41 t3 t45 t100 t48 t53 t58 t42 t114 t3 t114 t114 t40 t4 t48 t120`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo, for a string to be generated by S, it should be decomposable into either two NT1 and NT28 parts or NT50 and NT27 parts.\n\nNow, the input string starts with `t84`, so I need to see if `t84` can come from either of the initial productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n- NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT54 \u2192 NT53\n- NT53 \u2192 NT47 NT54\n- NT47 \u2192 NT40 NT36\n- NT36 \u2192 NT120 NT6\n- ... and so on. Wait, but looking at the provided grammar, I also see that NT4 \u2192 t91, NT24 \u2192 t122, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's check the rules for NT1.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n- NT7 \u2192 't79'\n- NT7 \u2192 't79'\nBut I'm looking for where a NT1 or NT25 or others produce a terminal like 't84'.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n- NT31 \u2192 't117'\n- NT42 \u2192 't80'\n- NT47 \u2192 't114'\nBut for 't84', looking for rules where a NT produces 't84'.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, there's:\n- NT46 \u2192 't84'\nAnd another rule:\n- NT48 \u2192 't70'\nAlso, NT17 \u2192 't84'. Wait, let me check the rules for NT17 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided:\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT1 \u2192 't69', 't5', etc.\n- NT46 \u2192 't84', 't100', 't27', etc.\n\nWait, here's a rule: NT46 \u2192 't84' is given.\n\nSo, NT46 can produce 't84'. Additionally, looking at NT31 \u2192 't42', etc.\n\nWait, but the initial S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So, S produces NT1 followed by NT28. So, for the first symbol to be t84, the production from S would have to be S \u2192 NT1 NT28, where NT1 produces t84 and NT28 produces something else. Or, alternatively, another way? Wait, no, S must produce either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So the entire string must be a sequence of derivations starting from S, which would split the string into two parts based on the initial production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can produce directly a single terminal, but in this case, since all the production rules start with two non-terminals, the string must be split into two parts based on S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if the string can be divided into two parts, where each part can be derived from NT1 and NT28, or NT50 and NT27.\n\nThe string starts with t84. So, for S \u2192 NT1 NT28, the first part should be t84=NT1, and the second part from NT28 should be 't122 t119 t36 t69 t4 (...) ... t120'. Wait, the second part is quite long. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT50 NT27 is the correct path, so the string starts with t84 must be from NT50 or NT27.\n\nWait, no, because S \u2192 NT50 NT27 means that the string starts with NT50, so the first part should be derived from NT50. So, in the string, the first symbol t84 must come from NT50.\n\nLooking at the NT50 rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT15 NT50 (cyclic?), NT50 \u2192 't4' (from the rules), and other NT50 rules?\n\nWait, per the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT50 \u2192 't4' \nand perhaps other rules where NT50 \u2192 ...?\n\nWait, the rules provided include:\n\nNT50 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT29 NT50 \n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\nLine: NT50 \u2192 't4'\n\nLine: NT50 \u2192 NT29 NT50\n\nSo, NT50 can produce 't4' or NT29 followed by NT50. \n\nNow, the first symbol is 't84'. So, if NT50 produces 't4', but the first symbol is 't84', which doesn't match. Therefore, 't84' must come from another non-terminal, perhaps NT17.\n\nWait, the rule for NT17 is:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't94'\n\nand \n\nLine: NT17 \u2192 't94'\n\nWait, but then how does 't84' come into play?\n\nWait, looking again, I have a rule: NT46 \u2192 't84'. So, perhaps, the first symbol 't84' comes from NT46, not NT17. Let me check the rules for NT46.\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\nLines:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't84'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't100'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't27'\n\nWait, so NT46 can produce 't84', 't100', or 't27'.\n\nSo, if 't84' is the first symbol, it can be produced by NT46. \n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT1 NT28, and NT1 is somehow producing 't46' as its non-terminal, but wait, NT1 is a non-terminal that can be broken down further.\n\nWait, looking at the start symbols: S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So, to get 't84' in the string, the first NT1 must be broken down into non-terminals that eventually produce 't84'.\n\nBut wait, NT1 in the grammar is a non-terminal; looking at the provided rules, where does NT1 appear?\n\nIn the provided grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, and \n\nLooking further:\n\nLine: NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n\nLine: NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n\nLine: NT54 \u2192 NT53\n\nLine: NT53 \u2192 NT47 NT54\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe NT1 is involved in the production of other non-terminals, but I'm getting lost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not in the language because the production doesn't allow for the first symbol to be 't84'.\n\nWait, but according to the provided rules, NT46 can produce 't84'. So, perhaps the first symbol 't84' comes from NT46.\n\nBut then, how does the entire string get split?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the string starts with 't84', which can come from NT46. Now, the initial production is S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nIf 't84' comes from NT46, then the initial production path must involve NT46 as the start symbol, but S starts as NT1 or NT50. So, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT46 NT38 or something, but S is only divided into two parts by S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27. Therefore, NT46 must be part of either NT1 or NT28.\n\nLooking at NT1's rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n\nLooking at NT25:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n\nLooking at NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n\nLooking at NT54:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT53\n\nLooking at NT53:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT47"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-570","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Okay, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the given string and see if it can be derived from the grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form actually requires that production rules be of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. So each rule has exactly two symbols on the right side, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see rules like S \u2192 NT1 NT18, but in the given grammar, I notice that some rules have two nt's on the right, but wait, some have terminals as well. Wait, no, let me check again. For example, rule S \u2192 NT1 NT18: but wait, in the given grammar, does any rule have a terminal on the RHS? Looking at the grammar, I see at the end:\n\nNT44 -> t44\nWait, no, actually, looking through the rules provided, I see that some rules produce terminals, like NT44 -> t44 or a terminal? Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nLooking, I see that for example:\n\nNT45 -> 't87'\n\nSimilarly, NT46 -> 't8'\n\nSo yes, some non-terminals produce terminals. So in this grammar, some production rules have terminals on the RHS.\n\nBut Chomsky normal form allows productions with two non-terminals as well as a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form for context-free grammars requires each production rule to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So in this case, some of the rules in the grammar produce a terminal and a non-terminal, which would be allowed in a modified Chomsky normal form, but I think the user's grammar is in CNF where each RHS has exactly two symbols, possibly terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, so the grammar provided has some rules like NT45 -> 't87' and NT46 -> 't29', which produce a single terminal, which would imply that these are non-terminals that can directly produce terminals, making the grammar a variant of Chomsky normal form. Or perhaps the user's grammar includes productions with single terminals, but in CNF, that's not allowed. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck. In Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So any rule in the grammar that doesn't fit this is not in CNF. Looking through the given grammar:\n\nFor example, rule NT45 -> 't87' fits the A \u2192 a form.\n\nNT46 -> 't8' also fits A \u2192 a.\n\nBut many rules, like NT36 -> NT56 NT10, that's A \u2192 BC, which is fine.\n\nBut a rule like NT44 -> NT44 NT13 is A \u2192 BC.\n\nSo, as long as every production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, it's in CNF. So yes, this grammar is in Chomsky normal form.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some rules have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT1 NT18, but NT1 and NT18 are non-terminals, so the RHS is NT1 and NT18, which is correct for CNF.\n\nSo the grammar is in correct CNF.\n\nNow, the string to check is: `t38 t81 t28 t114 t34 t79 t114 t123 t76 t134 t87 t122 t21 t58 t42 t114 t4 t93 t109 t29 t42 t53 t81 t21 t97 t87 t123 t79 t134 t87`.\n\nThis string consists of all terminal symbols. So, we need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S following the production rules in the grammar.\n\nSo, thinking about how to approach this, perhaps I can model this as a parsing problem: can the grammar generate this string? Since the grammar is in CNF, parsing can be done using the CYK algorithm or recursive descent with memoization.\n\nBut doing this manually might be time-consuming, but maybe a good approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived, starting with S.\n\nAlternatively, since all the symbols are terminals, perhaps I can work backwards: figure out the possible non-terminals that can produce each substring ending in that symbol.\n\nBut perhaps I can start by seeing if each part of the string can be generated by the RHS of any rules.\n\nWait, wait. Each production in CNF only allows the RHS to consist of two non-terminals or a single terminal. So when building the string, each pair of symbols (or any symbol if a single terminal production is allowed) should correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nWait, but since the string is a list of terminals from t87, t123, etc., perhaps each of these corresponds to a production rule. Let me see: can these terminals be directly produced by a non-terminal in the grammar?\n\nLooking through the grammar, several non-terminals end with a 't' indicating a terminal. For example, NT46 -> 't8', NT38 -> 't102', NT15 -> 't93', etc.\n\nSo perhaps each terminal in the string is from one of these non-terminals, and in the derivation, we can chain these.\n\nBut to make progress, maybe a good approach is to see if the entire string can be produced by S, following the production rules.\n\nWait, but S is initially NT1 and NT18. Wait, according to the grammar:\n\nS -> NT1 NT18\n\nSo, the initial step would be that S can derive into NT1 and NT18, each of which are non-terminals. So to produce the given string, the entire string would have to be derived from NT1 and NT18.\n\nEach NT1 and NT18 would then have to produce the relevant parts of the string in sequence. So perhaps the first symbol 't38' comes from NT1, or NT18, producing 't38', then the next symbols come from NT1 and NT18.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's more complicated since each production involves non-terminals and terminals, so perhaps the parsing requires breaking down each symbol into a possible non-terminal application.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to reverse the process: for each terminal symbol in the string, can it be mapped to a non-terminal that produces it directly? For example, 't38' is produced by NT38 producing 't38'? Looking at the grammar, yes, NT38 is part of the rules, but wait, the given grammar has NT38? Let me check the rules provided.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT38 isn't directly present as a non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Wait, the rules are:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT8 -> t102, NT38 -> t102? Wait, maybe. Let me check:\n\nLooking for terminals in the RHS of production rules. For example:\n\nNT38 -> t102: yes, that's a production.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 -> t102.\n\nWait, but then 't102' could come from either NT38 or NT8.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, line by line:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT9 -> NT35 NT46\n\nNT17 -> NT44 NT53\n\nNT26 -> NT14 NT45\n\nAnd so on. But looking for 't's:\n\nNT53 -> NT29 NT3\n\nWait, but wait, for example:\n\nNT36 -> NT56 NT10\n\nND3: NT3 \u2192 t6 NT3. Hmmm, that's a production where NT3 produces t6 and NT3 again. So that would loop, allowing an infinite number of t6s, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut to get back, I thought that in the string, each symbol is a terminal, so each must correspond to a non-terminal that directly produces that symbol.\n\nSo let's list all the terminals in the given string:\n\nThe given string is: `t38 t81 t28 t114 t34 t79 t114 t123 t76 t134 t87 t122 t21 t58 t42 t114 t4 t93 t109 t29 t42 t53 t81 t21 t97 t87 t123 t79 t134 t87`.\n\nSo each is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-588","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the rules seem to fit that form, so that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t120 t70 t89 t4 t34 t126 t36 t109 t117 t97 t91 t120 t89 t4 t24 t112 t69 t38 t109 t119 t84 t93`\nWait, no\u2014let me check again. The string is: `t4 t120 t70 t89 t4 t34 t126 t36 t109 t117 t97 t91 t120 t89 t4 t24 t112 t69 t38 t109 t119 t84 t93`.\n\nHmm, I notice that each part is separated by spaces, so the string is a sequence of terms: t4, t120, t70, t89, t4, t34, t126, etc. Each of these corresponds to a variable in the grammar, I think. Since the grammar starts with S, I assume that the entire string should be derived from S.\n\nNow, looking at the productions, I see that S can go to NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. Each of these non-terminals (NT1, NT28, NT50, NT27) have their own productions. \n\nFor example, NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6. So, t28 would be the result of combining t4 and t6 in some way. But in the string, I see t89, t97, etc., which I need to map back to the non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of building the string by expanding the non-terminals. Each non-terminal in the string would correspond to a path in the grammar tree.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which splits into either S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nLet's take the first option: S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So, the string should start with NT1 followed by NT28. Checking the string, the first two tokens are t4 and t120. So, NT1 must be t4, and NT28 must be t120.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. Hmm, so NT1 would expand into NT25 and NT17. So t4 = NT1, which is t25 followed by t17.\n\nBut t4 is a terminal, right? Wait, actually, in CFGs, the terminals are the leaves. Wait, no, no\u2014wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So t4 would be a terminal, meaning that NT1 must directly produce t4, but in the grammar I see NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17, which are non-terminals. So that can't be\u2014unless my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If t4 is a terminal, then NT1 must be a production that ends with t4. But looking at NT1's productions, all are in the form of NT25 NT17, which are non-terminals. So that would imply that t4 cannot be derived from NT1, unless NT1 can eventually derive t4 through a series of steps.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because NT1's productions only result in non-terminals. Therefore, if the string starts with t4, which is a terminal, then NT1 cannot be part of the leftmost derivation for the first symbol. So perhaps we need to look at the other option, S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nSo starting with NT50 and NT27. The string starts with t4, so NT50 must derive into t4. Looking at NT50's productions: NT50 \u2192 NT15 NT50 or NT10 NT34. Hmm, wait, NT50 \u2192 NT10 NT34. So that would produce two non-terminals, but in our string, the next token after t4 is t120, a terminal. So that can't be. Alternatively, if NT50 can derive directly to a terminal. But from the grammar, NT50 only goes to NT10 NT34 or NT43 NT50. Neither of these produce terminals. Wait, unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back, NT6 can go to t58, t62, etc. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe I should build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the recursive descent approach. Let's see.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t's, which are terminals. Each terminal must correspond to a production that reduces to that terminal.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string: t4, t120, t70, t89, t4, t34, t126, t36, t109, t117, t97, t91, t120, t89, t4, t24, t112, t69, t38, t109, t119, t84, t93.\n\nHmm, this is a lot. Let's see if there are any terminals that are in the grammar as leaves. Looking through the grammar, many of the right-hand sides are terminals like 't93', 't87', etc. So these terminals appear as results of productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice 't93' appears at the end. Now, looking at the grammar, which NT can produce 't93'? Let's see:\n\nLooking at all the productions, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't93'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6', which isn't a terminal but goes to t58 or t62 etc. Wait, no, actually, looking again, some of the productions are 't' followed by numbers, like NT7 \u2192 't97', but others like NT9 \u2192 't19' but then 't19' isn't a terminal\u2014it's further split.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals produce t93. Scanning through, I see NT7 \u2192 't93', so that's one.\n\nSo, in the string, the last token is t93. So in the parse tree, the root would derive into something that includes t93 through NT7. But the root is S, which splits into NT50 NT27 or NT1 NT25 NT17 (Wait, no, S's productions are binary, either S \u2192 A B or A B C? No, in Chomsky Normal Form, S can only split into two non-terminals, so S \u2192 NT1 NT28 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27).\n\nWait, no, each S production is two non-terminals. So the overall string must be the concatenation of expansions of these non-terminals.\n\nSo, S is split into two parts, and each part is a non-terminal that must expand into a sequence of terminals.\n\nIn the string, the first two terms are t4 and t120.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT1 NT28, then NT1 must produce t4 and NT28 must produce t120.\n\nLet's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT1, its productions are NT25 NT17. But both are non-terminals, which would mean NT1 can't produce a terminal like t4, unless there's a chain of productions that leads to a terminal. Let's follow NT1:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n\nThen NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58 or NT45 \u2192 t19\n\nWait, no, NT6 \u2192 t58 or NT45 \u2192 't54' (but no, NT45 says 't29'? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking back at NT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 t58, which is a terminal, or NT45 \u2192 't24'\u2014no, actually, looking again, the grammar for NT6 is: NT6 \u2192 t58 or NT45 (but I need to check the exact productions). Wait, in the provided grammar, NT6 \u2192 't58' is there, but also NT46 \u2192 t112. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT50 NT27 is the correct start, because t4 could be part of NT50's production.\n\nWait, if S \u2192 NT50 NT27, then NT50 must produce t4 and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-587","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on CFGs, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, the grammar structure. Chomsky Normal Form is a set where each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, actually, there's another variation where each rule has exactly two non-terminals, but sometimes they allow a single terminal. I need to check the grammar provided. Looking through the rules, most have two non-terminals except some where a terminal appears on the right side, like S -> NT1 NT1 or others. So maybe it's a mix. Anyway, I'll proceed.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t53 t93 t91 t53 t58 t87 t16 t123 t102 t102 t134 t87 t89 t48 t117 t97 t102 t102 t112 t87 t58 t120 t21 t42 t114 t41 t40 t3 t40 t87`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t4, t53, t93, etc., and it's a list of terminals. So each terminal in the string must be produced by a production rule that eventually terminates in a terminal. \n\nThe approach is to see if each terminal can be derived from the start symbol S by following the rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the terminals in the string and see which rules produce them. Then I can attempt to build a derivation that matches the entire string.\n\nBut there's a problem with the string's length. Counting the tokens, there are 34 terminals. However, in a CFG, each production step can produce up to two terminals, but non-terminals require more steps. It's impossible to produce 34 terminals in 34 steps because each step that produces a terminal reduces the number of symbols, and each non-terminal step creates more, so the number of steps needed would be roughly logarithmic.\n\nWait, maybe I should count how many steps are needed. Starting with S, which is a single symbol. Each production replaces S with two non-terminals or a terminal. But for the string to have 34 terminals, the number of symbols at each step would go 1 (S) \u2192 2, then 4, then 8, etc. Let's see:\n\n1: S (1 symbol)\n\nAfter 1 step: S \u2192 two non-terminals (2 symbols)\n\nEach step doubles the number (approximately) until it's possible to have terminals. To reach 34 symbols, how many steps? Let's see:\n\nStep 1: 1\nStep 2: 2 symbols\nStep 3: 4\nStep 4: 8\nStep 5: 16\nStep 6: 32\nStep 7: 64\n\nBut wait, each step after the first step can only produce two symbols, so to reach 34 symbols, which is between 2^5=32 and 2^6=64. So about 6 steps? But each symbol can eventually become a terminal. However, longer strings require more steps.\n\nBut 34 is not a power of two. For example, 2^5=32, so after 5 steps, we have 32 symbols, and in the 6th step, we can produce more. Let's see: from 32 symbols, each can be replaced by either two non-terminals or a terminal. But to get up to 34, in the 6th step, we might have 32 non-terminals, each of which can produce a terminal in the 7th step, but that would make 64 terminals. Hmm, but the string is only 34, so it's possible but maybe not feasible. Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each internal node (non-terminal) in the parse tree can be expanded. So the total number of leaves (terminals) in the parse tree must be equal to the length of the string, which is 34. So the number of leaves would be 34, which has to fit according to the grammar's structure.\n\nAnother approach is to look for possible units in the string that can be generated by specific rules.

Alternatively, maybe the string includes some 't's that are part of longer productions.

{"custom_id":"request-602","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the string provided is generated by this grammar. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, many rules are like that, except some are more complex, like S \u2192 NT1 NT1 or some NTs having multiple NTs or terminals. Hmm, maybe I should check if all the rules are in CNF. For example, S is a start symbol, but perhaps some NTs have multiple symbols on the right. Wait, in CNF, each production should only have two symbols on the RHS, both non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, some have three parts, like NT44 \u2192 NT44 NT38. Oh, that's not in CNF because they have two non-terminals. So maybe the given grammar isn't in CNF? That\u2019s a bit confusing because the user specified it's in Chomsky normal form. Maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have rules like NT44 \u2192 NT38 NT13, which is correct for CNF, each production has two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. Okay, so all the NTs have two symbols on the RHS. So the grammar is properly in Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the string to check is: `t4 t109 t28 t53 t126 t48 t53 t21 t53 t58 t42 t114 t112 t107 t126 t105 t107 t27 t4 t87 t109 t53 t4 t40 t65 t53 t89 t79 t28 t134 t2 t53`.\n\nEach token is separated by a space, so it's a sequence of terms, each possibly referring to a terminal or non-terminal. But in CNF, non-terminals can only expand into two symbols. Hmm, so perhaps I need to parse the string step by step, applying the grammar rules until I can fully parse the string.\n\nWait, the string seems to represent the terminals that result from expanding the grammar. So each token in the string should correspond to a terminal that can be derived directly from a production, possibly through a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, maybe I can use a recursive descent parser approach or simulate the process of expanding symbols. But that might be complex. Alternatively, I can try to construct a parse tree for the string, using the rules to see if each step leads to a terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that in CNF, every time a non-terminal is expanded, it produces exactly two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. So for the string, each token must correspond to a terminal or a production that leads to that token.\n\nLet me take the string and list the tokens in order:\n\n1. t4\n2. t109\n3. t28\n4. t53\n5. t126\n6. t48\n7. t53\n8. t21\n9. t53\n10. t58\n11. t42\n12. t114\n13. t112\n14. t107\n15. t126\n16. t105\n17. t107\n18. t27\n19. t4\n20. t87\n21. t109\n22. t53\n23. t4\n24. t40\n25. t65\n26. t53\n27. t89\n28. t79\n29. t28\n30. t134\n31. t2\n32. t53\n\nNow, each token must be a terminal that appears on the right-hand side of some production. Looking at the grammar, some terminals include t4, t28, t109, t21, t79, etc. So first, I need to see if each token is present as a terminal in the grammar rules.\n\nWait, I notice that in the grammar, some rules have terminals on the RHS. For example, NT3 -> NT6 NT3, and others. But I need to see if each token in the string matches a terminal appearing in some production. Let me look through the grammar to see all the terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see terminals like 't8', 't93', 't7', 't97', 't46', etc. So some tokens in the string are valid terminals. For example:\n\n- t4 is in the grammar.\n- t109 is a terminal (I see NT30 -> NT6 NT48; not sure, but looking through, 't109' appears in the grammar as NT30 -> 't111'? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, I see entries like NT35 -> 't105', NT37 -> 't17', etc. So looking for the actual string tokens:\n\nLet me go through each token in the string and see if they are present as terminals in the grammar.\n\n1. t4: Yes, appears as NT45 -> 't28', but t4 is another terminal. Wait, looking for 't4' in the grammar. Hmm, I see some rules: NT1 -> 't69', NT4 -> 't91', etc. But is 't4' a terminal? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only places where terminals (like 't87') appear are in NT6's rule (NT6 -> NT54 NT6) but that's a two-symbol rule. Wait, no, NT6 \u2192 't58' seems to be in some rule. Wait, checking:\n\nLooking at NT6's rules: Yes, NT6 \u2192 't58' seems to be an option. So 't58' is a terminal.\n\nBut the string has 't4' as token 1. Does 't4' appear as a terminal in any production? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any terminal 't4' except in some right-hand sides. Wait, looking through, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't42'?\nWait, no, looking again, I see NT33 \u2192 't79', etc. Wait, in the grammar, I see rules like NT35 \u2192 't105', NT7 \u2192 't93', etc. So 't4' is not a terminal in the grammar. Hmm, that would be a problem because the string has 't4', which isn't a terminal in the grammar. So is the string not compatible?\n\nWait, but maybe 't4' is a terminal generated by some NT. For example, looking at the grammar, maybe some NTs can produce 't4' as a terminal. But checking the rules, I don't see any NTs that directly produce 't4' as a terminal. Wait, for example:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 't91', which isn't t4. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check each production to see if any have 't4' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't69'\n- NT26 \u2192 't48'\n- NT4 \u2192 't91'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT7 \u2192 't97'\n- NT46 \u2192 't8'\n- NT21 \u2192 't3'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28'\n- NT15 \u2192 't48'\n- NT39 \u2192 't49'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT34 \u2192 't37'\n- NT28 \u2192 't87'\n- NT35 \u2192 't6'\n- NT15 \u2192 't48'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- NT7 -> 't93'\n- NT10 -> 't2'\n- NT37 -> 't17'\n- etc.\n\nI don't see any 't4' terminal in any of the productions. Wait, perhaps I missed one. Let me go through all the rules again:\n\nLooking at each production for each NT:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT1\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n3. NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10\n4.

{"custom_id":"request-607","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because it simplifies things a bit. Each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It has a bunch of NT symbols as non-terminals and t followed by some numbers as terminals. Each production rule starts with S and eventually breaks down into these terminals. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' followed by numbers, so I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: `t21 t117 t102 t126 t105 t107 t126 t109 t81 t45 t107 t69 t98 t14 t58 t21 t119 t42 t17 t102 t102 t102 t87 t69 t4 t114 t116 t81 t21 t42 t87 t58`.\n\nI notice that each 't' is a terminal symbol, and the numbers after it are specific. Since the grammar only has these 't's as terminals, every production must eventually derive these 't's without any further non-terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar's initial symbol is S, the derivation starts from S and must expand into the string step by step. Since each non-terminal can only produce two other symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal), I can model this as a tree where each non-terminal expands into its children, which are either symbols or non-terminals that further expand.\n\nBut doing this manually for such a long string would be impractical. Maybe there's a pattern or some way to break it down.\n\nLet me look for the rules that produce the terminals. For example, some non-terminals like NT14 produce 't79' or 't94', others produce single terminals like NT46 -> 't8'. But the majority of the non-terminals produce pairs of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking closely, I see that some non-terminals have multiple production rules. For example, NT46 has two rules: NT46 -> NT20 NT8 and NT46 -> NT25 NT13. So NT46 can be broken down into two different paths.\n\nI need to see if the entire string can be constructed by following these production rules step by step. Each step would take a non-terminal and replace it with two symbols, which could be further broken down or be terminals.\n\nGiven the length of the string, I think it's possible that the string could be generated, but to confirm, I need to check if each 't' in the string can be matched by some derivation.\n\nLet me try to parse the string backward. Starting from the end might help because sometimes it's easier to find the last step.\n\nLooking at the last part of the string: ..., t58. From the grammar, I see that NT26 -> NT14 NT45, and NT25 -> NT6 NT31, and NT46 has a production that involves NT24 and others. I also see NT28 -> 't76' and other terminals. But 't58' occurs a couple of times, like in NT46 -> 't58' (wait, no, looking back, NT6 -> 't58' and NT28 -> 't8'... Hmm, wait, I might have misread that.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NT productions have terminals in their bodies. Let me list those:\n\nNT6 -> 't58'\nNT21 -> 't3' (is this correct? Wait, NT21 -> NT37 NT20, but I see later NT37 -> 't24'? Or is it that some productions lead to terminals. Wait, I might be getting confused.\n\nWait, let's go line by line to find all the NT rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> 't87' (wait, line: NT36 -> NT56 NT10; no, that's not a terminal. Then, line 7: NT32 -> 't66', but wait that can't be because line says NT32 -> NT15 NT13; no, wait, looking at each line:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT1 NT1\n...\nLooking for 'a' -> NT followed by something or directly a terminal.\n\nWait, let me go through each production to see which ones produce terminals:\n\n- NT6 -> 't58' : Yes, production line NT6 -> 't54 NT6'? No, looking through:\n\nAt line NT6 -> 't58' : No, actually, I need to check all the lines to see where terminals appear.\n\nLooking back at the grammar provided:\n\n- Line: NT6 -> 't58' : No, actually, in the grammar provided, after NT6 comes 't54 NT6'? No, wait, I think I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar seems to have long lines, some combining multiple rules. For example, lines like:\n\nNT35 -> NT53 NT55\nNT26 -> NT50 NT48\n...\nLooking for where the production is just a terminal (i.e., NT -> a).\n\nHmm, looking through all the lines, I don't see any NT productions that directly produce a single terminal 'a', except towards the end. Wait, near the end, there are lines like:\n\nNT46 -> 't8' : No, looking back, I see lines:\n\nNT46 -> 't8'? Wait, no. Let me list all the NT productions:\n\nWait, actually, it's possible that none of the NT productions directly produce a single terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-621","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has a bunch of productions, and the string I'm checking is a series of symbols like \"t28\", \"t11\", etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit CNF because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is: `t28 t11 t58 t11 t120 t97 t48 t16 t93 t119 t134 t102 t53 t21 t58 t42 t4 t94 t69 t4 t114 t109 t81 t134 t34 t79 t94 t134 t48 t16 t112 t93 t120`.\n\nI think the approach here is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a good candidate for the CYK algorithm, but CYK can be a bit involved. Another way is to reconstruct possible leftmost derivations or see if the string can be decomposed according to the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, since some of the rules produce terminals, I can try to match the string step by step using the rules. However, given the complexity and the number of rules, this might be cumbersome. I should look for patterns or reductions that can be applied repeatedly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice various rules, some with terminals. For example, NT25 -> NT6 NT31, then NT6 -> NT54 NT6, which seems recursive. But in the string, \"t6\" appears, so maybe there's a rule that produces \"t6\". Wait, looking through the grammar, I see NT6 produces \"t54\" and \"t6\". Wait, let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, NT6 -> \"t54\" and \"t58\"? No, actually, looking back, in the grammar, NT6 has a production that becomes \"t58\". Wait, no, let me check again:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT22: NT22 -> NT14 NT45, and then NT45 -> 't87'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, looking for any rule that directly produces a terminal symbol.\n\nActually, looking at the grammar, many rules produce terminals. For example, NT1 -> NT25 NT17, and so on. Wait, but some of them produce terminals. For instance, NT31 has a production to 't117' and 't31'. Wait, no. Wait, let me scan through the grammar.\n\nWait, looking specifically for terminals:\n\nIn NT31, I see 't117' and 't31'?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to go through the string and see if each symbol can be matched by some rule.\n\nThe string starts with \"t28\", then \"t11\", \"t58\", etc.\n\nSo, the first symbol is \"t28\". Looking through the grammar, I should find a production that generates \"t28\".\n\nLooking for 't28' in the grammar. Scanning each rule's RHS to see if it's \"t28\".\n\nWait, none of the rules produce \"t28\" on their RHS. Wait, let me check all the RHS of the rules.\n\nLooking through all the RHS, I see that some NT's produce \"t17\", \"t24\", \"t46\", etc. Wait, is \"t28\" anywhere? Or is it \"t28\" in the string part of a larger symbol?\n\nWait, in the string, it's given as \"t28\". Looking in the grammar, I don't see any production rule where a non-terminal directly produces \"t28\". For example, \"t28\" occurs as part of some productions, like NT28 -> NT4 NT6, but that's not a terminal.\n\nSo the first symbol \"t28\" must be part of a larger term. But in the given string, each token is a single \"t\" followed by numbers. So each \"t11\", \"t58\", etc., are individual terminals.\n\nHmm, this is confusing because if none of the rules directly produce \"t28\", then \"t28\" can't appear as a single terminal symbol in the string. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I've misread the grammar. Let me double-check the grammar rule for NT28.\n\nLooking up NT28 in the grammar: NT28 -> NT4 NT6. Okay, so NT28 is non-terminal and produces two non-terminals.

The grammar is pretty long with many productions, and the string to check is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided seems to fit that structure since each production either combines two non-terminals or a non-terminal with a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t107 t89 t14 t21 t119 t120 t42 t79 t3 t93 t53 t58 t16 t123 t135 t116 t119 t119 t42 t102 t53 t53 t58 t42 t4 t114 t109 t53 t93 t27 t38 t48 t120`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't107', 't89', etc. I'll need to trace through the grammar to see if these ts can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many productions directly map non-terminals to a single terminal. For example, NT46 can produce 't8' or other ts. Similarly, NT35 can produce 't105' or other terminals.\n\nI'll start by looking for a production that directly matches the first 't107'.

So after NT25, the next symbol should be something that produces 't89'. Looking for a production that leads to 't89':\n\nLooking through the grammar, found:\nNT24 \u2192 't11' (No)\nNT44 \u2192 't114' (No)\nNT47 \u2192 't41' (No)\nWait, perhaps it's a combination like NT44 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and then NT8 might produce 't102', and NT32 produces 't66'... but that doesn't seem to get 't89'. Alternatively, NT44 can produce 't13' (Wait, no). Or maybe NT43 \u2192 't69' (No).\n\nWait, perhaps looking at NT32: NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13. NT15 can produce 't48' and NT13 can produce 't16'... Not matching 't89'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, which must be the result of derivations from the grammar. Each terminal in the string must match the output of a production.\n\nLet's approach each token one by one, starting with the first 't107'. As we saw, NT25 \u2192 't107' directly. So, in Step 1, the first token is matched by NT25.\n\nNow, the next token is 't89'. So, after NT25, the next non-terminal should produce 't89'. Let's see if there's a production for NTx that produces 't89'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't98' (No)\nNT32 \u2192 't66' (No)\nNT14 \u2192 't79' (No)\nNT44 \u2192 't114' (No)\nWait, maybe NT with a combination like NT44 \u2192 NT24 NT13. Then, NT24 can produce 't11' and NT13 can produce 't16'... No, that doesn't get 't89'. Alternatively, perhaps looking at NT that directly outputs 't89'. Is there such a production?\n\nLooking again, I find:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't69' (No)\nNT24 \u2192 't11' (No)\nWait, maybe NT36 \u2192 't87' (No)\nAlternatively, perhaps it's via a longer chain.\n\nWait, maybe NT24 \u2192 NT7 NT20. NT7 \u2192 't93', NT20 \u2192 't50'... That gives 't93 t50', but that's not 't89'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT24 \u2192 't11' and NT20 \u2192 something else. I'm getting stuck here. Let's see if there's another NT that can produce 't89'. Maybe looking at NT16: NT16 \u2192 't83' (No), NT10 \u2192 't2' (No). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's think again. The grammar is in CNF, so perhaps each production is a combination of two non-terminals. So, to produce 't89', it must be that some NT x is connected to yz, where y produces 't89' or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to draw some possible steps.\n\nStarting with NT25 \u2192 't107', that's the first token. Next, to get 't89', maybe the next NT is something that produces 't89'. Let me check the grammar for a NT that directly produces 't89'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't94' (No)\nNT27 \u2192 't124' (No)\nNT22 \u2192 't58' (No)\nNT28 \u2192 't76' (No)\nWait, perhaps NT46 \u2192 't100' (No), NT15 \u2192 't48' (No). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's not a direct production. Let me see if 't89' can be produced by a combination. For example, NT44 \u2192 NT8 NT32. If NT8 can produce something and NT32 can produce another, perhaps together they can form 't89'.\n\nLooking at NT8: NT8 \u2192 't102' (Yes, from NT84 \u2192 NT7\u2192 't79' and others). Wait, looking at NT8's productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I find NT84 \u2192 NT7 NT46 (Yes!), and NT7 \u2192 't93' (No), but wait, NT7 has multiple productions: NT7 \u2192 't93', NT7 \u2192 't97', NT7 \u2192 't79'. So, NT84 \u2192 NT7 NT46 would have to combine two of these, like 't79' and the production of NT46.\n\nLooking at NT46: NT46 can produce 't8', 't29', 't41', 't73', etc. So, if NT84 \u2192 NT7 NG46, and if NT7 can produce 't93' and NT46 can produce 't29', that would make 't93 t29', which is not 't89'. Alternatively, NT7 could be 't97' and NT46 't8', giving 't97 t8', which is 't978', but not 't89'.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the way. Maybe another NT produces 't89'. Let me search again.\n\nLooking for NT that directly produce 't89' in the grammar. I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't53' (No)\nNT46 \u2192 't100' (No)\nNT24 \u2192 't11' (No)\nNT16 \u2192 't83' (No)\nWait, perhaps NT39 \u2192 't131' (No). Hmm, maybe there's no NT that directly produces 't89' except through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier with 't107'. Let me double-check. NT25 \u2192 't107' is correct? Let me check the grammar.\n\nYes, in the production list, I see NT25 \u2192 't107'. So the first symbol is accounted for.\n\nNow, the next symbol is 't89'. So, perhaps after NT25, the next production is something that starts with 't89', but that's not possible because each production is either a non-terminal or a single terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the result of a series of"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-636","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, most of the productions seem to fit this pattern, with some exceptions where terminals like 't' are present.\n\nEach production has 'S' on the left-hand side (LHS). The productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT1\nS \u2192 NT50 NT27\n... and so on.\n\nWait, I notice that S itself is a non-terminal, and all the productions either expand S into two NT's or two terminals. So the start symbol S can directly derive a sequence of terminals, possibly, but more likely, it goes through NT's.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t28 t97 t79 t16 t102 t17 t27 t38 t89 t4 t89 t14 t119 t119 t58 t120 t120 t42 t87 t53 t81 t58 t93 t89 t31 t81 t81 t21 t21 t21 t120 t42 t87 t21.\n\nThis is a sequence of 35 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of the string must be a leftmost derivation, and each step involves replacing one non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. Since all productions either expand into terminals or non-terminals, the string must be a result of S being expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, the only way to get a terminal string is through a derivation where all non-terminals (NT's) are eventually replaced by terminals. However, the way the productions are set up, each production seems to have other NT's on the right-hand side (RHS), which suggests that it's not directly possible unless some NT's produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, I see that the productions sometimes lead to terminals. For example:\n\nNT46 \u2192 t24 (a terminal), and other NT's produce 't's which are terminals. Similarly, other NT's might produce terminals, but let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the last productions seem to have NT's converting to 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\nNT35 \u2192 t105\nNT46 \u2192 t8\nNT24 \u2192 t29\nNT32 \u2192 t66\nNT19 \u2192 t126\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, many of the NT's can produce a single 't' followed by a number. But in the given string, we have tokens like t28, t97, etc. So to generate a string with these 't's, the NT's involved must be ones that produce these specific 'tX's.\n\nBut wait, each production in CNF would replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. However, if the NT's are always being replaced by two non-terminals, the entire derivation would consist of a leftmost expansion until we reach terminals. But in this case, the string has terminals that are not covered by the given NT's directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, I see that some NT's have productions that include terminals on the RHS. For example, NT32 can produce NT6 and a terminal t66. Similarly, NT16 can produce NT34 and NT10, etc. But to produce a terminal string, all non-terminals must eventually expand into terminals. But in this grammar, it's possible because some NT's produce terminals directly.\n\nSo the process is that starting with S, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc. The key is to determine if the given string can be built by such a leftmost expansion.\n\nBut this manual approach is tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps we can build a parse tree for the given string.\n\nLet me start by listing the tokens:\n\nt28, t97, t79, t16, t102, t17, t27, t38, t89, t4, t89, t14, t119, t119, t58, t120, t120, t42, t87, t53, t81, t58, t93, t89, t31, t81, t81, t21, t21, t21, t120, t42, t87, t21.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated from the grammar. Let's think about the overall structure.\n\nLooking at the productions for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT1 or S \u2192 NT50 NT27.\n\nSo, the start is S, which can expand into two NT's. Let me think about which NT's can produce t28, etc.\n\nLooking for the 't's in the string:\n\nt28 is produced by NT47: NT47 \u2192 t24, wait no, looking back, there's NT47 in the productions that sometimes produce 't3', 't4', etc. Let me check:\n\nNT47 \u2192 t3 and perhaps other things, but I'm looking at the given grammar. Wait, the last part of the grammar has:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't3', 't4', etc. For example, NT47 \u2192 t4 (in the provided rules at the end). Let me check.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar rules, for example:\n\n\"NT47 \u2192 't41', 't40'...\" Wait, the exact rules given are:\n\nNT47 -> 't3'\nNT17 -> 't94'\nNT27 -> 't124'\nNT24 -> 't29'\nNT22 -> 't58'\nNT32 -> 't66'\nNT19 -> 't126'\nNT46 -> 't24'\n... and so on.\n\nSo specific NT's produce specific 'tX's. For example, NT47 can produce t4, which is present in the string.\n\nWait, looking at the given string: t28 is a token. So which NT's can produce t28? Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6 (both NT's)\nBut no NT directly produces t28. Wait, I'm not seeing any rules that have, say, NT28 producing t28. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar is in CNF, so all productions are of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. Therefore, every production in the provided grammar either produces a single terminal or two NT's.\n\nSo I need to check for each 't' in the string if that 't' is a result of a production that ends in that 't'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let me see if any NT's have a production that ends with 't28'.\n\nScanning the grammar rules, for example:\n\nNT28 is listed, but it's NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6, so that doesn't produce a terminal.\n\nLooking for any NT in the grammar that has a rule ending in t28. For example, I see NT7 \u2192 't93' and 't97', but not t28.\n\nWait, looking through the given rules, I can't find any NT producing t28 directly. So if the string contains t28, how could it have been generated? Because the grammar only allows replacing non-terminals with two non-terminals or a terminal. So unless there's a way to derive t28 from some NT, but so far, I've only seen NT28 producing other NT's.\n\nHmmm, this might be a problem. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nWait, looking through the list of grammar rules, I see several that end with 't':\n\nNT46 \u2192 't8', 't24', etc.\nNT47 \u2192 't3', 't4', etc.\nNT24 \u2192 't29', etc.\n\nBut not seeing any with 't28'.\n\nWait, so perhaps t28 is being used somewhere. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't8' (and also 't58'?)\nWait, no, the rule is:\n\nLooking through the rules, perhaps another one:\n\nLooking, I see:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't8', 't24'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, let me list all the 't' productions:\n\nLooking for 't28' in the grammar rules, each rule is like 'NTX \u2192 NT Y or NT Z' or 'NTX \u2192 a', where a is a single terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-637","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it makes parsing easier, though I'm not sure if I'll need that here. The string to evaluate is `t84 t3 t89 t4 t53 t126 t112 t128 t120 t117 t27 t117 t79 t3 t48 t53 t81 t119 t87 t73 t48 t58 t58 t120 t42 t4 t69 t4 t94 t69 t4 t63 t87 t21`.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's mostly about combining non-terminals (NT) into terminals or other non-terminals. Each production starts with a non-terminal on the left and has two parts on the right, both being non-terminals or terminals. The end of the string has terminal symbols, so I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this sequence.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into parts that might correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. The string has a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which are all terminals. Since the grammar's right-hand sides can produce terminals, I can look for sequences that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some useful productions involve NTs that lead directly to terminals. For example, NT46 can produce 't8', but in the string, I see 't84'. Wait, NT46 has a production to 't114' as well. Hmm, maybe I need to find a path from S to these terminals step by step.\n\nLet me try to map the string starting from the beginning. The first symbol is 't84'. Let's see if any NT leads to 't84'. Looking through the grammar, I spot NT1's production: NT1 -> NT25 NT17. Hmm, but that doesn't directly produce 't84'. Wait, maybe other NTs derive to 't84' indirectly. Alternatively, perhaps 't84' comes from NT34 or another NT.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT46 has several productions. For example, NT46 -> NT47 NT28, NT46 -> ... and also NT46 -> 't8' in some productions? Wait, actually, looking at the grammar rules, I notice NT46 has multiple rules. Wait, no, I think I might be confused. Let me scan the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 -> NT47 NT28\nNT46 -> NT20 NT22\nNT46 -> NT100 NT40\nWait, no, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check all NT46 productions. Looking at the list:\n\nNT46: \n- NT20 NT22\n- NT47 NT28\n- NT0 NT22\n- NT100 NT40\n- NT100 NT22... Wait, I think I might be missing some. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't84'. So I need to find which NT can produce 't84'. Let me look through the productions that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find ND6: NT6 -> 't58', NT6 -> 't62'.\n\nWait, wait, NT6: NT6 -> NT54 NT6 | NT6 NT46 | NT46 NT6 | NT6 NT54 | NT46 NT54? Wait no, looking at the initial part of the grammar provided, the first part is:\n\nS -> NT1 NT28\nS -> NT50 NT27\nNT36 -> NT56 NT10\n...\nThen, near the end, there are multiple NT46 productions that produce 't8', 't28', etc. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 -> NT47 NT28\nNT46 -> NT20 NT22\nNT46 -> NT100 NT40\nWait, no, actually, in the last parts of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't8', etc. Wait, let me parse it again:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n... lots of lines later ...\n\nNT35 -> NT55 NT22\nNT46 -> NT100 NT40\nWait, no, that's not in the provided grammar. I'm getting confused because the grammar as pasted is very long.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. I'll try to look at each 't' segment in the string and see if I can find matching NT productions.\n\nThe string is: t84 t3 t89 t4 t53 t126 t112 t128 t120 t117 t27 t117 t79 t3 t48 t53 t81 t119 t87 t73 t48 t58 t58 t120 t42 t4 t69 t4 t94 t69 t4 t63 t87 t21.\n\nThat's a lot of 't's, each with numbers. So each of these must be produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can look for any rules that produce a terminal, and then see if the sequence can be built from those.\n\nFor example, NT3 -> 't42', so if there's 't42', it can come from NT3.\n\nWait, let's break down the string step by step.\n\n1. 't84' \u2014 need to find a production that ends with that.\n\nLooking through the grammar, perhaps NT31 is producing 't117', which I don't see in the string. Alternatively, looking at the end of the string, I see 't21' at the end, which might come from NT21 -> 't3'.\n\nWait, NT21 has a production: NT21 -> NT37 NT20.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT21 -> 't3'. So 't21' could come from NT21, which is a non-terminal that directly produces 't3'? Wait, no, NT21 -> 't3' is in the grammar? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking back through the grammar, for example, in the lower part:\n\nNT17 -> 't94'\nNT27 -> 't124'\n...\nLooking for any rule where an NT directly produces a terminal, perhaps NT21 produces 't3' or similar.\n\nWait, checking NT21:\n\nLooking through the grammar, yes, under NT21: NT21 -> 't3'. So 't21' would be NT21 producing 't3', but that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait, looking at the last lines of the grammar:\n\nNT21 -> 't3'\nNT38 -> 't131'\n...\nSo yes, NT21 can produce 't3', meaning 't21' in the string must come from another NT that produces a series leading to 't3', or perhaps from NT17 or other.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's start from the end of the string and work backwards, as sometimes that's easier.\n\nThe string ends with 't21' \u2014 let's see what's the rule for that. Looking through the grammar, I find NT21 -> 't3'. So if the last part is 't21', that would require that the NT21's production is 't3', but that's not matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn the grammar, near the end, I see:\n\nNT21 -> NT37 NT20\nBut also:\nLooking lower, I see:\n\nWait, perhaps somewhere else. Wait, wait, the grammar ends with:\n\nNT38 -> 't131'\nBTW, but looking for 't21' in the string: it's the last symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for where a production leads directly to 't21'. For example, perhaps NT47 -> 't73' or something else. Alternatively, looking at the entire string, perhaps the beginning is something that starts with 't84', which is a long string, so we might need to break it down into parts that correspond to non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, considering that this could take a while, perhaps I can look for parts of the string that match the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nWait, I can try to split the string into parts that match the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, so the parse tree should be binary.\n\nLet me attempt to do a top-down parse.\n\nThe string starts with 't84'.

The string is: `t107 t102 t126 t14 t119 t42 t114 t36 t126 t42 t53 t102 t102 t53 t53 t21 t120 t120 t58 t42 t117 t122 t119 t76 t93 t28 t53 t79 t94 t50 t34 t109 t81 t102 t102`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form has each production rule of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. From the given grammar, it looks like all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. That's a good start because it simplifies the analysis.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, and each production starts with S, which eventually breaks down into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. My goal is to see if the given string can be derived from S by applying the grammar's rules step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it consists of a series of tokens (like t107, t102, etc.), which are presumably the terminals generated by the grammar. I'll need to see how these terminals can be generated from S using the grammar's productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, I can use a method like the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent parser to check membership. Alternatively, I can try to construct a leftmost derivation or rightmost derivation of the string.\n\nLet's outline the steps I can take:\n\n1. Understand the grammar's structure and the derivation process.\n2. Break down the string into individual terminals.\n3. Attempt to find a sequence of productions that can generate the string from S.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is quite extensive, it might be easier to look for non-terminals that can produce each part of the string.\n\nLet's try to analyze the string step by step. The string starts with `t107`. So, I'll look for a production that can generate `t107`. Scanning through the grammar rules, I see that `NT15 -> t48`, and later on, `NT15 -> NT6 NT31`, but I'm more interested in the terminal tokens.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I spot several rules that end with 't' followed by a number.

Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands into combinations of non-terminals. The string starts with 't69', which I believe is a terminal symbol. \n\nI notice that the grammar has several productions that result in terminals.

Since S can produce either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27, I can consider both possibilities but start with the first one.\n\nThe string starts with 't69', which appears in the grammar. Checking the productions, I see that S can produce NT41 NT17, and NT41 is NT24 NT17. Wait, no, looking at the productions: \n\nLooking back:\n\nWait, the grammar for S is:\n\nS -> NT1 NT28\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nSo S is decomposed into two parts. The string must start with one of these parts.

Looking for 't69', perhaps in the productions of non-terminals:\n\nLooking through, I see NT33 -> NT79 NT46, but that leads to 't79' and 't46'. Let me check: NT46 can produce a terminal, like 't87' in NT46. But 't69' is in one of the productions.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, in the list, I see:\n\nNT41 -> 't84' and NT37 -> 't17', but not 't69'.

Let's look at all terminals:\n\nLooking through all the productions, the terminals listed are:\n\nt69 (NT1?), t62, t21, t97, t69, t38, t89, t102, t76, t48, t28, t24, t81, t119, t119, t21, t42, t112, t93, t102, t21, t119, t119, t58, t53, t120, t58, t119, t42, t4, t134, t112, t87, t81, t120.\n\nI need to see which non-terminals directly produce these terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, for non-terminals producing 't69':\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked some. Let me go through each production and see if any NT produces 't69':\n\nLooking for 't69' in the right-hand sides (RHS) of the grammar productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't84' and 't42' (as in NT33 \u2192 't42')?\nWait, let me go step by step:\n\nEach production in the grammar has either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI need to find which non-terminals generate a terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't76', 't48', 't28', 't16' etc. Wait, maybe NT46 can produce 't134' or others? Let me check:\n\nLooking for 't69':\n\nWait, I don't see NT6 producing 't69' because NT6 produces 't54' and 't6'.\n\nWait, perhaps NT33 \u2192 't79' and 't46', which do not produce t69. Not seeing it here.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string has 't69', which must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't69' via a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the grammar, certain non-terminals produce 't69', but I don't see any explicit production for 't69' as a terminal. So unless a non-terminal produces 't69' as a terminal, it's not directly possible.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I missed it. Let me check all productions for terminals:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't87' and 't134', but looking for 't69' \u2014 not there.\n\nWait, perhaps 't69' is generated by some longer derivation. Let's think: Maybe NT69 is part of the productions. Wait, looking at production NT9 \u2192 't19', which doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. The grammar starts with S, which splits into two non-terminals, each of which can split further, until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't69'. So perhaps 't69' is a terminal, meaning the relevant production must be NT69 \u2192 't69'. But looking through, I don't see a production for NT69. Therefore, it's impossible for 't69' to be generated directly, unless it's produced by some other combination of non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming 't69' is a terminal. Let me check the production rules again to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't69'.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see a rule like NT9 \u2192 't69' or any other NT producing 't69'. Therefore, unless 't69' can be derived from a combination of non-terminals that eventually produce it, it can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe 't69' is part of a larger derivation. For example, perhaps NT41 can produce 't69' indirectly. But checking, NT41 \u2192 't84' or 't17', so that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe I should re-examine the productions:\n\nLooking through all productions, there is no NT that directly produces 't69'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar, as it contains a terminal that the grammar doesn't have a production for.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's a mistake in my approach. Perhaps the initial symbol S can produce a path that leads to NT9, which in turn produces 't19', but I'm looking for 't69' which I don't see any NT producing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't69' is a misread, but the user definitely wrote 't69' in the string.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because one of its terminals ('t69') is not directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, maybe 't69' is produced via some combination. Maybe NT40 can produce 't28' (so 't28' is in a production), and perhaps that's part of a larger chain. But to have 't69' in the string, there must be a path from S to t69 via other non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-661","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. First, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is a non-terminal symbol on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. \n\nThe string we need to verify is: t69 t97 t79 t102 t36 t123 t97 t87 t34 t16 t116 t42 t114 t69 t38 t34 t69 t4 t70 t14 t42 t40 t27 t4 t53 t102 t58 t120 t42 t79 t87 t14 t119 t42 t93 t119.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many of the productions end with terminals. These terminal productions will directly correspond to the tokens in the string. For example, NT6 -> t58, so any occurrence of t58 in the string is valid if a production with NT6 on the left exists.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t69. Looking through the grammar, NT33 -> NT36 NT32, but that doesn't directly give t69. However, I see that NT1 -> NT25 NT17 and NT25 -> NT6 NT31, and NT6 -> t54 NT6. Hmm, but looking for where t69 comes from, I spot NT46 -> t76 and other t... productions. Wait, more importantly, NT33 -> NT36 NT32, and NT36 -> NT56 NT10. Let me check the rules for NT36: NT36 -> NT56 NT10, and NT56 -> NT20 NT17. And NT20 -> NT43 NT50, as per the rules. NT43 -> NT8 NT3, NT8 isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal. Wait, but then NT3 -> NT6 NT3, so that would loop. Maybe I'm not on the right track.\n\nAlternatively, looking for nodes that produce t69. I see that NT46 -> t76 (which is 76), and that seems to match. But t69 is another token. Wait, let me check NT43: it can produce NT8 NT3, and looking for t69, maybe NT43 -> t69? Let me look: NT43 -> t69 is a terminal production. So if there's an NT43 in the derivation, it can produce t69. But in the string, the first token is t69, so that must come from NT43.\n\nSo the starting symbol S goes like S -> NT1 NT50, and maybe other options. But the string starts with t69 t97 t79..., which suggests that the first part of the derivation leads to NT43, producing t69.\n\nWait, but how does S -> NT1 NT50. Let me check NT1's rules: NT1 -> NT25 NT17. And looking at NT25: NT25 -> NT6 NT31. NT6 -> t54 NT6, which is a bit messy. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that S can be replaced by whichever production it starts with. Let me see the initial productions:\n\nS can be NT1 NT50 or NT53 NT16 (wait, no, original S is S -> NT1 NT50 or S -> NT53 NT16). Wait, actually, the original S is S -> NT1 NT50 or S -> NT53 NT16? Wait, looking back, the first two productions are S-> NT1 NT50 and S-> NT53 NT16. Hmm, I have to correct that.\n\nWait, the user provided grammar steps: first line says S-> NT1 NT50, next line S-> NT53 NT16. So S can produce either NT1 NT50 or NT53 NT16.\n\nSo the string must start with two tokens from either S -> NT1 NT50 (so first two symbols would be the two tokens of NT1 and NT50) or S -> NT53 NT16 (so first two tokens would be NT53 and NT16's productions).\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t69. So if S produces NT53 NT16, then t69 must come from NT53. But looking at the grammar, NT53 has a production NT53 -> NT49 NT54. And NT49's productions: NT49 -> t84. So NT53 would produce t84 and NT54, but the first token is t69, which doesn't match. Alternatively, if S produces NT1 NT50, then the first two tokens would be from NT1 and NT50. NT1's productions: NT1-> NT25 NT17, and NT25 -> NT6 NT31. NT6 is a terminal that's t54, but again not matching t69.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the initial productions. Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nLooking back, under the S productions, it's:\n\nS -> NT1 NT50\n\nS -> NT53 NT16\n\nSo the string starts with t69 t97. If it's S -> NT1 NT50, then the first two tokens should be the expansion of NT1 and NT50. Let's see: NT1's productions:\n\n- NT1 -> NT25 NT17\n\nNT25: NT25 -> NT6 NT31\n\nThen NT6 -> t54 NT6.\n\nWait, that would mean that NT1 would start with something like t54, but the first token is t69. So that can't be. So maybe it's S -> NT53 NT16.\n\nThen the first token would be from NT53. Let's see NT53's productions:\n\n- NT53 -> NT49 NT54\n\nSo NT53 would produce something like t... and t... \n\nLooking for where NT53 can produce a terminal. NT49 -> t84, and NT54's productions: NT54 is in several places. For example, NT54 -> t120, but also in other rules. So NT53 -> NT49 NT54. Let me track:\n\n- NT53: NT49 NT54\n\nNT49 -> t84\n\nNT54's productions: NT54 -> t53, and also as part of other rules like NT54 -> ... Hmm, looking through the grammar, under NT45, there's NT45-> 't8', but that's a terminal, but for NT54, I don't see a direct terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT54's productions:\n\n- NT54-> t53\n\n- and NT54 in NT24: NT24 has a production NT24->t53\n\nSo NT53 would produce t84 followed by something. But the first token is t69, so that's not matching. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Maybe the entire string is a leftmost or rightmost derivation. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with another expansion.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with NT46 -> t76, but that's not in this case. The string starts with t69, so the first symbol must come from a production where NTx produces t69.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT43 -> t69. Yes, in the grammar, under NT43:\n\nNT43 -> NT8 NT3\n\nThen looking for what's 8 and 3. NT8: looking at NT8's productions. Wait, in the grammar, NT8 doesn't have an explicit production as a terminal, but I see elsewhere: NT7->t93? But what about NT8. Let me check.\n\nLooking for NT8: It seems not directly, but I see NT17's production: NT17 -> t94, and also NT7 -> t8, but let me see NT8's rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't immediately see NT8 has a terminal production. Hmm. But looking deeper, maybe it's possible through some rule.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT7->t94 is not present. Let me check the grammar carefully. Under NT7's productions, I don't see a direct terminal, but perhaps through some chain.\n\nWait, let's check NT6: NT6->t54 NT6. So that would loop infinitely as a recursive rule. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string doesn't start with a direct production from the start symbol, but builds up via multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps T69 comes from NT43, as I noted before. Then the first two NTs would come from the expansion of S.

{"custom_id":"request-674","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string that I need to check whether it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me start by trying to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing, but I'm not sure if that helps me with just determining if a string is in the language.\n\nThe given string to evaluate is: `t4 t53 t17 t53 t79 t112 t34 t97 t87 t89 t31 t42 t16 t34 t16 t69 t38 t63 t87 t111 t52 t42 t27 t38 t89 t31 t119 t53 t119 t58 t119 t81 t58 t42 t4 t112 t93`.\n\nWait, I notice most of the elements are 't' followed by numbers. Let's see if these numbers correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. For example, 't4' might correspond to the non-terminal T4, 't53' to T53, etc. But I'm not exactly sure how the grammar maps to the terminals here. Maybe each non-terminal in the grammar produces a specific terminal symbol, like 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking at the productions, for instance, NT17 \u2192 't94'. So when NT17 is derived, it becomes 't94'. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't79' and others. So each non-terminal has a specific production that results in a terminal symbol.\n\nGiven that, I can create a mapping from non-terminals to their corresponding terminals:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- NT46 \u2192 't27' and 't8'\n- NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT44 \u2192 't114'\n- NT34 \u2192 't37'\n- NT36 \u2192 't87'\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT32 \u2192 't66'\n- NT21 \u2192 't3'\n- NT38 \u2192 't102'\n- NT39 \u2192 't131'\n- NT6 \u2192 't58'\n- NT49 \u2192 't109'\n- NT33 \u2192 't79'\n- NT35 \u2192 't53'\n- NT47 \u2192 't40'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT22 \u2192 't58'\n- NT48 \u2192 't70'\n- NT14 \u2192 't58' and 't79'\n- NT35 \u2192 't35' also maps to 't53'\n- I think I might have some errors here because some non-terminals have multiple productions, but their corresponding terminals are different. Wait, some non-terminals in the productions have the same terminal symbol. For example, NT35 \u2192 't53' and 't35'. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait no, looking back, the productions like NT53 \u2192 't53' (but wait, no\u2014it's either something or a terminal. Wait, actually, the productions in the grammar include some lines like NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT54, but others have the 't' terminals. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10 and other similar ones. So perhaps the presence of 't' at the end indicates that the non-terminal is expanded into a terminal.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should construct a parsing tree or use a recursive descent approach to generate the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to see what the string is composed of. Let's parse it into the non-terminals and terminals as per the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t4 t53 t17 t53 t79 t112 t34 t97 t87 t89 t31 t42 t16 t34 t16 t69 t38 t63 t87 t111 t52 t42 t27 t38 t89 t31 t119 t53 t119 t58 t119 t81 t58 t42 t4 t112 t93.\n\nEach t followed by a number is a terminal, so let's map them to the non-terminals as per the grammar:\n\n- t4 \u2192 NT4 (since NT4 \u2192 't91'\u2014wait, no, looking at the productions, NT4's production is 't91', so when NT4 is expanded, it becomes 't91'. But wait, in the given string, there's a 't4', which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the productions, some non-terminals generate a literal terminal, such as NT17 \u2192 't94', NT46 \u2192 't27' and 't8', etc. So each non-terminal can produce either another non-terminal or a specific 't' followed by a number.\n\nTherefore, in the string, each 't' represents a terminal, but the grammar also creates other terminals, so maybe the string is composed of these terminals and non-terminals must derive into the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is in terms of NTs. Wait, no, the string is given in terms of terminals: t4, t53, etc. So we have to see if the string can be formed by expanding the starting symbol S step by step.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's try to find a sequence of productions that could result in this string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the first few symbols and see if they can be derived.\n\nThe string starts with t4. Looking at the grammar, NT4 \u2192 't91', so 't4' would correspond to NT4 producing 't91', which is not a terminal but another 't'. Wait, no, NT4's production is 't91', which is a terminal, so 't4' in the string must correspond to NT4.\n\nWait, but according to the grammars, NT4 \u2192 't91', which is a single terminal. So in the string, t4 must come from NT4. So if the string starts with t4, that suggests that NT4 is the root.\n\nBut the start symbol is S, so S must eventually derive to NT4. Let's look at the productions for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT1 (Wait, no, the first production is S \u2192 NT1 NT1? Wait, looking back, maybe I misread.\n\nWait the grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT1 NT1\n\nThen S-> NT50 NT27\n\nWait, let me recheck the given grammar in the question.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe grammar lines start with S, then various NTs.\n\nWait, the initial lines are:\n\nS -> NT1 NT10\n\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nWait no, the first two lines are:\n\nS -> NT1 NT10\n\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nSorry, looking at the beginning of the grammar provided:\n\nThe lines start with S -> NT36 NT10, S -> NT28 NT4,... etc.\n\nWait no, actually the first line is:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT1 NT10\n\nLine 2: S -> NT50 NT27\n\nWait, no\u2014let me recheck:\n\nThe initial part of the grammar provided is:\n\nS -> NT1 NT10\n\nS -> NT50 NT27\n\nWait, no: wait line 1 is S -> NT36 NT10\n\nLine 2 is S -> NT28 NT4\n\nWait no, perhaps my confusion arises because the user provided a block of grammar which I can't format properly.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a multi-line block, starting with S->NT36 NT10, S->NT28..., so it's more accurate to say that S has multiple productions, each with two non-terminals.\n\nIn any case, the first two productions for S are S \u2192 NT36 NT10 and S \u2192 NT28 NT4. So, for example, S can be derived as S \u2192 NT28 NT4.\n\nSo, to produce the string starting with t4, let's see if the root is NT4. The start symbol S must eventually derive to NT4, then expand into t4.\n\nBut looking at S's productions, does S have a production that includes NT4?\n\nLooking through all the S productions:\n\nS -> NT28 NT4\n\nYes, line in the grammar: S-> NT28 NT4.\n\nSo, yes, S can produce NT28 and NT4. Therefore, the initial steps could be S \u2192 NT28 NT4.\n\nNow, the first symbol in the string is t4, which corresponds to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-695","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite extensive with multiple production rules, and there's a specific string I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF means. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure simplifies parsing because each rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, most of the production rules seem to fit CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT1 and NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10 are straightforward since they produce two non-terminals. However, I notice a couple of rules that might be exceptions, like NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, but upon closer inspection, it's still two non-terminals, so it fits CNF.\n\nNext, I need to check the target string against this grammar. The string is a series of terminals: `t4 t120 t24 t102 t79 t53 t126 t109 t81 t3 t112 t76 t134 t34 t36 t114 t109 t81 t93 t58 t24 t80 t27 t4 t122 t120 t119 t81 t120 t42 t3 t15 t120 t120 t42 t3 t114 t109 t83`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, parsing can be done using a top-down approach, typically with recursive descent or a stack-based method. However, manually tracing through all 50+ production rules to see if they can derive this string might be complex. But perhaps I can approach this by looking for any patterns or terminals that are not present in the grammar and then see if the grammar can produce such a string.\n\nWait, let me check if all the terminals in the string exist in the grammar. The string contains t4, t120, t24, t102, t79, t53, t126, t109, t81, t3, t112, t76, t134, t34, t36, t114, t109, t81, t93, t58, t24, t80, t27, t4, t122, t120, t119, t81, t120, t42, t3, t15, t120, t120, t42, t3, t114, t109, t83.\n\nI should check if each of these terminals is defined in the grammar. Scanning through the production rules, I see that some terminals are defined as part of other non-terminals. For example:\n\n- t4 is in NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15\n- t120 is in NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6 and NT6 \u2192 't58'\nWait, actually, looking back, I see entries like NT6 -> 't58', but in the problem statement, it's a bit messy. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nWait the grammar is given in a way where many production rules end with a terminal string. For example, looking at the production rules, I see:\n\nNT24 -> 't29', which is a terminal.\n\nBut wait, how are the rules structured? It seems that the more detailed rules are towards the end, but they might not be the entire production rules. For instance, a rule like NT46 -> 't87' and another NT24 -> 't29'. So, these suggest that some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar includes terminals as productions for some non-terminals. So, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly, it means that terminal can be part of the language.\n\nLooking through all the given rules, I notice that several have 't's followed by numbers. For example, NT24 \u2192 't29' means that NT24 can produce terminal t29. Similarly, NT46 \u2192 't87' means NT46 can produce t87, etc.\n\nSo, the string provided has a lot of 't' terminals. I need to make sure that each of these 't' terminals is present in the grammar as direct productions. Let me list all the 't' terminals in the string:\n\nt4, t120, t24, t102, t79, t53, t126, t109, t81, t3, t112, t76, t134, t34, t36, t114, t109, t81, t93, t58, t24, t80, t27, t4, t122, t120, t119, t81, t120, t42, t3, t15, t120, t120, t42, t3, t114, t109, t83.\n\nNow, I need to check if each of these 't' strings is directly a production rule in the grammar. For example, does NT46 have a production to 't83'? Looking through the grammar, I see various 't's, but it's unclear if all are covered.\n\nWait, this might be a misunderstanding. In the grammar provided, the production rules are written as A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where 'a' is a terminal. So, each 'a' is a single terminal symbol, not a multi-character string like 't4' or 't120'. For example, 't4' is a single terminal symbol, not 't' followed by '4' as separate.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, some rules have things like NT46 -> 't87', which would mean NT46 can directly produce 't87'. Similarly, NT24 could produce 't29'. So, the terminals are single characters, each being a token like tX where X is a number.\n\nSo, in that case, each of the 't4', 't120', etc., would have to be a terminal in the grammar, meaning their non-terminals have a rule that directly emits them.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, I see rules like NT4 \u2192 't91', so that's emitting 't91' directly. However, we have terms like 't120', 't81', etc., which may not be directly emitted by any rules.\n\nLooking back, let's pick a terminal from the string and see if it exists in the grammar as a terminal.\n\nFor example, t4: Is there a rule that produces t4? Looking through the rules, I see NT41 \u2192 't84', but no rule for t4 unless it's from NT4 \u2192 something. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't immediately see a rule that emits t4. Wait, no: NT4's rule is shown as NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15, so that's not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look in the later rules where production rules directly emit terminals. The grammar ends with several entries where non-terminals produce 't's. For example:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't28'\n- NT54 \u2192 't53'\n- NT46 \u2192 't4'\n- NT24 \u2192 't29'\n- NT29 \u2192 't48'\n- NT39 \u2192 't22'\n- NT39 \u2192 't131'\n- NT46 \u2192 't114'\n- NT46 \u2192 't41'\n- NT56 \u2192 't112'\n- NT54 \u2192 't81'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT47 \u2192 't109'\n- NT27 \u2192 't58'\n- NT17 \u2192 't24'\n- NT33 \u2192 't79'\n- NT0 \u2192 't126'\n\nWait, so for example, NT46 can produce t4, which is part of the string. However, other 't's like t120 may not be directly in the rules. For example, looking for t120, is there a rule producing it?

{"custom_id":"request-706","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens like t4, t109, etc. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) looks like. In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't produce the empty string. The given grammar follows this structure, so that's good.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the initial non-terminal is S. The grammar seems a bit complex with many non-terminals, but the key is to see if the string can be derived step by step by expanding non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string provided is: `t4 t109 t29 t50 t112 t2 t93 t126 t89 t4 t28 t34 t27 t38 t24 t48 t109 t29 t53 t21 t119 t119 t120 t120 t81 t21 t42 t21 t21 t81 t21 t42 t114 t112 t117 t38 t36 t58 t59 t59`.\n\nI notice that the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are the terminal symbols. Each symbol corresponds to a production rule in the grammar. My job is to see if this sequence can be formed by substituting non-terminals step by step.\n\nStarting with S, the grammar allows S to produce either NT1 NT28 or NT50 NT27. So the first step is to see which of these could lead to the given string. The string starts with t4, so I need to look for productions that can lead to 't4'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only production that starts with a terminal symbol is 'NT8->t29', but that's not helpful for 't4'. Wait, actually, let me check each non-terminal's productions to see if they produce 't4'.\n\nLooking at NT1: it has productions like NT4->NT21 NT15, NT1->NT25 NT17, but nothing directly producing t4. Wait, in the given grammar, production NT1 has entries like NT1->NT25 NT17, but in the provided list, there's also NT1->'t84' and NT1->'t78' and NT1->'t69' and others, but perhaps I should check all the nt1 productions.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, in the part under NT1, it's written as:\n\nNT1 -> NT25 NT17, but then in the end, there's a line: NT1 -> 't69', another: NT1 -> 't78', NT1 -> 't2', and another: NT1 -> 't84'. So NT1 can produce 't2', 't69', 't78', 't84'.\n\nSo the string starts with 't4', which is different from these. Hmm, so perhaps the initial production is not the right path.\n\nLooking further, let's check other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT4: NT4->NT21 NT15 and also NT4->'t91'. So 't91' is an option.\n\nWait, another non-terminal, NT26 has productions: NT26->NT14 NT45 and NT26->'t21'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should methodically go through the grammar.\n\nLet me list all non-terminals and their terminal productions, if any.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are some non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT6: looking for 'nt6->t58' and others. Wait, the given grammar for NT6 says: 'NT6 -> 't58'', so NT6 can produce 't58'.\n\n- NT4: looking through the grammar, I see 'NT4->'t91''.\n\nWait, no, wait. In the grammar, NT4's productions are:\n\n- NT4 -> NT21 NT15\n- NT4->'t91'\n\nSo yes, NT4 can produce 't91'.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 has a production ending with 't21' (line: NT26->'t21'), so NT26->t21.\n\nAlso, NT46 has NT46->'t8' and NT46->'t27', etc.\n\nWait, let me list out all non-terminals that have a direct terminal production:\n\n- NT3: NT3->'t6 NT3' isn't a terminal; looking further, NT3->'t17' perhaps? No, let me check. Wait, in the grammar, NT3 has lines like NT3->'t94' (probably 't94'), but I need to look.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go line by line through the given grammar to pick up all non-terminals that have a terminal as their production.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\n- NT7->'t93' (so NT7 can produce t93)\n- NT10->'t2' (so NT10 produces t2)\n- NT12-> (looking through the lines, I see NT17->'t94' but NT17 is part of a larger production)\n- NT24->'t29', so NT24->t29\n- NT27->'t79' (line: NT27->'t79')\n- NT33->'t79' (another line: NT33->'t79')\n- NT41->'t5' (line: NT41->'t5')\n- NT45->'t36' (line: NT45->'t36')\n- NT46->'t8' (line: NT46->'t8')\n- NT49->'t114' (line: NT49->'t114')\n- NT53->'t45' (line: NT53->'t45') but NT45->t36, etc.\n- NT56->'t134' (line: NT56->'t134')\n- NT32->'t66' (line: NT32->'t66')\n- NT26->'t48' (line: NT26->'t48')\n- NT13->'t16' (line: NT13->'t16')\n- NT15->'t48' (NT15->'t48')\n- NT19->'t126' (line: NT19->'t126')\n- NT29->'t48' (line: NT29->'t48')\n- NT28->'t89' (line: NT28->'t76' and NT28->'t89'?)\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT28 has:\n\nNT28->NT4 NT6\nNT28->NT8 NT8\n\nBut looking earlier lines, is there a terminal production for NT28? Let me check. \n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, for NT28, the productions are NT4 NT6 and NT8 NT8. So no terminal productions directly.\n\nBut NT8 is in the grammar: looking for NT8 productions, I see NT28->NT8 NT8. Does NT8 have a terminal?\n\nLooking through the grammar, looking for NT8:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see NT8->'t89' (line: NT8->'t89'), so NT8 produces 't89'. So NT28 can be NT8 NT8, so each NT8 becomes 't89', so NT28 produces 't89 t89'.\n\nWait, in the string, I see t89 appears a few times. So that's a possibility.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals that can produce terminals are:\n\n- NT3->'t42' (is there a line where NT3->'t42'? Let me check: looking back, I see NT3 has lines like NT3->'t94' and others, but perhaps I need to confirm.\n\nWait, let me go through each line carefully:\n\nNT36->'t59' (line: NT36->'t59')\nNT38->'t102' (line: NT38->'t102')\nNT44->'t89' (line: NT44->'t89')\nNT46->'t3' (line: NT46->'t3')\nNT13->'t16' (line: NT13->'t16')\nNT15->'t48' (line: NT15->'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This looks a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. \n\nThe string to be checked is a sequence of terminals starting with 't120' and ending with 't119', with various numbers in between. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string using the given grammar. Since it's a CNF grammar, I can build a parse tree or use a parsing algorithm that works with CNF, like the CYK algorithm. But manually doing CYK might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT1 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT50 NT27\n\nSo, the string should start with either NT1 and NT28 or NT50 and NT27. \n\nLet me look at the string: It starts with 't120 t117 t53 t126 t48 t21 t53 t119 t119 t119 t42 t4 t45 t21 t117 t126 t45 t28 t87 t117 t38 t28 t73 t53 t79 t94 t87 t58 t70 t102 t119 t21 t120 t42 t38 t63 t109 t119 t119 t120 t42 t76'\n\nI notice that the initial NT is 't120', so let's see which non-terminal derives to 't120'. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6' but also other rules. Actually, I should check each NT production to see where 't120' comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n- NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6'\n- NT46 \u2192 't20 NT8'\n- NT20 \u2192 't43 NT50'\n- NT43 \u2192 't8 NT3'\n\nWait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, checking all rules where NTs derive to terminals with 't' and are followed by numbers. Or perhaps I should look for rules that directly produce a terminal with a specific number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial NT1 \u2192 ... Let me look at NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17\n\nHmm, not a terminal. Looking for NTs that have direct productions to terminals. Scanning through:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't6 NT3' (but it also has NT6 \u2192 't54 NT6', which is recursive), same with NT4: NT4 \u2192 't91'\n\nWait, looking for rules where NT directly produces a terminal.\n\nWait, NT4's production is NT4 \u2192 't91'. Yes! So NT4 directly produces 't91', so that's a possible route.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other NTs that produce terminals:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't24' and NT7 \u2192 't93', NT14 \u2192 't79', NT17 \u2192 't94', NT27 \u2192 't124', etc. \n\nBut in the string, the first element is 't120'. So I need to see which NT leads to 't120'. Hmm, perhaps no NT directly produces 't120'. So maybe the string isn't possible?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, let me check all NT productions that result in terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't6 NT3' (but this is a chain)\n- NT7 \u2192 't24', 't93'\n- NT14 \u2192 't79'\n- NT17 \u2192 't94'\n- NT20 \u2192 't43', 't3'\n- NT27 \u2192 't124'\n- NT29 \u2192 't48', 't119'\n- NT33 \u2192 't79', 't97'\n- NT36 \u2192 't87', 't120'\n- NT38 \u2192 't102', 't131'\n- NT39 \u2192 't131', 't41'\n- NT41 \u2192 't19', 't10', 't52'\n- NT42 \u2192 't2', and so on.\n\nWait, looking for 't120'. In the grammar, I see that NT36 \u2192 't87' in one production, and another production: NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT10. But 't87' is a terminal, and other parts are NTs. So perhaps the direct production that includes 't120' is in a longer production.\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nLooking at NT36:\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT21\n- NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT46\n\nWait, not 't120' directly.\n\nWait, looking at NT46: NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT8, which can produce 't24' and 't87' respectively? Or perhaps via other productions.\n\nLooking deeper, for example, NT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50 and NT50 \u2192 NT4 NT34.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to find possible derivations.\n\nThe string starts with 't120', so let me check if any NT can produce 't120':\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some NTs have chain productions to terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 t54 NT6, but it also has NT26 \u2192 t50 nt48.\n\nWait, no. I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT21 might eventually lead to a terminal. Let me see:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't112' (is that a terminal? Let me check. Oh, yes, in the grammar, NT56 \u2192 't112' as per the provided list.)\n\nAnd NT21 \u2192 't3' and other things. Let me check NT21.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions: NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT20, and NT20 \u2192 NT43 NT50, and NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT3 (and 't69'), NT50 \u2192 't4' (is t4 a terminal? Wait, in the grammar, NT4 \u2192 t91, so '4' is just a number without a 't'. So t4 is a terminal? Or not?\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar rules have 't-something', like 't93', 't87', etc. So 't4' might not be a terminal\u2014it would be part of an NT production, perhaps. Or maybe it is a terminal. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, from the grammar rules, NT4 \u2192 t91, so t91 is a terminal. So any term without 't' is a number, but with 't' seems like a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, I'm not sure. In the provided grammar, it's written as 't93' which is a terminal, but NT4 produces t91. So the actual terminals are those with 't', like 't102', while others like 't2' might be a terminal or not. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see that some rules have both NTs and terminals. For example, NT28 \u2192 t8 t8. So 't8' is a terminal. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 t7 t94, so '7' and '94' are terminals? Or are they just part of the production?\n\nWait, no. If NT17 \u2192 t94, then 't94' is a terminal. If it's '94' without 't', it's a number.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has entries like NT9 \u2192 t19, so 't19' is a terminal, but '19' without 't' might not be. For example, looking at rule NT26 \u2192 NT14 t8, so '8' is a terminal, but t8 is as well.\n\nWait, I think that in this grammar, any rule where the right-hand side (RHS) has 't' followed by a number is a terminal. Like 't87' is a terminal, but 'nt50' is an NT.\n\nSo, for example, NT56 \u2192 't112' is a terminal.\n\nSo, focusing on the initial part of the string: 't120'. I need to find which NT can produce"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-768","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string that I need to determine whether it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky normal form, which I recall means that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. That's helpful because Chomsky normal form makes parsing and understanding the grammar structure clearer.\n\nNow, the start symbol is S, and the productions are given from S down to various non-terminals and terminals. The terminals are all the 't' strings with numbers, like t4, t53, etc. Non-terminals are letters like S, N, T, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t53 t79 t102 t102 t102 t97 t16 t102 t16 t58 t28 t87 t58 t120 t119 t81 t119 t58 t42 t87 t89 t102 t36 t28 t53 t126 t45 t58 t27 t58 t87 t28 t63 t117 t38 t58 t42 t81 t21 t58 t42 t93 t16 t134 t48`.\n\nWow, that's quite a long string. So, the first thing I might consider is how the grammar can produce such a string. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, the grammar is straightforward, but the string is complex with multiple terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the provided grammar. Parsing in this context means applying the production rules step by step to see if we can derive the string starting from S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the productions and see which terminals and non-terminals they produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT28: So S can produce two non-terminals, the first is NT1, the second is NT28. Then each NT can produce more NTs, eventually producing terminals.\n\nI should try to see how each part of the string can be derived. But this might be tedious because the string is long. Alternatively, I can consider the structure of the grammar to see if the string can be formed.\n\nI notice that NT13 appears in several productions, like NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6, NT16 \u2192 NT10 NT34, etc. Perhaps certain terminals are parts of certain production chains.\n\nLooking for 't4' as the first symbol. Let's see which production leads to 't4'. Scanning through the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT15: Hmm, NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT20, so that's more non-terminals.\n- NT44 \u2192 NT38 NT13: Still non-terminals.\n- NT45 \u2192 't87': Oh, wait! NT45 directly produces 't87'. But the first symbol is 't4', so how is 't4' produced?\n\nWait, looking again: The first production is S \u2192 NT1 NT28. So if I start at S, I can choose other productions for NT1 and NT28.\n\nWait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form usually has two symbols on the right, so maybe NT1 and NT28 are non-terminals. So from S, I can go to NT1 and NT28. Each of these, in turn, will produce other non-terminals until they generate a terminal.\n\nSo the string starts with 't4'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't4':\n\nLooking through, not immediately obvious. Let me list all productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6: That's a cycle, but not a terminal.\n- NT45 \u2192 't87': Ah, that's a terminal.\n- NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15: Also a cycle.\n- NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT13: Still non-terminals.\n- NT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46: Both non-terminals.\n- NT55 \u2192 't112': Another terminal.\n- NT24 \u2192 NT40 NT17: None terminals.\n- NT39 \u2192 NT49 NT24: Non-terminals.\n- NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15: Wait, actually another terminal for NT31 when looking at other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for each 'tX' in the string, which NT can produce them.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't4' is production of NT45 \u2192 't87' no, wait NT45 is not 't4'. Wait, looking through:\n\nWait, in the grammar rules:\n\n- NT45 is directly the terminal 't87': NT45 \u2192 't87'.\n- Similarly, NT46 is 't8' (look, NT46 \u2192 't8' in many rules, like in NT24: NT46 \u2192 't87'? Wait, no. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through, here are some terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't58': Wait, no, looking at the rule: wait, in the grammar, a production for NT6 is shown as NT6 \u2192 NT58 (Wait, no, in the given list, I have:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6: Not directly terminal.\n\nLooking deeper:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT56 NT15: Not terminal.\n- NT2 \u2192 ... No, wait, maybe I'm losing track.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all the direct terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT53 \u2192 NT29 NT3\n- NT35 \u2192 NT10 NT38\n- NT47 \u2192 NT40 NT36\n- NT34 \u2192 NT36 NT32\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT20\n- NT17 \u2192 NT44 NT53\n- NT27 \u2192 NT39 NT16\n- NT24 \u2192 NT40 NT17\n- NT14 \u2192 NT24 NT0\n- NT46 \u2192 NT20 NT8\n- NT14 \u2192 NT24 NT0\n- NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\n- NT9 \u2192 NT35 NT46\n- NT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31\n- NT43 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT35\n- NT26 \u2192 NT14 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT35 NT34\n- NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT14\n- NT44 \u2192 NT38 NT13\n- NT29 \u2192 NT20 NT24\n- NT29 \u2192 NT15 NT39\n- NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6: Hmm, wait, this means NT6 can only produce more non-terminals, but also, are there any direct terminals?\n\nWait, looking again, I see no NT directly mapping to 't4'. Hmm, maybe I need to check if 't4' is produced by some NT.\n\nWait, looking at the rules for NT1, NT2, etc., perhaps:\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT25 NT17. Not terminal.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT6 NT31.\n\nNT6 is not a terminal, unless NT6 \u2192 'tX' but I don't see NT6 directly. From the rules, NT6 has no terminal production\u2014only NT6 \u2192 NT54 NT6, which is a recursive rule for NT6.\n\nWait, but there is NT45 \u2192 't87'; that's a terminal but 't45' as a terminal. But the string starts with 't4', not 't45'.\n\nWait, I'm now confused. Let me re-examine the grammar rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, are there any non-terminals that produce terminals which are in the string? Let's look again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't87' \u2014 so it produces 't87'.
