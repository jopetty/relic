{"custom_id":"request-6","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string 't56' is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make things a bit easier because each production is straightforward without any \u03b5 or other complexities.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar and identify all the production rules that lead to the terminals. Since the string is just one symbol, 't56', I\u2019m assuming that it's a single terminal symbol. In the grammar, I need to see if there's a production that directly produces 't56' or if it can be derived through a series of steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a production where the non-terminal becomes 't56'. Most of the rule bodies contain non-terminals like S, NT2, NT3, etc., except some have 't' followed by numbers. But do any of these non-terminals directly produce 't56'?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that some rules have terminals like 't28', 't14', 't61', etc. For instance, one production is NT17 -> 't14'. So each NT has a specific string it can generate if followed through. Maybe 't56' is one of these terminal symbols.\n\nI need to trace the possible derivations. Let's start with the start symbol S. S can produce NT21 NT28. So S -> NT21 NT28. Now, each of these can produce terminals or other non-terminals. Looking at NT21 and NT28, let's see what they can produce.\n\nNT21 has rules like NT21 -> NT32 NT6, NT21 -> NT6 NT0, etc. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT21 is defined with several rules, including some with 't's. For example, NT21 -> 't8', which is exactly one of the desired symbols. So if NT21 can produce 't8', then perhaps we need to see how NT28 contributes.\n\nWait, the string is 't56'. So S -> NT21 NT28. If NT21 can produce 't8' and NT28 can produce 't56' directly, then 't8 t56' would be the production. But does NT28 have a production that results in 't56'? Or is it that we need to derive 't56' through other means.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, each rule body is a pair of non-terminals or terminals. So to get 't56', there must be a path where one non-terminal produces 't56' or some combination that leads to it. Let me check each non-terminal that can produce a 't'.\n\nLooking through the list, I see rules like:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT34 -> 't14'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT17 -> 't49' (Wait, no, NT17 is defined as NT17 -> 't14' and NT17 -> 't49'? Or is it another NT? Let me check.)\n\nWait, looking more carefully, there's a rule NT0 -> 't17', and NT17 -> 't14' and NT17 -> 't49'. So NT17 can produce both 't14' and 't49' through different productions. So if the string is 't56', I'm not sure if that's a terminal directly.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I don't see a non-terminal that directly produces 't56'. Only some produce 't' followed by another number. For example, NT23 -> 't40', NT15 -> 't68', etc. So unless 't56' is directly produced by a non-terminal or through a series of steps, the string won't be generated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the NTs again. Does any NT produce 't56'? Looking through all the rules, I don't see any with 't56'. So perhaps 't56' is not directly produced by any rule, which would mean the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through some combination of rules, but the string is only one symbol, so it can't be a combination of multiple symbols. Therefore, unless there's a rule that directly produces 't56', the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. Let's consider if any NT can reach 't56'. For example, NT23 -> 't40', and if there's a way from 't40' to 't56', but 't40' is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Therefore, it can't produce anything further. Similarly, other terminals are single characters, so they can't combine to form longer strings. Since the desired string is a single 't56', which isn't a terminal, and no NT produces it, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

All the terminal rules end with `t` followed by a number, but none of them are `t51`.\n\nHmm, that's confusing because `t51` isn't listed as a terminal symbol in the grammar. Maybe I made a mistake in looking. Let me search again.\n\nScrolling down, I see that some rules produce similar-looking `t` with numbers, but `t51` isn't there. For example, `t50` exists (`\"t50\"`), `t41`, `t54`, `t77`, etc., but not `t51`.\n\nSo, if the grammar doesn't have a rule that produces `t51`, then the string `t51` cannot be generated by this grammar. It's impossible because there's no production that directly outputs `t51`. All the production rules either involve non-terminals or produce different terminals like 't41', 't54', etc.\n\nAlternatively, could the string `t51` be a result of combining non-terminals that somehow resolve to `t51`? But given that all productions are in CNF, every step only replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since `t51` isn't a terminal symbol, it's impossible for any production rule to generate it directly. Additionally, for it to be generated indirectly, some non-terminal would have to eventually produce `t51`, but none of the terminal rules do this.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string `t51` is not producible by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to check is \"t49 t66\". Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar is generating. Typically, in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. So, looking at the given grammar, most of the rules like S -> NT21 NT28, etc., fit this pattern. \n\nNow, the string \"t49 t66\" consists of two tokens: t49 and t66. In the grammar, I notice that some symbols like t6, t7, etc., are terminals. For example, 't6' is directly produced from NT26, NT18, and others. Similarly, 't3' comes from NT7, 't8' from NT18, and so on.\n\nLet me look through the grammar to see where these terminals appear. I see that some of the non-terminals like NT17 and others are directly mapped to terminals. For instance, NT17 -> 't14', so NT17 is a terminal in this case.\n\nGiven that the string is two tokens, it suggests that the derivation process must have gone through two production steps. Each step would involve replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols, and ultimately, these non-terminals would resolve to the given terminals.\n\nLet me see if I can trace back from the string \"t49 t66\" to see how it could be generated. I remember that in the grammar, certain non-terminals produce terminals. For example, from NT24 -> t71, NT23 -> t52, NT22 -> t8, etc.\n\nWait, \"t49\" doesn't immediately pop up in any single production. Let me check all the productions for terminals. Hmm, I see that some non-terminals don't directly produce t49 but others do, like NT25 -> t77, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, looking at the production NT23 -> t52, that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for production rules where the right-hand side includes non-terminals that eventually produce t49 and t66. Let me check the grammar for non-terminals that produce t49 and t66.\n\nLooking through, I see NT17 -> t14, NT0 -> 't17', and others. Hmm. Maybe t66 is another one. Wait, NT6 -> t68, NT13 -> t6, but not t66. Let me see NT22 -> t8, NT27 -> t22, but no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look for t49 and t66 in the rules. There's a NT31 -> 't31' and so on. Wait, no. In the grammar, the non-terminals that directly map to terminals include t6, t7, t8, t14, t16, t21, t22, t23, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t29, t30, t31, and some others.\n\nI don't see t49 or t66 being directly produced by any non-terminal. Hmm, does that mean the string is not part of the language? Or perhaps I'm missing a production path.\n\nWait, maybe t49 and t66 come from longer derivations. Let me check if any non-terminals produce combinations that include these. For example, NT24 -> t71, NT20 -> t29 NT32, but that doesn't help. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking at NT17 -> 't14', which might be used in a production. For example, S -> NT32 NT14, which would be 't54 t14', but that's not our string.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for production rules that could produce 't49' and 't66' in the final string. Let me check the rules where the right-hand side could lead to these terminals. For example, is there any NT that leads to t49 or t66?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly leading to t49 or t66. For example, NT23 -> t52, NT25 -> t77, NT19 -> t25, etc. So, maybe the string isn't part of the language, which would mean the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to ensure I'm not missing anything. Maybe through some chain of productions. For example, could any NT lead to t49 via other steps? Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT33 -> t49. Yes, there's a production NT33 -> t49. So, that's a terminal. Now, how is NT33 derived? Let me check the grammar for NT33's production.\n\nLooking through, I notice that NT33 has multiple productions: NT33 -> t7 NT22, NT33 -> t7 NT28, etc. But wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT33 -> t7 NT22\nNT33 -> t7 NT28\nand also NT33 -> t49, t70, etc.?\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused. Looking back at the given grammar:\n\nAh, I see some entries like:\n\nNT33 -> t7 NT22\nNT33 -> t7 NT28\nAnd other rules such as NT33 -> t49, NT33 -> t70, NT33 -> t60.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me look again. The given grammar has:\n\nNT7 -> t84\n\nNT0 -> t17\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nFor NT33: I see entries like\n\nNT33 -> t49\n\nNT33 -> t60\n\nNT33 -> t7 NT22\n\nNT33 -> t7 NT28\n\nBut I don't see the ones you mentioned. Wait, let me scan the provided grammar carefully for NT33.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT33 -> t33 NT19\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me re-examine the original grammar provided by the user.\n\nUpon checking, the lines are:\n\nNT33 -> NT33 NT19\n\nNT22 -> NT29 NT2\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT33 directly mapping to t49 or t66. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I look for 't49' and 't66' as terminals. The production for NT17 is 't14', NT26 is 't28', but that's it. Wait, perhaps the string is part of a larger derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is 't49 t66', which might come from a production like NT23 -> t40 NT28 or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is part of the start symbol S, which first breaks down into NT21 NT28, and then each of those into non-terminals leading to terminals.\n\nBut in order for the string to be \"t49 t66\", the entire string must be generated by the start symbol S after two productions.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S -> NT21 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, etc.\n\nSo, the first step is to produce S into two non-terminals. Then, each of those needs to produce the required terminals.\n\nBut in the given grammar, I don't see any direct production from NT21 or NT28 leading to 't49' or 't66'. Wait, S -> NT21 NT28 would become 't8' t50? Because looking back, S -> NT21 NT28 would expand to the productions of NT21 and NT28.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: Each non-terminal is replaced step by step. Let's try to see if S can produce a string of two terminals that matches \"t49 t66\".\n\nWait, S can be rewritten as two non-terminals, each of which can produce a terminal. So, perhaps S -> NT21 NT28, and then NT21 -> 't8' and NT28 -> 't66'? Is that possible?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT21 has several productions, one of which is NT21 -> 't6' and another is NT21 -> NT26 NT6, etc. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT1 -> NT6 NT27, and others. Wait, no, for NT21:\n\nThe productions for NT21 are:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6,\n\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0,\n\nNT21 -> NT25 NT13,\n\nand others.\n\nBut I don't see any production where NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-25","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t41 t16` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, where do I start? The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because it means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make the analysis a bit easier.\n\nFirst, I should look at the string and see what it consists of. The string has two tokens: `t41` and `t16`. Both are terminals, so they must come from some terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to find where `t41` and `t16` appear as direct terminals. Let's scan through the productions:\n\n- I see `NT5 -> 't41'`: So `t41` is produced by NT5.\n\n- For `t16`: Scanning the productions, I find `NT18 -> 't66'`, `NT17 -> 't14'`, `NT16 -> 't6'`, and so on. Wait, `NT18` produces `t66`, not `t16`. Looking further, I see `NT16 -> 't10'`, `NT25 -> 't77'`, `NT20 -> 't17'`, etc. Hmm, does any non-terminal produce `t16`? Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through all the productions again. Oh, here's `NT18 -> 't16'`\u2014yes, okay, that's correct. So `t16` is produced by NT18.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see `NT18 -> 't66'`, `NT17 -> 't14'`, but I don't see `t16` directly. Wait, did I miss it? Let me go through the list again. Oh, here it is: `NT18 -> 't16'`! So `t16` comes from NT18. Great.\n\nSo the string `t41 t16` corresponds to NT5 producing `t41` and NT18 producing `t16`. But that doesn't necessarily mean the entire string can be generated. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two symbols. So the string must come from a derivation where each step doubles the number of symbols, halving the length each time until it becomes the string.\n\nBut the string has two symbols. Let me think about how this could happen. The initial symbol is S. So the derivation must start with S and end with the string of `t41 t16`. Since S is on the left, let's see what S produces:\n\nS can produce:\n1. NT21 NT21\n2. NT32 NT14\n3. NT20 NT25\n\nSo S splits into two non-terminals. Then each of those can split further.\n\nLooking at the string `t41 t16`, each terminal must come from a production that directly generates it. So let's check if `t41` can be generated by any of the NTs.\n\nFrom the list, `t41` is from NT5. Let's see how NT5 is produced. It looks like NT5 can produce `t41` or also other things. Wait, here's `NT5 -> 't41'` and `NT5 -> 't40'`? Wait no, I think I'm mixing up. Let's check the grammar correctly.\n\nWait the productions for NT5:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- `NT5 -> 't41'`\n- `NT5 -> 't40'?` Wait no, the list I have says:\n\nWait the user provided a long list of productions. For NT5, here's what I see:\n\n- `NT5 -> 't41'`\n- `NT5 -> 't5'`? Or maybe I'm looking for the wrong entries.\n\nWait, wait, looking carefully, the lines for NT5 are:\n\n- `NT5 -> 't41'`\n- `NT5 -> 't5'`? Wait, no, the lines are:\n\nLooking back:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n`NT5 -> 't41'`\nand\n`NT5 -> 't40'`? No, I think I'm getting confused. Wait, looking precisely:\n\nThe user provided a list with many entries. For NT5, checking:\n\nHere are the relevant lines:\n\n`NT5 -> 't41'`\n`NT5 -> 't5'`? Wait, no, looking again, I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, I think I miswrote the productions. Let me re-examine the grammar. The user wrote:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT5 -> 't40'? Or wait, looking through the list, under NT5, I see:\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- Also, under NT29: `NT29 -> NT27 NT22`\nWait, no, I think I need to focus.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the list:\n\n`NT5 -> 't41'`\n`NT5 -> 't40'?` I don't see `t40` mentioned. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me look more carefully. The list of productions starts with S, and then moves through NT21, NT32, etc. When I get to NT5, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- Also, in the list, I think I see NT5 -> 't84'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the NTs. Let me try again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for NT5, I find:\n\n- \"NT5 -> 't41'\"\n- \"NT5 -> 't5'\": No, I don't see that.\n- Other lines:\n- \"NT5 -> 't41'\"\n- Also, looking for 't41' and 't16', we have:\n\nSo, from NT5, you can get `t41`.\n\nNow, looking at NT18, as earlier, we see:\n\n`NT18 -> 't16'` and `NT18 -> 't66'`.\n\nSo, `t16` comes from NT18.\n\nSo, the string is `t41 t16` which corresponds to NT5 producing `t41` and NT18 producing `t16`.\n\nNow, how does S derive this? Since S is the start symbol, it's replaced by two non-terminals. So S could split into NT21 NT21 (first production), or NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25.\n\nBut our string is `t41 t16`, which comes from NT5 and NT18.\n\nWait, but in the first step, S splits into two NTs. Let's see if NT5 can somehow lead to `t41` and NT18 can lead to `t16`.\n\nWait, but how would the derivation go from S to NT5 and NT18? Because S splits into two NTs, but NT5 and NT18 are different. So unless the two NTs produced from S's first split are NT5 and NT18, which is unlikely because S only splits into combinations like NT21 NT21, or NT32 NT14, and so on. None of these directly split into NT5 and NT18.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think differently. The string is two terminals, `t41` and `t16`. So, perhaps the derivation must involve NT5 and NT18 generating these, and S must produce these in some way.\n\nBut wait, S only can produce pairs like NT21 NT21, NT32 NT14, etc. So for the string `t41 t16` to be generated, it's necessary that during the derivation, the two symbols generated are `t41` and `t16`, but that would require that the non-terminals split in such a way that they produce these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's possible through a left or right derivation, or via some intermediate steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is `t41 t16` can be generated by some path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the parse tree. Let me try to construct a parse tree.\n\nThe string is two tokens, so the bottom level of the parse tree would be these two. The root would be S or one of the initial symbols.\n\nWait, since S produces two non-terminals, to get a string of two terminals, each of those two non-terminals must produce one terminal each. So, each of the two non-terminals in S's production must eventually generate a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, if S \u2192 NT1 NT2, and NT1 generates `t41`, NT2 generates `t16`, then S could produce `t41 t16`.\n\nSo, I need to find if there exists a production for S that allows one of the NTs to generate `t41` and the other to generate `t16`.\n\nLooking at"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-40","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I'm given is `t28 t34 t38`, and the grammar is quite extensive with numerous productions. My first task is to understand how CNF works and how it can be applied here. \n\nCNF requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals except a, which is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in CNF since each production either has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. That should make it easier to parse, but I'm not entirely sure yet.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces combinations of NT2, NT32, and others. The string in question is `t28 t34 t38`, and I notice that these are terminals. So I need to see if the grammar can derive this sequence starting from S.\n\nFirst, I should check if the string can be broken down into parts that match the productions. The string has three tokens, so I need to see if each can be generated through a series of productions.\n\nStarting with `t28`, looking at the grammar, I see multiple rules that result in 't28'. For example, NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, and further down, NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0. Then, looking at NT27, it can produce 't28' from some other rules. So it's possible that 't28' can come from NT28 and eventually from S.\n\nNext, `t34`: from NT34, there's a production NT34 \u2192 NT16 NT1 and others. NT16 can produce 't41' or 't6', but perhaps through other steps, it can lead to a terminal. Wait, but I'm looking at the string `t34`, which is a terminal. So I need a path from a non-terminal to 't34' in the string.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT34 can go to NT16 NT1, and then perhaps NT16 can lead to more non-terminals. Let me check if NT34 can directly produce 't34'. Looking back, I don't see a rule where NT34 directly produces a terminal, but maybe through intermediate steps. Hmm, but since in CNF, the only direct terminals are single terminals, so unless a non-terminal directly expands to a terminal, we can't get a terminal in the middle of a production.\n\nWait, so the grammar might only have single terminals on certain productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT17 \u2192 't14', NT21 \u2192 't28', NT10 \u2192 't32', etc. So, NT28 \u2192 't27' NT32, but perhaps eventually, the non-terminals can expand to these terminals.\n\nWait, but the string `t28 t34 t38` doesn't have any non-terminals, so each part must come from a terminal expansion. So I need to find a way that each of these terminal symbols can be derived from the grammar.\n\nBut how? Starting from S, which produces combinations of other non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals must then produce terminals, and their sequences should build up the given string.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get terminals, the non-terminals must eventually derive to them. Let me check if the grammar can generate these terminals.\n\nLooking at `t28`, from NT28, as I saw earlier, there are rules that lead to NT27 or NT3, which might ultimately produce 't28' via other steps. Similarly, NT34 can produce NT16 NT1, but neither of these are terminals. Wait, maybe I need to see if any non-terminals directly expand into these.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT17 \u2192 't14', NT21 \u2192 't28', NT10 \u2192 't32', and others. Wait, but is there a path where a non-terminal like NT28 can produce 't28' directly? Looking at the rules, the only production for NT28 is NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0 and NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3. Neither of these are terminals. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Since the grammar is in CNF, some of these non-terminals must directly produce a terminal. Are there any rules in the grammar where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal? Looking through the list again:\n\nI see NT17 \u2192 't14', NT21 \u2192 't28', NT10 \u2192 't32', etc. Oh, right, there are several rules where NTs produce terminals, like NT17 \u2192 't14', NT21 \u2192 't28', and so on. So yes, some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nSo, for `t28`, it's produced directly by NT21. So in the derivation, we might have NT21 \u2192 't28'. Similarly, `t34` could come from a NT that directly produces it. Looking at the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 't22', but perhaps not NT34. Wait, looking through, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't34' except perhaps in a way that requires multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a chain where a non-terminal eventually leads to 't34'. But given that the given string is `t28 t34 t38`, I think it's possible that each part is derived through such steps.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that the grammar can be parsed as a series of productions. The string has three terminals, so to produce it, we'd need a derivation that results in these terminals. That would imply that the starting symbol S must be able to generate a sequence of productions that lead to the concatenation of three terminals.\n\nBut S starts as S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc. So perhaps S can produce two non-terminals, each of which then derive into one terminal, leading to a string of two terminals. But in our case, the string is longer, so maybe it's a longer derivation.\n\nWait, no, S generates two non-terminals. If both of those generate a terminal, then the string would be two terminals, not three. So to get three terminals, there must be more productions involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial productions of S can produce more non-terminals, which in turn produce more terminals. Let me see. For example, S can produce NT21 and NT28. Suppose NT21 \u2192 't28' directly, and NT28 \u2192 some non-terminals that further produce the other terms.\n\nWait, but NT28 can produce NT11 NT3. Then, if NT11 produces another non-terminal, which in turn produces the next part.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe it's easier to build the parse tree to see if all the terminals can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can track the derivations step by step.\n\nLet me attempt a possible derivation path:\n\nStart with S.\n\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nNow, NT21 can produce 't28' directly. So NT21 \u2192 't28'.\n\nNT28 can produce, let's see, perhaps NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0.\n\nNow, NT27 can produce 't28' (wait, looking back, I don't see NT27 \u2192 't28' directly. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT27 \u2192 NT11 NT4. Hmm, no direct terminal for NT27. Alternatively, perhaps through another step.\n\nWait, NT27 has a production NT27 \u2192 NT11 NT4. Then NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13. NT25 can go to NT5 NT1. And so on. This seems too indirect. Alternatively, maybe NT28 can go to another path.\n\nWait, another option: S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nNT32 can produce 't54' according to some rules (I think, but looking back: NT32's rules are as follows:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT23. Let's see NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT6 NT27. NT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31. NT10 \u2192 NT29 NT32. NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT2. NT2 \u2192 NT24 NT16.\n\nThis chain seems to go into more non-terminals, perhaps not leading to terminals. Alternatively, other rules for NT32: NT32 \u2192 NT5 NT20. NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT32, which doesn't seem helpful as it's creating loops.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT20 NT25.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32, which again goes into non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach was better.

{"custom_id":"request-37","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string \"t38 t22 t6\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That helps because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since the question is about a single string, maybe a different approach is better.\n\nLet's look at the starting symbols. The grammar starts with S, and looking at the first production rules:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, S can only expand into these three combinations of non-terminals. Since the string we're testing starts with \"t38 t22 t6\", I notice that the first symbol is t38. I should check if \"t38\" can be derived from any of these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that T38 is not directly listed. But perhaps it's derived indirectly. Or maybe T38 is a terminal symbol. Wait, let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I spot several instances where variables are replaced by specific terminals:\n\nNT21 -> 't8'\nNT18 -> 't36'\nNT11 -> 't6'\nNT0 -> 't61'\nNT6 -> 't68'\nNT5 -> 't41'\nAnd many others like NT19 -> 't25', NT24 -> 't22', etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't38', I don't immediately see a direct production rule. So maybe \"t38\" is a derived symbol, but perhaps in this grammar, it's not present as a terminal. Alternatively, maybe T38 is part of a non-terminal that eventually produces t38.\n\nLooking at the non-terminal NT23's productions: NT23 -> NT22 NT27 and others. But do any non-terminals produce T38? Or is T38 a terminal symbol that doesn't appear in any rule except possibly S.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules again: There's a NT21 -> 't8', which I think is correct. Then, looking for T38, perhaps it's in the rules but I can't see it. Wait, let me check all the rules again:\n\nLooking through each line, the only time T38 is mentioned is in the string representation, but as a terminal. For example, NT11 -> 't6', NT0 -> 't61', etc.\n\nWait, the string has \"t38 t22 t6\". So, does any rule have 't38' as a terminal? I don't see that. Unless it's derived from a non-terminal that eventually produces t38.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me check all the production rules again.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I don't see any direct production of 't38'. So that suggests that 't38' cannot be a terminal. Therefore, it must be a non-terminal that can derive into something ending with t38. But if 't38' is a non-terminal, it must appear on the right-hand side of some production.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT21 -> 't8', which is t8, and NT18 -> 't66'; NT2 -> 't23', and others, but I don't see any production rule that starts with NT38. So, NT38 is not a non-terminal either because there's no rule for it. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through each production rule again. Scanning each line for 't38', but I can't find it. So that means that T38 is not a terminal or non-terminal in the grammar, which can't be. Or perhaps it's a terminal that appears as a result of a series of productions, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps it's part of a higher production. Let me see: some non-terminals are T38. Or maybe 't38' is a terminal symbol introduced by one of the productions. Wait, I don't see any production where a non-terminal leads to T38.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at NT21, yes, it goes to 't8'. NT18: 't66'. NT2: 't23', and others. So, none of them produce t38. So if the string starts with t38, that seems impossible because no rule allows any non-terminal to produce t38. So unless I'm missing something, t38 shouldn't be in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a production. Let me go through all the NT23 rules. Wait, NT23 -> NT22 NT27 and other rules, but no 't38' in there. So if T38 is not present as a terminal in any production, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the symbols. The string is \"t38 t22 t6\". So the symbols are t38, t22, and t6.\n\nSo t6 is in some rules. NT11 -> 't6', NT18 -> 't36', NT6 -> 't68'\u2014wait, no, that's t68. Wait, looking for t6: in NT18 -> 't66', so 't66' is not 't6'. Wait, no, NT6 is 't68', and in the NT6 rules: NT6-> 't68' NT13, which is a non-terminal, so probably a string of t68 and t13.\n\nWait, maybe t6 is a non-terminal. Let's see:\n\nLooking for rules that result in t6: NT0->'t61', NT11->'t6', NT5->'t41', etc. So yes, t6 appears as a terminal in some rules, such as NT11->'t6'.\n\nSo, the string has t6 as the third symbol. So, the derivation would need to reach t6. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nBut the first symbol is t38, which we can't derive because no rule leads to t38 as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t38, which isn't a terminal. So the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps T38 is represented by some non-terminal that eventually leads to t38, but I don't see any such rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar has a production that allows t38 as an expansion from another non-terminal, but without any rules, I don't see how.\n\nSo, I think the conclusion is that the string can't be generated by the given grammar because t38 is not present as a terminal or as a derived symbol from the production rules.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-59","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is \"t36 t14 t61 t23\". \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of writing context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain properties easier to analyze.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that it's a bit complex. It consists of multiple non-terminal symbols (like S, NT21, NT31, etc.) and a mix of productions that can generate both non-terminals and terminals. The terminals include various \"t\" words, which I assume are the actual tokens that make up the string we're testing. \n\nThe given string is \"t36 t14 t61 t23\". So I need to see if this can be derived from the grammar. \n\nI start by looking for production rules that can directly produce these terminals. \n\nFirst, \"t36\" appears in the grammar under NT18: NT18 -> 't36' and NT18 -> 't70'. So NT18 can produce t36. \n\nNext, \"t14\" appears in a couple of places. Looking at NT14, there's a production NT14 -> 't65' and NT14 can also produce t14 via other routes, but I need to see if I can get t14 from the right non-terminals.\n\nIn the string, after t36 is t14. Maybe after generating t36, the following production would be t14. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence comes from a different non-terminal.\n\nLooking further, I see that NT18 also has a production that includes t70, but I'm targeting t36 and t14. \n\nWait, maybe I should map the string step by step. Let's see:\n\nThe string is four tokens: t36, t14, t61, t23.\n\nEach of these needs to come from some non-terminal. Let's break it down.\n\n1. t36: as above, comes from NT18.\n\n2. t14: I need to see how t14 is generated. Looking through the grammar, I see NT14 can produce 't65' directly and other terminals via other rules, like NT14 -> NT15 NT7, but that doesn't directly produce t14.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, in the grammar, there's a production for NT14 that includes t14? Let me check: \n\nYes, looking at the grammar, I see NT14 -> 't14' and also NT14 can produce NT34 NT7. So that means NT14 has a direct production of 't14' as one option. So if NT14 is expanded, it can directly yield 't14'.\n\nSo the second token t14 could come directly from NT14.\n\n3. t61: Checking the grammar, I see NT0 -> 't61' directly. So that's another terminal that appears as an atomic production.\n\n4. t23: Looking through the grammar, I see NT23 -> 't43' and NT23 also has a production NT23 -> NT24 NT21 and so on. But perhaps 't23' comes from a different rule. Wait, looking again, I see that NT31 -> 't31', but that's for a different nt. Oh wait, maybe I missed it. Alternatively, perhaps nt23 can produce 't23' directly? Let me check:\n\nNo, looking again, the grammar only has NT17 -> 't14', NT5 -> 't41', etc. Wait, actually, I see in the very end of the grammar some rules where terminals directly appear, like NT34 -> 't30', NT34 -> 't14', NT7 -> 't3', NT18 -> 't66', NT0 -> 't17', etc. Hmm, I'm not seeing a direct 't23'. Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, the last part of the grammar, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT21 -> 't8'\n\nBut not NT23. Hmm, so perhaps 't23' isn't directly produced. Alternatively, maybe NT23 is not a starting point and I need to see if it can be derived through other means. Alternatively, perhaps the string isn't generated because one of the steps is missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in not seeing 't23' production. Let me scan the grammar again. \n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nAt the very end, I see:\n\nNT23 -> 't43'\n\nSo this means that NT23 can produce the terminal 't43'. But in our string, after t36, t14, t61, comes t23. So t23 isn't a direct terminal; it's a token that is not listed in our string. So perhaps the string cannot be produced because we don't have t43. Alternatively, did I miss a production?\n\nWait, no. The string is t36 t14 t61 t23. So the last token is t23. Looking through the grammar, the only way to get t23 is if it exists as a production. But in the grammar, I don't see any production that directly yields t23. So maybe t23 isn't present, which would mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't23' comes from some indirect derivation. Let me see. For example, maybe NT23 can generate something that produces t23. Wait, according to the grammar, NT23 has a production to 't43', which is a different terminal. So unless t23 is derived through a chain, but it's not present as a direct or indirect production.\n\nSo perhaps the string is not possible.\n\nAnother approach is to reconstruct the parse tree:\n\nTo get 't36 t14 t61 t23', the entire string would come from a single S production or via intermediate productions.\n\nLooking back at the initial grammar, the start symbol S can produce:\n\nS -> NT21 NT23\nOr other combinations like NT21 NT23, or NT3 NT20, etc. But none of the S productions produce terminals directly. Wait, actually, let me check:\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: the possibilities are S -> NT21 NT23, S -> NT3 NT20, etc.\n\nEach of these NT productions can then expand further.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's four terminals. Since S is a start symbol that produces non-terminals, the full string would require that each non-terminal eventually expands into terminals. Since the string is four tokens, probably involving two non-terminals at each level, as in S -> A B, where A and B each expand into two terminals.\n\nBut let's try to find a possible path.\n\nFor example, can S expand into NT18 NT6 (or something similar), and then each of those produce the corresponding 't's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT21 NT23. Let's see what NT21 and NT23 can produce.\n\nNT21: Looking through the grammar, I see NT21 -> 't8' directly, but does that mean that NT21 can only produce 't8'? Or are there other rules?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, one of the rules for NT21 is:\n\nNT21 -> 't8'\n\nAnother rule is:\n\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nWait, so NT21 can produce either 't8' or (NT6)(NT0).\n\nIn the string, we have a t61 after t36, so let's assume that NT21 could produce 't8' as one part. But in our string, after t36, we have t14, but 't8' isn't in the string. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S could expand into NT18 NT6, which can produce t36 and then perhaps another expansion to get t14 and so on. Let's explore this.\n\nS -> NT18 NT6.\n\nNow, NT18 is a non-terminal. From the grammar, NT18 can produce 't36' and 't70'.\n\nSo let's say NT18 -> 't36', then NT6 is next.\n\nNT6 can produce various things. Looking at NT6 entries:\n\nNT6 -> 't68', NT6 -> 't6', or via other productions.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, I see NT6 can produce 't68' and also can produce 't6' via a rule? Or wait, looking back, maybe it's a different structure.\n\nWait, correcting that:\n\nIn the grammar, looking at NT6:\n\nNT6 -> 't68' and also NT6 -> NT13 NT18.\n\nAdditionally, let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-58","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string `t54 t12 t31 t51` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar and the string we're checking.\n\nFirst, I see that the grammar is quite extensive, with multiple non-terminals and productions. The string we're evaluating consists of four tokens: t54, t12, t31, and t51. These look like terminal symbols since they are specific strings, not the non-terminals like S, NT2, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several productions lead to terminals. For example, NT5 -> 't41' and NT17 -> 't14', etc. So, each of these terminals must be produced by specific rules in the grammar.\n\nThe string `t54 t12 t31 t51` needs to match some sequence of productions starting from the start symbol S. Let me break down each part:\n\n1. t54: I look through the grammar rules and see if any non-terminals produce 't54'. Scanning the rules, I spot NT23 -> 't52', but that's 't52' not 't54'. Wait, where else? Looking further, I don't immediately find a rule that produces 't54'. Maybe I missed one. Alternatively, perhaps 't54' isn't present, which would mean the string can't be generated. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should check again. Let me look at the non-terminals that can produce terminals. I see rules like NT15 -> 't71', NT23 -> 't43', etc. But no 't54' comes up. That's a problem because if 't54' isn't produced by any rule, then it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar. Unless it's derived from a chain of non-terminals leading to 't54', but since the string is directly given, it must be a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, if 't54' isn't present in any production, then the string can't be generated, and I should answer 'No'. But wait, maybe I missed a rule that leads to 't54'. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see 't54' being produced by any NT. I see NT23 -> 't52', NT22 -> 't8', etc., but not 't54'. So that seems impossible. Alternatively, I might have overlooked something.\n\nWait, maybe the NT23 rule can produce 't54' through another path. Let me check NT23: it's defined as NT23 -> NT24 NT28. Hmm, but NT24 and NT28 are non-terminals, so that would produce more symbols, not a terminal 't54'. So no, that doesn't help.\n\nSimilarly, NT32 is defined as -> 't54' perhaps? Wait, looking back: NT32 has a rule NT32 -> 't54'. Yeah, that's one of the NT32 productions: NT32 -> 't54'. Oh, right! I think I missed that earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the NT32 rules. The user provided a long list, and I see NT32 -> 't54' and also other rules for NT32. So yes, 't54' is directly produced by NT32 when it's in the non-terminal form. But in the string, it's a terminal. So the string's first token is 't54', which must come from a production that ends with 't54'.\n\nSo, if 't54' is a terminal symbol, it must be the result of a production like NT32 -> 't54'. So in the string, we have 't54' as the first part. Therefore, in the derivation, somewhere S must derive to a production that leads to 't54', which would happen if S can reach that, but considering the string is length 4, let's think about paths.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't54', so to derive it, we must have NT32 -> 't54', but in the initial string, the first token is 't54', so that suggests that the derivation is S -> NT... -> ... -> 't54'.\n\nBut let's think step by step. Maybe I can parse the string from the start.\n\nBut first, the string is 't54 t12 t31 t51', which is four tokens. Each token is a terminal.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- t54: must come from NT32 \u2192 't54'.\n- t12: check if any NT \u2192 t12. Looking at the rules, I see NT12 has a rule: NT12 -> NT4 NT0, which goes to t68, not t12. Another NT12 has a rule: NT12 -> NT33 NT3. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe NT12 has a rule that produces 't12' directly. Let me check all NT12 rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT12 has these rules:\n\n- NT12 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT15 NT3\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking again: the user provided lists. Looking for NT12, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT15 NT3\n\nNone of these produce terminals. Alternatively, perhaps in another rule, but perhaps looking elsewhere, like NT12 in the later part of the grammar. Wait, looking at the entire grammar, I don't see any NT producing 't12'. Hmm, that's a problem because 't12' would not be a terminal produced directly. So perhaps 't12' is a non-terminal? But in the string, it's a terminal, so that can't be. Unless 't12' is a symbol from the bottom of the grammar, meaning it's just a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, looking again: I see 't12' as a string in the string. The list of rules includes some NT12 rules, but none directly produce terminals like 't12'. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules again, perhaps I missed a rule that leads to 't12'. Let's scan:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any that produce 't12'. So perhaps 't12' is part of the input, but in the grammar, there is no rule that leads directly to it. That would mean that 't12' is a literal in the string, not produced by any rule, making the string ungrammatical.\n\nWait, hold on: Maybe the string contains symbols that are not terminals. So, to parse the string, all four tokens must be produced by the grammar. If any token cannot be produced, the answer is 'No'.\n\nSo for the string `t54 t12 t31 t51`, let's check each part:\n\n1. 't54' must be produced by a non-terminal. As above, NT32 can produce 't54'.\n2. 't12' must be produced by a non-terminal, but I don't see any NT in the rules that produce 't12'.\n3. 't31' must be produced by a non-terminal. Let's check NT31 rules: I see NT31 -> 't75'? No, wait: looking through the rules, I can't find NT31 producing 't31' directly. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT31 -> 't75'. Wait no, looking more carefully:\n\nThe user's grammar includes a rule NT31 -> 't75', and another, wait, perhaps not. Let me re-express:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the part that mentions NT31 is:\n\nNT31 -> NT25 NT13\n\nAnd then NT13 -> t6, etc. Wait, no, the rules include:\n\nNT31 -> NT25 NT13\n\nBut I don't see any production where NT31 leads to 't31' directly. Instead, looking for tokens like 't31': from the rules, I see:\n\nNT31 -> 't75' perhaps? Wait, in the list of rules, there's NT31 -> 't75'. Yes, I think that's the case. For example, in the user's grammar, one of the rules is NT31 -> 't75'. So 't31' is not directly produced, but 't75' is.\n\nWait, but the string has 't31' as part of it. So if 't31' isn't a terminal but a non-terminal, that's a problem because it's being treated as a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps 't31' is a literal in the string, but in the grammar, there's no production that allows NT31 to generate 't31'.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused.

{"custom_id":"request-82","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar provided has several production rules. CNF requires that all production rules either:\n1. Replace a non-terminal with a single terminal, or\n2. Replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can see that most of the rules indeed follow this structure. For example:\n- S -> NT2 NT28\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT29\nThese are both two non-terminals on the right side. However, I notice some rules have a terminal before a non-terminal, like NT17 -> 't14' or NT5 -> 't41'. These are acceptable in CNF because a single terminal can follow a non-terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the target string is `t38 t30 t17 t38 t10`. Each token here corresponds to a terminal symbol that might be generated by some rules.\n\nMy task is to see if this string can be generated starting from the start symbol S using the given rules.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n\n1. Identify all the production rules that produce each terminal in the string and see if they can be linked in a way that the string can be derived.\n\nThe string is 't38 t30 t17 t38 t10'.\n\nSo, the terminals are:\n- t38: Possible if a non-terminal expands to 't38'.\n- t30: Looking for a non-terminal that can expand to 't30'.\n- t17: Same here, a non-terminal that produces 't17'.\n- t10: A non-terminal that expands to 't10'.\n\nLet me look through the given rules to find which non-terminals expand to these terminals.\n\nLooking for t38:\n- The rules are NT2 -> 't23', NT3 -> 't31', etc. Wait, I don't see a non-terminal that directly expands to 't38'. Hmm. Maybe I missed some. Wait, NT2 -> 't23' is not t38. Wait, looking through more carefully:\n- In the grammar, there are rules like NT2 -> 't23', NT5 -> 't41', but I don't see any direct rule that produces 't38'. Is there any NT rule that does? Let me check all the rules for terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I see:\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT8 -> 't66'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT29 -> 't7'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT16 -> 't36'\nWait, looking for 't38'\u2014maybe it's indirectly derived? Or maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- Wait, what about NT6? NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't14'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT19 -> 't22'\n- NT20 -> 't29'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\nWait, I'm not seeing a non-terminal that directly expands to 't38' except maybe one that is derived from multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see all the rules again. Let me scan the entire list for any terminal like 't38' on the right side.\n\nUpon reviewing all the production rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal is directly replaced by 't38'. The right-hand side of all rules either have two non-terminals or a non-terminal followed by a terminal.\n\nSo, the only way 't38' can appear is if it's in the terminal expansion of a non-terminal. Since I don't find any production for any non-terminal to 't38', it's impossible to generate a 't38' token in the string.\n\nWait, did I miss any rules? Let me go through the production rules more carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT29\n- NT0 -> 't61', NT0 -> 't17', etc.\nI don't see any non-terminal that expands to 't38'. For example, NT5 -> 't41', NT17 -> 't14', NT25 -> 't77', etc.\n\nTherefore, 't38' cannot be derived from any rule in this grammar because no non-terminal expands directly to 't38'. This means that the string `t38 t30 t17 t38 t10` cannot be generated because 't38' isn't present in any of the terminal symbols that the non-terminals can produce.\n\nWait, but let's make sure: maybe through a series of productions, a non-terminal can produce 't38' by expanding through multiple steps, but looking through all the rules, I don't see any such path. For example, if a non-terminal A expands to NT2 and NT38, but since there's no rule for NT38, that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string contains 't38' which is not a terminal symbol generated by any non-terminal in this grammar, meaning the string cannot be derived from the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-98","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string `t65 t8 t7 t34 t84 t66` is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, it seems all the productions are either generating two non-terminals or a terminal. That helps because each step in the derivation will use one production rule, either replacing a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is `t65 t8 t7 t34 t84 t66`. Each of these are terminals, so each must be directly derived from a production. I think the approach is to see if we can start from the start symbol S and derive the string through some sequence of productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The first step would be to see which production rules for S exist. Looking at the grammar, S has three productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nI need to choose one of these to start with. Let's consider each option.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT21 NT28. Then I need to see if NT21 and NT28 can derive to t65 and t84 respectively, or if there's a way to get t65 and t84 from those non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions: NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29 or NT26 NT6. NT21 can go to either.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3 or NT27 NT0.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t65, which is a terminal. So let's see if any of these NTs produce t65.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT14 \u2192 t65. Oh, so NT14 directly produces t65. But in the initial S production options, none of the options produce NT14. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, but NT32 can produce t54? Wait, looking at NT32's productions: NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23. Hmm, but NT32 can also go to t3, right? Because in the grammar, some non-terminals like NT3, NT5, etc., directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string starts with t65, I can see that t65 comes from NT14. So perhaps I need to find a way to have S derive something that eventually leads to t65, t8, t7, etc.\n\nBut S's first options don't directly produce NT14. Let's think: maybe I need to go through multiple steps. Let's take S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then, NT32 and NT14 need to produce the remaining symbols in the string.\n\nSo NT32 can be any of its productions. Looking at NT32: it has NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23, NT32 \u2192 t3. Wait, but the second symbol in the string is t8. So perhaps I can derive t8 from NT2 or NT23.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT2 can produce t23? Or let's check: NT2's productions include \u2192 t23. Hmm, wait, in the grammar, I see NT2 \u2192 t23. Yes, in the \"Other productions\" section: NT2 \u2192 t23. So if NT2 can directly produce t23, and the second symbol is t8, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, in the string, the second symbol is t8. I'm confused because I thought NT2 can produce t23, but that's not matching. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, let me look at NT14. Since t65 is produced by NT14 \u2192 t65. So for S \u2192 NT32 NT14, NT32 must produce t8, and NT14 must produce t65.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t65 t8 t7... So the second symbol is t8, which would be the result of NT14 if it can produce t8. But looking at NT14's productions: NT14 \u2192 t51 or t49. No, that's not right. Wait, looking back at the grammar: NT14 has rules like \u2192 t65 and \u2192 t84. Wait, in the \"Other productions\" section, I see NT14 \u2192 t65. Oh right, so NT14 can produce t65. And in another rule, NT14 \u2192 t84.\n\nSo, if I'm using S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then NT14 would need to produce t65, t84, or the next symbol. Wait, but the string is t65 t8 t7 t34 t84 t66. So after t65 comes t8.\n\nSo if I have S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then NT14 produces t65, and NT32 needs to produce t8? But NT32 can produce t3 or t2? Wait, in the grammar, NT32 has productions NT32 \u2192 t3 or t2? Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT32: NT32 \u2192 NT28 NT18 is an option? No, wait. The \"Other productions\" for NT15 include NT33, but let's look for NT32.\n\nActually, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23 OR NT32 \u2192 t3.\n\nWait, so NT32 can produce t3, which would be '3', but in the string, after t65 comes t8, which is 't8', a different symbol.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not the right path. Maybe I should try a different initial production.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT20 NT25. What can NT20 and NT25 produce?\n\nLooking at NT20: productions include \u2192 t17, \u2192 NT25\u2192t61? Wait, in the grammar, NT20 has productions like NT20 \u2192 t61? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT20, I see NT20 \u2192 t17 or t61. Hmm, no, let's look: looking for NT20:\n\nIn the given grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32. So NT20 can produce t61 (a terminal). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me list the productions for NT20:\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32\nNT20 \u2192 t17\nNT17 \u2192 t41\nWait, no, that's not right. Let's look through the \"Other productions\":\n\nNT17: production \u2192 t51 and \u2192 t49 (Wait, no, it's later in the list. Wait, perhaps NT20 has multiple paths. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Maybe it's better to approach this by looking for how to produce each token step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a parsing approach or constructing a parse tree, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each token in the string can be derived from some non-terminal. Let's go through each token and see if there's a production rule that can reach it.\n\nThe tokens are: t65, t8, t7, t34, t84, t66.\n\nSo, t65 is produced by NT14 (NT14 \u2192 t65).\n\nt8 could be from NT18 \u2192 t66 or maybe NT3 \u2192 t7, but let's check: looking at NT3: \u2192 t12, \u2192 t5, \u2192 t20. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, NT18 has production NT18 \u2192 t66 and \u2192 t20. Hmm, but the second token is t8, which isn't appearing here. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps each token is generated by an NT whose rule includes that terminal. So for t65, it's from NT14. Then, the next token is t8, which would be the result of another NT. So let me consider S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then, in this case, NT14 produces t65. So the first token is t65. Now, the next symbol is t8, so NT32 needs to produce t8.\n\nBut looking at NT32, NT32 \u2192 t3 or \u2192 t2 (but not directly 't8'). Wait, perhaps the t8 is from another NT. Maybe NT8 \u2192 t8?\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT8 has productions:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t27\n- NT8 \u2192 t16\n- NT8 \u2192 t10\n- NT8 \u2192 t12\n\nWait, none of"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It seems like it's a CFG where each production is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the productions lead towards terminals like 'tXXX' and other non-terminals that eventually resolve into those terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of a series of terminals: t30, t16, t3, t49, t77, and t16 again. My goal is to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards through the string, trying to see if each terminal can be the result of a production. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, in Chomsky normal form, productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So each production has exactly two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nSo each production either adds two symbols or a single terminal. Thus, the string should be built by replacing non-terminals with pairs of symbols until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol, t30. I need to find a production that results in t30. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for any production that results in t30. Scanning through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that the production for NT3 is:\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT7\n\nBut also, looking at the bottom of the listing, I see NT34 -> t30. Wait, no, actually, the bottom part lists some terminals as productions. For example, NT34 -> 't30' and another production 't14'.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, some of the non-terminals are terminals. For example, NT5 -> 't41', etc. So each non-terminal can produce a terminal or another combination.\n\nSo, looking at the productions, I see NT34 has two productions: NT34 -> t30 and NT34 -> t14.\n\nSo, the first symbol t30 can be produced by NT34.\n\nSo, let's write t30 as NT34.\n\nThen, the next symbol is t16. Let's check what produces t16.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT16 -> 't3', 't6', etc. Let's see if t16 is a production.\n\nLooking at the start of the grammar, I don't see any productions starting with NT16 as a production. Wait, looking closer, I see:\n\nIn the productions, there's NT16 -> 't36' and 't4', but not 't16'. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's look again. No, the productions for NT16 are:\n\nLooking at the grammar: NT16 -> 't6', 't29', 't36', etc. But no production for NT16 -> t16. Maybe t16 is a terminal, but looking at the string, the second symbol is t16, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions for NT16. I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\nNT16 -> 't18' in NT16 -> NT18, which is a production, but not t16.\n\nWait, perhaps t16 is a terminal. Let me check the string again. The string is t30 t16 t3 t49 t77 t16.\n\nSo t16 is a terminal, and I need to find a production that emits t16 directly.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't16'\n\nWait, yes, the production NT0 -> 't16' exists.\n\nSo, for the second symbol t16, it's produced by NT0.\n\nSo now, in the derivation, after t30, we have NT34, then followed by t16, which is NT0.\n\nWait, but in the CFG, a production only replaces one non-terminal. So, the entire string must be built from a tree where each node is a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should consider each symbol and see what can produce them.\n\nLet me list each symbol and possible sources:\n\n1. t30: can be NT34.\n2. t16: as above, NT0.\n3. t3: looking for a terminal NT3, or something that can produce it.\n4. t49: production.\n5. t77: production.\n6. t16: again NT0.\n\nSo, going through the string step by step:\n\nThe entire string as a series of symbols: t30, t16, t3, t49, t77, t16.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the right and see if each symbol can be the result of a production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to work top-down, starting from S, and see if I can reach the string.\n\nLet's think about the possible derivations.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, has three productions:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, S can expand into three possible pairs. Let's see what each of these pairs can produce.\n\nBut wait, to generate the string, perhaps we can consider each production step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find whether the entire string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to check the production substitutions.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t30 is from NT34. So, where does NT34 come from?\n\nIn the given grammar, there's NT34 -> 't30' and NT34 -> 't14'.\n\nSo, t30 is a direct production from NT34.\n\nNow, the second symbol is t16. As before, t16 is from NT0.\n\nSo, the first two symbols: NT34 followed by NT0.\n\nIn the CFG, can NT34 produce something that leads to NT0? Or perhaps each symbol is the result of a non-terminal, and they must be connected via productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the sequence and see if each transition from one symbol to the next is possible by a production.\n\nAlternatively, considering the entire string as a sequence, perhaps we can represent it as a tree where each node is a non-terminal, and each edge corresponds to a production.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse the string by trying to match from the start.\n\nLet me try to parse the string:\n\nThe string is t30 t16 t3 t49 t77 t16.\n\nLet me think of this as a sequence of symbols, and try to find a way to expand the start symbol S into this sequence.\n\nPerhaps starting with S and seeing if any of the productions can match the string.\n\nS has three productions:\n\n1. NT21 NT28\n2. NT32 NT14\n3. NT20 NT25\n\nLet me see if any of these produce the string t30 t16 t3 t49 t77 t16.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by a chain of productions. Let's see:\n\nIf the first production is S -> NT21 NT28, then maybe NT21 can produce t30 and t16, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated, so maybe I should look for a chain of substitutions that can generate the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at each part of the string and see if they match any production.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each symbol is a terminal that is directly produced by a non-terminal, and see if there's a path that can link them.\n\nLet me start breaking down the string:\n\nt30: comes from NT34.\n\nt16: comes from NT0.\n\nt3: comes from NT3.\n\nt49: comes from NT19.\n\nt77: comes from NT25.\n\nt16 again: comes from NT0.\n\nSo, perhaps the chain is NT34 -> t30, NT0 -> t16, NT3 -> t3, NT19 -> t49, NT25 -> t77, NT0 -> t16.\n\nBut that's a direct match, which may not be possible since the productions in the grammar require that each non-terminal is expanded into two symbols. So, unless there's a non-terminal that can produce sequences of terminals and non-terminals that eventually reduce to these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to work from the left, seeing if a production can generate the initial part of the string, then recursively check the remainder.\n\nLet's try to see if the entire string can be derived step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string is 't30 t16 t3 t49 t77 t16'.\n\nLet me check if S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by carefully understanding the problem and the grammar provided.\n\nSo, the grammar has several productions, all of which are in CNF since each production has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for some that produce terminals. The string to check is `t36 t38 t40 t22 t3 t65 t25`. \n\nFirst, I'll note that in CNF, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals. Some productions may have terminals on the right-hand side, which is allowed in CNF because terminals can be part of the grammar as long as they are production rules with a single terminal.\n\nMy approach will be to try to find a derivation path that leads from the start symbol S to the given string. Let's break down the string into its components: t36, t38, t40, t22, t3, t65, t25. Since it's a sequence of seven tokens, the derivation must have several steps where each symbol in the string is produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I'll first list out which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\n- S is the start symbol, and it can produce NT21 NT2, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25.\n\nNext, I'll look for each terminal token in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them:\n\n- t36: Looking through the productions, S can produce NT21 NT2. In the productions for NT21, I see that NT21 -> NT6 NT0 and NT21 -> 't28', but I don't see a production that directly gives 't36'. Alternatively, NT22 -> 't8' and others, but 't36' doesn't seem to be directly produced by any production I have. Wait, looking back, maybe I missed something. Let me check all productions again. Oh, I see that NT22 -> 't71' and NT24 -> 't22', but nothing gives 't36' directly except NT23? No, looking through all the rules, I only see NT32 -> 't54'. Hmm, this might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a way to get t36. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for non-terminals that could produce 't36'. Looking at the grammar, for example, NT19 -> 't25', but that doesn't help. Wait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that have 't36' as a production. Let me scan through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT where the production includes 't36', I see:\n\n- NT21 -> 't28' and 't69'? No, wait: Let me scan the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\nNT23 -> 't40'\n\nWait, NT23 is a production that can produce terminal t40. So t40 is produced by NT23.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 -> 't8' and 't69'? No, NT22 can produce 't8' and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me make a detailed list of which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\n- NT21: I see NT21 -> 't28' (from NT17?), but wait, wait: Let's look back.\n\nWait, the grammar production for NT21 is not directly 't28'; it's part of a larger rule. For example, looking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- But looking for 't36', it's not directly obvious. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis. Let me go through all the productions and find which non-terminals produce each terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backward from the string.\n\nLooking at the last token in the string is t25. Let me see which non-terminals produce t25:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT21 -> 't28', but that's not t25.\n\nWait, in the grammar productions, I don't see a direct production for any non-terminal other than NT0 or NT15 or others that might have t25. Let me scan the productions:\n\nWait, I see NT0 -> 't17', but that's not t25. Wait, looking at the top-level productions, S can produce NT21 NT2, etc. But perhaps it's better to start building from the string and see if each terminal can be generated by some non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the string again: t36, t38, t40, t22, t3, t65, t25.\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nt25: Let's see which production(s) can produce 't25'. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that directly produces 't25'. Unless perhaps NT6 produces 't68', but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps looking more carefully, I see that NT21 is a production that produces 't28' as part of a larger rule\u2014wait, actually, looking at the earlier productions, maybe I missed a direct production for 't25'. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see any production directly producing t25. So perhaps this string cannot be generated because t25 isn't present. But that can't be the case because the user is asking if the string can be generated, and I might have missed something.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, I see that NT31 -> 't38' because NT31 is another non-terminal. Wait, let me check: looking at the productions, for example, NT31 -> NT25 NT13. Oh, no, NT25 may produce a terminal, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should work step by step, trying to find a path from S to each token in the string.\n\nAn alternative approach is to try to find a leftmost derivation. Let's start with S:\n\nS can produce NT21 NT2 or NT32 NT14 or NT20 NT25.\n\nLet's assume the first production: S -> NT21 NT2.\n\nNow, I need to see how each of these can produce the tokens in the string.\n\nFirst, NT21: Let me see what possibilities I have. Looking through the productions, I see that NT21 -> 't28' (from some rule?), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's make this more systematic.\n\nLet me create a map of which non-terminals can produce which terminals:\n\n- NT21 can produce 't28' (from NT17 -> 't14' doesn't help here). Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think I'm mixing up the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each rule and see whether it's a terminal or non-terminal produce.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check for each token in the string, whether it can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLet me go through each token:\n\n1. t36: Is there any non-terminal that can produce t36?\n   Scanning the grammar, no direct production for t36 except maybe I overlooked it. Let me check all productions:\n\n   - NT23 -> 't40' \u2192 no.\n   - NT22 -> 't8' \u2192 no.\n   - NT19 -> 't25' \u2192 no.\n   - Looking further, I see NT15 -> 't71' \u2192 no.\n   - Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, in the grammar, in the productions, I see:\n\n     For example, NT26 -> 't71'. Wait, no.\n\n     Wait, maybe I can find a non-terminal that produces 't36'. Looking again:\n\n     Looking at NT10: NT10 -> 't32' \u2192 no.\n\n     NT12: NT12 -> 't16' etc.\n\n     Hmm, perhaps I missed a production. Wait, in the initial problem setup, the first part lists all the productions, so let me go through each production in order to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\n     Looking through the entire grammar, for example:\n\n     - NT33 -> 't33'?

Let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or two terminals. So all the productions here fit that form. \n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is a sequence of terminal symbols, which are all 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, some of these terminals are defined by specific productions. For example, t6 is 't68' which is defined by NT6 -> 't68', and t25 is defined by NT0 -> 't25'. Similarly, t49 corresponds to NT18 -> 't49', and so on.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to derive the string from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can simulate this using a parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just thinking through it, I'll try to see if each token appears in the correct places without necessarily building the parse table.\n\nLet me see. The string has seven tokens. I'll try to map each token to a non-terminal that can produce it, then see if those non-terminals can be combined in the right way.\n\nBreaking down the string:\n\n1. `t6`\n2. `t69`\n3. `t68`\n4. `t49`\n5. `t49`\n6. `t41`\n7. `t25`\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- `t6` is produced by NT6 -> 't68'? Wait, no. Wait, NT6 -> 't68' is that correct? Wait, looking back, yes, in the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> 't68'\n\nSo `t6` isn't directly in that. Wait, but then maybe it's a typo? Because I thought `t6` would be matched by NT6. Wait, no, NT6 produces 't68', so `t6` must come from another non-terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar again:\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the NT definitions:\n\n- NT16 -> 't6'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT8 -> 't27 NT6' -> so 't27' and 't68' (since NT6 is 't68').\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- ...\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach: maybe it's better to see if the entire string can be broken down into the right non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t6`. Let me find which NT can produce `t6`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT16 -> 't6'. So to get `t6`, we'd need a derivation that goes through NT16.\n\nBut the start symbol is S, which is a combination of two Nts. Let me check S's productions:\n\nS -> NT2 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo S can produce any of these pairs. Now, let's see if any of these Nts can lead to `t6` through a chain of productions.\n\nLooking at S's first alternative: NT2 and NT28.\n\nNT2's productions include NT2 -> NT15 NT18, and further down, perhaps. Let's see: NT2: \n\nNT2 -> NT15 NT18\nNT18 -> NT20 NT0\nThen, NT20 and NT0. Wait, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first alternative of S: NT2 and NT28. Let's see what NT28 can produce. From the grammar, NT28 -> 't50' or 't50'? Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking at NT28: \n\nNT28 -> 't50' (Wait, is that correct? Or is it combined with another?)\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me carefully check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I notice that many Nts are defined as combinations of other Nts or terminals. For example:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3 \u2192 and then NT11 and NT3 have their own rules.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be formed by starting from S and expanding step by step.\n\nThe string is `t6 t69 t68 t49 t49 t41 t25`.\n\nLet me see each token and which NT can produce it:\n\n- `t6` \u2192 NT16\n- `t69` \u2192 I don't see an NT that directly produces this. Let me check the grammar. Looking through the Nts, is there any that produces `t69`? Hmm, no direct terms seem to have `t69`. Maybe it's an NT that combines others. Alternatively, perhaps `t69` comes from NT26. Wait, looking at NT26:\n\nNT26 -> 't28' (from the list):\nLooking back, yes, NT26 is defined as NT26 -> 't28' or other combinations. Wait, let me check each NT definition:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar again, for example:\n\nNT26 -> NT28 NT22\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking back:\n\nNT26 -> `t28` (no, looking again, the NT26 productions are:\n\nWait, from the given grammar, looking under NT26:\n\nDoes any NT26 have a production ending with `t69`? No, that doesn't seem to be the case. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the `t69` comes from a combination of other Nts. Let's see, for example, NT26's productions:\n\nLooking back, I see NT26 -> 't28'. So perhaps `t69` comes from another NT that can derive it. But in the given grammar, I don't see any NT that produces `t69` directly. Hmm, so maybe the string isn't in the language because one of the tokens isn't produced by any NT.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT26 again:\n\nIn the grammar, does NT26 produce anything else besides 't28' and other combinations? Let me look again:\n\nYes, looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT26 -> 't28'\n\nBut also:\n\nIs there any other production for NT26? Let me check:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT26 appears in:\n\n- NT0 -> NT27 NT11 \u2192 but this is NT0, not NT26.\n\nWait, let me list all NT26 productions to check:\n\nFrom the grammar, I find:\n\nLooking for NT26, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> 't28 NT22' \u2192 Wait, no, checking again:\n\nNo, the grammar doesn't list any of NT26's production other than `t28`. So maybe NT26 doesn't produce `t69`. So if the string includes `t69`, but nt that can produce it?\n\nIf that's the case, then the string can't be generated because there's a token that doesn't have a corresponding NT production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed an NT that can produce `t69`.\n\nWait, let me check NT21: it's a long chain. Does it produce `t69`? No. NT69 doesn't exist as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps NT21 produces `t6` and then something else. But no, NT21's production is NT21 -> NT26 NT6. So that's combinations. So where would `t69` come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string isn't correct because one of the tokens can't be derived. So since `t69` isn't a terminal in the grammar, perhaps it's a problem.\n\nWait, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the NT production list again to see if any of the Nts produce `t69`.\n\nLooking at the Nts:\n\n- NT31 -> NT25 NT13\n- NT32 -> NT28 NT18\n- NT25 -> NT5 NT13\n- NT29 -> NT27 NT22\n- NT27 -> NT11 NT4\n- NT22 -> NT18 NT32\n- NT18 -> NT16 NT24\n- NT22 -> NT33 NT21\n- NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n- NT34 -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The user wrote:\n\nNT17 -> 't49'\n\nand\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\n\nWait, no, that's not clear. Looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's one rule for NT17: `NT17 -> 't49'` and another rule elsewhere? Or are these both part of NT17?\n\nWait, in the user's input, under NT17:\n\n\"NT17 -> NT16 NT19\"\n\n\"NT17 -> 't49'\"\n\nAnd also \"NT17 -> 't14'\". Wait, let me look again:\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT17 -> NT16 NT19\"\n\n\"NT17 -> 't49'\"\n\n\"NT17 -> 't25'\"\n\nWait, perhaps a typo? Let me see the exact lines:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nNT17 -> 't14' (earlier line? Or is that another NT17?)\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nThere's a line: NT16 -> 't10' under NT16: wait, actually, let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar lines, for example:\n\n\"NT17 -> NT16 NT18\"\n\n\"NT0 -> NT10 NT27\"\n\n\"NT2 -> NT15 NT18\"\n\nNT17 appears under several other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps it's easier to spot the terminals in other parts.\n\nWait, looking further, for NT17, I see:\n\n\"NT17 -> 't49'\"\n\n\"NT17 -> 't14'\"\n\nWait, perhaps those are not separate productions but part of the same non-terminal. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the grammar, under NT17:\n\nLine 18: NT17 -> 't49'\n\nLine 19: NT17 -> 't14'\n\nWait, no, that's not possible. Each line is a separate rule. So NT17 has two rules: one that goes to a terminal and another.\n\nWait, no, in the user's grammar, looking line by line:\n\nLine 9: `NT21 -> NT6 NT0`\n\nLine 10: `NT21 -> NT26 NT6`\n\nLine 11: `NT2 -> NT15 NT18`\n\nWait, no, it's easier to check for each rule leading to a terminal. Let me list all the rules that are terminals.\n\nIn the grammar, the rules that end with single letters are terminals. For instance:\n\nLine 26: `NT17 -> 't49'`\n\nLine 35: `NT17 -> 't14'`\n\nWait, perhaps 't49' and 't14' are two separate productions for NT17?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nUnder NT17, there's:\n\n\"NT17 -> 't49'\"\n\nand\n\n\"NT17 -> 't14'\"\n\nWait, that can't be. So NT17 can go to 't49' directly, and also to 't14' directly.\n\nWait, that would mean NT17 has two productions: one to 't49' and another to 't14'.\n\nWait, but that would mean 't49' and 't14' are produced terminals from NT17.\n\nLooking at the given string, I see 't41', 't68', etc. So perhaps the string is built using other non-terminals. Let's try to find possible ways to derive the given string.\n\nLooking at the string: t41 t68 t43 t68 t16 t6 t25 t65.\n\nI think I need to work backwards from the string to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nEach token is a terminal; so starting from the last token and moving up.\n\nLet me think about the last token: t65.\n\nLooking for a production that leads to 't65'. Scanning the grammar rules:\n\nI see a production under NT4: `NT4 -> 't14'`.\n\nWait, no, looking back, it's line 15: NT4 -> NT34 NT10.\n\nBut that's a non-terminal. Wait, another line under NT4:\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nLine 6: `NT14 -> 't65'`\n\nWait, yes, so NT14 can go to 't65'.\n\nAlso, looking further, under NT14: `NT14 -> t65` and `NT14 -> t51` are two rules.\n\nWait, no. Let's look line by line:\n\nLine 2: NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n\nLine 3: NT3 -> NT20 NT13\n\nLine 4: NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\nWait, no, let me find t65.\n\nLooking through all the terminal rules in the grammar, under NT4 and NT7:\n\nNT7: `NT7 -> 't3'`\n\nNT14: `NT14 -> 't65'` (line 6). So yes, NT14 can go to 't65'.\n\nAlso, NT7 goes to 't3'.\n\nBut in our string, we have 't65' as the last token. So that could come from NT14.\n\nSo, the last symbol is t65, which is produced by NT14.\n\nSo, the last step is S -> ... -> ... -> NT14 -> 't65'.\n\nSo, the step before is producing NT14.\n\nNow, looking for a production where NT14 is derived.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT14 -> 't65' and NT14 -> 't51' (line 4: NT14 -> NT4 NT8; line 5: NT14 -> NT7) Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, let's find NT14's productions.\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\nLine 2: NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n\nLine 5: NT14 -> NT7 -> 't3' and NT14 -> 't65' as a terminal.\n\nWait, no, line 5 is: NT14 -> NT7 (so nonTerminal). Then line 6 is: NT14 -> 't65'.\n\nSo, two productions for NT14: 't65' and NT7.\n\nSo, NT14 can produce 't65' directly.\n\nSo, that's the last symbol.\n\nNow, the symbol before that is 't6'.\n\nSo, the string so far is t68 t43 t68 t16 t6 t25 t65, and before that we have another t6.\n\nWait, wait, the string is t41 t68 t43 t68 t16 t6 t25 t65.\n\nWait, in the string, the order is from first to last: 1: t41, 2: t68, 3: t43, 4: t68, 5: t16, 6: t6, 7: t25, 8: t6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-138","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to check is `t14 t52 t6 t84 t51 t16 t69 t14`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Non-terminals can produce other non-terminals or terminals. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. Moreover, all rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar given, it seems to comply with CNF since all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT21 NT28, but wait, NT isn't part of the terminals. Oh, wait, the terminals are marked using 't' followed by numbers, like t14, t52, etc. So, the non-terminals are all the NT parts, like NT2, NT3, etc.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if they can be derived from the grammar. Each step in the derivation should replace a non-terminal with two other symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which can produce NT21 NT28. So the string must expand from S. Let me see what NT21 and NT28 produce.\n\nLooking at NT21: in the grammar, I see NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29. So replacing NT21 would get us two more non-terminals, NT32 and NT29.\n\nThen, looking at NT32: NT32 \u2192 NT5 NT10. So that would replace to two more non-terminals, NT5 and NT10.\n\nNT5 \u2192 't41' (a terminal) and NT10 \u2192 't32'. So from NT32, we can get t41 and t32. But wait, NT32 \u2192 NT5 NT10, so NT5 is t41, and NT10 is t32. So concatenating those, we'd get t41 t32 from NT32.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after the initial t14, I have t52, t6, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm jumping ahead too fast.\n\nAlternatively, let's break down the given string into steps:\n\nThe string is: t14 t52 t6 t84 t51 t16 t69 t14.\n\nI need to see if this can be a derivation starting from S. So, each step should break down non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals. \n\nStarting from S, which is NT21 NT28.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT21 NT28. Now, we can expand NT21 and NT28.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29. Then, NT32 \u2192 NT5 NT10, which are t41 and t32. So, expanding that, we'd get t41 t32 from NT32.\n\nSimilarly, NT29 \u2192 NT27 NT22. Then, NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9. NT9 \u2192 NT16 NT24. NT16 \u2192 NT29 NT7. Let's look at the expansion:\n\nWait, this could get complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Instead of trying to expand each possibility, perhaps I should look for the terminals in the string and see if their order and positions align with any possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at the end of the string. The last symbol is t14, which is a terminal. So, maybe the last step was that a non-terminal produced t14 and something else, which then expanded into the rest.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT14 can produce t65 or t51 or directly t14. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT14 \u2192 t65, NT14 \u2192 t51, and NT14 \u2192 t14.\n\nWait, I'm looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT14 has several productions, including NT14 \u2192 t65, NT14 \u2192 t51, and NT14 \u2192 t14.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, in the grammar:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT34 NT7, NT17 \u2192 NT16 NT19, etc. Wait, let me scan more carefully.\n\nLooking for NT14:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT14 -> NT34 NT1\n\n- NT17 -> NT16 NT19\n\n- NT2 -> NT24 NT16\n\n- NT12 -> NT10 NT18\n\n- NT14 -> NT15 NT7\n\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n\n- NT12 -> NT15 NT3\n\nWait, maybe I missed NT14 in the earlier list. Let me check the given grammar snippet again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT14 is only in a few places. Let me list all NT14 productions:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the relevant ones are:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT7\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT15 NT7\n\n- Is thereanother? No, seems just these two. Or perhaps in the complete list, more.\n\nWait, checking the entire grammar:\n\nLooking for NT14:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT1\n\nWait, is that right? Wait, in the grammar:\n\n- Line 15: NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\n- Line 16: NT12 -> NT4 NT0\n\n- And so on. Scrolling through, I see:\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\n- Line 32: NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n\n- Line 42: NT12 -> NT15 NT3\n\nWait, maybe I missed NT14's production. Actually, in the given grammar, I think NT14 is only present in the initial rules. Let me check line by line.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- Line 5: S -> NT21 NT28\n\n- Line 6: S -> NT32 NT14\n\n- Line 7: S -> NT20 NT25\n\n- Line 8: NT21 -> NT32 NT29\n\n- Line 9: NT31 -> NT25 NT13\n\n... and so on.\n\nWait, I don't see NT14 in the initial productions. Hmm, perhaps that's a mistake, or maybe it's in some other section.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Looking again:\n\nIn the grammar, the rules for NT14:\n\nLooking for NT14 on the left side of the arrow:\n\n- Line 14: NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\n- Line 15: NT12 -> NT4 NT0\n\nWait, wait, that's NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0. Hmm, perhaps I need to scroll.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see that NT14 has the following productions:\n\n- Line 14: NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\nIs that right? No, wait, looking back:\n\nLine 14: NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\nNo, that's for NT28. Not NT14.\n\nWait, am I looking correctly? Let me check the grammars properly.\n\nIn the given grammar, the rules include:\n\n- Line 5: S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n\n- Line 6: S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n\n- Line 7: S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\n- Line 8: NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29\n\n- Line 9: NT31 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n\n- Line 10: NT3 \u2192 NT20 NT13\n\n- Line 11: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n\n- Line 12: NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n\n- Line 13: NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT1\n\n- Line 14: NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18\n\n- Line 15: NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n\n- Line 16: NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n\nWait, no, Line 16 in the given grammar is:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT16 NT24\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused because the line numbers are messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should search for NT14 in the grammar.\n\nLooking carefully through the grammar, I find:\n\n- Line 9: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n\n- Line 10: NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n\n- Line 11: NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT1\n\nAh, here it is. So, NT14 can produce NT34 NT1. But wait, NT34 also produces terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is `t65 t0 t61 t31 t40 t54 t14 t52 t28`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has several terminals ending with 't', each representing a literal symbol. So, the string consists entirely of these terminal symbols. My job is to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S can produce combinations of NT2, NT32, etc. Each production either splits S into two non-terminals or, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal, that might be the end of a sequence.\n\nWait, actually, some non-terminals can produce terminal symbols directly, but looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce the exact terminals in the string. For example, NT10 \u2192 't32' is one such production. But in the string, 't65' and others that are longer.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the productions again. For NT10, yes, it goes to 't32', but what about NT14? It goes to 't65'. Similarly, NT12 goes to 't16' and 't14'. NT33? It can go to 't33'... Oh wait, no, NT33 can produce 't49' and 't60' as well. So not directly any of the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, but let's look at the string components: t65, t0, t61, t31, t40, t54, t14, t52, t28. These are specific terminals. So for each of these, I need to see if there are terminals in the grammar (maybe those are the only way to get them). Let me list each terminal and see if it's produced directly or as part of a non-terminal.\n\n- t65: NT14 \u2192 't65'\n- t0: looking at the rules, NT10 \u2192 't32' and NT0 \u2192 't61', but I don't see t0 directly. Wait, NT0 can go to 't17' or other terminal in some cases, but not t0. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check: in the grammar, is there any non-terminal that directly goes to 't0'? Looking through: NT0 \u2192 't61' only, except for when NT10 \u2192 't32' and others. Wait, perhaps I missed. Let me recheck the grammar rules.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see NT0 rules:\n- S -> NT20 NT25\n- And others, but specifically:\n- NT0 \u2192 't61'\n- Other NT rules produce terminals like 't14', 't1', etc., but not 't0' directly. Hmm. So does the grammar have a production for 't0'? Because in the string, the second element is t0. If there's no production that introduces 't0', then that's a problem because we can't derive 't0'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals directly producing 't0', except perhaps NT10 produces 't32', but that's not 't0'. So that suggests that 't0' is not present in the language defined by this grammar. But wait, the string includes 't0' as the second token, which would mean the grammar can't generate it. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any production that can derive 't0'. Looking through the entire grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't0'. The only productions that go to t are in the NT0 and NT10 cases, but those go to 't61' and 't32' or others. Wait, looking more closely, in NT17, it's 't14', and in another rule, NT16 \u2192 't3' and others. Wait, but in the early rules of the grammar, there's an NT0 \u2192 't17'. So, that would mean NT0 can derive t17, but that doesn't help with 't0'.\n\nSo, if the string requires 't0' as a symbol, and the grammar cannot produce 't0' through any derivation, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-159","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine whether the string `t34 t65 t8 t28 t70 t10 t31 t28 t6` can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules. Looking at them, each non-terminal (like S, NT21, NT3, etc.) has rules that break them down into other non-terminals or terminals. At the end of the grammar, I see a lot of non-terminals being replaced by 't' followed by a number, which are presumably terminal symbols. So the terminals are words like 't34', 't65', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t34 t65 t8 t28 t70 t10 t31 t28 t6`. It looks like a sequence of terminal symbols, so each of these must be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince this is a context-free grammar, I can approach this by attempting to parse the string using the given productions. Parsing can be done using methods like recursive descent, but since the grammar might be complex, maybe I can look for patterns or key production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has productions leading to combinations of NT2 and NT32, etc. Each of these seems to break down into other non-terminals. The key is to see if the string can be constructed by following these productions step by step.\n\nLet me look at the string components:\n\n1. t34\n2. t65\n3. t8\n4. t28\n5. t70\n6. t10\n7. t31\n8. t28\n9. t6\n\nI notice that some of these are directly produced by non-terminals. For example, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 -> NT7 NT22 (and others like that)\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT6 or NT6 NT0\n- NT15 -> NT21 NT23\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT7\n- And so on.\n\nBut actually, looking at the productions, many non-terminals produce terminal symbols directly. For example:\n\n- NT34 -> 't14'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- etc.\n\nSo, to find out if a part of the string is generated, we can see if it matches any of these direct productions.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t34. There's a production that NT34 -> t14. Wait, that's t14, not t34. Hmm, maybe I need to check other rules.\n\nWait, looking again, I see:\n\n- NT34 -> t30\n- NT34 -> t14\n\nSo, the direct terminals are t14 and t30. I don't see t34 being a terminal. So how is t34 generated? Looking back, perhaps it's derived from non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT34's productions, it's derived from other non-terminals, not direct terminals. So that means t34 must come from a series of productions.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me confirm. In the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT34 -> t30\n- NT34 -> t14\n\nSo, no terminal 't34' is directly produced. That's odd because in that case, how do we get t34? Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I have to derive t34 step by step. Alternatively, perhaps the production chain ends up with t34 through some combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking for the non-terminals that produce 't34'. Hmm, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains 't34' which must be a result of some production. Maybe via NT34 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The grammar rules under NT34 are:\n\nNT34 -> t30\nNT34 -> t14\n\nSo no, NT34 doesn't produce 't34' directly. So perhaps 't34' comes from some other non-terminal.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce 't34' in their productions. For example, looking through the rules, is there any non-terminal that produces t34? Let me scan through all the NT rules.\n\nHmm, looking through the rules again:\n\n- NT31 -> NT25 NT13\n- NT10 -> NT33 NT24\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT15 NT3\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT12 -> NT10 NT18\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT6\n- NT21 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT15 NT18\n- NT16 -> NT29 NT7\n- NT8 -> NT27 NT6\n- NT17 -> NT16 NT19\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT0\n- NT26 -> NT28 NT22\n- NT7 -> NT27 NT1\n- NT18 -> NT32 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT43\n- NT21 -> NT8 NT26\nWait, I'm not seeing any NT with a production to 't34'. So maybe t34 is from a derivation of some non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps t34 is a result of another non-terminal's production. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me double-check.\n\nHmm, perhaps I missed some rule. Let me check NT34's rules again. Yes, NT34 -> 't30' and 't14'. So nowhere does NT34 produce 't34' directly. So how is 't34' in the string generated?\n\nThat makes me think that perhaps the string is not possible because there's no production for 't34', unless maybe it's constructed via a more complex derivation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo and I should check.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't34 t65 t8 t28 t70 t10 t31 t28 t6'. So the first token is 't34', which I'm assuming must come from some non-terminal's production.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me look for any NT production that includes 't34' in the RHS.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\nLooking for any line that has 't34' as a production.\n\n- NT31 -> NT25 NT13\n- NT10 -> NT33 NT24\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT15 NT3\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT12 -> NT10 NT18\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT6\n- NT21 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT15 NT18\n- NT16 -> NT29 NT7\n- NT8 -> NT27 NT6\n- NT17 -> NT16 NT19\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT0\n- NT26 -> NT28 NT22\n- NT22 -> NT18 NT32\n- NT13 -> NT10 NT21\n- NT21 -> NT21 NT24\n- NT16 -> NT5 NT32\n- NT2 -> NT24 NT16\n- NT12 -> NT25 NT3\n- NT6 -> NT10 NT31\n- NT5 -> NT3 NT32\n- NT5 -> NT5 NT20\n- NT1 -> NT6 NT27\n- NT16 -> NT18 NT6\n- NT26 -> NT34 NT2\nWait, here's something: NT26 -> t34 NT2.

{"custom_id":"request-182","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is in the form A -> BC or A -> a. The string to evaluate is `t38 t70 t11 t51 t32 t23 t30 t77 t12 t0`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar starts with a start symbol, which in this case is S. The provided grammar has S -> NT2 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, and S -> NT20 NT25. So S produces combinations of other NT symbols followed by numbers.\n\nThe string has 10 tokens, so I should check if it can be derived through the grammar by considering the possible splits at each step. Since each production leads to two parts, the number of tokens should be a product of the number of possible splits.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a parse tree with each node having two children, the number of tokens should be in the sequence that allows for such a structure. However, the string has 10 tokens, which is 2^3 + 2, which doesn't fit the usual binary tree structure, so perhaps a different approach is needed.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of possible parse trees. Each production splits into two parts, so for a string of 10 tokens, the parse tree must have a structure where each internal node has exactly two children. The number of tokens must be generated in a way that allows the tree to have 10 tokens at the leaves.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Maybe a better approach is to try to derive the string step by step, considering each production.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can be NT2 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25. So the string must be generated from one of these. Let's break it down.\n\nThe first token is 't38'. Let's see where 't38' comes from. Looking at the rules, I see NT22 -> 't40' and NT2 -> 't23'. Hmm, that's not t38. Looking through the rules, wait, NTC is one symbol, but the terminal symbols are like 't38', 't70', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the NTs and see which ones produce t38. Let's look through all the NT rules ending with terminal symbols:\n\nNT5 -> 't41', NT17 -> 't14', NT0 -> 't61', NT15 -> 't71', NT0 -> 't11', NT10 -> 't32', NT16 -> 't6', NT7 -> 't3', NT18 -> 't66', NT0 -> 't17', NT26 -> 't28', NT18 -> 't41', NT3 -> 't31', NT14 -> 't65', NT3 -> 't7', NT6 -> 't68', NT13 -> 't6', NT24 -> 't22', NT14 -> 't51', NT10 -> 't0', NT28 -> 't50', NT5 -> 't41', NT25 -> 't77', NT15 -> 't6', NT23 -> 't43', NT21 -> 't8', NT26 -> 't71', NT18 -> 't36', NT11 -> 't6', NT18 -> 't70', NT34 -> 't30', NT34 -> 't14', NT7 -> 't84', NT12 -> 't16', NT12 -> 't14', NT3 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't10', NT19 -> 't25', NT33 -> 't49', NT15 -> 't28', NT33 -> 't60', NT15 -> 't34', NT24 -> 't71', NT14 -> 't84', NT32 -> 't54', NT21 -> 't77', NT15 -> 't68', NT23 -> 't52', NT22 -> 't8', NT23 -> 't56', NT13 -> 't71', NT5 -> 't84', NT19 -> 't22', NT2 -> 't23', NT17 -> 't49', NT23 -> 't40', NT2 -> 't38', NT21 -> 't69', NT31 -> 't75', NT11 -> 't14'.\n\nWait, looking through these, I see 't38' comes from NT23. The rule is: NT23 -> 't38', right? Let me check the list. Yes, under NT23: 't38' is present. So the first token 't38' must come from NT23.\n\nNow, since S is the start symbol, and the string starts with 't38', which is from NT23, that means S must have produced a rule that includes NT23. Looking at S's productions: S -> NT2 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, S -> NT20 NT25. None of these directly give NT23, so my initial assumption must be wrong. Maybe the first step is combining two other NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built up by combining smaller parts. So each production step doubles the number of tokens, considering each production is two parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree for the string.\n\nLet me think step by step. The string is: t38, t70, t11, t51, t32, t23, t30, t77, t12, t0.\n\nSo 10 tokens. Let's think about possible breakdowns.\n\nAn option is that the string is generated by breaking it into two parts at some points. Each part should themselves be parseable.\n\nLooking at the first token 't38', as I found earlier, it's from NT23, whose production is NT23 -> 't38'.\n\nSo the first symbol comes from NT23, which is part of the initial S production that includes another NT symbol. Looking at S's productions:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT2 NT28, then NT2 could contribute to the first symbol. But the first symbol is 't38' which is from NT23, which is not directly in NT2 NT28. So perhaps this isn't the way.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT32 NT14. Let's see if either NT32 or NT14 can produce 't38'. From the rules, NT32 -> 't54', NT14 -> 't65', so no, they don't produce 't38'.\n\nOption 3: S -> NT20 NT25. NT20 and NT25. Do either of their productions include 't38'? NT20's production: NT20 -> NT29 NT32, which then may need to expand. Not sure. NT25: NT25 -> NT5 NT13, NT13 -> 't7' or other rules. Not seeing 't38' there.\n\nHmm, so none of the initial productions from S can directly produce 't38' as the first token. That suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and maybe the parse tree has more internal nodes than I thought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S doesn't produce these, and perhaps there's a step-by-step production that combines the tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is the result of a series of binary splits. Let me think about it in reverse. Start from the entire string and see if it can be divided into two parts that each can be parsed.\n\nThe string is 10 tokens long. Let's try breaking it into two parts at position 5: tokens 1-5 and tokens 6-10.\n\nFirst part: t38, t70, t11, t51, t32\n\nSecond part: t23, t30, t77, t12, t0\n\nNow, check if the first part can be parsed as some S production.\n\nLooking at the first part: It starts with 't38', which comes from NT23.\n\nSo perhaps S -> NT23 NTsomething, but in the initial productions of S, we don't have NT23. Alternatively, maybe the first part is a result of further splitting.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about the grammar as a parse tree. Each node can split into two children, each of which is a symbol or a terminal.\n\nSo for the entire string, the root would be S.\n\nThe entire string would be split into two parts, each part then splitting further until we get down to terminals.\n\nLet me try to split the string at various points and see if each part can be validated.\n\nAlternatively"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, but in the grammar provided, there are many non-terminals, but I don't see any NT that produces t75. So perhaps t75 cannot be produced by the grammar, meaning the string contains t75 which is not allowed. That might already rule out the possibility.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's see the grammar again:\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT that expands to t75. The closest is NT33 \u2192 't33 NTsomething' but no t75 terminal. So if the string has t75, that would be a problem unless it's derived from some other NT. But since there's no production for t75, I'm pretty sure t75 is not in the language. Therefore, the string contains a symbol that the grammar can't produce, so it's not possible for the string to be in the language.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed a production.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't17', 't8', etc., but I don't see t75. NT27 \u2192 't9' etc., no t75. NT32 is 't2' and other things, but I don't see t75. So I think t75 is definitely not in the terminal symbols of the grammar.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check again. The grammar has a lot of productions between non-terminals, but in the given list, the only terminal symbols are those that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This structure is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply certain algorithms, even though here I'm doing it manually.\n\nFirst, I should understand the given grammar. It consists of a series of production rules where the non-terminals on the left produce combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. Some of the rules directly replace non-terminals with terminals, marked by entries like `NT5 -> 't41'` and others. These terminals seem to be the actual words in the language, and the non-terminals are the variables that can be expanded further.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: t77, t8, t70, t16, t54, t50, t16, t31, t22, t38, t31. My task is to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of replacements according to the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, let's see the initial productions:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\nS -> NT32 NT2\n\nLooking at these, I see that S can branch into four different sequences. I'll have to see if any of these can lead to the target string. But since the target string is specific, I need to track how each terminal in the string can be generated.\n\nLet me break down each terminal and see which non-terminals could produce them. \n\n- t77: Looking at the grammar, NT25 produces 't77' (NT25 -> 't77'). So, t77 must come from NT25.\n\n- t8: Checking the productions, NT33 -> 't33 NT28' doesn't produce t8 directly. Wait, looking further, NT17 -> 't14' and others. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a rule. Oh, wait, I see NT22 -> 't8' because one of the productions is NT22 -> 't8'. So, t8 comes from NT22.\n\n- t70: NT12 -> 't14' and others. Wait, to get t70, I need to check where t70 comes from. Looking through the productions, I notice NT27 -> 't70' (NT27 -> 't70'). So, t70 is produced by NT27.\n\n- t16: Let's see, NT27 -> 't6' and 't9'... Wait, direct terminals. NT27 has a production NT27 -> 't9' NT9, but that's not t16. Looking through the other rules, NT16 -> 't16'. So, t16 is directly produced by NT16.\n\n- t54: Looking at the productions, NT32 -> 't54NT5'. So, NT32 must produce t54 as one terminal. But in the string, it's just t54, so NT32 must produce t54 directly. Wait, no, the production is NT32 -> NT5 -> 't54'? Wait, no, looking again: NT32 -> NT5 -> 't41' is another production. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's look at the productions for NT32. The given productions include:\n\nNT32 -> 't54' (probably one of the rules, checking the list, yes, there's NT32 -> 't54'). So NT32 can produce t54. So the fifth element is t54, which comes from NT32.\n\n- t50: NT50 is a terminal, but looking through the grammar, is there a production where NT28 -> 't50'? Yes, looking at the grammar, NT28 -> 't50' (NT28 -> 't50'). So t50 comes from NT28.\n\n- t16: Again, same as earlier. NT16 -> 't16', so it's directly produced.\n\nWait, wait, looking back at the string: t16 appears twice, at positions 3 and 7. So each t16 must come from NT16.\n\n- t31: NT33 -> 't31'. So t31 is produced by NT33.\n\n- t22: Looking through, I see NT22 -> 't8' earlier, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, t22 is in the string, and looking through the productions, I see NT22 -> 't8'. Oh no, that would mean t22 is produced by NT22, which in turn produces 't8', which is not possible because 't8' isn't a terminal. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, perhaps I misread.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let me check for NT22. One of the rules is NT22 -> 't8', but that would mean NT22 produces 't8', which is a terminal. So how can the string have 't22'? Wait, that's a problem. 't22' isn't a terminal, unless I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps I need to check where 't22' comes from.\n\nLet me look again. The productions for NT22 include NT22 -> 't8'. So that's the direct production. Similarly, looking for where 't22' appears as a terminal in the string. The string has t22, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, 't22' is only a terminal if there's a production rule for NT2-> 't22' or another non-terminal that produces it. But from the given list, I don't see NT22 producing 't22', only NT22 -> 't8' and others leading to different terminals.\n\nWait, that suggests that 't22' might not even be present in the grammar. But I'm looking through the given rules, and I only see NT33 -> 't33' and others, but 't22' isn't a terminal in any production. This is confusing. Did I copy the grammar correctly? Let me check again.\n\nLooking carefully, the grammar includes:\n\nNT22 -> 't8'\nNT22 -> 't32 NT23'\nNT13 -> 't6 NT21' etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, there's a t22, which is a terminal. So for the parser to accept this string, there must be a production that generates 't22'. But in the given grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't22'. That would be a problem because 't22' can't be derived from any non-terminal; it doesn't have a production rule.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. If 't22' is a terminal in the string, and there's no rule in the grammar that allows any non-terminal to produce 't22', then the string cannot be generated by the grammar. So this would immediately mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I might have missed a production for 't22'. Let's scan the list of rules again. \n\nLooking through all the non-terminals (NT1, NT2, NT3, etc.), there's:\n\n- NT33 -> 't33 NT28' which doesn't directly produce 't22'.\n- NT27 -> 't9 NT9' which isn't helpful.\n- NT18 -> 't66 NT7' etc.\n- NT22 has rules like NT22 -> 't8' and NT22 -> 't32 NT23'.\n  \nWait, 't22' is not among any of the terminal symbols in the grammar. Therefore, any occurrence of 't22' in the string would make it impossible to generate that string, as there's no rule that allows a non-terminal to produce 't22'. \n\nTherefore, the string contains 't22' which cannot be derived from any production in the grammar, so the answer must be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT32 -> 't54' (from NT19.3)\n- NT32 is a rule for NT32 producing 't54'.\n\nSo, 't54' has a direct production. Good. Similarly, 't51' comes from NT22.3, which is a production of NT17: NT17 -> 't51'.\n\nSo, we have 't54' and 't51' appearing as direct terminals. Now, the next step is to see how the rest of the string can be broken down.\n\nThe string is: t54 t6 t51 t17 t7 t49 t28 t68 t56 t69 t71.\n\nBreaking it down in terms of possible productions:\n\nStarting from the beginning, 't54' must come from some rule that directly produces it, which is NT32: 't54'. So S must start with NT32 NT28 based on the grammar's production. Wait, no. The top-level production is S -> NT32 NT28. Or wait, looking at the grammar, the first rule is S -> NT21 NT28. Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the initial productions are:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo S can derive NT21 and NT28, or NT32 and NT14, etc.\n\nBut 't54' is from NT32: NT32 -> t54. So perhaps the first production used is S -> NT32 NT14, then NT32 -> t54, and then NT14 must derive something else.\n\nBut let's step through this more carefully.\n\nThe string starts with t54. So in the derivation, after expanding S, the first two symbols must be the terms of one of the S productions. S -> NT32 NT14 would allow us to have 't54' as NT32, which would match the first token.\n\nSo let's see: S can produce NT32 and NT14. So the first part would be t54 from NT32, and then the next part would be the result of NT14.\n\nLooking at NT14's productions: NT14 can produce 't14' (from NT14.5: NT14 -> 't14'), NT34, 7, 17 (NT14.8: NT14 -> 't84'), or NT7 (from NT17's rule where 17 produces 7, but wait, no. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rule for NT14 is:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7 (from NT14.8: NT14 -> NT34 NT7)\nNT14 -> NT15 NT7 (from NT14.14: NT14 -> NT15 NT7)\nNT14 -> 't17' (from NT17's rule, but wait, is that correct?)\n\nWait, looking back: in the grammar, there's a line 'NT17 -> NT14' or does it produce something else? Wait, looking through the lines:\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in my initial parsing. Let me go through the grammar rules again more carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit complex. Let me check for NT14's productions.\n\nFrom the lines:\n\n- NT14 -> 't17' (looking for lines starting with NT14 that have 't17').\n\nWait, looking through the lines, I see:\n\n- Line: NT7 -> NT16 NT24\n- Line: NT18 -> NT20 NT0\n- Line: NT0 -> NT10 NT27\n- Line: NT17 -> NT16 NT19\n- Line: NT0 -> NT16 NT10\n- Line: NT0 -> NT2 NT23\n- Line: NT7 -> NT27 NT1\n- Line: NT18 -> NT29 NT6\n- Line: NT2 -> NT15 NT18\n- Line: NT17 -> NT9 NT18\n- Line: NT10 -> NT12 NT21\n- Line: NT16 -> NT18 NT6\n- Line: NT7 -> NT27 NT1\n- Line: NT27 -> NT11 NT4\n- Line: NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n- Line: NT14 -> NT15 NT7\n- Line elsewhere: NT14 -> NT17\n\nWait, maybe I need to find all productions for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, specifically for NT14, looking through the lines:\n\n- Line: NT14 -> 't17' (looking for NT14's production that directly gives a terminal). Let me see: the line says NT14.8: NT14 -> 't17'; no, on line 14.8: '43': NT14 -> 't17'? No, looking at the lines:\n\nWait, one of the lines is 'NT14 -> NT5 NT20' but that's in the middle. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLooking through the lines, I see:\n\n- Line: NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n\n- Line: NT14 -> NT15 NT7\n\n- Line: NT14 -> 't69'?

{"custom_id":"request-218","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe provided grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals and terminals. The initial step is to understand the structure of the grammar and the string we're evaluating. The string given is `t10 t34 t31 t60 t34 t51 t34 t41 t14 t25 t30 t0`. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. I'll try to see which non-terminals can produce the terminals we see in the string. The string has several 't' terms, so I'll focus on the productions that produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some rules where non-terminals are replaced by 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT27 -> 't9' (Wait, no, NT27 can produce 't9' twice?)\n- NT28 -> 't7'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT34 -> 't30' and 't14'\n- NT3 -> 't31' and 't7' etc.\n\nAlso, there are some rules where non-terminals produce combinations of other non-terminals. For instance, S can produce combinations like NT21 NT28, which then are replaced by terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string, I should start from the beginning and see if I can find a production chain that leads to it step by step.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens:\nt10, t34, t31, t60, t34, t51, t34, t41, t14, t25, t30, t0.\n\nStarting with t10. From the grammar, NT10 produces 't32', so to get t10, perhaps NT20 is involved, but also look at NT10 rules.\n\nWait, NT10 rules:\n- NT10 -> 't32'\nBut the string starts with t10, which isn't directly produced by any production I can see. Looking again, is there a non-terminal that produces 't10'? Yes, looking through the non-terminals, I see NT10 -> 't32' and NT10 -> 't10' if it exists. Wait, looking closely, I don't see a rule for NT10 that produces 't10'. Maybe I misread.\n\nWait, maybe I missed that. Looking through, for example, NT10: under the given rules, I don't see NT10 -> 't10'. Let me check again. Oh, yes, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT10 -> 't32'\nBut no rule for 't10', which is the first token in the string. That's a problem because the string starts with t10, which isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. So, unless t10 is part of a production that's further expanded, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the non-terminals again for 't10' as a production.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't10'. The only rule that has 't10' is at the end, but in the string, the last token is t0, which comes from NT0 -> 't61' or another rule.\n\nWait, no, looking at NT0: there's a rule NT0 -> 't17' and another NT0 -> 't61', but no 't10' production. Hmm, but the string starts with t10, which isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. That suggests that either the string is invalid, or maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me look again. Oh, wait, I see a production for NT10: here's NT10->'t32' and another rule: NT10 -> 't10'. Let me verify. Oh no, actually, looking at the provided rules, under NT10, the rules are:\n\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n\nWait, that's correct. I didn't notice earlier. So NT10 can produce 't32' and 't0', but also can it produce 't10'? Let's check the rules again.\n\nAh, yes, earlier in the list, under NT10, there are two rules:\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n\nSo that means NT10 cannot produce 't10' \u2014 wait, let me make sure. Looking through, the user provided the grammar with NT10 -> 't32' and NT10 -> 't0'. So 't10' isn't directly produced by any rule, which means the string starts with 't10', which isn't possible. Therefore, the string is invalid because it starts with 't10', which isn't directly produced by any production.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because if the string starts with t10, which isn't produced by any rule, then the grammar can't generate that string. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the non-terminals can produce t10 through a chain. Let me check if any non-terminal can produce t10 as part of a derivation.\n\nLooking through the rules, perhaps through other non-terminals. For example, is there a non-terminal that can eventually derive 't10'?\n\nLooking through the rules, let's see: for 't10', it's used in some productions, like in NT18 -> 't66', but that's part of a chain.\n\nWait, maybe there's a non-terminal that can produce 't10' via a chain. Let's check NT12, which has a rule NT12 -> 't14' and another rule NT12 -> 't16' (Is that correct? Let me check the rules again):\n\nIn the given rules, under NT12, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT12 -> 't14'\n\nYes, so if a non-terminal produces NT12, which then can produce t14 or t16. But that's not t10.\n\nLooking for t10 further down: NT10 can produce 't32' or 't0', but nothing else. So to produce t10, we need a non-terminal that can directly produce it, but I don't see any. Therefore, the string cannot be generated as it starts with t10, which isn't directly produced by any rule.\n\nBut wait, perhaps t10 is in a longer production. Maybe a non-terminal A can produce Bt10C, so during derivation, t10 can be part of it. But looking through the given rules, I can't find a non-terminal that includes 't10' in its production. The only t10's I can see are as the output of NT0, which is either 't61' or 't17' or others, but none directly produce 't10'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar's initial S, and the rest, could 't10' come from somewhere else?\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the string has 't10' in the middle, not the beginning, and I incorrectly thought the string started with it. Let me verify the string again. The string is `t10 t34 t31 t60 t34 t51 t34 t41 t14 t25 t30 t0`. So yes, it starts with t10, so if the grammar doesn't have a production for t10, then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe 't10' is part of a larger production. For instance, is there a non-terminal that can produce a string that includes 't10' as a middle part? Let's see, for example, looking at NT20:\n\n- NT20 -> 't68' and another rule NT20 -> 't32'\n\nNo, t10 isn't there. NT21 has a rule NT21 -> 't8', and another that produces combinations like 't60' or other 't's.\n\nWait, NT33: looking at the rules, some produce 't49', 't69"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, the top symbol of the string should match a terminal that's the right-hand side of a production. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several productions where terminals are on the right-hand side. For example:\n- NT14 -> t65\n- NT3 -> t31\n- NT5 -> t41\n- BT -> t28\n- NT15 -> t71\n- NT0 -> t17\n- NT26 -> t28\n- And many others where terminals are assigned specific t-something values.\n\nOur string has several terminals, and each might correspond to a specific production.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string and see if they match any known production rules:\n\n1. t56: Looking through the productions, I see that NT23 -> t56. So, t56 is derived from NT23.\n2. t65: NT14 -> t65.\n3. t8: Hmm, scanning the grammar, I don't see a production where a terminal is t8 directly. The only 't' productions I notice are for t56, t65, t70, t60, etc. Maybe t8 isn't a terminal, but perhaps a non-terminal. Wait, no\u2014the grammar's terminals are all labeled with 't' followed by a number, but looking through the productions, t8 doesn't appear as a terminal. So perhaps t8 is a non-terminal that can produce some string. Let's check if any production leads to t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that NT23 -> t56, which is part of the string. But I'm trying to see how t8 could be derived. Scanning through the productions for NT23, I find that NT23 \u2192 t40, but that doesn't help because in our string, after t56 comes t65, then t8.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconstruct the possible derivation.\n\nLet's try to see the entire string sequence:\n\nt56 t65 t8 t54 t70 t60 t70 t60 t23 t49 t22 t32\n\nBreaking it down into individual symbols, we have:\n\n1. t56\n2. t65\n3. t8\n4. t54\n5. t70\n6. t60\n7. t70\n8. t60\n9. t23\n10. t49\n11. t22\n12. t32\n\nLet me consider each symbol and see what non-terminals they originate from:\n\n1. t56 \u2192 NT23\n2. t65 \u2192 NT14\nSo, the first two symbols come from NT23 and NT14.\n\nNow, to get t8 next, we need NT8 \u2192 t8.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT8 has two productions:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t27 nt6\nNT8 \u2192 t6 t\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again, NT8 seems to have:\n\nNT8 -> t27 nt6\n\nand another that might be NT8 -> t68? No, actually, looking back, I think I might have misread the grammar. Let me check the productions for NT8.\n\nIn the given grammar, under NT8, I see:\n\nNT8 -> t27 nt6\n\nand also:\n\nNT8 -> t6 nt27\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me scan through the productions:\n\nLooking at NT8: I see:\n\n- NT8 -> t27 nt6\n- NT8 -> t16 nt10\n- NT8 -> t10 nt27\n- NT8 -> t6 nt27\n- NT8 -> tnt14 (perhaps not)\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT8 -> t27 nt6, but looking through all productions, I don't see a direct t6 terminal. Wait, no\u2014it's possible that NT8 is the non-terminal that may derive to a combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the string as a sequence of non-terminals, each corresponding to a production.\n\nLet me consider the possibility of building a parse tree for the string.\n\nThe string is: t56 t65 t8 t54 t70 t60 t70 t60 t23 t49 t22 t32\n\nEach terminal in the string must come from a production where the non-terminal is replaced by a terminal at the bottom. So, each t-something is a terminal, which must directly correspond to a production where something -> t-number.\n\nSo, for t56, the production is NT23 -> t56, so that's fine.\n\nFor t65, the production is NT14 -> t65, so that's also fine.\n\nSo far, we've used NT23, NT14.\n\nNext is t8. Looking through the productions for NT8, I see:\n\nNT8 -> t27 nt6\n\nBut wait, terminal in this production is t27 and nt6, which is another non-terminal. Hmm, but wait, t27 is another terminal that might come from another production.\n\nWait, perhaps each production in the grammar can be used to break down the string recursively. So, starting from the initial symbol, S. But perhaps a better approach is to work backwards from the string.\n\nEach symbol in the string must be a terminal, which must correspond directly to a production.\n\nWait, but in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals or a single terminal. However, when building the string, the non-terminals will expand into other symbols until they're replaced by terminals.\n\nBut perhaps the string we're given is a sequence of terminals, so the grammar must generate this sequence through its productions.\n\nAlternatively, to see if the sequence is a derived string, each symbol must come from a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, each terminal is represented as t-something, such as t56, t65, etc. So, each symbol in the string corresponds to a particular terminal.\n\nBut I'm now confused because I don't see a direct production for t8. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, let me scan the entire grammar to see which NTs have t as their terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are the terminals I can find:\n\n- NT8 -> t27 nt6 (so t27 is a terminal). But the string has t8, which isn't a terminal in any production. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe in the given grammar, t27 is a terminal, but t8 is a non-terminal that can produce a terminal t8. But in the given grammar, under NT8, I see no production where NT8 is replaced by t8 directly.\n\nWait, let me check the production for NT8:\n\nLooking through all productions, I see:\n\n- NT8 -> t27 nt6\n- NT8 -> t16 nt10\n- NT8 -> t10 nt27\n- NT8 -> t6 nt27\n- Also, I see NT8 -> tnt14 (not sure). Wait, looking again, I see:\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back, under ' productions', I have:\n\nWait, in the grammar, let me look for NT8:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT8 -> t27 nt6\n- NT8 -> t6 nt27\n- NT8 -> t16 nt10\n- NT8 -> t10 nt27\n\nSo, NT8 doesn't directly produce a terminal like t8. Instead, the production chain for t8 would have to go through NT8, which first expands into combinations of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nBut in our string, after t8 comes t54, which corresponds to NT3 -> t54 (since NT3 -> t54 is in the grammar). So, after t8 t54, it's possible that t8 is an NT that must produce a t-something followed by something else.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me approach this differently. Maybe I should parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t56 t65 t8 t54 t70 t60 t70 t60 t23 t49 t22 t32\n\nLet's consider each symbol and see if it can be derived from a production:\n\n1. t56 \u2192 NT23\n2. t65 \u2192 NT14\n3. t8 \u2192 ?\n   - From the grammar, I don't see NT8 deriving to a single terminal, so"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-237","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar provided, I notice it's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This helps because it simplifies the parsing process and makes it easier to track the derivation steps.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t66 t49 t3 t32 t16 t17 t75 t41 t17 t7 t49 t60 t30`. So, I need to see if there's a way this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules.\n\nLet me start by examining the initial grammar rules. The start symbol S has three options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT2 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nLooking at these, the string starts with `t66`, which is a terminal symbol. Let's check which production rules can lead to `t66`. Scanning through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't66' is one of the productions. So, maybe S can produce NT18 NTsomething, which then gets replaced by t66 and something else.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first two symbols are t66 and t49. So, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT18 NTsomething. But looking at S's productions, none produce NT18 directly. Hmm, maybe I need to trace back.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with t66, which comes from NT18, and the next symbol t49 might come from another production involving NT17 or something else.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 't49' and NT23 \u2192 't52', but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Let me think about the first few symbols.\n\nWait, I see that NT6 is a non-terminal, and NT6 \u2192 't68'. Hmm, but that's not matching t66 or t49. Maybe looking at the rules for NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT28 NT2, and that's not helpful. Alternatively, NT29 \u2192 NT27 NT22, but that's not it either.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for rules that produce t66 directly. From the rules, NT18 \u2192 't66'. So, if there's a production where a non-terminal becomes t66, that's a possible step. So perhaps in the first step, S produces a non-terminal that eventually becomes t66.\n\nLooking back, S can produce NT18 NTsomething? But S's options don't include NT18 directly. Wait, S's first option is NT2 NT28, which might eventually produce t66 if NT2 and NT28 derive to that.\n\nAlternatively, S's second option is NT32 NT14. If NT32 and NT14 derive to t66 and t49 respectively, that could fit the start of the string.\n\nWait, NT32's production is NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20. Then, NT1 \u2192 NT6 NT27, which could go on. Let me map this out:\n\nFor the string starting with t66, maybe the first part is generated by NT18, which only appears as a production of NT18 \u2192 't66'. So, if the first symbol comes from a path that ends with NT18, then that's a possibility.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built by a series of NTs that eventually produce terminals. Let me trace through the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t66 t49 t3 t32 t16 t17 t75 t41 t17 t7 t49 t60 t30\n\nLet's break it into parts:\n\n1. t66: This is from NT18 \u2192 't66'.\n2. t49: This is from NT17 \u2192 't49'.\n3. t3: This could be from NT3 \u2192 't31' or 't3', but t31 is a terminal, so maybe NT3 \u2192 't3'.\n4. t32: From NT32 \u2192 't54' or other, maybe NT32 \u2192 NT32 NT14 or NT28?\n5. t16: From NT16 \u2192 't16'?\n6. t17: From NT17 \u2192 't49' or other.\n7. t75: From NT75, which might be a terminal or from another production.\n8. t41: From NT41, which is a terminal.\n9. t17 again: same as before.\n10. t7: From NT7 \u2192 't3', etc.\n11. t49 again: same as step 2.\n12. t60: From NT60 \u2192 't60'.\n13. t30: From NT30 \u2192 't30'.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to see how the entire string can be broken down into the grammar's production rules.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols: t66 and t49. If the first production step is S \u2192 NT18 NTsomething, then NT18 \u2192 t66. But then where does T49 come from? Perhaps another NT17, which is connected through some productions.\n\nWait, let me look at the rules again. S can produce NT32 NT14. If NT32 produces the symbols after t66, and NT14 produces t49, that could work.\n\nLooking at NT32's production: NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20. Then NT1 \u2192 NT6 NT27, which might lead to t3, perhaps.\n\nWait, NT6 \u2192 't68', which doesn't match t3, so maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, NT32 could produce other symbols that lead to t3, t32, etc. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong; perhaps I should consider the order of the symbols and see if each can be derived step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to model the parse tree for the given string and see if each terminal can be produced by the non-terminals at each step.\n\nLet me try to map the string:\n\nThe string is: t66 t49 t3 t32 t16 t17 t75 t41 t17 t7 t49 t60 t30\n\nAssuming the start symbol S, each symbol must be produced exactly once, in order, through the grammar.\n\nLet me try to see how each part can be produced.\n\n1. t66: Must come from NT18 \u2192 t66. So the first non-terminal in the first step must be NT18.\n\nBut wait, the initial productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT2 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, S \u2192 NT20 NT25.\n\nNone of these directly lead to t66 or t49, except for NT18 and NT17. So, maybe S is part of a longer derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT18 NTsomething. But looking at the initial productions, S only has the three given, none of which are NT18. So that might not be possible. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the leftmost derivation of the string would help. Let me try that.\n\nThe string starts with t66. To get t66, the first symbol must be a terminal, so in the derivation tree, the first symbol is produced by the leftmost non-terminal, which eventually leads to t66.\n\nBut looking at the initial productions for S, none produce t66. So maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT2 NT28. Let's explore that.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT2 NT28.\n\nNow, let's consider NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18 from the rules.\n\nSo, NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18.\n\nThen, NT18 \u2192 t66.\n\nSo, the first part of the string could be derived as:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18 \u2192 NT15 't66'.\n\nBut the string starts with t66, which would require that NT15 may produce some symbols before it. Wait, no, because in the leftmost derivation, we pick the leftmost non-terminal, which is NT2, and substitute it first.\n\nSo, NT2 may produce NT15 NT18, which then will be NT15 and NT18. But NT15 is another non-terminal that needs to be handled.\n\nLooking at NT15's production: NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT23.\n\nSo, NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT23.\n\nNow, NT21 has two options:\n\n1. NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n2. NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n\nWait, but in the string, the next symbol is t49, which comes before others.

The string is `t54 t75 t52 t10 t25 t6 t28 t54 t16 t41 t25 t6 t43`. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except for the terminals which are the base cases. Since the grammar is given in CNF, each production starts from a non-terminal and leads to exactly two non-terminals, except for those that produce terminals, which are the atoms.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see various non-terminals with productions. For example, S -> NT21 NT25, which means S expands into NT21 and NT25. Then each of those NTs can further expand, either into other NTs or into terminals.\n\nThe string consists entirely of terminals: t54, t75, etc. So I need to trace back the derivations to see if the string can be built starting from the start symbol S.\n\nTo approach this, I should trace each token in the string back to the grammar. Let's analyze each term:\n\n- The string starts with t54. Looking at the grammar, t54 is directly produced by NT9. So the first step could be NT9 -> t54.\n\nNext, after t54, we have t75. Looking at the grammar, t75 is produced by NT26 -> t71, but that's not matching. Wait, t75 is produced by who? Looking through the productions, t75 is actually NT26 -> t71, which is a terminal, but I don't see a production for t75 elsewhere. Wait, I must have mixed up. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, t75 isn't directly produced by any NT as a terminal. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the productions for terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT3 -> t31\n- NT33 -> t33\n- NT22 -> t22\n- NT32 -> t2\nWait, no, t54 is produced by NT32 -> T2? Wait, no, looking back, the productions:\n\nIn the grammar, NT32 can produce NT5 and NT10. But terminals are when the rule produces a terminal symbol. Wait, maybe I need to see the actual terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see entries like \"t28\", \"t14\", \"t61\", etc. So these must be terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-266","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a particular string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's break this down step by step because it's a bit overwhelming with all these rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, most of the productions do seem to fit this form, where non-terminals on the left produce two non-terminals on the right, except for some which produce terminals. That seems consistent.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t30 t28 t28 t61 t50 t28 t41 t66 t84 t40 t70 t6 t34 t14`. I notice that most of these are terminals, except a few. Wait, but actually, looking again, most are t followed by numbers, which I think are terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. My job is to see if this sequence can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has productions like S \u2192 NT21 NT28, etc. So S is a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals. \n\nLet me start by analyzing the given string. Each token like t30, t28, etc., might be a terminal, but in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT5 \u2192 t41, as seen in the last entries. So maybe some of these t's are the result of specific non-terminal productions.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar more carefully, I see that some non-terminals like NT14 produce 't65', 't51', 't84', etc., while others produce 't's. For example, NT5 \u2192 t41, which is one of the productions. So when a non-terminal like NT5 is expanded, it produces a 't41'. But in our string, we have 't84', 't70', etc., which might correspond to different non-terminals.\n\nI think I can approach this by working backwards. The string starts with t30, which needs to be matched by some production rule that produces t30. Looking through the grammar, I see NT34 \u2192 t30 and also NT34 \u2192 t14. So NT34 can produce t30 or t14. Since our string starts with t30, maybe we can assign NT34 as the first non-terminal in the expansion.\n\nAfter t30, the next symbol is t28. So looking for a production that includes t30 followed by t28. But t28 is a production of NT3, because I see NT3 \u2192 t31 and also other options like NT14 \u2192 t65, etc. Wait, no, NT7 \u2192 t3, which is a different case. Alternatively, looking at the string, after t30 comes t28, so maybe the two non-terminals after t30 must produce these two t's.\n\nBut wait, in the string, we have t30 followed by t28, t28, etc. So perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT21 NT28. Let's check that. So S expands into NT21 and NT28, both non-terminals. Then each of these can expand further.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT21 NT28. Now, I need to find if NT21 and NT28 can expand into the remaining string tokens. Let's look at NT21. Checking the grammar, NT21 \u2192 t8. But if NT21 expands to t8, then in our string, after t30, we have t28, but t8 doesn't match t28. Hmm, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar. NT21 has productions, including NT21 \u2192 NT8 NT27. Oh, right, so NT21 can produce NT8 and NT27. Both of these are non-terminals. So perhaps the expansion is more complex.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 can produce NT27 and NT0, which are both non-terminals. Wait, NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0. So both NT27 and NT0 have their own productions.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be derived by following some path.\n\nThe string is:\n\n1. t30\n2. t28\n3. t28\n4. t61\n5. t50\n6. t28\n7. t41\n8. t66\n9. t84\n10. t40\n11. t70\n12. t6\n13. t34\n14. t14\n\nLet me start from the beginning. The first symbol is t30, which must come from some NT that produces t30. Looking at the grammar, NT34 can produce t30. So perhaps the first production is NT34 \u2192 t30. But wait, in the initial grammar, NT34's productions are NT34 \u2192 t30 and NT34 \u2192 t14.\n\nSo the first step could be NT34 expanding to t30. Then the next symbol in the string is t28. But since t30 is a terminal, that would mean the next symbol must be part of a longer expansion. Maybe the NT34 is not the first step after S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT21 NT28, which would mean that after expanding NT21 and NT28, we get the sequence starting with t30, t28, etc.\n\nBut let's think about NT21. NT21 can go to NT8 NT27, so if NT21 \u2192 NT8 NT27, then we need to expand NT8 and NT27. Looking at the grammar, NT8 \u2192 t27 NT6, perhaps? Or other options. But looking back, the grammar list might have 't's, which are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map out the possible terminals that each non-terminal can produce. For example:\n\nNT14 \u2192 t65 | t51 | t84 | t6 | ... others. \n\nBut maybe it's better to see which non-terminals can produce the required terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n\nt30, t28, t28, t61, t50, t28, t41, t66, t84, t40, t70, t6, t34, t14.\n\nI need to match each of these with possible productions.\n\nt30 is produced by NT34.\n\nt28 is produced by NT27 (since NT27 \u2192 t27 NT22, which is t27 and another non-terminal).\n\nWait, wait. Let's check:\n\nNT27 \u2192 t27 NT22.\n\nBut t27 as a terminal is present in the string as a 't27'? Wait, but in the given string, I see 't28', 't61', etc., but not 't27'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the string doesn't have 't27', but it does have 't28' twice. Let me recheck. The string is indeed t30, t28, t28, t61, t50, t28, etc.\n\nWait, are there 't27's in the string? No. So perhaps the 't27' in NT27's production isn't used in this case. Or maybe another path.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by looking for sequences of 't's and non-terminals that can generate those sequences.\n\nAnother approach is to try to find a leftmost derivation of the string.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT21 NT28. So let's see if there's a way to have NT21 and NT28 expand to generate the string.\n\nNT21 can expand into NT8 NT27. Let's suppose NT21 \u2192 NT8 NT27.\n\nNow, NT8's production: Looking through the grammar, NT8 \u2192 t27 NT6. So NT8 can become t27 followed by NT6's expansion. But in our string, after the initial t30, the next is t28, so maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT21 can expand into something else. Let me check NT21's productions again. Yes, NT21 \u2192 NT8 NT27, and that's all. So NT21 must become these two.\n\nWait, no other productions for NT21. So it's stuck there. Hmm.\n\nBut that can't be, since the string starts with t30, which would require NT34 to produce that, but S isn't producing t30 directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me go back to the grammar. S has several productions, like S \u2192 NT21 NT28, which are both non-terminals.

Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the string, I see a bunch of 't' followed by numbers. I think each 't' is a terminal symbol, so the string is a sequence of these terminals. My goal is to see if S can derive this sequence using the provided productions.\n\nHmm, let's list the grammar productions again to see the possible non-terminals and terminals. Wait, actually, the grammar seems to have both non-terminals and terminals. Some productions end with a terminal, like NT17 -> \"t14\", which means t14 is a terminal symbol. Similarly, NT0 -> \"t61\" and NT10 -> \"t32\". So the terminals are like \"t6\", \"t7\", up to \"t84\" or so, each being a separate terminal symbol.\n\nSo the string is \"t71 t66 t54 t51 t30 t6 t41 t52 t52 t32 t6 t6 t56 t60\". Since the string has 14 elements, I'll need to find a derivation path that matches all of them.\n\nStarting from S, which can produce NT2 NT28 or other variants like NT21 NT32, etc. Let me take the initial production S -> NT21 NT28 as the first step because the string starts with t71 and t66.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, S has multiple options. Let me check each production starting with S:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28, which is one option. Let's see what NT21 and NT28 produce.\n\nNT21 can produce several things, like NT32 NT2, NT6 NT0, etc. Looking at t71 in the string, I see that NT0 -> \"t17\" and NT26 -> \"t28\" are options, but that might not help directly. Let me see NT21's productions:\n\nLooking for NT21's options:\n\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT6\n- NT21 -> NT6 NT0\n- Also, NT21 -> NT19 NT26 and others, but maybe the first two are the relevant ones since we have t71 and t66.\n\nWait, NT21 can produce NT26 NT6. So let's see, if I choose S -> NT21 NT28, then the first symbol after S would be NT21's output. If NT21 is NT26 NT6, then NT26 can produce NT28, which is a terminal \"t50\" and other non-terminals. Hmm, but in the string, the second symbol is t66, which is a terminal. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S -> NT25 NT1. Because NT25 can go to NT5 NT13, which might lead us somewhere. Wait, not sure. Let's think deeper.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the string is a series of terminals, and the non-terminals in the grammar produce sequences of these. So perhaps the string corresponds to a leftmost derivation from S.\n\nLet me try to find a path.\n\n1. Start with S, which can go to NT21 NT28. So the string starts with t71, so NT21 must produce t71.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6. So to get a terminal, maybe NT26's production. Let's see NT26's options:\n\nNT26 -> NT28 NT22, NT6 -> NT10 NT31, etc. Wait, in the string, after t71 is t66. So t71 comes first, then t66. So perhaps S produces NT21 (which is t71) and then NT28, which produces t66.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28.\n\nIs NT21 capable of producing t71? Let's see NT21's productions:\n\nNT21 can produce NT26 NT6. So it's either two non-terminals. To get t71, perhaps NT21 is producing something else. Wait, NT21 also has NT21 -> NT19 NT26, but I'm not sure if it leads to a terminal. Alternatively, looking for direct t71, do any non-terminals produce t71 directly?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT0 -> 't61', which is t61, not t71. NT3 -> 't31', which is t31. NT15 -> 't68' (t68), etc. Let me check NT21:\n\nWait, checking the grammar, I see that NT21 has a production NT21 -> \"t8\" (from the end of some production, perhaps?), but not directly.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll take a closer look at the grammar. It seems pretty extensive with many production rules. The start symbol is S, and the initial productions are S -> NT21 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, and S -> NT20 NT25. Each of these non-terminals then branches out into other non-terminals and eventually into terminals, which are labeled as 't' followed by a number. \n\nThe string we're checking starts with t6, which is a terminal. So, we'll begin by looking for which production rules can generate a t6. Looking through the grammar, I notice that NT18 -> t6 is a production. Also, NT26 -> t28 isn't directly helpful here. Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT18 has rules like NT18 -> t6. Also, NT5 -> t41, NT7 -> t3, etc. From the given string, t6 appears a couple of times, so we'll need to track those.\n\nNext, the string is t6 t43 t32 t38 t65 t43 t10 t41 t34 t66 t65 t22 t10 t52 t68. Let's try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT21 NT28 or NT32 NT14 or NT20 NT25. Each of these non-terminals will need to generate the corresponding terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t6. Let's see which non-terminals can derive t6. From the grammar, I see that NT18 -> t6, so S needs to produce something that includes NT18.\n\nBut the initial productions are all combinations like NT21 and NT28. So S can only produce a combination of two non-terminals, and from the string, the first part is t6. So perhaps S first expands to a non-terminal that can generate t6.\n\nWait, the initial productions are S -> NT21 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, S -> NT20 NT25. So the first step is S -> something like NT21 NT28. Now, what do NT21 and NT28 produce?\n\nLooking at NT21's productions: NT21 -> NT26 NT6, NT21 -> NT6 NT0, NT21 -> NT21 NT24. So NT21 can potentially derive t6 via NT21 -> NT26 NT6. Since NT26 -> t28, which isn't t6, maybe that's not the path.\n\nWait, but NT26 has a production that goes to 't28', but also, NT26 -> NT6 NT5, and NT5 can derive t41. Hmm, that might not help. Alternatively, NT18 -> t6 is a direct production, so if NT26 could produce t6, but it doesn't directly. Wait, no. Let me check NT13's production: NT13 -> t6. Yes, so NT13 can produce t6. Also, NT24 -> t22, which isn't t6. \n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me list all the non-terminals that directly produce t6:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT18 -> t6, NT13 -> t6, NT24 -> t22 (not t6), NT12 -> t16, NT12 -> t14, NT23 -> t40, etc. Wait, looking at the rules, NT6 has production NT6 -> t68, which isn't t6. NT7 -> t3 (no), NT5 -> t41, etc. Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, checking the rules again: Is there any non-terminal that can directly produce t6? Yes, NT18 has NT18 -> t6, and NT13 -> t6 is not correct. Wait no, looking again, the rule is NT13 -> NT18 NT18. So that doesn't produce t6 directly. Wait, let me check the rules properly.\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, the one that produces t6 is NT18 -> t6. So any non-terminal that eventually produces NT18 can generate t6.\n\nWait, no. NT18 -> t6 is a direct production, so if a non-terminal can derive NT18, it can produce t6. So for example, if a non-terminal can derive NT18, then it can produce t6.\n\nSo looking at S's initial productions: S can produce NT21 NT28, NT32 NT14, NT20 NT25.\n\nNow, let's see if any of these can generate t6.\n\nFirst, let's take the first production: S -> NT21 NT28.\n\nNT21 can derive to NT26 NT6 (which is NT26 and NT6), or NT6 NT0, or recursively more.\n\nNow, NT26's rules: NT26 can produce NT6 NT5, or other combinations.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by considering the derivation steps.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t6, t43, t32, t38, t65, t43, t10, t41, t34, t66, t65, t22, t10, t52, t68.\n\nLet me see the number of symbols: 15 symbols. The grammar starts with S, which in each step increases the number of non-terminals. So the number of symbols should match the number of steps or so.\n\nBut to track the derivation, it's better to use a stack-based approach or try to match the string from the top-down.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to parse the string using the grammar rules.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if we can derive this sequence starting from S.\n\nLet me consider the first symbol, t6. So the first step must involve a production that leads to t6. Since S is the start symbol, it needs to expand into something that can generate t6 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the initial productions: S -> NT21 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, S -> NT20 NT25.

So the first part is NT21 and the second is NT28.\n\nNow, NT21 can produce NT26 NT6 or NT6 NT0, etc. But the first symbol is t6, so in NT21's expansion, we need to have a production that can produce t6 as the first symbol. Let me see NT21's rules: NT21 can expand to NT26 NT6, which is two non-terminals. Alternatively, can NT26 produce t6? No, because NT26's rules start with NT6 NT5, which is t68 and t41? Wait, no. Wait, looking at NT26's rules: NT26 -> NT6 NT5, which is 't68' and 't41'? Wait, no.

The grammar and the string are quite long, so I need to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is: a CFG where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are variables and a is a terminal symbol. In this grammar, I see that all the productions start with a single non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. So it fits the CNF criteria.\n\nThe string given is: t84 t61 t6 t51 t77 t75 t66 t40 t11 t8 t6 t77 t56 t10 t70.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production introduces exactly one terminal at each step, but the derivations can get complex quickly because of the leftmost or rightmost productions.\n\nLet me try to map the string back to the non-terminals.\n\nEach symbol in the string, like t84, t61, etc., corresponds to a production rule ending with that terminal. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals like NT27 go to t7 or other t's.

Is there any NT that produces t84?\n\nLooking at all the rules, I don't see any.

{"custom_id":"request-298","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is \"t7 t3 t60 t60 t25 t23 t71 t69 t66 t54 t11 t40 t22 t66 t38 t30\".\n\nFirst, I recall that the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow CNF since all rules are left-hand sides with two non-terminals (except the terminals, but according to CNF, we can have terminals as right-hand sides to simplify, so this might be ok).\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, S is the start symbol and the productions from S are into NTs that eventually lead to terminals. Each production right-hand side is a combination of two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I can try to parse it backtracking, or alternatively, build a parse tree by seeing if the string can be broken down according to the grammar. Since the grammar is provided, perhaps a better approach is to see if each step in the string corresponds to a production.\n\nAlternative approach: Reverse the string because in CNF, each step tends to produce a string from higher levels to lower, but sometimes people parse left to right. Alternatively, each production is atomic, so the string must be built by concatenating the results of the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps better to think step by step. Let's take the string and try to split it into possible left-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string:\nt7, t3, t60, t60, t25, t23, t71, t69, t66, t54, t11, t40, t22, t66, t38, t30\n\nWe can think of this as a sequence of 16 tokens. Each token is the result of a production that is either a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nBut in CNF, each production is either one terminal or two non-terminals. So, a string in CNF can be seen as a series of terminals and non-terminals, each production expanding a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, the string is a series of 16 terminals. Since each production produces two non-terminals, perhaps the string length is 2^k, but 16 is 2^4, so that's possible.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S is the initial symbol, so S would produce two non-terminals, each of which could produce more, leading to the string. So for the string to be in the language, it should be the result of expanding S into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, ending in a string of only terminals.\n\nSo to approach this, I can try to break the string into segments that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nLet's list the given productions (some are listed multiple times, but we can note each as they might matter):\n\nLooking at the given grammar rules, some key ones are:\nS \u2192 NT2 NT28\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nNT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29\nNT31 \u2192 NT34 NT1\n\u2026 and so on.\n\nBut the string consists of only the terminals (like t7, t3, etc.), so each of these must be the result of terminals from the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me list all the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals they can derive from.\n\nIn the grammar, terminals are things like t28, t14, t61, etc. So each 'tX' is a terminal symbol, but in the rules, they are generated by specific non-terminals.\n\nFor example, NT17 produces t14 (NT17 \u2192 't14'). Similarly, NT0 \u2192 't61', and so on.\n\nSo, the key is to see which non-terminals expand into which terminals.\n\nLet me start by creating a list of the terminal symbols in the string and their corresponding possible non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the string:\n\nt7: From grammar rules, NT24 \u2192 't22', NT6 \u2192 't68', NT26 \u2192 't28', NT7 \u2192 't3', NT18 \u2192 't66', NT22 \u2192 't22', etc. Wait, to find which non-terminals output t7.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't3' \nAnother production: NT7 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, but in the given rules, NT7 \u2192 't84' (from NT14 \u2192 't84' but that's a different NT).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check which NTs produce t7.\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn the rules, NT7 is only used in rules like NT14 \u2192 't84', or:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't3' (from NT7 \u2192 't3')\nBut is there another occurrence? Let me check.\n\nYes, looking at the list:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't3' (once)\nNT3 \u2192 't12' (so not t7), and other rules:\n\nNT14 \u2192 't65' (so no), NT10 \u2192 't0', etc. Wait, so is there any NT that directly produces t7?\n\nWait, looking at the given rules, the only production for t7 is NT7 \u2192 't3'. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at it wrong. The grammar has many rules where t is followed by numbers, like 't1', 't2', etc. For example:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't66'\n\nWait, looking again, I think I might have misread. Let me go through the grammar rules to find which NTs produce the tX terminals:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't23' (rule: NT2 \u2192 't23')\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT0 \u2192 't61'\n- NT15 \u2192 't28'\n- NT30 \u2192 't30' (Wait, is there a NT30? Let me check: the last lines have NT34 \u2192 't30' and NT34 \u2192 't14'. Wait, maybe I need to find each production and see which NT produces which terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note down each non-terminal and see which terminal it produces:\n\nFor example, NT17 \u2192 't14' (this is line: NT17 \u2192 't14')\nNT0 \u2192 't61' (line: NT0 \u2192 't61')\nNT15 \u2192 't28' (line: NT15 \u2192 't28')\nNT30 \u2192 't30' (looking through the rules, I don't see NT30 \u2192 't30'; instead, NT34 \u2192 't30' and also NT34 \u2192 't14'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some rules. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but perhaps more precisely, NT34 \u2192 't30' and 't14').\n\nWait, perhaps some other rules produce t's. Let me check each line:\n\n- \"S -> NT2 NT28\" etc. These are all production rules, but some are for terminals. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, perhaps some of these lines represent production rules where the right-hand side is a pair of non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT2 NT28 is a production from S.

Hmm, I think I don't see any NTs that directly produce 't7' except perhaps in lines:\n\nWait, looking through, I don't see a rule like NTX \u2192 't7'.

{"custom_id":"request-306","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is a set of production rules. It starts with the start symbol S, which has several productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT2 NT28\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo, any string derived from S must start with two non-terminal symbols. Each of these non-terminals can then be further expanded according to the production rules.\n\nNow, looking at the string: `t3 t41 t54 t6 t70 t71 t0 t43 t12 t49 t43 t61 t60 t40 t36 t49`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of symbols, some of which seem to be terminal symbols (like t3, t41, etc.) and others that might correspond to non-terminals? Wait, in the grammar, each production right-hand side consists of two non-terminals. At some point, these non-terminals will be replaced by terminal symbols. So, the string should be built by expanding non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nI need to parse the string backward because usually, in a bottom-up parsing approach, we start expanding the rightmost non-terminals. But with the given grammar, perhaps a top-down approach is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can construct a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of non-terminals is quite large, perhaps a dynamic programming approach like theCYK algorithm would be suitable here. But I'm not very familiar with how to apply CYK to this specific grammar and string.\n\nWait, the string is:\n\n`t3 t41 t54 t6 t70 t71 t0 t43 t12 t49 t43 t61 t60 t40 t36 t49`\n\nCounting the tokens, there are 16 tokens. Let me write them as a list for clarity:\n\n1. t3\n2. t41\n3. t54\n4. t6\n5. t70\n6. t71\n7. t0\n8. t43\n9. t12\n10. t49\n11. t43\n12. t61\n13. t60\n14. t40\n15. t36\n16. t49\n\nSo, 16 terminal symbols. Each production in the grammar replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, so in each expansion step, the number of symbols increases by one.\n\nSince S starts with two non-terminals, to derive a string of length 16, we need 15 production steps, each time replacing one non-terminal with two. So, the total number of non-terminals in the derivation sequence would be 2 + 15 = 17, leading to 16 terminals.\n\nSo, the string has 16 terminals, which is correct.\n\nNow, let's see which non-terminals can produce which sequences.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals are terminals after expansion. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t41\n- NT17 \u2192 t14 (from NT17 \u2192 t14 in the rewritten grammar)\nWait, checking the rewritten grammar, NT17 \u2192 t14.\n\nSo, some non-terminals like NT5 and NT17 directly produce terminals. Others, like NT0, produce multiple things, including terminals.\n\nLet me map out which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nFrom the rewritten grammar:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t14\nNT5 \u2192 t41\nNT0 \u2192 t61 (but also NT0 can produce other things)\nOther NTs produce combinations of NTs or terminals.\n\nLooking for the string, t3 is the first token. Let's see which NT produces t3. Looking at the rewrite rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t31 | t7 | t2 | t5 | ... Wait, I'm not seeing t3 in the rewritten NT3 production.\n\nWait, in the original grammar, NT3 has several productions, but now looking at the rewritten grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7\nBut what do NT5 and NT7 produce?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t41 (so t41)\nNT3 \u2192 t7 (t7?) Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait in the rewritten grammar, NT3 \u2192 t7?\n\nNo, looking at the rewrite:\n\nNT3: \n- NT14\n- NT23\n- NT28\n- NT33\n- NT29\n- ...\nWait, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each NT to the terminals they produce.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT3 seems to produce NT5 and NT7. NT5 \u2192 t41, NT7 \u2192 t3, so NT3 \u2192 t41 t3? No, that can't be, because NT7 \u2192 t3.\n\nWait, looking at the rewritten grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t7 | ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps let me clarify:\n\nThe rewritten grammar provided is actually the full set of productions. Let me check each NT for terminals.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7 | NT34 NT1 | NT5 NT7 | NT18 NT24 | NT20 NT13 | NT5 NT7 | NT18 NT6 | NT32 NT2 | NT28 NT18 | NT13 NT18 | NT15 NT32 | NT32 NT23 | NT22 NT27 | NT21 NT6 | NT18 NT32 | NT13 NT18 | NT21 NT24 | NT27 NT11 | NT7 \u2192 several terminals?\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a mapping for each NT to its terminal productions.\n\nLet me list each NT and see what terminals they can produce:\n\n1. NT17 \u2192 t14 (direct)\n2. NT5 \u2192 t41 (direct)\n3. NT0 \u2192 t61, also can produce other NTs, but when does it produce t61? Only in the direct production.\n4. NT1 \u2192 NT6 NT27 \u2192 possibly t6 and t27, but need to see if those have terminal rules.\n5. NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7 | NT20 NT13 | NT5 NT7 | NT18 NT24 | NT29 NT1 | NT15 NT32 | ... Hmm, I'm not seeing direct terminals except for some combinations. Maybe NT3 can produce certain tokens when those NTs have terminal rules.\n6. NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27 \u2192 NT22 can produce t23 (from earlier, NT22: NT4 NT5 \u2192 but NT4 is NT29 NT10, etc. Maybe not directly.\n7. NT25 \u2192 NT23 NT28 \u2192 which goes deeper.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to see if the string can be parsed using a top-down approach, but given the string length, that might be too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, it's context-free, and each step produces two symbols. The only terminals are when the top-level symbols are expanded to produce t tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps a way is to reconstruct the possible parse tree. Let's start by looking at the string from the beginning.\n\nBut since the string is 16 symbols, which is quite long, perhaps the approach is to check if the grammar can generate a string that starts with t3, which is in the first position.\n\nLooking at the NTs that can produce t3.\n\nIn the rewritten grammar:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t3. Wait, maybe looking deeper:\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I've made a mistake. Let me scan each NT to see if they can produce t3.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT3: NT5 NT7 \u2192 if NT5 \u2192 t41 and NT7 \u2192 t3, then NT3 \u2192 t41 t3. But in the string, it's t3 followed by t41, so that could be possible if a segment like 't3 t41' is generated by NT3. But does that mean that in the production, NT3 must produce t3 t41 in that exact order?\n\nWait, actually, in a context-free grammar, the order in the right-hand side can matter only in the sense of the derivation; the parser will allow leftmost derivations, for example. But in the string, the order is fixed as per the given sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding, and the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each one being a result of a production step. So, the parsing needs to find a way to break down the string into a sequence of productions matching the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the first token: t3. Since there's no NT that directly produces t3, perhaps t3 comes from a deeper production where each step replaces a non-terminal. But to get t3, we need an NT that eventually produces t3.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake here. Let me recheck the NT3 production in the rewritten grammar:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is t7 t22 t31 t54 t38 t36 t40 t50 t52 t77 t32 t14 t25 t50 t56 t50 t17. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. All non-terminals are on the left, and the right-hand sides are pairs of non-terminals or terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nMy plan is to map each token in the string to the corresponding production rules. I'll start from the beginning of the string and see if I can find matching rules step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is t7. Looking through the rules, I see NT7->'t3'. So, t7 corresponds to NT7 production. \n\nNext is t22. Checking the rules, there's NT22->'t22' and NT22->'t8->t22'? Wait, no, NT22's rules are NT22->'t22', NT26->NT28, NT22->NT26 NT6, etc. Hmm, looking at the rules, NT22->'t22' is present, so t22 is directly a terminal. So, the second step is t22.\n\nWait, no, the string is t7 t22 t31... so after t7 is t22. So, after t7, which is NT7, the next is t22, which must come from a production where the next symbol is t22. So, after NT7, we have NT7->'t3', so the next symbol must be t3. But the string has t7 followed by t22, not another t3.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Because the first symbol t7 uses NT7->'t3', which would require the next symbol to be t3. But in the string, after t7 is t22, which isn't t3. So, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the order. Let me re-express the first part. The string starts with t7 t22 t31... So, the first two symbols are t7 and t22. But according to NT7->'t3', after t7, we should have t3, not t22. That would mean it's impossible. Unless there's a way for t7 to transition into something else.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the rules. Let me check NT7 again. The rules include NT7->'t3', and nothing else seems to involve NT7. So, once NT7 is used, it produces 't3', which would follow in the string. But the string has t7 followed by t22, so that can't happen. That suggests that the string cannot be generated because the immediate next symbol is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the string. Let me double-check: the string is t7 t22 t31 t54 t38 t36 t40 t50 t52 t77 t32 t14 t25 t50 t56 t50 t17. So yes, after t7 it's t22.\n\nThat means the string starts with a production that produces 't7' followed by 't22', but in the grammar, after 't7' (from NT7), the next symbol should be 't3'. Therefore, this sequence is impossible, so the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing a possibility where NT7 can somehow generate a longer sequence. Let me think. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either terminals or two non-terminals. Once NT7 is used, it directly produces 't3', so there's no way to get 't7' again followed by something else.

{"custom_id":"request-321","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has a specific structure. Each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to stick to that: all the rules are either two symbols on the right or a terminal.\n\nThe goal is to check if the string `t41 t43 t14 t17 t30 t22 t49 t84 t41 t34 t77 t22 t61 t50 t31 t0 t36` can be generated by this grammar. So, I need to parse the string using the grammar and see if every symbol in the string can be derived step by step according to the rules.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can expand it step by step to match the string. Let's see what S can produce:\n\nLooking at the rules, S can produce NT21 NT28, NT31 NT25, or NT20 NT25. \n\nLet me consider each possibility:\n\n1. Starting with S -> NT21 NT28:\n   - Need to expand NT21 and NT28.\n   - Looking at NT21's rules: From the grammar, NT21 can produce NT32 NT6 or NT6 NT0. \n   - Let's pick one. Suppose NT21 becomes NT32 NT6.\n   - Then NT32 can expand to NT1 NT23. Let's pick that.\n   - NT1 can produce t28 (see the rule NT1 -> 't28') or other possibilities? Wait, looking at the rules, NT1 sometimes has t28 as an option, but I'm not sure if there are others. From the provided rules, it seems NT1's production is either 't28' or perhaps others. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I notice that some symbols like NT1 have multiple rules. For example, NT1's rules aren't explicitly provided except when it's a terminal. Wait, maybe I missed some. Let me recount.\n\nIn the given grammar, NT1 has a rule NT1 -> 't28'? Or maybe more? Looking through the provided rules: \n\nI see NT26 -> 't28' and other t rules. But in the actual rules, let's check. \n\nLooking at the rules: NT1's production isn't showing any except when it's a terminal. Wait, did I miss a rule?\n\nWait, in the provided rules, for NT1, there's one rule: NT1 -> 't28'? Or is there another? Let me scan: \n\nNo, I don't see NT1 having another terminal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. \n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see that some symbols have multiple productions:\n\nFor example, NT21 has NT21 -> NT32 NT6 and NT21 -> NT6 NT0.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 can have NT3 -> NT20 NT13 or NT3 -> NT5 NT7, etc.\n\nBut for NT1, looking back, it's only present in other rules, not as a primary non-terminal. Wait, no, wait: looking at the given rules, NT1 doesn't directly appear as a non-terminal. Wait, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, let me go through the rules systematically:\n\nI see NT2 -> NT15 NT18, which is a production for NT2, not NT1.\n\nSo, from the provided grammar, I don't see a rule for NT1 as a non-terminal. All seem to be non-terminals except the ones with terminals as the right-hand side.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed one. Let me check again:\n\nLooking for a rule like NT1 -> something. Oh, wait, in the later part, I see NT5 -> 't41', which is a terminal, but not NT1.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the given grammar. Oh, I notice that there are several lines where symbols are assigned to terminals, like:\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\n\nNT25 -> 't77'\n\nAnd so on. So, some non-terminals expand into terminals. So, for example, NT15 -> 't28'.\n\nWait, but looking again, none of the non-terminals have 't28' as a production except for NT21 and others. Hmm.\n\nSo, perhaps, in the given grammar, all non-terminals expand to either a non-terminal or a terminal. Now, for our string, the term tokens are: t41, t43, t14, etc. So, all these are terminals, which must be directly derived from non-terminals that have a production to that terminal.\n\nSo, let's trace the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t41 t43 t14 t17 t30 t22 t49 t84 t41 t34 t77 t22 t61 t50 t31 t0 t36.\n\nI need to break this down into possible non-terminal expansions.\n\nStarting from S, which can be NT21 NT28, etc.\n\nLet's consider each option for S:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT21 NT28.\n\nNow, NT21 can expand into either NT32 NT6 or NT6 NT0.\n\nLet's pick NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT6.\n\nThen, NT32 can expand into NT1 NT23. So, NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT23.\n\nNow, NT1: Do we have any rule for NT1 on the right-hand side? Looking at the grammar, I don't see a rule for NT1 as a non-terminal, which is confusing because non-terminals should only appear on the left. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me check again. Looking through the given grammar, all non-terminals have rules. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, I notice that some non-terminals have two symbols on the RHS. For example, NT17 \u2192 't14', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't41'. Wait, so some non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nBut what about NT1? I don't see any production for NT1 as a non-terminal. All the rules for NT1 must be elsewhere. Wait, maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, maybe I misread earlier. Let me go through all the provided grammar rules again and see if NT1 has any rule.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT17 -> 't14'\n\nNT5 -> 't41'\n\nNT1 -> ... Hmm, no, I don't see any production for NT1 as a non-terminal. Maybe I overlooked it.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. The rules provided are extensive, but I might have missed an NT1 rule. Let me go through all of them.\n\nWait, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> NT11 NT4\n- NT13 -> NT10 NT21\n- NT24 -> NT32 NT23\n- NT14 -> NT15 NT7\n- NT10 -> NT12 NT21\n- NT13 -> NT10 NT21\n- NT21 -> NT21 NT24 (Wait, that's a rule: NT21 can sometimes produce NT21 NT24. Oh! So, for NT21, the rules are:\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT6\n\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nNT21 -> NT21 NT24\n\nSimilarly, maybe other non-terminals have recursive rules. So, perhaps for other non-terminals as well.\n\nSo, going back, if NT1 is a non-terminal that's part of the grammar, but in the provided rules, I don't see a production for NT1 as a non-terminal. That's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in reading.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again:\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I don't see a production for NT1 on the left-hand side. So, perhaps NT1 is a terminal, but that's unlikely because it's a non-terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe NT1 is a terminal sometimes, but in this context, it can only expand to another non-terminal or a terminal. But in the given data, the string contains t41, which is matched by NT5 -> 't41', but not 't1', 't14', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should proceed.\n\nAssuming that S can expand into NT21 and NT28, and NT21 can expand into NT32 and NT6. Then, proceeding, perhaps the NT32 can expand into NT1 and NT23, but since NT1 is not a known non-terminal, perhaps that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the other production for S: S -> NT31 NT25.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nS -> NT31 NT25.\n\nNT31 can expand to NT25"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-343","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, the string is 't7 t56 t43 t16 t6 t40 t65 t66 t34 t32 t25 t14 t52 t75 t6 t7 t32 t50', and the grammar has a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form consists of rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The string seems to consist of several 't's followed by numbers. I think these terminals might correspond to specific non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals (like NT2 to NT4, NT6 to NT34, etc.) have been defined to produce certain terminals. For example, some of them produce 't28', 't14', 't61', and so on. Wait, but in the string provided, I see 't7', 't56', 't43', etc. So perhaps I need to see which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nLet me go through the grammar rules step by step to see which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nStarting with the top-level rules:\n- S can generate NT21 and NT25 via S -> NT21 NT25\nWait, actually, looking back, no, the initial S production is actually more than two; let me check.\n\nWait, looking again, the first line is S -> NT21 NT25. Wait, no, actually, looking at the provided grammar, the first rule is S -> NT21 NT25, but that seems incorrect because S should produce two non-terminals, but the definition has 13 lines, so maybe it's a copy-paste error. Wait, no, looking more carefully, the user presented the grammar with 13 rules, all are S -> something, but the initial part is S -> NT21 NT25 and so on, but the provided production rules have S defined as S -> NT21 NT25 and 12 more similar rules. Wait, that seems incorrect, but wait no, S is the start symbol and is defined with multiple production rules, each producing two non-terminals. So the initial lines under S are the possible ways S can be broken down.\n\nWait, the user provided the entire grammar, so S has multiple rules, each producing two non-terminals, like S -> NT21 NT25, etc.\n\nThen, all NT... non-terminals have their own production rules, some produce two non-terminals, others produce a terminal and a non-terminal, or directly a terminal.\n\nSo, to process the string, I think I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from some production rule starting from S.\n\nBut considering the size, it's quite big, so perhaps a better approach is to check if each terminal in the string is part of the production of any NT... non-terminal, and then see if we can find a path from S down to those.\n\nWait, let's list the terminals in the string:\n\nt7, t56, t43, t16, t6, t40, t65, t66, t34, t32, t25, t14, t52, t75, t6, t7, t32, t50.\n\nHmm, some of these are larger ts, like t56, which I think correspond to 't' followed by a number. Now, according to the grammar, each non-terminal might produce specific terminals.\n\nFor example, some non-terminals produce 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 produces 't31' and 't7'. NT5 produces 't41' and 't5'. NT17 produces 't14' and 't49'. NT25 produces 't77'. NT21 produces 't8'. Wait, so some of these nt's produce certain tXXs.\n\nBut let me list out each terminal and see which NTs produce them.\n\nt7 is produced by NT7? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT7's production is NT7 -> NT16 NT24. But NT16 -> NT29 NT7, which is a cycle. Wait, no, I need to find NTs that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I can list which NTs produce terminals:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nNT0 -> some non-terminals, but some produce terminals: 't61', 't10', 't27', etc. Wait, looking at the lines, for example:\n\nNT17 -> 't14', so that's a terminal.\n\nLooking at all the lines:\n\nNT0 -> several, but some produce terminals like 't8' (multiple lines), 't61', 't10', 't27', etc.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT2 -> 't23', 't54', 't6' (from NT26), 't86'? Wait, need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, taking it step by step:\n\nList of all NT rules and their terminals if any:\n\n1. S -> NT21 NT25 etc. (These are initial and produce non-terminals, but we need to focus on the NTs)\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- NT21: rules: NT21 -> NT26 NT6, NT21 -> NT6 NT0. No terminals.\n\n- NT25: rules: NT25-> NT5 NT13, NT25-> NT23 NT28. So no terminals.\n\n- NT5: NT5 -> 't41', NT5-> 't3' and 't' etc. Wait, looking:\n\nLooking more closely:\n\n- NT2: 't54' (I think). For example, NT2's rules include 't54', which is 't5' followed by 4? No, in the lines, for NT2: \"NT2 -> NT15 NT18\", and \"NT22 -> NT23 NT27\", etc. Wait, looking for lines where NT... directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to go through each NT rule and note if any of them produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n1. NT21: No terminals; always produces non-terminals.\n\n2. NT25: No terminals.\n\n3. NT3: NT3 -> NT20 NT13, NT3 -> 't7'. Ah, so NT3 produces 't7' and something else.\n\n4. NT28: NT28-> NT11 NT3, NT28-> NT11 NT3 again? Wait, looking:\n\nNT28's rules:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3, NT28-> NT11 NT3? Wait, no. Let me check the lines:\n\nLine starting with NT28: \"NT28 -> NT11 NT3\", then later \"NT28 -> NT27 NT0\". So two rules: one gives NT11 and NT3, and another gives NT27 and NT0.\n\nSo NT28-> NT11 NT3 would be a production that produces two non-terminals unless NT11 or NT3 produce a terminal.\n\nWait, NT3 does produce a terminal: 't7' as we saw earlier.\n\nSo NT28 can eventually produce 't7' via NT3->'t7'.\n\nSimilarly, NT11: Let's see what NT11 produces.

{"custom_id":"request-337","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, but the string is quite long with many tokens. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a way to structure CFGs where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps simplify parsing and makes certain analyses easier.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the rules are in the form of two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT21 NT28, which fits the S \u2192 NTNT rule. There are a few rules where a terminal is present, like NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, but that seems a bit odd because in CNF, productions should either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. Wait, no\u2014CNF allows production rules like A \u2192 a, so that's acceptable. However, I notice that the grammar has some mixed rules, like NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7 and others. So it seems consistent with CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t38 t8 t7 t38 t32 t66 t40 t40 t43 t23 t43 t10 t68 t75 t49 t49 t70 t0`. Let me break it down into tokens: each token is a component like t38, t8, etc.\n\nMy task is to see if this string is generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, and the string is a series of terminals, it makes sense to model this as a parsing problem where the grammar can derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which branches into NT21 NT28, NT21 NT32, or NT20 NT25. So the first step is to look at the first few tokens to see which branches are possible.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t38. So let's see how t38 can be generated. Let me scan the grammar rules for t38. Scanning through all the production rules, I see that several non-terminals have rules that result in t38. For example, NT7 \u2192 t84, but not t38. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the rules provided are a lot. Looking for t38, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t14\n- NT34 \u2192 t30 or t14\n- Wait, in the last part of the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 t52 or t56, but not t38. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan more carefully. Oh, I see: \n\nLooking at the grammar part:\n\nRTs for t38: I don't immediately see any production that directly gives t38. Wait, let me scan the last few lines:\n\nLooking for 't38', I don't see any production rules directly giving t38 as the result. So maybe t38 is a terminal that comes from some non-terminal. But from the rules, perhaps I need to see which non-terminals can derive t38.\n\nWait, perhaps looking deeper, maybe t38 is part of a larger production. Let's see, maybe the way the grammar is structured, t38 might be part of a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps S can generate a sequence that leads to t38. Let me think: starting from S, which can go to NT21 NT28, NT21 NT32, or NT20 NT25. Let's look at the start symbol S, so perhaps S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nNow, the first token is t38. Let's see what NT21 and NT28 can generate. NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6, and NT28 \u2192 NT50.\n\nWait, that might not help directly. Perhaps I should approach this differently. Alternatively, maybe t38 is generated from a chain of productions starting from a non-terminal that can directly or indirectly produce t38.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree from the string and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nAnother approach is to represent the string as a sequence of steps where each step produces the current token based on the grammar's rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step consumes two symbols or a terminal.\n\nWait, no: in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals (like A \u2192 BC) or a terminal (A \u2192 a). So when parsing, at each step, a production can consume one or two symbols. But in the way of table-driven parsers like CYK, it's about whether the string can be divided into parts that fit the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can model the grammar as a set of terminal and non-terminal symbols, and try to see if the string can be broken down into sequences that match the rules.\n\nWait, I think a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but since doing CYK manually is time-consuming, perhaps I can find patterns in the string that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's look at the string structure:\n\nt38 t8 t7 t38 t32 t66 t40 t40 t43 t23 t43 t10 t68 t75 t49 t49 t70 t0\n\nSo it's 18 tokens. Let's try to see how these can be broken down.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial t38, perhaps it's the result of a rule involving a non-terminal that can produce t38. Let me scan the grammar for rules that generate t38.\n\nWait, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces t38. For example, looking through the rules, I don't see NT[?]. produce t38. So perhaps the parsing needs to go deeper, involving multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is generated through a chain. Let's check the rules for non-terminals that can lead to t38.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and see where they can lead.\n\nLooking for production rules:\n\n- NT21: goes to NT26 NT6 or NT6 NT0.\n- NT7: goes to t8 or t7?\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT16 NT24 or NT27 NT1.\n\nSo that's two possibilities for NT7. But none of these directly produce t38.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the rule for NT8: NT8 \u2192 NT27 NT6 or NT16 NT10 or NT29 NT24 or NT8 NT11.\n\nHmm, again, no t38.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead think about the possible paths that can generate the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should focus on the fact that in CNF, each production splits into two parts, so each step in parsing reduces the string by two symbols.\n\nStarting from the beginning, t38 is the first token. So the first part must be generated by some rule that emits t38 or leads to it. Since none of the directly written rules produce t38, I must look into which non-terminals can be split into parts that can generate the initial t38.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: I can represent the string as a list of letters and see if it can be built by applying the grammar's rules. Let's list all the letters:\n\nt38, t8, t7, t38, t32, t66, t40, t40, t43, t23, t43, t10, t68, t75, t49, t49, t70, t0.\n\nI'll try to construct possible sequences.\n\nLooking at the string, the first step is t38. Perhaps t38 is the result of a production where a non-terminal A is split into X and Y, and X produces t38 and Y produces something else? But if the string starts with t38, that would require A \u2192 t38 B, but in CNF, A can only produce BC or a terminal. However, from the grammar, in the given rules, non-terminals only produce terminals or two non-terminals. So I'm trying to see if t38 is a terminal or comes from some non-terminal that is built from other non-terminals that produce t38. But I don't see any non-terminals in the rules that directly produce t38.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've missed something.\n\nWait, let's check all rules. For example, NT17 \u2192 t14, but that doesn't help. Looking for t38 in the left-hand sides: I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce t38. So perhaps t38 must be produced through a chain starting from a non-terminal that is connected via other rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string consists of multiple steps that consume symbols two at a time, each time splitting into two parts"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t43 t71 t41 t50 t40 t61 t52 t52 t23 t49 t36 t25 t61 t8 t84 t70 t31 t71 t16\". \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires all productions to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to be in CNF because all the left-hand sides (LHS) of the productions are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) consist of two non-terminals or a terminal followed by another non-terminal? Wait, no. Wait, in CNF, RHS can only be two non-terminals. Hmm, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, S \u2192 NT21 NT28. Each production is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal? Wait no, some seem to have terminals directly after the non-terminal. For instance, NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27. Wait, no, all the RHS are either two non-terminals or perhaps a terminal followed by a non-terminal? Wait, no, I think in the grammar provided, all RHS seem to be two non-terminals; for example, NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20. Wait, no, NT3 \u2192 NT20 NT13. So maybe the initial productions are S \u2192 NT21 NT28, which are non-terminals, so okay. But some productions have terminals, like NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27. Wait, NT23 is a non-terminal, right, so its RHS is two non-terminals again.\n\nWait, no, looking again: the grammar has productions like S \u2192 NT21 NT28, which is non-terminals. Then NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29, which is also non-terminals. But wait, other productions like NT25 \u2192 NT5 NT13, same thing. Wait, but is there any production with a terminal as part of the RHS? Looking through the list, yes, some RHS have an 'a' symbol. For example, a production like NT7 \u2192 NT16 NT24 is okay, but something like NT17 \u2192 t14. Oh wait, in the productions, I see some like NT17 \u2192 't14', which is a terminal symbol. That makes sense because in the grammar, non-terminals can produce terminals.\n\nSo, I think the grammar is in CNF because all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nNext, I need to parse the given string using this grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's suitable for the CYK algorithm. But parsing by hand might be a bit time-consuming, so I'll try to approach it step by step.\n\nThe string is: t43 t71 t41 t50 t40 t61 t52 t52 t23 t49 t36 t25 t61 t8 t84 t70 t31 t71 t16.\n\nI should note that all these terminal symbols are present in the grammar. For example, t43 is derived from NT33, I think, because NT33 \u2192 NT7 NT22, and NT7 \u2192 NT16 NT24, and so on until it becomes terminals. So, I need to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree by working backward from the string to see if it can be formed by the grammar.\n\nLet's first list all the symbols in the string and see their possible non-terminals they could come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each terminal symbol corresponds to a specific production. For example, t2 is NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18, which later breaks down to terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to consider each symbol and see which non-terminals could produce it. Then, check if the entire string can be built step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm is the systematic way. Let's try to set up a table for the CYK algorithm.\n\nThe steps for CYK are:\n\n1. Initialize a table with rows as the symbols of the string and columns as indices from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of the string.\n\n2. For each symbol, find all possible non-terminals that can produce it, based on the grammar.\n\n3. For each position in the string, fill in the possible non-terminals that can produce the substring from that position.\n\n4. Finally, check if S (the start symbol) is in the last cell of the diagonal, which would indicate a derivation is possible.\n\nGiven the string is 21 symbols long, the CYK table would be 21x21. That's quite big, but let's try to do it for each symbol.\n\nAlternatively, since the string starts with t43, I'll look for which non-terminal can produce t43. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through, I see that NT33 \u2192 NT7 NT22. Then, NT7 \u2192 NT16 NT24, and NT22 \u2192 NT4 NT0, etc. Let's see if any production leads directly to t43. Hmm, looking through, I don't see any direct production of t43. All seem to go through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps t43 is a result of a production like NT43 \u2192 ... well, but in the given grammar, there's no NT43. The highest I see is NT55 or something? Wait, no, in the list, the non-terminals go up to NT56 but let me check. Looking through the list, the highest NT number is NT56. But none have t43.\n\nWait, looking again, I think in the productions the non-terminals beyond NTS have productions like NT34 \u2192 NT16 NT1, and so on. Wait, the terminal symbols go up to t71, t61, etc. I'm confused. Maybe t43 is part of a non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string given is a series of terminals like t43, t71, etc. So the question is, does the grammar generate this string, which is essentially a string of these terminals.\n\nI think perhaps I should list all the rules that produce these terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 t49 could be a rule? Wait, wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT43 \u2192 NT13 NT32. Wait, no, I don't see any production for t43. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me see: Looking through the productions, I see NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27. So, that's two non-terminals. For t43, I don't see a production of NTsomething \u2192 t43. So maybe t43 is not directly a terminal but is a non-terminal, but wait, in the grammar, all terminals are just letters like t, but some have numbers following.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me re-express the productions more clearly. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27 means NT23 is followed by NT22 and NT27. But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the symbols like 't43' are derived from NTs that have productions ending in t43.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any production that produces a terminal starting with 't' followed by numbers, like t43. Looking through the productions:\n\nYes, I see NT34 \u2192 NT16 NT1. So that's two non-terminals.\n\nAnother production is NT14 \u2192 NT65, which is another terminal? Wait, no, NT14 is a non-terminal, and NT65 is another production. Looking again, some non-terminals are mapped to terminals. For example, NT25 \u2192 NT5 NT13, which are non-terminals. Wait, I'm not seeing any production that directly maps to a terminal like t43.\n\nHmm, maybe t43 comes from a chain of productions. For example:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT7 NT22 (from the grammar, though I'm not sure if that's correct; looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, looking at the production NT32 \u2192 NT28 NT18, but where is NT33?\n\nWait, wait, I think I'm making a mistake because in the provided grammar, there are many rules, but I need to check which non-terminals have productions that lead to 't43'.\n\nWait, maybe 't43' comes from NT43. Looking at the list, I don't see an NT43. The highest I see is NT56.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

{"custom_id":"request-364","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string to evaluate is `t50 t25 t31 t84 t23 t60 t56 t38 t16 t17 t70 t36 t22 t65 t66 t69 t25 t56 t14`.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, a grammar is structured such that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the base case where a terminal can produce itself or a terminal string. Since some of the rules in the given grammar seem to produce terminals (like \u2018t28\u2019, etc.), but I think in this case, each production is correctly in CNF, with the exception that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that some non-terminals like NT2, NT6, NT10, etc., produce terminals directly. For example, NT5 \u2192 't41', etc. So, the idea is that when a non-terminal rule produces terminals, that's the end of that path in the parse tree.\n\nThe string provided consists of a number of 't' symbols with numbers, which suggests that each 't' is a terminal in the grammar. The first step is to parse the string from left to right, starting from the start symbol S. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, there are three production rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nI need to see if the string can be derived from any of these. Let's go through each possibility.\n\nFirst option: S \u2192 NT21 NT28. If this is the first production, then the first two symbols of the string should correspond to the first symbol of NT21 and NT28. Let's see what NT21 and NT28 produce. \n\nFrom the grammar, NT21 has several productions:\n- NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29\n- NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n- NT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24\n- NT21 \u2192 NT19 NT26\n\nI also see that NT28 has:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT22\n- NT28 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- NT28 \u2192 NT5 NT28\n- NT28 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let's first look at the string and see if the first part matches any of these.\n\nThe string starts with t50. Let me check the productions of NT21 and NT28 to see if they can produce t50.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions, none of them directly produce a terminal, except for the right-hand sides, which are combinations of non-terminals. So NT21 can't directly produce a terminal like t50. Hmm, that might be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, NT21 has a production NT21 \u2192 't28', but actually, in the grammar provided, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 't14', NT3 \u2192 't31', etc. So let me see if NT21 or NT28 have a production that includes 't50'.\n\nLooking at NT21 \u2192 NT28 could be part of the production, but that doesn't directly give a terminal. Wait, no, NT28's productions include t50 via NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0, but I don't see t50 in there. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I think I might have misinterpreted the grammar. Each rule is written as something like NT17 \u2192 't14', which suggests that NT17 directly produces the terminal 't14'. Similarly, other non-terminals produce other terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0. But wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT28's first production is NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, which leads to NT11 and NT3. NT11's production is NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13. NT25 \u2192 NT23 NT28. Hmm, perhaps the string is constructed through a series of such rules.\n\nBut the string starts with t50, so perhaps the initial symbol S must generate this through some path. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the productions may chain off into the base cases (terminals).\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken down step by step. Let's take the entire string and see if it can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nBut before I dive into parsing, I think it's better to map out all the possible terminals and non-terminals that can produce them. The string consists of several t's with numbers, so let's see which non-terminals have productions that include these t's.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'\n- NT17 \u2192 't14', 't49'\n- NT3 \u2192 't31', 't7', 't6', etc.\n- NT14 \u2192 't65', 't51', etc.\n- NT33 \u2192 't49', 't77', etc.\n- NT25 \u2192 't77', 't56', etc.\n- NT15 \u2192 't68', etc.\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to list all the terminals and their corresponding productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to see if the string can be derived by applying the productions rule by rule.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each terminal in the string can be reached through a valid derivation from the start symbol. But this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated by the grammar because all the t's correspond to some rule in the grammar. For instance, t50 is produced by NT28 \u2192 't50' look for that. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT28 \u2192 't50' as a production: look for NT28 \u2192 't50' in the rules. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking back, the grammar seems to have some lines where a non-terminal is followed by an arrow and a 't' symbol or a combination. But in the given grammar, I don't see any terminal symbols other than what's written in quotes. Wait, no, looking at the grammar as presented, I don't see any t symbols, except perhaps in later rules. Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar is as follows:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\nNT21 -> NT32 NT29\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\nNT21 -> NT21 NT24\nNT21 -> NT19 NT26\nNT0 -> NT10 NT27\n... and so on.\nLooking at the non-terminals and their productions, I don't see any non-terminals producing a 't' directly except in the case where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, in the provided grammar, there's a line: NT17 \u2192 't14'. That means NT17 can produce 't14' directly. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 't31', etc. So, the terminals in the string are the ones that appear in these production rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t50 t25 t31 t84 t23 t60 t56 t38 t16 t17 t70 t36 t22 t65 t66 t69 t25 t56 t14.\n\nThese are all lowercase t's followed by numbers. I need to check if each of these t's can be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I can check which non-terminals produce these t's.\n\nFor example:\n- t50: does any non-terminal have a rule that includes 't50' on the right-hand side? Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see any. Wait, but in the grammar, there's a production NT5 \u2192 't41', NT25 \u2192 't77', etc. Hmm, maybe 't50' is being produced by NT28. Wait, looking at NT28's productions:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT22\nNT28 \u2192 NT25 NT13\nNT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT5 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-379","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that seems a bit complex for me, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's given. The grammar is provided in a bunch of rules, each starting with a symbol (like S, NT2, etc.) and producing two other symbols. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production on the left is replaced by two non-terminals or two terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces: `t61 t50 t65 t56 t56 t0 t38 t61 t16 t70 t75 t60 t7 t14 t3 t32 t38 t25 t28 t71`. My job is to check whether this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that some symbols (like t61, t50, etc.) are terminals, while others (like S, NT2, etc.) are non-terminals. My approach will be to see if the string can be broken down according to these rules starting from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the string: `t61 t50 t65 t56 t56 t0 t38 t61 t16 t70 t75 t60 t7 t14 t3 t32 t38 t25 t28 t71`\n\nI should check each terminal and see if it matches any production rule that ends exactly with that terminal. Looking at the grammar rules, for example:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't61'\n- NT10 \u2192 't32'\n- NT16 \u2192 't6'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT7 \u2192 't3'\n- etc.\n\nSo, let's go through the string step by step.\n\n1. The first symbol is t61. Looking at the rules, NT0 \u2192 't61', so the entire string must derive from S by eventually reducing to NT0 \u2192 't61' at the end. That means the last part of the string should be t61, which it is. So, t61 is the terminal for NT0.\n\n2. Now, the rest of the string before t61 is `t61 t50 t65 t56 t56 t0 t38 t61 t16 t70 t75 t60 t7 t14 t3 t32 t38 t25 t28 t71`. Wait, no, actually, t61 is the last symbol, so the rest is before it. So the string is a sequence of symbols generating down to t61. So I need to see if each pair of symbols is compatible with the grammar rules.\n\n3. Alternatively, perhaps I should build a parse tree from the start symbol S, trying to reach the given string.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each part of the string can be derived from the grammar by using the rules.\n\nBut given the complexity, another approach is to check if the string can be split into productions that lead to the given terminal string.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is given, perhaps I can trace each symbol back to see if they can reduce to terminals or non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a step-by-step reduction approach would work. Let me think about the possible derivations.\n\nWait, starting from S:\n\nS can produce NT2 NT28 or NT32 NT14 or NT20 NT25.\n\nLet's take the first part of the string: t61 t50 t65 t56 t56 t0 t38 t61 t16 t70 t75 t60 t7 t14 t3 t32 t38 t25 t28 t71.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should try to match the string to possible derivations.\n\nGiven the start symbol S, which can split into two parts. Let's consider each possibility:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT2 NT28\n\nThen, the string should derive a sequence that starts with NT2 followed by NT28.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t61, t50, etc. Wait, t61 is the final symbol, so perhaps that's the end of the derivation. Let me see:\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think about each production step by step.\n\nAn alternative approach: Each production is of two symbols, so perhaps the string has to be split into 18 symbols, meaning 17 splits. But that seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, actually, the string length is 20 symbols, so the parse would require 19 productions. But perhaps instead, since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation depth would be logarithmic, but perhaps for a string of length 20, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using dynamic programming or memoization, but that might be too involved.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to check possible pairs that can derive to the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can note that many non-terminals produce two terminals. For example, NT0 \u2192 't61', which is the last symbol, so the last part of the string must come from NT0.\n\nSo let's see if the last part of the string can be t71, but no, the last is t71 \u2192 NT15 \u2192 't71' (from NT15 \u2192 't71'). Hmm, wait, no, the last symbol is t71, which corresponds to NT15 or another rule. Let's see.\n\nWait, the last symbol is t71, which is directly part of the production NT15 \u2192 't71'.\n\nSo, the string ends with t71, which is 't71' from NT15.\n\nSo, perhaps the last two symbols before t71 are the parents of NT15.\n\nLooking at the string, before t71, the symbols are ... t7 t14 t3 t32 t38 t25 t28 t71.\n\nWait, let's see: The last few symbols are: t7,14,3,32,38,25,28,71.\n\nWait, let me try to parse this from the end.\n\nI think it's better to start at the beginning and see if the string can be broken down as per the grammar.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT2 NT28.\n\nSo, the first part would be NT2 and then NT28. Let's see if that can be matched.\n\nLooking at the string: starts with t61, which is 't61' from NT0. But S \u2192 NT2 NT28, so S is producing two non-terminals. So, the first t61 would have to come from NT2, and the rest from NT28.\n\nWait, no. Because S \u2192 NT2 NT28, so the entire string would be the result of NT2 and NT28. So, perhaps the first part is NT2 which generates a substring up to a certain point, and then NT28 generates the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making this too complicated. Another approach is to list all the production rules that result in terminals and see if the string can be matched.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I can see that many non-terminals produce terminal pairs. For example:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT32 NT6, which in turn may produce terminals, but perhaps a better approach is to list possible pairs.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the ones that result in two terminals are:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't32'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't61'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't32'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't41'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't14'\n\nWait, some of these might be useful. Let's try to find if any of these produce a part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if any symbol can be directly matched. For example, the last symbol is t71, which is matched by NT15 \u2192 't71'. So, perhaps the last part comes from NT15, which is generated by a production that may split into two.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there a rule for NT15?\n\nYes, looking at the rules: NT15 \u2192 't71' directly.\n\nWait, that's a good point. NT15 produces 't71' directly. So, the last symbol is t71, which would come from NT15. But NT15's production is just a terminal, which means in the derivation, when you have NT15, it can only directly produce a single symbol 't71'. Thus, the last symbol must be t71. So, the previous part must be producing NT15's parent.\n\nWait, but if S is the start symbol, and S \u2192 NT2 NT28, then S would be splitting into two, so the string would be the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string starts with \"t3\" and ends with \"t60\", so I'll need to see if each \"t\" corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some symbols like NT2, NT3, etc., are non-terminals because they have productions (like S -> NT21 NT28). On the other hand, some others, like 't28', are terminals because they have direct rules (NT17 -> 't14'). Wait, actually, in the rules, I see lines like NT17 -> 't14', so 't14' is a terminal.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, some lines have terminals like 't28', 't14', etc. So these are terminal symbols, and others are non-terminals that need to be expanded further. \n\nThe string starts with \"t3\". I need to check if \"t3\" is present as a terminal in any production. From the grammar, let's see: some NT3 -> something. Yes, in the rules, I see NT3 -> 't31' and NT3 -> 't7'. But wait, \"t3\" isn't present as a terminal; the only t3 appears in NT3 rules. So t3 is part of a non-terminal symbol. That might complicate things because if \"t3\" is a terminal, but the grammar doesn't have a production NT3 -> 't3', does that mean the string can't have \"t3\"?\n\nWait, no, looking again, I see that there are no lines where NT3 reduces to t3. The rules are:\n\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n\nSo the string has \"t3\", which isn't a terminal in the grammar. That might be an issue. Maybe the string is invalid because \"t3\" isn't present as a terminal in any production.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"t3\" is part of a non-terminal symbol's expansion. Hmm, looking at the grammar, the only non-terminals that might produce 't3' are those that have 't3' in their productions. From the rules, NT31 is a non-terminal that can produce 't7' and 't18'. Also, other non-terminals might have t3 in their expansions. For example, looking at the rules, NT27 -> NT11 NT4, and maybe NT4 can produce something that includes t3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is generated through a series of derivations where \"t3\" comes from a non-terminal. Wait, but if \"t3\" is a terminal, it must be directly produced by a non-terminal via a rule that includes \"t3\". Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't3'. So \"t3\" cannot be produced by any production, because all the rules ending in 't' are for specific non-terminals. For example, NT3 is a non-terminal that becomes 't31' or 't5'.\n\nTherefore, the string contains \"t3\", which isn't generated by any rule in the grammar. That would mean the string cannot be generated because 't3' is not present as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe I missed a rule. Let me scan through the rules again. I see:\n\n- NT16 -> 't6'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- etc.\n\nBut I don't see any NT3 -> 't3', NT2 -> 't3', or anything else like that.

It seems to be a right-linear grammar since all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form allows productions to be A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 B, or A \u2192 a, but the given grammar seems to only have A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so it's right-linear. \n\nIn right-linear grammars, each production has a single non-terminal on the left, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. This structure typically leads to languages that are linear, but I'm not sure about the specifics here. \n\nI'm going to look at each production rule and see how they relate to the terminals in the string. The string contains a mix of a bunch of 't's with numbers, like t75, t22, etc. Looking at the productions, I can see that each rule either leads to two other rules or a terminal (for example, NT5 -> 't41'), but many terminals are more specific, like t7, t3, etc.\n\nSo, the approach is to decompose the string into the possible non-terminals step by step. Starting from the left, see if each part matches a production or can be derived from a series of productions.\n\nLet me break down the string into its tokens:\n\n1. t75\n2. t22\n3. t11\n4. t51\n5. t56\n6. t61\n7. t31\n8. t31\n9. t31\n10. t0\n11. t25\n12. t36\n13. t75\n14. t77\n15. t54\n16. t14\n17. t32\n18. t32\n19. t50\n20. t75\n21. t11\n\nLooking at these, I need to see if each can be derived from the grammar. \n\nStarting from the first token, t75. Looking at the production rules, I see that NT3 -> 't31' and NT14 -> 't65'. Also, looking at NT75, wait, no NT75 in the productions. Wait, let me check the rules again. Scanning through all the productions, I don't see any rule leading to t75 directly. Instead, I see rules like NT33 -> 't49', NT29 -> 't27', etc. Hmm, perhaps I missed something. Wait, maybe the numbers correspond to something else. Alternatively, perhaps 't75' is a single production, but I don't see any such. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. \n\nWait, the productions go up to NT40, NT50, etc., but not all 't's are directly produced. Let's search for 't75' in the productions. \n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 -> 't77'\n- NT32 -> 't23'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT27 -> 't9', but that's 't9', not 75\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT19 -> 't32'\n- NT22 -> 't22' (is it nt22 -> t22 or what? Wait, looking at the rules, one of the rules is NT22 -> 't22', yes. So t22 is directly a terminal. Similarly, looking for 't75', it's produced by NT31, correct.\n\nWait, so NT31 -> 't75' is a production in the grammar. Good. So the first token t75 can be produced by NT31.\n\nThen, the second token t22 is directly produced by NT22. So that's straightforward.\n\nThird token t11. Looking for a production that produces t11. Scanning the rules, I see a production NT6 -> 't68', which is not 11. NT10 -> 't32', nope. NT18->'t66', NT21->'t8', nope. Wait, perhaps NT18->'t66', which is not 11. Let's see NT15->'t71', NT11 has a rule NT11 -> 't6', so that's not 11. Wait, looking again, is there a production for nt12? Yes, nt12 has two productions: nt12->nt4 nt0 and nt12->nt14. Hmm, but that doesn't produce t11. Alternatively, looking for NT11: no, NT11 is a non-terminal, but looking through the rules, I see NT6 -> 't68' and NT13 -> 't6'.

It looks like it's written with rules that generate these terminal symbols (like 't28', 't61', etc.) and non-terminal symbols (like S, NT21, etc.). The grammar's start symbol is S. The initial rule for S is S -> NT21 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, S -> NT20 NT25. So S starts with one of these three options.\n\nI notice that all the production rules are of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals. The terminal symbols are those that appear as strings, like 't41', which are terminals, meaning they can't be split further.\n\nGiven the string, it has 22 tokens (since each 't' is a separate token, and I see 22 t's separated by spaces). My job is to see if this sequence can be derived from S using the given production rules.\n\nLet me map the string to the sequence:\n\n1. t41\n2. t69\n3. t68\n4. t70\n5. t6\n6. t14\n7. t25\n8. t51\n9. t66\n10. t84\n11. t7\n12. t56\n13. t11\n14. t71\n15. t0\n16. t25\n17. t7\n18. t68\n19. t32\n20. t68\n21. t36\n\nI need to find a way to break this down into the non-terminals following the grammar rules.\n\nSince S can expand into NT21 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25, let's see if the string can start with any of these.\n\nLooking at the start, the first token is t41. Let's see where t41 appears in the productions.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT33 -> 't49'\n- NT29 -> 't7'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- So, t41 is produced by NT5.\n\nWait, from NT5, it can be 't41' or via other rules. Wait, in the grammar:\n\nWait, looking again, there's a line: NT5 -> 't41', and another line: NT5 -> NT5 NT20. So NT5 can be 't41' or generate more non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 can be 't14' or via other rules.\n\nWait, but the first token is t41, which is produced by NT5. So perhaps one of the rules for NT5 is 't41'. So S might expand into NT5 generating t41, but let me see.\n\nBut wait, S's first production is NT21 and NT28. Wait, that's S -> NT21 NT28. So that's generating t21 and t28, but t21 is a non-terminal. So that's confusing because the string starts with t41, which is a terminal. So maybe I'm getting something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar's structure. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo S can expand into NT21 and NT28, which are non-terminals. Then, each NT rule can further expand into other NTs or terminals.\n\nSo for the string to start with t41, it needs to be produced by a terminal production. So perhaps NT21 can expand into a series that ends with t41, and similarly for NT28.\n\nLooking at NT21's rules:\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT29\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\nWait, wait, that's not correct. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, the production for NT21 is:\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT29\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\nWait, that's not right. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT29\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me check correctly.\n\nIn the grammar, the lines under NT21 are:\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT6\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\nWait, actually, looking again, the grammar snippet provided is a bit confusing, but I think it's correct as:\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT6\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, but regardless, let's focus. The first production for NT21 is NT32 NT6, and the second is NT6 NT0.\n\nSo then, NT21 can produce:\n\nNT32 NT6 or NT6 NT0.\n\nSimilarly, NT32 has a production: NT32 -> NT28 NT18.\n\nSo let's try to see how that would expand.\n\nWait, but the first token is t41, which comes from NT5. So perhaps the expansion is from a path where NT5 is used somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if the string can be broken down into applicable rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t41, which comes from NT5, so perhaps S expands into NT5 generating t41. But how?\n\nWait, S is the start symbol and cannot directly produce a terminal. Wait, no, because S's rules are all non-terminals. So S must generate two non-terminals, and those non-terminals must eventually produce the terminals in the string.\n\nSo S expands into, say, NT21 and NT28. Then each of these non-terminals must produce a sequence that builds up to the required tokens.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t41, which is a terminal, so that must come from one of the non-terminals in the expansion.\n\nSo perhaps S -> NT5 NT14, which is another option for S.\n\nWait, but looking at the S rules, it's S -> NT21 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, S -> NT20 NT25. So the initial S can only go into those three options. So the first two tokens are from NT21 and NT28, or NT32 and NT14, or NT20 and NT25.\n\nGiven that the first token is t41, let's see which NTs can produce t41.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT5 can produce 't41' as one of its productions.\n\nSo perhaps S is expanding into NT32 and NT14, where NT32 can produce t41.\n\nWait, but NT32's productions are:\n\nNT32 -> NT28 NT18\nAlso, NT28 can produce NT11 and NT3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's too involved. Let me try to think about the structure.\n\nThe string is 22 tokens long. Since in each expansion of NT into two NTs, the number of tokens increases by one (from 1 non-terminal -> 2, leading to a tree that can generate as many leaves as the depth plus one), but in this case, the string has 22 tokens, so perhaps the derivation is quite deep.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree is a straight left expansion, building a chain of non-terminals that then each expand into a terminal.\n\nWait, but let's see: for example, S -> NT5 NT14. Then, each of these NTs could expand into other NTs until the terminals are reached.\n\nLooking at NT5: NT5 -> 't41' or NT5 NT20.\n\nIf NT5 expands to 't41' (a terminal), then that's that. Similarly, if NT14 expands to 't14' or other NTs.\n\nWait, yes, in the S rule, S can be NT32 NT14. So if NT32 can produce 't41' and NT14 can produce 't14', then the string starts with t41 t14, etc.\n\nWait, but in our string, the first token is t41 and second is t69, not t14. So that would suggest that maybe S is expanding"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-421","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string we have is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are terminals. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar structure, S has three main productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must be a concatenation of two parts from these options. The given string is `t41 t43 t6 t7 t51 t31 t60 t70 t49 t16 t8 t23 t22 t28 t66 t12 t41 t43 t12 t17 t50 t30`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with t41. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT17 \u2192 't14' and NT5 \u2192 't41'. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT5 has two productions: NT5 \u2192 't41' and NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20. So t41 can only come directly from NT5. Also, NT17 \u2192 't14', and looking at the productions, I see that S can have NT17 as part of the breakdown, but that's not relevant here since the string starts with t41.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. However, the string is quite long, so maybe breaking it down into parts that fit the grammar's structures would help.\n\nLet me consider the possible ways the string could be split into two parts, each part being the result of applying one of S's productions.\n\nOption 1: The string is the concatenation of two parts, each part being from S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, or S \u2192 NT20 NT25.\n\nSo, let's say the first part is a string generated by one of these and the second part by another. But wait, the string is a entire sequence; maybe it's a single derivation from S, not a concatenation of two different derivations. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into two substrings, each of which is generated by one of the productions for S. For example, the first part could be from S \u2192 NT21 NT28, and the second from S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and so on.\n\nBut looking at the string, let me check if any of the non-terminals can directly derive a substring of t's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals have terminal productions. For example, NT5 \u2192 't41', NT17 \u2192 't14', NT0 \u2192 't61', etc. So, if I can trace back from the string to a combination of these, that might work.\n\nLet me try to find possible non-terminals that can produce the initial 't41'. From the grammar, NT5 can produce 't41' directly. So, if the first token 't41' comes from NT5, then the rest of the string must form a part after it. Wait, not exactly, because each production of S has two parts. So perhaps each production is a sub-derivation, so the string is built by choosing one production for each part of the S \u2192 NT X NT Y.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to break the string into pairs of terminal symbols that make sense as a production.\n\nLooking at the string: t41 t43 t6 t7 t51 t31 t60 t70 t49 t16 t8 t23 t22 t28 t66 t12 t41 t43 t12 t17 t50 t30.\n\nI need to split this into chunks that match the grammar's productions. Let's try to find a possible split.\n\nLet me see if I can find a production that starts with t41. Wait, t41 is only produced by NT5, and in the grammar, NT5 has a production that directly gives 't41' and another that does NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20. But that's probably not useful unless the entire string is made of t41s, which it isn't.\n\nLooking further, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string might be a direct concatenation of the non-terminal expansions. Let's try to see if each part of the string can be matched by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as parsing using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S and trying to match the string.\n\nSo, the initial string is 't41 t43 t6 t7 t51 t31 t60 t70 t49 t16 t8 t23 t22 t28 t66 t12 t41 t43 t12 t17 t50 t30'.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Let's consider the productions for S again:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo, the first step is to split the string into two parts, each starting with one of NT21, NT32, or NT20.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't41'. Let's see which non-terminals can start with 't41'.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't41'.\nNT17 \u2192 't14'.\nNT0 \u2192 't61'.\nNT10 \u2192 't32'.\nNT16 \u2192 't6'.\nNT7 \u2192 't3'.\nNT18 \u2192 't66'.\nNT0 \u2192 't17'.\nNT26 \u2192 't28'.\nNT18 \u2192 't49'.\nNT3 \u2192 't31'.\nNT14 \u2192 't65'.\nNT3 \u2192 't7'.\nNT6 \u2192 't68'.\nNT13 \u2192 't6'.\nNT24 \u2192 't22'.\nNT14 \u2192 't51'.\nNT10 \u2192 't0'.\nNT28 \u2192 't50'.\nNT5 \u2192 't41'.\nNT25 \u2192 't77'.\nNT15 \u2192 't6'.\nNT23 \u2192 't43'.\nNT21 \u2192 't8'.\nNT26 \u2192 't71'.\nNT18 \u2192 't36'.\nNT11 \u2192 't6'.\nNT18 \u2192 't70'.\nNT34 \u2192 't30'.\nNT34 \u2192 't14'.\nNT7 \u2192 't84'.\nNT12 \u2192 't16'.\nNT12 \u2192 't14'.\nNT3 \u2192 't12'.\nNT16 \u2192 't10'.\nNT19 \u2192 't25'.\nNT33 \u2192 't49'.\nNT15 \u2192 't28'.\nNT33 \u2192 't60'.\nNT15 \u2192 't34'.\nNT24 \u2192 't71'.\nNT14 \u2192 't84'.\nNT32 \u2192 't54'.\nNT21 \u2192 't77'.\nNT15 \u2192 't68'.\nNT23 \u2192 't52'.\nNT22 \u2192 't8'.\nNT23 \u2192 't56'.\nNT13 \u2192 't71'.\nNT5 \u2192 't84'.\nNT19 \u2192 't22'.\nNT2 \u2192 't23'.\nNT17 \u2192 't49'.\nNT23 \u2192 't40'.\nNT2 \u2192 't38'.\nNT21 \u2192 't69'.\nNT31 \u2192 't75'.\nNT11 \u2192 't14'.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that starts with 't41', the possible non-terminals are NT5 (appears twice) and NT17 (which produces 't14').\n\nSo, if the first token is 't41', maybe it comes from NT5. Then, the rest of the string should be derived from the production that starts with NT21, NT32, or NT20, since S's production is two non-terminals.\n\nLet me try this approach. Suppose the string starts with NT5 (t41) and the second part comes from another non-terminal that starts with the next token, which is t43.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that starts with t43:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 t43. So perhaps the second part starts with NT23.\n\nSo, the first part is NT5 \u2192 t41, and the second part is NT23, which starts with t43.\n\nNow, looking at NT23's productions. Let's see what NT23 can derive.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT23 appears as:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT28 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-424","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string to check is a series of tokens: `t8 t17 t51 t40 t0 t68 t7 t70 t32 t31 t31 t56 t84 t84 t34 t23 t54 t71 t40 t30 t49 t69`.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the string is generated by applying these productions until all symbols are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which immediately expands into one of three possibilities: NT2 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25. Each of these non-terminals then expand further according to the given productions.\n\nThe string to check seems to be a sequence of terminal symbols. Each symbol is prefixed with a 't', which probably indicates terminal tokens, so we can ignore those and focus on the numbers as the terminal sequence.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using either a top-down or bottom-up approach. Since the grammar is inCNF, top-down parsing with a recursive descent parser would be suitable. However, manually doing this step by step might be tedious, so I need to find a way to map each symbol in the string to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and their possible productions:\n\nS -> NT2 NT28, NT32 NT14, NT20 NT25\n\nNT2:\n- NT15 NT18\n- NT5 NT20\n- NT24 NT16\n\nNT24:\n- NT32 NT23\n\nNT16:\n- NT18 NT6\n- NT29 NT7\n- NT32 NT0\n\nNT6:\n- NT10 NT31\n- NT0 NT5\n\nNT10:\n- NT25 NT13\n- NT33 NT24\n- NT21 NT21\n- NT0 NT27\n- NT16 NT19\n- NT8 NT17\n\nNT5:\n- NT3 NT32\n- NT5 NT20\n\nNT17:\n- NT4 NT8\n- NT28 NT14\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT17 has two productions: NT4 NT8 and NT28 NT14. So in the initial S productions, when expanding S, perhaps one of the branches leads to NT17, which then expands into these options.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t8. So the first step after S would have to produce a t8 as one of the terminals. But in the grammar's S productions, each option starts with NT2, NT32, or NT20, except that these NTs themselves have their own productions.\n\nNow, looking at the initial productions:\n\nS expands into NT2 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25.\n\nSo each of these non-terminals will produce two terminals or more.\n\nWait, but looking at the list, for example, NT32 can expand into NT5 NT20, which then can expand further. But I'm looking for the terminals, so I need to see if any of the NTs directly produce terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the NT definitions, some of them end up with productions that eventually produce terminal strings. For example:\n\nNT32 can expand into NT1 NT23. Wait, but NT1 might have more expansions, but some NTs expand into terminals.\n\nLet me check each NT to see if they can produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT2 --> [NT15 NT18, NT5 NT20, NT24 NT16]\nNo terminals here.\n\nNT24 --> [NT32 NT23] Still non-terminals.\n\nNT16 --> [NT18 NT6, NT29 NT7, NT32 NT0]\nStill non-terminals.\n\nNT6 --> [NT10 NT31, NT0 NT5]\nNon-terminals.\n\nNT10 --> [NT25 NT13, NT33 NT24, NT21 NT21, NT0 NT27, NT16 NT19, NT8 NT17]\nHmm, NT10 can expand into NT8 and NT17, which in turn can produce terminals.\n\nNT8 --> [NT27 NT6, NT16 NT10]\nStill non-terminals.\n\nNT17 --> [NT4 NT8, NT28 NT14]\nNon-terminals, but perhaps in one of their expansions, they might reach terminals. But looking through the grammar, I don't see NT17 expanding into a terminal. So NT17 only goes further into non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 --> [NT29 NT10, NT2 NT23], non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT29: productions include NT7 NT2, NT27 NT22, NT7 --> NT27 NT1, etc. Again, many non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for any NTs that can directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking back, some NTs might have productions with only terminals. Wait, for example, looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT18 -> 't66' (a terminal) and NT27 -> 't71', etc.\n\nWait, the 't's are terminals, so in the list, NT18 has a production NT18 -> 't66' and NT27 -> 't71', etc.\n\nSo, there are NTs that produce individual terminals. So, in order to produce the given string, the parser must follow a path that reduces to these terminals.\n\nGiven that, let's see: the string starts with t8, which is the first token. Looking at the grammar, the first step must be one of NT2, NT32, or NT20, as part of the S expansion.\n\nLet me try to figure out how t8 can be generated. From the grammar, any of the S's options are:\n\n1. NT2 NT28\n2. NT32 NT14\n3. NT20 NT25\n\nSo, the first production is NT2 and NT28. Let's see what NT28 produces.\n\nLooking at NT28:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\nThen, NT11 can produce NT25 NT13 or NT27 NT24, etc.\n\nLooking further, NT25's productions include NT10 NT3, etc. Not immediately helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of how t8 might be generated. The first token is t8, which can be produced by NT17 -> NT4 NT8 or NT28 NT14, but since NT17 itself isn't a terminal, it must produce further.\n\nBut wait, the production NT17 has two options: NT4 NT8 and NT28 NT14. Let me see if either of these can lead to a t.\n\nNT4 is another non-terminal, so that path might not get us to a terminal. Let's check NT4's productions.\n\nWait, looking at the NT4 definitions, NT4 --> NT3 NT20, or NT29 NT10. So still non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, looking for any NTs that have a production which directly ends in a terminal. For example, NT31 -> 't31', NT16 -> 't6', etc.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nIn the provided NT definitions, some NTs have terminal strings as their productions. For example:\n\nNT3 -> 't31' and 't7'\n\nWait, no, in the given detailed grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't31' is under NT3 -> NT20 NT13, but looking back, the detailed grammar shows:\n\nUnder NT3: NT20 NT13, and also NT5 NT7, and another production. But then, looking further down, I notice that some NTs have terminal tokens.\n\nWait, looking again through the list of productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several NTs that have terminals as their single production.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT3 -> 't31' : No, because looking at the grammar, that's in the detailed list:\n\nWait, the detailed grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\n...\nLooking through the detailed list, I see for example:\n\nNT0 -> 't61'\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\n\nNT10 -> 't32'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some terminals in the detailed grammar.\n\nWait, the user provided a very long list of grammar rules, each in the format NTx -> NTy NTz or something else. So for example, looking at the last lines:\n\nNT28 -> 't50'\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\n\nNT0 -> 't61'\n\nNT15 -> 't28'\n\nNT0 -> 't17'\n\nWait, okay, so these NTs can produce a single terminal string.\n\nFor example:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar consists of several production rules. Each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT21, NT31, etc.) can be rewritten into other symbols. The terminal symbols are marked with 't', such as t70, t40, etc., which I assume are atomic symbols.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

That's 21 tokens, each presumably derived by a single production.\n\nStarting with the top-level non-terminal, which is S. From the grammar, S can produce:\n- NT21 NT28\n- NT32 NT14\n- NT20 NT25\n\nThe string starts with t70, so I need to find which of these non-terminals can produce a terminal starting with 70.\n\nLooking at the productions that lead to S, let's check each option:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28: The start with NT21 and NT28. From the grammar, NT21 can produce several things, including 't7' (for example, NT21 \u2192 't8'). Wait, no, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the NT21 productions, I see:\n- NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n- NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24\n- NT21 \u2192 NT24 NT16\n- NT21 \u2192 't8'\n\nAh, there's a rule that NT21 \u2192 't8'. So if the string starts with t70, NT21 producing 't8' doesn't help. Wait, no, that's a problem because the string starts with t70, which isn't 't8'. So if S produces NT21 NT28, then each of those NTs would need to produce the corresponding t's. But NT21 can produce t8, but our string starts with t70, which isn't possible. So S via NT21 NT28 is unlikely.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14: Let's check NT32 and NT14. NT32 can produce 't54' and 't23' (looking through the rules), and NT14 produces 't65', 't14', etc. So looking for terminals in NT32 and NT14 that could match the start of the string. Our string starts with t70, but neither NT32 nor NT14 directly have 't70' as a terminal. Therefore, S via NT32 NT14 doesn't seem to match because neither can directly produce t70.\n\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25: So NT20 and NT25. Checking NT20: it can produce 't68' and 't11' (from the rules, NT20 \u2192 NT11 NT32 when expanded further can lead to t68, but let me check the direct replacements. Looking at NT20 rules, there's NT20 \u2192 't68' as a direct production (NT20 \u2192 NT11 NT32 where NT32 can produce t54 or t23, but wait, no, perhaps more directly, maybe NT20 has a production leading to a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT11 NT32, and both NT11 and NT32 might produce more non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps NT20 can produce a terminal like 't68' as per the rules. Scanning the given productions, I see NT25 \u2192 't68' perhaps? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the production rules, one of them is NT6 \u2192 't68', but that's NT6. So perhaps other non-terminals lead to t68. Wait, I'm looking for NT20's production that leads to a terminal. From the given rules, I don't see NT20 directly producing a terminal. The rules for NT20 show that it produces other non-terminals, so it might take multiple steps. Similarly, NT25 produces a terminal 't77' perhaps? Checking the rules, NT25 \u2192 't77' and 't32'? No, I see:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't77'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5' 'something'?\n\nWait, looking back, one of the rules for NT25 is NT25 \u2192 't77' (from \"NT25 -> t77\"), so that's a direct production. So NT25 \u2192 't77'. \n\nSo if we have S \u2192 NT20 NT25, then NT20 needs to produce t70, but looking at NT20's possible terminals, earlier I thought it might produce t68 via a production, but from the given rules, NT20 doesn't directly produce t70. Wait, perhaps NT20 can produce t70 through another path.\n\nWait, let me check all possible ways S can be formed. Since none of the options for S directly have t70 as a terminal (the first option S produces NT21 NT28, which would start with t8, not t70), the second option S produces NT32 NT14, neither of which have t70, but the third option S is NT20 NT25. NT25 can produce t77, which doesn't help, but NT20 might have a path to t70.\n\nWait, looking back, I don't see any direct production of t70 in the grammar provided, which makes me think that perhaps the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The string starts with t70, but maybe the NT20 can produce t70 through multiple expansions. For example, NT20 can produce NT11 NT32, which can further be expanded. Let me follow a possible derivation path.\n\nIf NT20 \u2192 NT11 NT32, then NT11 can produce NT25 NT13, and NT32 can be 't54' or 't23'. So then we have NT25 which can produce 't77', and NT13 can produce 't6'.\n\nBut I'm supposed to parse the string step by step. So perhaps the string's first token t70 comes from a production in the grammar, but I haven't found such a production. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding, and perhaps the given grammar has a rule that I'm missing that directly produces t70.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules provided, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t70. So that's the first red flag: no non-terminal in the given rules produces 't70' directly, so how can the string start with t70? That would mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar, so the answer would be No.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. I'll list all the production rules for NTs to see if any directly produce t70.\n\nLooking at all production rules:\n\nI see NT28 \u2192 't50', 't41', 't70' (looking at the rules, under NT28 we have:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- NT28 \u2192 NT6 NT32\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NOT0\nWait, wait, no. Actually, looking in the rules provided:\n\nI think I see that NT28's rules include 't50' and maybe 't70'? Let me go through the list.\n\nNo, wait. The rules are:\n\nLooking for any production that includes 't70':\n\nI see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't84', 't3', 't66'\n- NT15 \u2192 't6', 't51', etc.\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking again through the production rules.\n\nOh, wait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-445","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t14 t49 t34 t7 t36 t32 t60 t17 t84 t10 t14 t84 t0 t51 t32 t32 t49 t50 t77 t52 t22 t38 t61`. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to be structured in this way, with S expanding into various combinations of non-terminals, and eventually non-terminals terminating into a mix of other non-terminals and terminals (like 't' followed by numbers).\n\nThe question is whether this grammar can generate the given string. The string is a sequence of terminals, all of which are 't' followed by a number. \n\nI think the approach here is to see if the string can be broken down according to the productions. Since it's a context-free grammar, we can parse the string using a method like the CYK algorithm or by trying to find a way to split the string into the possible productions.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe a better approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be mapped to a rule that stops in the grammar, and the sequences between them can fit the non-terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the productions, the terminals seem to be assigned to non-terminals. For example, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal like 't28' or 't14', which match some of the 't' parts in the string.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, we have 't14' appearing multiple times, which matches the production NT14 \u2192 't65' and NT14 \u2192 't51' and NT14 \u2192 't14'? Wait, let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT14 \u2192 't65'\nNT14 \u2192 't51'\nNT14 \u2192 't14'\n\nWait, no. Let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7\nNT14 -> NT15 NT7\nNT14 -> NT14 NT11\n\nWait, but the terminals are separate. Wait, in the user's grammar, the first NT14 is a production to other non-terminals, but in terminal symbols, like NT2 -> 't23', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's parse the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT0 -> 't61'\nNT3 -> 't31'\nNT14 -> 't65'\nWait, no. Wait, in the given grammar, it's structured differently. Wait, the user provided a lot of rules, some of which are non-terminals producing terms like 't28' or 't14'. For example, in the beginning, NT31 is converted to 't25', and some others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a mapping of which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\nFrom the user's grammar:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nNT21 -> NT32 NT6\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\nSo S can produce sequences of non-terminals that eventually produce terms.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to create a list of all the non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\nCheck the productions:\n\nNT2 -> 't23' (from NT22 -> NT23 and others, but not directly)\nWait, no. Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking through each production rule:\n\n- S doesn't directly produce terminals, it produces non-terminals.\n\nNT12 -> NT4 NT0 (not a terminal)\nNT14 -> NT34 NT1 (not a terminal)\nWait, looking for direct productions to terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see some NTs directly produce terminals:\n\nNT0 -> 't61' (so 't61')\nNT3 -> 't31' (so 't31')\nNT4 -> 't29 NT10' (no, 't29' is a terminal? Wait, wait, let me see.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some production rules assign terminals:\n\nFor example, looking for \"NTx -> 'ty'\" where 't' followed by a number.\n\nScanning through:\n\nLooking for any rule where the RHS is t followed by a number, e.g., 't14', 't17', etc.\n\nI notice:\n\nNT2 -> 't23'\n\nYes, many NTs have such productions. Let me list all the NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT2 -> 't23'\n\nNT4 -> 't29 NT10' \u2013 no, that's a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Looking for rules where the entire RHS is a terminal. For example:\n\nNT2 -> 't23' (yes)\nNT4 -> 't29 NT10' is not, because NT10 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, some NTs produce multiple terminals? Or is it that each production is a single terminal?\n\nWait, wait. Chomsky normal form is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. But in the given grammar, most productions produce two non-terminals. Wait, let me check one of the rules:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28, which is two non-terminals.\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT26, etc. So, the only direct terminal productions must be somewhere.\n\nLooking again through the grammar, perhaps the NTs have rules where one side is a terminal.\n\nFor example, in the user's grammar, I notice:\n\nNT0 -> 't61' \u2013 that's a direct terminal production.\n\nSimilarly, NT15 -> 't6' (I think).

Let's see.\n\nWait, in the grammar, it's possible that some NTs produce a terminal only in the form of 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, let's continue.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I find:\n\nNT2 -> 't23'\n\nThat's the only direct terminal production.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nLooking through all the rules again:\n\nAfter a thorough check, the only NT that directly produces a terminal is NT2 \u2192 't23'.\n\nWait, according to the user's grammar, there's only one NT producing a terminal, which is NT2.\n\nSo if that's the case, to produce the given string, which has multiple t14, t49, etc., we have to follow the productions through.\n\nWait, in that case, the string contains t34, t7, t36, which must come from somewhere.\n\nWait, but if only NT2 produces 't23', then that would mean that most other t's must come from larger productions that expand into multiple non-terminals that eventually produce other terms. But that's complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol, which can have more when terminating symbols are involved. \n\nFirst, I notice that the string consists of a series of tokens ending with 't61'. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals are converted into terminal symbols in specific productions. For instance, NT28 \u2192 t50, NT14 \u2192 t65, etc. So, I think I should map the string back to the non-terminals to see if the sequence of productions could generate this string.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't30'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT29 \u2192 t7 NT22, which means part of it could include 't7' and 't22'. Hmm, but the first token is 't30', which I don't see directly in the grammar.

Yes, I see NT22 \u2192 t71, but that's not helpful. Hmm, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Wait, looking at NT5 \u2192 t41, but how does that help? \n\nWait, maybe I should trace the string backward or use a top-down approach. Let me think: the first part is 't30 t75', so maybe that relates to NT35 or something, but looking at the grammar, it's not directly present. Wait, perhaps 't30' comes from NT28. Let me check: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3. From the string, after 't30', it's 't75'. So if I have 't30', I need to see if I can go to 't75' from there. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find where each token in the string comes from and see if it's consistent with the grammar. Let's list the tokens in order: t30, t75, t71, t51, t3, t68, t3, t11, t50, t30, t34, t34, t50, t7, t61, t32, t28, t7, t11, t71, t11, t52, t41, t70.\n\nWait, 't75' is a terminal, but looking through the grammar, I don't see a production that generates 't75'. Perhaps 't75' is part of a larger non-terminal. Let me check each production to see if any terminal is t75. Looking through all the productions, I don't see 't75' as a terminal. So maybe the string cannot be derived, hence the answer is 'No'. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that some non-terminals produce single terminals. For example, NT19 \u2192 't25', NT34 \u2192 't14', etc. But 't75' isn't listed. So if the string includes 't75', and there's no production for that, then it's impossible.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. That usually makes things a bit more straightforward.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the rules are all two-symbol productions. The key thing here is to see how the string can be derived from S using these rules.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of tokens: t14, t43, t31, t68, t28, t65, t30, t70, t6, t14, t6, t68, t66, t25, t38, t40, t23, t68, t77, t69, t70, t56, t77, t11, t11.\n\nEach token seems to correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. So, my job is to see if the string can be generated starting from S.\n\nI should probably try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar's right-hand sides. Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t14, t43, t31, etc. Let me see if these match any of the grammar productions.\n\nThe grammar S has four initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT20 NT25\nS \u2192 NT32 NT2\n\nSo S can directly derive into any of these four pairs. Let me see which of these might produce the start of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t14 and t43. Let me check if any production matches t14 t43.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see a rule NT14 \u2192 t65. Wait, no, that's part of another production. Let me search the grammar for the combination t14 t43.\n\nLooking through, I don't immediately see a production that starts with t14 and is followed by t43. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the first token is derived from S.\n\nWait, perhaps the string was built from the parse tree starting at S. Let me start by trying to see if the first two tokens can be derived from one of the rules.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: t14 and t43. So the first part is t14 t43. Let's see if any production starts with t14 and is followed by t43.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT14 has a production NT14 \u2192 t65, among others. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t14 comes from a rule like NT14 \u2192 t65, but that's not matching. Wait, perhaps the first token t14 comes from S's production.\n\nLooking at the S productions again:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n4. S \u2192 NT32 NT2\n\nSo, for example, using the second production: NT32 NT14. So maybe the overall string starts with NT32 followed by NT14, which then produce some t's.\n\nWait, let's consider the start: t14 t43. The second part might be NT43, but I don't see any production for NT43. Wait, in the grammar, is there an NT43? Let me search through the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see any NT43. Wait, perhaps the string is composed differently. Maybe t14 comes from NT14, and then t43 comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, NT43 is not present. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me see each part of the string and try to find possible rules that can generate it.\n\nBreaking down the string: t14 t43 t31 t68 t28 t65 t30 t70 t6 t14 t6 t68 t66 t25 t38 t40 t23 t68 t77 t69 t70 t56 t77 t11 t11.\n\nThis looks quite complex, but maybe I can split it into smaller parts that correspond to grammar rules.\n\nWait, another approach is to note that each token in the string must be generated by an S-derivation, so each t must come from some NT's production.\n\nLet me check each token to see which NT could produce it.\n\nFrom the grammar, let's list all the terminal productions:\n\n- S \u2192 t14 (if NT32 and NT14 are both t14)\nWait, no, NT32 and NT14 as separate symbols.

Let me see which NT can produce t14. From above, NT17 \u2192 t14. So NT17 can produce t14.\n\nSo the first token t14 could be from NT17, and the next token is t43.\n\nWait, in the grammar, any NT that can produce t43? Looking at the above, I don't see any NT with a production to t43. Hmm. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two tokens are generated from S's production.\n\nWait, S's possible productions are:\n\n1. NT21 NT28\n2. NT32 NT14\n3. NT20 NT25\n4. NT32 NT2\n\nSo if the first two tokens are t14 t43, perhaps the first token t14 is from NT14, which can produce t65, but that's not 43. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long and the tokens don't align with any of the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is needed. Since each symbol in the string must be a terminal, and each step in the derivation must replace a non-terminal with other symbols, perhaps I can think in reverse: can the string be reduced to S using the grammar"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-481","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t8 t61 t68 t17 t41 t56 t23 t56 t25 t56 t71 t51 t34 t28 t41 t49 t3 t68 t43 t84 t56 t6 t36 t12 t36` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I've been told this grammar, which includes both terminal and non-terminal symbols. My task is to determine whether this string is indeed part of the language defined by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF grammars have each production rule as either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This structure simplifies the process, so I can apply methods like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing strings in CNF.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that many non-terminals produce terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers or other 't's with numbers. For example, some rules have 't41', 't3', etc. This suggests that the grammar is generating a sequence of these terminal symbols, which I need to check.\n\nNext, I see that the given string consists of a series of these 't' symbols. My goal is to see if, starting from the start symbol S, I can derive this sequence through a series of productions.\n\nThe string starts with `t8`, so I need to find a production rule that has 't8' as its right-hand side. Looking through the grammar, I spot that NT17 can produce 't14' and 't25' (rule NT17 -> t14). Hmm, not directly t8. Let me check other rules.\n\nLooking for 't8', I see that NT11 can produce 't41'. Wait, let me check NT8: NT8 has rules like 't27' and 't10', and other combinations. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, let me approach this more methodically. Each character in the string must be produced by a production rule. Since the string has multiple 't's, I should check if each 't' can be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice a non-terminal called NT8, which has the production NT8 \u2192 NT28 NT18. Both NT28 and NT18 seem to produce other non-terminals or 't's. But where is 't8' being produced?\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any non-terminals that produce 't8' directly. Scanning the list, I notice NT17 -> t14 and t25. Hmm, that's not 't8'. Then I see NT11 -> NT25 NT13, and NT12 -> NT10 NT18. Not directly helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a combination. Let me track the 't8' in the string. The string starts with t8, so there's a production that starts with t8. Looking at the grammar, I see NT30 has a production NT30 -> NT0, which produces 't61' in some cases. Wait, maybe I'm looking elsewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: since all productions in CNF are either non-terminal pairs or single terminals, I can model this as a series of connections where each step either combines two non-terminals or appends a terminal.\n\nGiven that, for the string to be generated, it must be possible to walk through each symbol in the string by connecting the correct non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, my understanding is that each symbol corresponds to a production that is applied in a top-down fashion. So, starting from the start symbol S, each step replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't8', then the start symbol S must eventually derive 't8' through some chain of productions. I need to find a path from S to t8.\n\nLooking at the possible rules, S has three options:\n1. S -> NT21 NT28\n2. S -> NT32 NT14\n3. S -> NT20 NT25\n\nI need to see if any of these can produce the string starting with 't8'.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT21 NT28\nNT21 has multiple productions. For example, NT21 can be NT26 NT6 or NT6 NT0, etc. So NT21 could lead to a 't8' in combination with NT28, which leads to 't50'. Hmm, but the first symbol is t8, so let's check if NT21 can produce t8 with some other rule.\n\nWait, does any of NT21's productions directly produce 't8'? Looking, I don't see that. All rules of NT21 seem to combine with another non-terminal, none directly producing 't8'. So perhaps this path won't give t8 as the first symbol.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT32 NT14\nNT32's production includes rules that produce NT18 NT1 (from earlier rules) or other combinations. Wait, looking at NT32, I see NT32 can produce NT28 NT18. Let's see, NT28 can produce NT11 NT3. Then NT3 can produce NT20 NT13, etc. But how does that get to 't8'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me check for all non-terminals that have t8 in their production.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT7 produces 't3' and 't16', but nothing else. Wait, no, looking again, some non-terminals might have t8 as part of a chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if any non-terminal can produce 't8' through a sequence of productions.\n\nLooking again, I see that NT16 can produce 't8' as per the rule NT16 -> t8 NT10 or the reverse. Wait, looking at the grammar, yes, I notice that in the list:\n\nNT16 -> t8 NT10\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\nWait, checking again, I don't see a rule where NT16 directly produces 't8'. Let me carefully scan through the rules.\n\nAh, under line 33: NT18 -> t66\n\nThen, line 37: NT0 -> 't17'\n\nLine 40: NT17 -> 't14'\n\nLine 43: NT10 -> 't32'\n\nLine 45: NT16 -> 't6'\n\nLine 47: NT7 -> 't3'\n\nLine 51: NT34 -> 't30'\n\nWait, but I see that in another rule, NT28 can produce 't50' (from NT28 -> t50), but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, wait, I'm looking for a non-terminal that can derive 't8'. Let me see:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that has a rule producing 't8'.\n\nLooking through the list, I notice line 22: NT15 -> 't71'\n\nLine 23: NT21 -> 't8'\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, no, line 22 is NT15 -> 't71'\n\nLine 23 is NT21 -> 't8'\n\nIs that correct? Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLines 17-34: many entries, but I don't see where a non-terminal directly produces 't8'.\n\nWait, let me parse line 22: NT15 -> 't71' and line 21: NT15 -> 't28'\n\nDoes any rule have 't8'? No, maybe. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, looking at line 24: NT19 -> 't25'\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe 't8' is produced by a non-terminal that's derived by other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the chain of productions.\n\nStarting from S, can I derive the first 't8'? Let's see:\n\nLooking at S's options:\n1. S -> NT21 NT28\nIf I choose the first option, can NT21 derive 't8'? From NT21's rules, looking for any rule that leads to 't8' or can produce a path ending with 't8'. Looking again:\n\nNT21 has rules like:\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\nNT21 -> NT25 NT13\nNT21 -> NT19 NT26\nNT21 -> NT26 NT9\n\nNone of these seem to directly produce 't8'. So this path might not help.\n\nAnother option: S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nFor NT32, it produces NT18 NT1, etc. Let's see:\n\nLooking at rules for NT32:\nNT32 -> NT14 NT8\nAh!

{"custom_id":"request-504","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I have this context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t11 t38 t52 t70 t41 t8 t65 t8 t66 t30 t65 t43 t71 t14 t11 t11 t49 t16 t23 t31 t69 t7 t65 t10 t11 t30` is generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol followed by two non-terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, all productions must be either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, let's check if it's indeed in CNF. The first productions are S -> NT21 NT28, which fits the two non-terminals. Other productions like NT3 -> NT20 NT13 and NT31 -> NT25 NT13 also fit. However, some productions have terminals on both sides, like NT5 -> NT5 NT20 or NT5 -> NT3 NT32. Wait, but in CNF, terminals can't be on the right side, only terminals can be single symbols on the right. Oh, but actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, any production with a terminal followed by two non-terminals would violate CNF. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals have terminals, but in CNF, terminals are on the right side, not followed by other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. In CNF, all productions are to two non-terminals, except for the base cases where a terminal appears. So, for example, NT5 could be a base production with NT5 \u2192 't41', which is allowed, but if it's something like NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20, that's not in CNF because the right side has symbols (including terminals) along with non-terminals.\n\nWait, the provided grammar seems a bit inconsistent with CNF. For example, NT5 \u2192 't41' is a terminal production, which is fine, but NT5 also has other productions like NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT32, which is two non-terminals. So, those are allowed in CNF. Similarly, NT3 has productions to NT20 NT13 and NT5 NT7, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is that the grammar is in CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right side. So, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Therefore, the grammar is correctly in CNF.\n\nNow, the string provided is a sequence of terminal symbols: `t11 t38 t52 t70 t41 t8 t65 t8 t66 t30 t65 t43 t71 t14 t11 t11 t49 t16 t23 t31 t69 t7 t65 t10 t11 t30`. I need to see if this string can be derived starting from S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, it's a binary tree with each node being a non-terminal and each leaf a terminal. To check if the string is generated, I can think of it as a binary derivation where each step combines two non-terminals into their right-hand sides.\n\nBut the string is quite long, so deriving it step by step would be tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can find a path through the grammar using the given terminals and see if the structure matches.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t11, t38, t52, etc. Each terminal corresponds to a rule in the grammar. Let's see:\n\n- t11 is produced by NT11 -> 't6' (from the production NT11 -> 't6'), but wait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT11 is produced by NT11 -> 't6', but that's a terminal production. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, NT11 -> 't6'? Or does it have 't6' as a production?\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The last part shows NT11 -> 't6' and others. Wait, looking through the productions, for example, there's NT11 -> 't6' (I'm not sure; let me check the list):\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT10 -> 't32', NT16 -> 't6', NT5 -> 't41', NT17 -> 't14', NT0 -> 't61', NT15 -> 't71', NT0 -> 't11', etc. Wait, actually, looking at the end, there are several NTx -> 'txxx' productions. So, t11 is produced by NT0 -> 't11', t14 is produced by NT14 -> 't65', and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I can create a parse tree for the given string. Let's start by trying to break down the string into chunks that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t11 t38 t52 t70 t41 t8 t65 t8 t66 t30 t65 t43 t71 t14 t11 t11 t49 t16 t23 t31 t69 t7 t65 t10 t11 t30.\n\nLet's see if this can be split into pairs or chunks where each pair corresponds to the right-hand sides of non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for sequences that match the grammar's productions.\n\nFirst, let's look for t11. From the grammar, t11 can be the result of NT11 -> 't6', but wait, in my initial scan, I think NT11 is produced by 't6'. Wait, looking back, in the grammar, under the ending, I see NT11 -> 't6'. Wait:\n\nLooking at the last part of the grammar:\nNT10 -> 't32'\nNT16 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't41'\nNT17 -> 't14'\nNT0 -> 't61'\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT0 -> 't11'\nNT10 -> 't32'\nNT28 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't41'\nNT25 -> 't77'\nNT15 -> 't6'\nNT23 -> 't43'\nNT21 -> 't8'\nNT26 -> 't71'\nNT18 -> 't36'\nNT11 -> 't6'\nNT18 -> 't70'\nNT34 -> 't30'\nNT34 -> 't14'\nNT7 -> 't84'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT12 -> 't14'\nNT3 -> 't12'\nNT16 -> 't10'\nNT19 -> 't25'\nNT33 -> 't49'\nNT15 -> 't28'\nNT33 -> 't60'\nNT15 -> 't34'\nNT24 -> 't71'\nNT14 -> 't84'\nNT32 -> 't54'\nNT21 -> 't77'\nNT15 -> 't68'\nNT23 -> 't52'\nNT22 -> 't8'\nNT23 -> 't56'\nNT13 -> 't71'\nNT5 -> 't84'\nNT19 -> 't22'\nNT2 -> 't23'\nNT17 -> 't49'\nNT23 -> 't40'\nNT2 -> 't38'\nNT21 -> 't69'\nNT31 -> 't75'\nNT11 -> 't14'\n\nWait, looking at this, I see that NT11 -> 't6', but I also see NT11 -> 't6'. Wait, there's an entry for NT11 -> 't6' and also NT11 -> 't6' again? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at the end:\nNT11 -> 't14' (probably a mistake, but I'm not sure). Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to create a mapping from terminal symbols to non-terminals. So, for example, each terminal 't11' must be produced by a specific non-terminal, and each occurrence of 't11' corresponds to that non-terminal.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is 't11',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-502","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that a CNF grammar has production rules where each right-hand side is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. Each production starts with a non-terminal, and the entire string is derived from the start symbol, which in this case is S. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S directly produces certain combinations of NT2, NT3, and so on. For example, S can produce NT21 followed by NT28, or other combinations. This makes sense because each production rule for S has two NT symbols.\n\nNow, the string I'm given is: `t11 t3 t14 t16 t7 t22 t56 t49 t32 t77 t69 t14 t31 t3 t49 t65 t38 t77 t40 t25 t84 t25 t38 t28 t84 t25`.\n\nBreaking this down, each \"t\" followed by a number seems to be terminals. Wait, but in the grammar, some of the NT symbols expand into these terms. For instance, NT10 becomes t32, as per the grammar. So, I need to see if the string can be derived by replacing the non-terminals with the corresponding terminal strings step by step, starting from S.\n\nI think the first step is to see which non-terminals can produce t11, t3, t14, etc. From the grammar, some of these are terminals:\n\n- T7 is defined as 't3', so NT7 becomes 't3'.\n- NT14 becomes 't65' and 't84' depending on the rule. Looking at the grammar, NT14 has two rules: NT14 -> NT34 NT1 and NT14 -> NT15 NT7. But wait, in the given grammar, I need to check the specific productions for each NT and see which ones expand to the terms in the string.\n\nWait a minute, the grammar provided is quite extensive, but I need to identify which NT symbols correspond to which terminals in the string. Let me list the terminals in the string and see their potential NT sources:\n\n1. t11: Looking at the grammar, NT10 is 't32', NT16 is 't6', NT18 is 't66', NT33 is 't49', etc. Wait, where does t11 come from? Looking through the grammar, I see that NT17 becomes 't14' and NT18 becomes 't66', but maybe there's a rule that produces t11. Scanning through, I see that NT36 is 't11' but wait, no, I need to check the given grammar. Let me go through each terminal in the string and see which NT produces it.\n\nWait, the string starts with t11, t3, t14. So:\n\n- t11: Looking at the grammar rules, I don't immediately see a direct rule that produces t11. Maybe NT11 -> t6, but t6 is another terminal. Hmm, perhaps t11 is derived from NT11 which expands to 't6', but then where does 't6' come from? Or maybe t11 is from another production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again, I notice that some NT symbols expand into multiple terms, but for t11, I need to find a rule that includes it. Perhaps NT4 is 't84', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe t11 comes from NT0 via a production? Looking at the grammar, I see NT0 has multiple rules, such as NT0 -> 't8' (but that would be NT0 becoming t8?), wait no, looking more carefully, some NT0 rules expand into terminals. For example, NT0 -> 't61', but that's probably not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps t11 comes from a different NT. Let me check the grammar rules again. Hmm, looking for 't11' in the terminals, I don't see a direct NT that produces it in a single step. Maybe it's part of a larger expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me map each terminal in the string to possible NT symbols and their derivations.\n\nLet me start by writing down which NT could produce each terminal in the string.\n\nThe string is: t11, t3, t14, t16, t7, t22, t56, t49, t32, t77, t69, t14, t31, t3, t49, t65, t38, t77, t40, t25, t84, t25, t38, t28, t84, t25.\n\nBreaking it down term by term:\n\n1. t11: Looking through the grammar, perhaps NT11 is 't6' or something else. Wait, I don't see a direct rule for t11. Maybe NT11 is involved in a larger expansion. But without a direct rule, maybe I need to find an NT that can derive t11 through multiple steps. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar doesn't produce t11, which would immediately say 'No'. Wait, looking again, I think I might have missed it. Let me check each NT rule:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT11 -> 't6'. Oh, but t6 isn't in the string. Hmm, so maybe t11 is not present. Wait, no, the string starts with t11, but in the grammar, t11 isn't a terminal; instead, NT11 would produce 't6' which is another terminal. So unless t11 is produced directly, perhaps it's not possible. But in the given string, t11 is present as the first term. So either the grammar doesn't produce t11, in which case the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but looking more carefully, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Oh! I see that some of the NTs produce two terminals. For example, looking at the production NT3: NT3 -> NT5 NT7, but that's non-terminal to non-terminal. But are there any NTs that produce a single terminal, like a leaf node?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see entries like:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT0 -> 't8' (wait, no, looking again, some have single terminals like NT17 -> 't14', NT0 -> 't61', etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the end, some NTs are mapped to terminals like 't6', 't14', etc., but not 't11'. Let me check each entry:\n\n- NT17: 't14'\n- NT0: 't61'\n- NT10: 't32', 't2' (looking back, it says NT10 -> NT25 NT3 and others, but nowhere does NT10 directly produce a terminal except in specific rules. Wait, no, looking again, the NT25 rule says NT25 -> NT5 NT13, and some others:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Some NTs have rules that end with a terminal. For example, looking for 't11' in any rule:\n\nI don't see any NT that directly produces 't11'. For example, NT4 -> NT29 NT10, but t10 is another NT. So I'm starting to think that 't11' is not a terminal in this grammar, which would immediately say \"No\" because the string contains a term that's not produced by any rule.\n\nWait, but the string has t11 as the first word. So unless there's a way for the grammar to produce t11, the answer is 'No'. So perhaps that's the case here.\n\nWait, but I'm just looking at the provided grammar, and I see that some NTs produce terminals, but 't11' isn't one of them. Let me check every rule in the grammar to see if any of them produce a terminal that's 't11'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT14 -> 't65', 't84'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT2 -> several rules, none ending with 't11'\n- NT5 -> 't41', 't84'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT12 -> 't16', 't14'\n- NT15 -> 't28'\n- NT16 -> 't6', 't31', etc.\n- NT18 -> 't66', 't84'\n- NT20 -> 't14', 't84'\n- NT22 -> 't22' from some rules, but also to 't66' or others\n- NT25 -> 't77"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-519","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string to evaluate is: `t38 t25 t8 t49 t14 t32 t3 t75 t12 t34 t32 t60 t41 t32 t30 t41 t70 t84 t17 t30 t34 t10 t34 t69 t36 t6 t22`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Each rule has a non-terminal on the left, and the right side consists of two non-terminals. Since this is a CNF grammar, I can apply the CYK algorithm to parse the string. But maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nLet me list out the grammar rules first to see the relationships:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are a lot of production rules. For example, S starts with NT21, NT20, or NT23. But looking at the right-hand sides, S is broken down into combinations like NT21 -> NT32 NT29, and so on. Each NT has its own production rules, eventually leading to terminals like 't38', 't25', etc.\n\nThe string starts with 't38' and ends with 't22'. So, I need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar, step by step, without violating any production rules.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that each non-terminal in the grammar has specific production rules. For example, NT5 can produce 't41' or 't41' again, which is interesting. But more importantly, some non-terminals produce t's with numbers, which are terminals.\n\nI think the CYK algorithm is the most systematic way, but considering the length of the string, which is 31 tokens, it might be tedious. Maybe instead, I can construct a parse tree or look for possible combinations of the start symbols and see if the string fits.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The first character is 't38'. So I need to see which rule starts with T38. Let's look through the rules to find the left-hand side of a rule that can produce 't38'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find NT25 can produce 't30' and 't22' (from NT25 -> 't30' and 't41', etc.), but wait, 't38' is an option for NT0 and NT32. Wait, looking back at the rules: NT17 can produce 't14' and 't41', but that's not t38. Wait, actually, in the production rules, I see that 't38' is only one of the terminals. Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me go through the rules again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT0 can produce 't8' (maybe not), but looking more carefully, I don't see 't38' appearing in any rule. Wait, that can't be right because 't38' is in the string to parse. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me look through each non-terminal's production rules:\n\nLooking at NT0: it's 'NT0 -> \"t1\", \"t10\", etc. but I don't see an option that directly produces 't38'. Wait, let me look for NT... that can produce t38.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake because t38 is an option. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nWait, I see:\n\nWait, for NT33 -> 't33' and 't19'? No. Wait, it's possible that 't38' is a terminal and perhaps produced by another non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe a mistake.\n\nWait, or perhaps 't38' is a non-terminal. Because looking at the rules, the non-terminals are letters like NT21, NT32, etc., and some of these can produce other NTs or t's with numbers.\n\nWait, no, the production rules are all in terms of NT followed by numbers. So each production, like \"S -> NT21 NT20\", so all the left-hand sides are NTxxxx, and the right side is two NTs. The terminals are strings that end with a number in quotes, like 't38', which is a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, 't38' is a terminal, which must come from a production rule where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that can produce 't38'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT (like NTx) that can produce 't38'. So this is the first hint that the string might not be in the language because none of the rules seem to generate 't38' directly. Unless I'm missing a production path.\n\nWait, perhaps I can derive 't38' from a longer path. Let me check each nt rule that ends in 't38'. Or maybe it's a typo, but assuming the string is correct.\n\nWait, let me look again. Oh! I see in NT16: \"NT16 -> NT29 NT7\" which includes some productions but I don't see 't38'. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. If none of the rules for non-terminals directly produce 't38', then the string cannot be generated, meaning the answer would be 'No' because 't38' isn't present as a production.\n\nBut wait, looking back, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me see the list again.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminals (like NT38) or NTs that directly produce 't38' as a terminal. So maybe the string contains a terminal that's impossible to produce from this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the rules once more to see if 't38' is a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT0 can produce \"t1\", \"t10\", \"t17\", etc., but 't38' isn't one of them. Similarly for other NTs:\n\nLet me look for all terminals:\n\nNT0: t1, t10, t17, t18, t27, t26, etc.\n\nWait, is 't38' even an option? No, I don't see it anywhere. So, does that mean the string starts with a symbol that the grammar can't produce?\n\nIf that's the case, then the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a rule? Maybe 't38' is produced by a combination of productions.\n\nLooking through: does any production have 't38'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through each rule, the only places where t is mentioned are in NT0 and NT17.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT0 -> \"t18\", \"t20\", etc.\nNT17 -> \"t14\", \"t41\"\n\nBut no 't38'. So unless I'm missing a production, 't38' is not a terminal that can be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with a symbol that the grammar cannot derive, so the string is not part of the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in not seeing the rule. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nNT1 -> NT6 NT27\nNT2 -> NT15 NT18\nNT3 -> NT5 NT7\nNT4 -> NT29 NT10\nNT5 -> various options, including \"t41\"\nNT6 -> NT8 NT1 etc.\nWait, no 't38' anywhere.\n\nSo, the grammar doesn't have a rule that directly produces 't38' as a terminal, meaning the given string cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-523","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is \"t23 t14 t6 t12 t11 t36 t10 t77 t69 t34 t31 t34 t34 t16 t31 t3 t3 t50 t36 t23 t7 t77 t77 t71 t11 t40 t60\". My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The string we're evaluating consists of a series of terminals, so the non-terminals in the grammar must derive into these terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many rules are for non-terminals directly producing strings of terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT23 NT14, and NT23 \u2192 t52, NT14 \u2192 t65, so S can derive into two terminals. But wait, in the given string, the first two tokens are t23 and t14, which correspond to NT23 and NT14. So S can produce t23 t14 directly, which is the start of our string. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's break down the string into parts and see how they might be generated. The string starts with t23 t14, so from S, we have S \u2192 NT23 NT14, which would produce t23 t14. So the first two tokens match.\n\nNext, the string has t6 t12 t11 t36 t10 t77 t69 t34 t31 t34 t34 t16 t31 t3 t3 t50 t36 t23 t7 t77 t77 t71 t11 t40 t60. After the first two, we have a long sequence of terminals. Let's parse this step by step.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT23 NT14, the next part to process would be NT23 and NT14. Looking at the NT23 rules:\n\nLooking back, NT23 has a production rule NT23 \u2192 t40, but that's if there's another rule. Wait, I need to check if NT23 has more production rules beyond the direct terminal. Let me scan through the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT23:\n- NT23 \u2192 t40\n\nWait, that seems to be the only rule for NT23. So NT23 can only produce t40. But in the string, after NT23 comes t14, t6, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, actually, the initial S is S \u2192 NT23 NT14, which is correct for t23 t14. Then, after that, the next part must come from the derivation of NT23 and NT14 further. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Each non-terminal is expanded separately. So after S \u2192 NT23 NT14, each of these NTs can expand into more symbols until they become terminals. So, after initial S \u2192 NT23 NT14, we have t23 and t14, which is the start of our string, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the rest of the string is t6 t12 t11 t36 t10 t77 t69 t34 t31 t34 t34 t16 t31 t3 t3 t50 t36 t23 t7 t77 t77 t71 t11 t40 t60.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string as the rightmost derivation. Starting from S, which is the root, we can expand S into NT23 NT14. Then, each NT can expand further.\n\nLet me try to see how the string can be derived. Let's take the string and try to match it step by step, perhaps using a top-down approach.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT23 NT14 \u2192 t23 t14 (matches the first two tokens).\n\nNow, the remaining tokens are t6 t12 t11 t36 t10 t77 t69 t34 t31 t34 t34 t16 t31 t3 t3 t50 t36 t23 t7 t77 t77 t71 t11 t40 t60.\n\n2. Next, after t23 and t14, we need to expand NT23 and NT14 further. Let's look at NT23's production rules. From the grammar, NT23 \u2192 t40, which is a single terminal. So that can't be because we have more tokens to process. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe S doesn't directly produce t23 t14 but through more steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the grammar more carefully. Let me list out the production rules for the non-terminals to see which ones can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at NT23:\n- NT23 \u2192 t40\n\nSo, NT23 can only produce t40. That seems problematic because after S \u2192 NT23 NT14, the next part of the string is t6 t12 t11 t36..., but t40 can't lead to any of these unless there's a way to produce multiple symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps S \u2192 NT23 NT14, but then each of those NTs can expand beyond single terminals. Let me check the rules again.\n\nNT14: Looking at the grammar, NT14 \u2192 t65. So NT14 can't produce anything else except t65, which is a terminal. So S \u2192 NT23 NT14 would produce t23 t14, but after that, NT23 and NT14 have to produce something else. But NT23 can only produce t40, and NT14 only t65, which doesn't help because the string continues.\n\nHmm, that suggests that S \u2192 NT23 NT14 only produces t23 t14, but the next tokens are t6, which doesn't fit. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong, or the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the productions for S again. S has multiple productions:\n\nS -> NT23 NT14\nS -> NT32 NT8\nS -> NT20 NT25\n... and others.\n\nSo S can expand into other combinations, not just NT23 NT14. I think I made a mistake earlier. The initial expansion might not be S \u2192 NT23 NT14. Instead, perhaps another rule is used.\n\nWait, the string starts with t23 t14, which corresponds to S \u2192 NT23 NT14 because NT23 \u2192 t40 (wait, no, NT23 is t40, but in the string, it's followed by t14, which is NT14, but wait, that's not matching because after NT23, it should produce t40, and NT14 produces t65. So S would produce t40 t65, but the string starts with t23 t14, which is different.\n\nSo that suggests that S \u2192 NT23 NT14 can't match the beginning of the string as provided. Therefore, the string cannot start with t23 t14 if the production is S \u2192 NT23 NT14. Instead, maybe the string starts with a different production from S.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t23 t14, so S must directly produce t23 t14 through some production rule. Let's look for any S rule that, when expanded, leads to t23 t14.\n\nLooking at the S rules:\n\nS -> NT23 NT14 \u2192 produces t23 t14 (since NT23 \u2192 t40? Wait, no, NT23 produces only t40, which is different. So S can't produce t23 t14 directly because NT23 would produce t40.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct. Let's look more carefully. Let me check the S rules:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT14: but NT23 \u2192 t40, NT14 \u2192 t65, so that production would give t40 t65, not t23 t14.\n\nSo none of the S production rules can directly produce t23 t14, because NT23 and NT14 produce other terminals. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the string does not start with t23 t14.\n\nWait, but the string provided is: \"t23 t14 t6 t12 t11 t36 t10 t77 t69 t34 t31 t34 t34 t16 t31 t3 t3 t50 t36 t23 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t32 t10 t41 t32 t10 t7 t3 t30 t84 t32 t43 t32 t60 t38 t77 t84 t7 t75 t60 t36 t7 t10 t71 t30 t23 t77 t68 t70`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has each production rule either of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the productions are either A -> BC or A -> symbol, except for a few where A might have more than two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal. Let me check a few productions:\n\n- S -> NT2 NT28\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT29\n- NT0 -> NT10 NT5\n- And so on.\n\nYes, all the productions have either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right side. So the grammar is indeed in Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the string consists of a series of terminals: t32, t10, t41, etc. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can simulate the parsing process to see if the string can be generated. Parsing a string in CNF can be done using a recursive descent parser or by checking if the string can be reduced from the top-down using the productions.\n\nBut parsing this string from scratch might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can check if the string can be split into a sequence of productions starting from S. Each production step should reduce two symbols if they are non-terminals to one symbol.\n\nThe strategy is to check if there's a way to parse the string starting from S, applying productions step by step.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t32 t10 t41 t32 t10 t7 t3 t30 t84 t32 t43 t32 t60 t38 t77 t84 t7 t75 t60 t36 t7 t10 t71 t30 t23 t77 t68 t70.\n\nSince the first symbol is t32, I can look for a production that directly produces t32. Looking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals produce t32:\n\n- S -> NT2 NT28\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT29\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT22 -> NT29 NT2\n- NT32 -> NT2 NT23\n- NT29 -> NT7 NT2\n- NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT10 NT31\n- NT22 -> NT33 NT21\n- NT17 -> NT16 NT19\n- And so on.\n\nWait, not all these produce t32 directly. Let me check each relevant production.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT29\nSo, this is a production where NT21 can produce NT32 and NT29. So NT21 can lead to t32 if NT29 is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the NT29 terminal: NT29 -> t27 nt22. Wait, no, the productions for NT29 are:\n\n- NT29 -> NT27 NT22\n- NT17 -> NT16 NT19\n- NT25 -> NT23 NT28\n- NT17 -> NT16 NT10\nWait, no, let me look again.\n\nActually, the productions for NT29 are:\n\n- NT29 -> NT27 NT22\n- NT29 -> NT16 NT7\n- NT8 -> NT27 NT6\n- NT29 -> NT7 NT2\n- NT29 -> NT14 NT10\n- NT29 -> NT16 NT10\n- NT26 -> NT28 NT22\n- Wait, I'm looking at the NT29 productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the direct productions starting with NT29 are:\n\n- NT29 -> NT27 NT22\n- NT17 -> NT16 NT19 (Wait, no, NT17 is another non-terminal)\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT17\n\nWait, actually, looking through the productions, I don't see any production that directly produces t32 from the start of NT. So maybe I need to see if t32 can be produced by any non-terminal that S or other non-terminals can start with.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S -> NT2 NT28. So S starts with NT2 followed by NT28.\n\nBut NT2 is one of the non-terminals. Let me see:\n\nNT2 -> NT15 NT18 (from S productions) or directly?\n\nWait, looking at the NT2 productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2 -> NT15 NT18\n- NT2 -> NT24 NT33\n- NT2 -> NT26 NT3\n- NT2 -> NT29 NT10\n- NT2 -> NT15 NT3\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT28\n- So not directly producing t32.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should try to top-down parse the string.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t32, the first step would be to find a production where the first two symbols can derive t32 t10... etc. Wait, no. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces two symbols if the current non-terminal can split into two.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be considered as a sequence of non-terminals and terminals. Let's try to split the string into the possible productions.\n\nThe first symbol is t32. To get t32, I look for a production that starts with some NT leading to t32 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT29: So if I have NT21, it can produce NT32 followed by NT29.\n\nBut Nt21 itself can be derived from S, perhaps.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nThe string is t32 t10 t41 t32 t10 t7 t3 t30 t84 t32 t43 t32 t60 t38 t77 t84 t7 t75 t60 t36 t7 t10 t71 t30 t23 t77 t68 t70\n\nI need to find a way to parse this.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be derived from S.\n\nS can be split into NT2 followed by NT28. So the first production must be S -> NT2 NT28.\n\nNow, NT2 must produce t32, so it's a terminal. Wait, but in CNF, NT2 must produce a sequence of symbols. If NT2 is a non-terminal, it must be split into two symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again: each production in CNF is of the form NT -> a or NT -> NT NT.\n\nSo, the string starts with t32, which is a terminal. But in the grammar, there are non-terminals that produce terminals.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t32:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- S -> NT2 NT28\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT29\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT22 -> NT29 NT2\n- NT32 -> NT2 NT23\n- NT29 -> NT7 NT2\n- NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT10 NT31\n- NT22 -> NT33 NT21\n- NT17 -> NT16 NT19\n- NT26 -> NT28 NT22\n- NT2 -> NT15 NT18\n- NT12 -> NT10 NT18\n- NT21 -> NT21 NT24\n- NT26 -> NT34 NT2\n- NT18 -> NT27 NT1\n- NT11 -> NT25 NT13\n- NT10 -> NT28 NT32\n- NT26 -> NT18 NT9\n- NT22 -> NT18 NT32\n- NT13 -> NT10 NT21\n- NT5 -> NT3 NT32\n- NT17 -> NT5 NT28\n- NT0 -> NT10 NT27\n- NT21 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's list out the rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT21 -> 't28'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT34 -> 't14'\n- NT7 -> 't84'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT12 -> 't14'\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT16 -> 't10'\n- NT19 -> 't25'\n- NT33 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't28'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't71'\n- NT18 -> 't36'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT33 -> 't60'\n- NT15 -> 't34'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- NT14 -> 't84'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT21 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT23 -> 't56'\n- NT13 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT11 -> 't14'\n- NT8 -> 't27'\n- NT8 -> 't16'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT16 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't71'\n- NT18 -> 't36'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT33 -> 't40'\n- NT15 -> 't34'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- NT14 -> 't84'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT21 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT23 -> 't56'\n- NT13 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n- NT19 -> 't25'\n- NT33 -> 't49'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT34 -> 't14'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n\nWait, actually, some of these rules have multiple outputs. So, the first step is to see if the string can be generated by starting with S and applying these productions.\n\nThe string starts with t75. Looking at the production rules, the only non-terminal that directly produces t75 is NT31 -> 't75'. So, the first part of the derivation must be S -> NT31 NTsomething, but wait, no. Because S has to produce a combination of two non-terminals. S can only split into three possible combinations as listed earlier: NT21 and NT28, NT32 and NT14, or NT20 and NT25.\n\nSo, the string starts with t75, which comes from NT31 -> 't75', which is part of the S -> NT21 NT28 production? Wait, no. S is the start symbol, and each production for S is either NT21 and NT28, etc. So, if the first element in the string is t75, then the first two non-terminals produced by S must be NT31? But in the given S productions, none of them are NT31. So S can't directly produce NT31. Therefore, the string must be starting with a symbol that's a combination of two non-terminals from S's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The start symbol S can only generate two non-terminals at a time, as per its productions. The string's first part is t75, which must come from a non-terminal that produces t75. Looking at the rules, only NT31 -> 't75'. So, to get t75, the derivation must have a point where NT31 is expanded, which as per the rules is produced by some other non-terminal. But looking at the S productions, none of them produce NT31. So, there's no way S can directly generate a t75. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the first part of the string isn't directly from S, but through some intermediate steps. Let me try to map this out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken into parts that correspond to the S productions. Let's see: the string is a sequence of t75, t12, t16, etc. If I group them into pairs as per S's possible productions, maybe that helps.\n\nBut it's tricky because each production for S combines two non-terminals, which in turn can expand into sequences of terminals and other non-terminals. So, the string is a sequence of terminals that must be the result of all those expansions.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t75, which is a terminal produced by NT31. But S can't start with NT31 because S only produces pairs of NTs as per its rules. So S can only generate something like NT21 NT28, etc. So any string generated by S must start with a pair that eventually expands into a terminal.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is t75, which implies that the first pair of non-terminals from S must expand into t75 somehow, but I don't see how since NT31 isn't part of S's initial productions.\n\nTherefore, I think it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar because the first symbol t75 can't be produced by S's initial rules.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Okay, first, I need to understand what each part of the grammar looks like and how it can derive strings.\n\nSo, the grammar starts with S, which can produce different combinations of NT2, NT32, NT20, etc. Then each of those non-terminals can break down further. The goal is to see if the string `t22 t40 t43 t11 t77 t54 t49 t7 t28 t12 t31 t23 t66 t11 t75 t10 t11 t56 t28 t6 t69 t56 t14 t50 t54 t6 t6 t28 t30` can be generated through these productions.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The string provided ends with multiple 't...' tokens, which seem to be terminal symbols. So, the grammar can directly produce these terminals after breaking down through the non-terminals.\n\nLet me list out the productions first to see how the non-terminals can be expanded.\n\nLooking at some key productions:\n- S -> NT21 NT2 NT28\n- NT21 can produce NT32 NT29, NT31 NT25, etc. Each of these further breaks down into other NTs or terminals.\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT27 -> NT11 NT4\n- NT4 -> NT29 NT10\n- NT29 -> NT27 NT22\n- NT22 -> NT18 NT32\n- NT32 -> NT28 NT18\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n- NT11 -> NT25 NT13\n- NT25 -> NT5 NT13\n- NT13 -> NT18 NT18\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT0\n- NT0 can produce several things like 't61', 't17', etc.\n\nI'm noticing that several of these NTs can reach terminals like 't3', 't6', 't7', etc. But the string has a lot more 't's, such as 't14', 't22', 't23', etc.\n\nLet me try to see how 't22' can be generated. Looking at the terminals, there's 't28' and other t's. I'll check if any non-terminals directly produce t22. Wait, in the grammar, I see that NT25 -> NT5 NT13, but I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly becomes t22. Instead, looking deeper:\n\nNT25 -> NT5 NT13\nNT5 has productions:\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT5 -> NT5 NT20\n\nWait, so does that mean NT5 can produce t41 or another NT which might produce t41 or something else? Hmm, but the string has t22, which isn't immediately reachable from NT5.\n\nLet me trace the possible derivation steps for t22. Since t22 is a terminal, it must come from a production where a non-terminal directly becomes t22. But I don't see NT22 -> t22 in the grammar. So that can't be.\n\nWait, looking again, NT22 appears in some productions:\n\n- NT22 -> NT18 NT32\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT26 -> NT28 NT22\n- NT22 -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo, perhaps t22 is produced through these combinations. For example, if I have NT22 -> t22 NT32, but I don't see such a production. Alternatively, NT22 could be part of a larger production that breaks down into t22 somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the entire string and see if each token can be produced by some NT that's reachable through the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t22 t40 t43 t11 t77 t54 t49 t7 t28 t12 t31 t23 t66 t11 t75 t10 t11 t56 t28 t6 t69 t56 t14 t50 t54 t6 t6 t28 t30\n\nLet's go through each part step by step.\n\n1. t22: As established, t22 isn't directly produced by any NT. So, I need to see how t22 can be formed. Since NT22 can eventually lead to t's through other productions, maybe.\n\n2. t40: This is unique. Looking through the productions, I don't see NT40, so unless it's a typo, maybe it's part of a longer sequence.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should make a tree of possible productions starting from S and see if I can map the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But considering the time, maybe a step-by-step breakdown would help.\n\nLet me think if each step in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with t22: Since I can't directly get t22, I need to see if there's a path from S through other non-terminals that eventually produce t22. For example, S can go to NT21 NT2 NT28. Let me see NT21: NT21 -> NT32 NT29. NT32 -> NT28 NT18. NT28 -> NT11 NT3. NT11 -> NT25 NT13. NT25: that could go to 't41' or more NTs. It seems too indirect to reach t22.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps S can't generate this string because of some tokens not being in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, I see 't56', 't66', 't77', etc. Let me check:\n\n- NT56: There's a production NT19 -> t56. So if any NT19 appears, t56 would be produced.\n\n- NT77: production is NT15 -> t77.\n\n- NT66: looking for NT66. Wait, NT66 is not a terminal, let me see. The productions for NT6: NT6 -> t68. So perhaps NT66 is a non-terminal. Looking, I see that NT23 -> t22 t52, etc. Wait, maybe I should check the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The production NT23: NT23 -> NT22 NT27. If I have NT23, can it produce t22 or t27? Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT22: its productions only lead to t's indirectly. But the only way to get t22 is to see if any NT can lead directly to it.\n\nWait, looking at the start of the string:\n\nt22 t40 t43 t11 t77 t54 t49 t7 t28 t12 t31 t23 t66 t11 t75 t10 t11 t56 t28 t6 t69 t56 t14 t50 t54 t6 t6 t28 t30\n\nSo, the first part is t22. Since I don't see a production that yields t22 as a terminal, this string might not be in the language. Therefore, the answer would be No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a production chain. Let me check NT22 again. NT22 can produce NT18 NT32, which could then be further decomposed. Maybe through multiple steps, but I don't see a direct path to t22.\n\nGiven this, I think the string can't be generated because t22 isn't a direct terminal in any production, and it's unclear how to derive it.

Let me list them:\nS -> NT21 NT21\nWait, no, in the grammar, S seems to have four productions:\n1. S -> NT21 NT28\n2. S -> NT32 NT14\n3. S -> NT20 NT25\n4. S -> NT32 NT2\n\nWait, the first line is S->NT21 NT21? No, looking again, it's S -> NT21 NT28, etc. So the start is S, and each production is combining two non-terminals. So for example, the first production is S splits into NT21 and NT28.\n\nThe string given starts with t41. Since t41 is a terminal, it must be derived directly by a production. Looking at the grammar, I see that production NT17 can go to 't41', so if we have NT17, we can get 't41'. So the derivation tree must have a node that produces t41 through NT17.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the next symbol after t41 is t60. So we have 't41 t60'. Let's see if t41 can connect to t60 in some way. Wait, perhaps that's part of a combined non-terminal expansion. For example, if somewhere in the derivation, we have a non-terminal that expands to t41 followed by t60.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this step by step, checking each part of the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string as a sequence of terminals, seeing if each can be matched by a production of the grammar, starting from S.\n\nThe string is: [t41, t60, t56, t84, t3, t32, t31, t84, t22, t16, t25, t84, t52, t68, t84, t25, t60, t17, t17, t10, t75, t25, t43, t49, t8, t77, t60, t56, t30]\n\nTo parse this, I can model it as trying to match symbols step by step, starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is complex, maybe it's easier to see if the string is generated by the grammar by checking if each terminal is present in any production as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list all the terminals:\n\nFrom the productions, NT17 can produce 't41' and 't14'.\n\nLooking through other non-terminals, do they produce any other terminals? For example, NT0 can produce some 't's.\n\nLooking at NT17: can generate 't14' or 't41'.\n\nLooking at NT21: according to the productions, NT21 can produce various combinations, but some of them resolve to terminals. For instance, NT21 -> NT26 NT6, which eventually leads to NT26 -> 't28' and NT6 -> 't68'? Wait, but looking deeper, NT6 -> 't68'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT6, there's a production NT6 -> NT18 NT31. NT31 -> 't75'. NT18 can produce 't41' or other things. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the string includes 't56' which I see at the third position. Where does 't56' come from? Looking at the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't56'?\n\nHmm, looking through all the productions, I don't immediately see a production that produces 't56'. So if 't56' is in the string, it must be derived from a non-terminal that can go to 't56'.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't56' directly? Let me scan the productions.\n\nLooking at NT32: NT32 can produce NT2 NT23. NT23 can produce NT22 and NT27. Wait, but NT22 can produce various things. Let me see if any NT can produce 't56'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't56' is part of a larger production that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nAnother approach: since the string starts with t41, which comes from NT17, perhaps the entire string is built up from that initial node. So let's see if the string can be generated starting with NT17.\n\nIf the first symbol is t41 (from NT17 -> 't41'), then the next symbols must be matched by the subsequent expansion of NT17's other part.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to try to see if any of the non-terminals in the grammar can produce the entire string as a sequence of terminals. Alternatively, perhaps building a left or right parse tree would help, but that could take a while.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the grammar has some left recursion or right recursion that can generate certain strings. Looking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals have productions that include themselves, leading to more complex trees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some non-terminals can produce multiple terminals in a row, allowing the string to be built by a series of such steps.\n\nWait, focusing on the string, after t41 comes t60. Where can t60 come from? Let's look for a production that produces 't60'.\n\nLooking at NT25: NT25 -> NT5 NT13. NT5 can produce 't41' or other things. NT13 -> 't6' or 't10'. So t60 would have to come from some combination where the parts resolve to 't60', but I don't see a direct production for 't60'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT20: NT20 -> NT29 NT32. NT29 -> 't7' or other things. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should consider that the string might not be generated by the grammar because there's a terminal that isn't present in any production. Looking at the grammar, let's make a list of all terminals.\n\nFrom the productions, the terminals are:\n\nt41, t60, t56, t84, t3, t32, t31, t84, t22, t16, t25, t84, t52, t68, t17, t17, t10, t75, t43, t49, t8, t77, t60, t56, t30.\n\nWait, do any non-terminals produce these values? For example, 't56'\u2014I need to check if any non-terminal can produce 't56'. Looking through all the non-terminals, I only see NT17 and a few others have specific terminals.\n\nWait, let's look at NT2: NT2 -> 't23', 't4', or 't16', etc. Hmm, I don't see any NT that produces 't56' directly. Similarly, checking others:\n\nNT0 can produce 't17', 't18', etc.\n\nNT17 can produce 't41' or 't14'.\n\nSo 't56' is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Alright, let's start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, especially for algorithms like CYK.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo, the string starts with two non-terminals, which must be expanded according to these rules. Now, looking at the provided string, it starts with t49, which I assume is a terminal. Let's see which rule produces t49.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT17 -> t14, NT19 -> t25 is not listed here, but wait, I'm focusing on NT19's rules. Alternatively, looking at the rules, NT17 has t14, but I need to check if t49 is produced anywhere else. Hmm, perhaps I should create a mapping of all the terminals and see where they come from.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see several terminal nodes like t3, t6, t7, etc. For example, NT20 -> t6. So, t6 is a terminal. But t49... looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through each production, I find NT25 -> t77, which is another terminal, but no 't49' so far. Wait, let me scan the rules again more carefully. \n\nLooking at NT23 -> t52, NT21 -> t77, NT14 -> t65, NT15 -> t68, etc. Hmm, I don't see 't49' directly. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each rule:\n\nWait, I see NT17 has 't14', NT23 has 't52', NT22 has 't8', NT24 has 't71', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing the 't49' rule. Or maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I need to find where 't49' appears. I'll go through each rule and see if any non-terminals produce t49. \n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT17 -> 't14' (twice?), wait no,NT17 is defined as NT17 -> t14? No, let's see: I might have made a mistake. Wait, the user provided a very long list, perhaps I can find 't49' anywhere.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT14 produces 't65'\n\nNT7 -> 't3'\n\nNT24 -> 't71'\n\nNT23 -> 't52'\n\nNT22 -> 't8'\n\nNT26 -> 't28'\n\nNT32 -> 't54'\n\nAnd so on. Wait, I don't see 't49' directly. Maybe I should check if any long productions result in t49.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't49' is a result of expanding a non-terminal. Let me see:\n\nWhat's NT15? Looking back, NT15 is defined as NT15 -> t6. Hmm, but that's not helpful. What about NT19? Hmm, does NT19 produce 't49'? Looking through the rules, I don't see NT19 \u2192 t49. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the 't49' is part of a production. Let's see: NT17 is defined as NT17 -> t14, and also NT17 -> t49? Wait, no. Looking again:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT17 -> t14\n- NT22 -> t71\n- Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the rules. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, I see that T19 is not mentioned. Or perhaps I'm forgetting a rule.\n\nWait, here's the full list of production rules. Let me organize them more clearly.\n\nNon-terminals produce the following terminals:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 t6\n- NT3 \u2192 t68? Wait, no, looking back:\nLooking through each rule line by line.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through the rules systematically.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- S produces to NT21 NT28, etc.\n\nNow, for the terminals:\n\nHere's all the terminal productions listed:\n\nNT20 \u2192 t6\nNT3 \u2192 t12 (twice)\nNT0 \u2192 't17', etc. Wait, here:\n\nLooking at the entire list, I see a lot of terminal nodes:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t14\n\nNT23 \u2192 t52\n\nNT21 \u2192 t77\n\nNT12 \u2192 t16, etc.\n\nWait, I need to find all the rules that map non-terminals to terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 t54\n- NT28 \u2192 t50\n- NT14 \u2192 t65\n- NT15 \u2192 t68\n- NT7 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t68 and t7\n- NT24 \u2192 t71\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n\nWait, I think I'm not seeing a 't49' here. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the production rules provided, is there a production where a non-terminal directly produces 't49'? Scanning through:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' is present twice.\n- NT23 \u2192 't52'\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n- NT26 \u2192 't28', etc.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps 't49' is part of a larger expansion. That is, it's not directly a production but part of a longer chain. However, given that the grammar is in CNF, all productions are two-terminals on the right-hand side, except the start symbol. So, any terminal in the string must come directly from a production with a single terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, but every non-terminal must eventually derive a string of terminals. So, in that case, each terminal in the string must be a result of a production that directly maps a non-terminal to it. Therefore, the string provided has t49, which must be generated by a single non-terminal rule.\n\nWait, but looking through all the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't49'. That could mean that the string is not generated by the grammar, which would be 'No'. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps 't49' is a terminal and is part of a production that is somewhere deep in the grammar. But according to the given rules, every production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, no: when you expand a non-terminal, you replace it with two non-terminals, each of which can be expanded further, until you reach terminals.\n\nSo, for example, if you have S \u2192 NT21 NT28, and NT21 can expand to another two non-terminals, etc. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be the result of some non-terminal in the grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It seems that most of the productions start with S and have parts that eventually lead to terminals like 't'. The string in question has a lot of 't's followed by numbers, so it's likely these are the terminals of the language.\n\nThe goal is to parse this string using the given grammar. Let's try to see if this works step by step.\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar, S can be split into two parts, each of which is a combination of other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT21 NT28, or another option S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the first step is to pick the correct split of the string into these possible parts.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't30'. Let's see which productions produce 't30'. Looking through the grammar, I notice that NT7 \u2192 't3', NT12 \u2192 't14', NT15 \u2192 't6', and others, but I don't see a direct production for 't30'. Wait, in the grammar, NT33 \u2192 NT33 NT19 and others, but maybe I need to find where a non-terminal leads to 't30'.\n\nLooking back, I see NT54 in the string is 't38'... Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the first part of S is NT21 which leads to 't8', as NT21 \u2192 't28'? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT21 has a production NT21 \u2192 't28'? Or maybe another route. Wait, some of the NTs lead to terminals. Let me find where 't30' comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT4 is involved in several places but not directly. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check: NT21 in the grammar is defined as NT21 -> NT26 NT6, which then leads to other things, but in one of the productions, NT25 -> 't77', and NT77 isn't present. Alternatively, perhaps NT34 has a production NT34 -> 't30'.\n\nWait, looking again: I see a production NT34 \u2192 't30' and NT34 \u2192 't14'. So 't30' can be produced by NT34. So maybe the first non-terminal is NT34, which produces 't30'. Then, the remaining string needs to be parsed with the other part of S.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT34 NTsomething, then the rest of the string should start with whatever NT34's other part is. But looking back, the first production for S is NT21 NT28, which might produce different things. Alternatively, perhaps S starts with something else.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to split the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe first token is 't30', which can come from NT34. So let's see: If the first part of S is NT34, then the first token 't30' is correct. Now, what's the second part of S? S can have multiple options, so let's see which second part can lead to the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at the string after 't30', it's 't34 t68 t68 t50 t6 ...'. So the next part would have to be split into another non-terminal. Since S can be split into two non-terminals, each of those can produce more non-terminals, and so on, until we reach terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT21 NT28. So the first part is NT21 and the second part is NT28. Let's see if that works.\n\nNT21 has productions, one of which is NT21 \u2192 't28'. Wait, the first token is 't30', which doesn't match 't28', so that can't be it. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Let's check NT32. Looking at the grammar, NT32 can be NT5 NT10 or other things. NT32 \u2192 't54'?\n\nWait, let's look for NT32's productions. In the grammar, NT32 \u2192 't54' is there. So if the first part of S is NT32, then the first token could be 't54'. But the string starts with 't30', which is different. So perhaps that's not the route.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. Let's look for a way to generate 't30' followed by 't34', etc. So 't30' is from NT34, as I thought. Then, after 't30', the next part is 't34'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, after NT34, the next part would have to come from another non-terminal. So the string is t30 t34 t68 t68 ... So after NT34, the next non-terminal would be producing 't34'. Let's see, in the grammar, NT33 \u2192 't33' is not present, but I do see NT33 producing other things, not terminals. Wait, let me check: NT23 \u2192 't43', NT22 \u2192 't22', NT25 \u2192 't77', etc. Hmm, is there a non-terminal that produces 't34'?\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking back, I see NT4 \u2192 't10' etc., but I don't see NT34 producing a terminal. Wait, earlier I thought NT34 has a production to 't30' and 't14'. Maybe that's incorrect. Looking back, the list of productions:\n\nLooking for NT34 in the grammar. I see that NT34 appears in several productions but doesn't have a terminal on the right. For example, NT17 \u2192 't14' is one, and other NTs produce terminals. Wait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking for 't34' in the grammar, perhaps a production like NT12 \u2192 't34'? Let me see: the list includes NT28 \u2192 't50', NT25 \u2192 't77', and others. Wait, perhaps a non-terminal called NT34 is the result of some other splits, but I don't see a direct 't34' in the grammar. Wait, maybe it's part of another non-terminal's production. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a way to parse the entire string by recursively applying the grammar's productions. Let's try to see if the string can be divided into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: The grammar is almost entirely in CNF, which means each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the tree structure of any string must correspond to such a split.\n\nLooking at the string: The first token is 't30', which I think comes from a non-terminal that produces 't30'. Looking for that, let's find which non-terminals can produce 't30'. I recall that in the grammar, NT7 leads to 't3', while other non-terminals may not directly produce 't30'. Wait, but earlier I saw NT34 can produce 't30', right? Yes, looking back, the grammar has NT34 -> 't30' and also perhaps another production involving NT34.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking specifically, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT34 -> 't30' NT...\". Wait, maybe I misread it before. Let me scan the list again:\n\nLooking for 't30' in the productions:\n\n\"NT34 -> 't30'...\". Oh, found it near the end: \"NT22 -> NT33 NT21\", \"NT14 -> NT51\", etc., but I don't see 't30' at the beginning until much later.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, I don't see 't30' directly in the grammar as a terminal. Wait, could I misread it? Let me check again through all the productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, somewhere it says:\n\n\"NT22 -> NT28 NT22\" and others, but I don't see 't30' being produced.

{"custom_id":"request-602","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF has specific rules where all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, I see that some productions like S \u2192 NT21 NT28 don't have terminals; they might be productions I need to handle differently. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions must be to two non-terminals or a single terminal. So if any production has more than two non-terminals, it's not in CNF. Let me check the given grammar.\n\nLooking closer, I notice that the grammar has productions like S \u2192 NT21 NT28, which are two non-terminals. But then other productions like NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3 have two non-terminals as well, which seems okay. But wait, are there any terminals? It looks like yes, some non-terminals are transformed into terminals, like NT25 \u2192 't33' or NT14 \u2192 't65'. So the strings will contain these terminal symbols.\n\nWait, but the string to evaluate is `t71 t22 t16 t50 t7 t28 t70 t11 t0 t49 t6 t3 t31 t40 t66 t40 t43 t32 t6 t50 t70 t31 t36 t43 t50 t65 t70 t0 t68 t49 t41`. All these are terminals, so the question is whether this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nNow, the problem is to check if this string is in the language generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps I can apply the CYK algorithm to parse the string. CYK uses dynamic programming tables to check parseability. Let me recall how CYK works.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a table where for each position and length, I check possible non-terminals that can generate that substring. The steps are:\n1. Identify the terminal symbols in the grammar and map them to their respective non-terminals.\n2. Create a table where rows represent positions in the string, and columns represent lengths.\n3. For each substring, determine which non-terminals can produce it by looking at all possible factorizations and checking if the corresponding non-terminals are present in the grammar.\n\nLet me list down the terminals with their possible non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are mapped as follows:\nNT1 \u2192 't36', NT2 \u2192 't23', NT3 \u2192 't31', NT4 \u2192 't14', NT5 \u2192 't41', NT6 \u2192 't68', NT7 \u2192 't3', NT8 \u2192 't27', NT9 \u2192 't26', NT10 \u2192 't32', 't0' (which is NT0), NT11 \u2192 't6', NT12 \u2192 't16', NT13 \u2192 't6', NT14 \u2192 't65', NT15 \u2192 't6', NT16 \u2192 't18', NT17 \u2192 't14', NT18 \u2192 't66', NT19 \u2192 't25', NT20 \u2192 't50', NT21 \u2192 't8', NT22 \u2192 't22', NT23 \u2192 't40', NT24 \u2192 't22', NT25 \u2192 't77', NT26 \u2192 't28', NT27 \u2192 't9', NT28 \u2192 't50', NT29 \u2192 't27', NT30 \u2192 't30', NT31 \u2192 't75', NT32 \u2192 't54', NT33 \u2192 't49', NT34 \u2192 't34', NT35 \u2192 nothing (since no production for NT35?), wait no, I should check all possible NTs.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals might not have any productions, or perhaps the grammar is incomplete. For example, NT34 has productions like NT34 \u2192 't34' and others, but in the given grammar, NT34 has multiple productions. For example, NT34 \u2192 NT16 NT1 and others including producing 't34'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their possible productions, including terminals. But this seems extensive. Alternatively, perhaps I can map each terminal to its possible non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step with CYK.\n\nFirst, I need to tokenize the input string and list the terminals. The string is a list of 't's followed by numbers, all terminals.\n\nLet me write down the string: t71, t22, t16, t50, t7, t28, t70, t11, t0, t49, t6, t3, t31, t40, t66, t40, t43, t32, t6, t50, t70, t31, t36, t43, t50, t65, t70, t0, t68, t49, t41.\n\nThe length is 31, so the CYK table will have 31 rows and 31 columns, covering all substrings.\n\nBut doing this manually is time-consuming. Maybe I can find a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals. So, each step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one. For a string of length n, the derivation will have n-1 productions. So, the total number of steps is 30, which is manageable, but perhaps I can find a pattern or see which parts might not be generated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can start by looking at the first few symbols and see if the grammar can produce them.\n\nThe first symbol is 't71'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals derive to 't71'? Looking through the productions, NT11 \u2192 't6' is production 9, NT20 \u2192 't50' (production 19), NT30 \u2192 't30' (not listed), but not seeing 't71' as a terminal. Wait, looking back, does any non-terminal produce 't71'? Looking at the grammar, NT10 \u2192 't32' (production 16), NT1 \u2192 't6' (14), NT26 \u2192 't28' (26's productions: 22, 21, 32, etc.), I don't see any NT that produces 't71'. Wait, perhaps NT0 \u2192 't61' is production 15. So NT10 \u2192 't32' (16), NT7 \u2192 't3' (3), NT0 \u2192 't10' (17?), maybe not. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, in the rules for NT22, for example, NT22 production like 't22' may correspond to a non-terminal. Alternatively, I might have to see each production and map the right-hand sides to their possible left-hand sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can create a list of all the non-terminals that can produce each terminal. For example, for each terminal token, collect all non-terminals A such that A can produce that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't36' (production 34)\n- NT3 \u2192 't31' (production 33)\n- NT2 \u2192 't23' (production 22)\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' (productions 41, 45)\n- NT4 \u2192 't14' (productions 14, maybe others)\n- NT6 \u2192 't68' (production 6)\n- NT7 \u2192 't3' (32)\n- NT8 \u2192 't27' (productions 27, 68)\n- NT14 \u2192 't65' (28)\n- NT15 \u2192 't6' (15, 23, 29)\n- NT18 \u2192 't66' (66)\n- NT20 \u2192 't50' (19, 29)\n- NT21 \u2192 't8' (7)\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' (22)\n- NT23 \u2192 '40' (productions 40, 42)\n- NT24 \u2192 't22' (22)\n- NT25 \u2192 't77' and 't34' (25, 12)\n- NT26 \u2192 't28' (19, 31, etc.)\n- NT27 \u2192 't9' (27)\n- NT28 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That typically makes parsing easier using algorithms like CYK, but I'm not limited to using that; I just need to derive the string from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to check is: `t30 t23 t34 t11 t50 t52 t14 t23 t41 t84 t69 t43 t14 t10 t71 t38 t36 t36 t75 t25 t41 t28 t16 t54 t56 t23 t25 t22 t61 t84 t16`.\n\nI notice that each token in the string is a terminal, like 't30', 't23', etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left side, and the right side is two non-terminals. So, for the string to be generated, each of these terminals must correspond to a left-hand side of a production, and the sequence must form a valid derivation.\n\nLet me look at the grammar's productions and see which terminals correspond to which non-terminals. For example, certain productions seem to have specific terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT2 -> NT15 NT18\nNT24 -> NT32 NT23\nBut I also see that NT23 has several productions, but in the grammar, NT23 is written as NT23 -> NT22 NT27, etc. Wait, but some of the NT entries have a mix of NTs and terminals. For example:\n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\nNT27 -> NT11 NT4\nNT31 -> NT25 NT13\nNT33 -> NT33 NT19\nNT22 -> NT29 NT2\nNT13 -> NT10 NT21\nNT24 -> NT71 NT24\nNT15 -> NT21 NT23\nNT17 -> NT16 NT19\nNT0 -> NT71\nWait, in the grammar, some of the productions for NT entries have both NTs and terminals. For example, looking at NT21:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6 | NT6 NT0 | NT21 NT24 | NT18 NT26 | NT34 NT28 | NT19 NT26 | NT23 NT28 | NT16 NT28 | NT19 NT26 | NT23 NT28 | NT16 NT18 | NT19 NT26 | NT34 NT28 | NT15 NT32 | NT10 -> ... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the NTs in the grammar expand to terminals. Looking more carefully, I see productions like:\n\nNT17 -> 't14' \u2192 Wait, that's a terminal. So NT17 is a production that produces the string 't14'. Similarly, other NTs might have terminal symbols.\n\nWait, the grammar has some rules where the right-hand side is a terminal and an NT. For example:\n\nNT25 -> 't41' \u2192 Wait, does that mean that NT25 can produce the terminal 't41'? Similarly, other NTs might produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT1 -> 't29'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT8 -> 't27'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT16 -> 't6'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't70'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT34 -> 't14'\n- NT7 -> 't84'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT12 -> 't14'\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT16 -> 't10'\n- NT19 -> 't25'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT33 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT14 -> 't51'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't71'\n- NT18 -> 't36'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT18 -> 't70'\n- NT34 -> 't36'\n- NT29 -> 't7'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT12 -> 't14'\n- NT3 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't10'\n- NT19 -> 't22'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT11 -> 't14'\n\nWait, some of these are actually terminals with specific letters. So for example, NT17 can only produce 't14'. Similarly, NT25 can produce 't41'. And other NTs have terminals.\n\nSo, for any production that includes a terminal like 't30', I need to find which non-terminal can produce that. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT34 -> 't30' | 't14'\nSo NT34 can expand to 't30' or 't14'.\n\nIn our string, the first token is 't30', which must match one of the terminals in the grammar. So looking for NT34's production which includes 't30', that's fine.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't30' comes 't23'. So after NT34, we need to produce 't23'. Looking at NT34's production, if it's splitting into 't30' and another non-terminal that can produce 't23'. Wait, 't23' is itself a terminal. So looking for NTs that can produce 't23'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT24 -> 't22' and 't8' (from NT24's productions). Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Wait, let's check the NTs that produce 't23'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nWait, wait, I think I may have made a mistake. Because 't23' is a terminal, I need to find which NT can produce 't23'. Looking at the grammar entries:\n\nLooking through the terminals listed:\n\nLooking at each production, if it's a terminal, like NT25 -> 't41', then the NT25 can produce 't41'.\n\nLooking for 't23' in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't23' except when it's part of a production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps in the grammar, some of the right-hand sides include a mix of NTs and terminals. For example, NT2 -> NT15 NT18, and both NT15 and NT18 have terminals in their productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar's productions can also involve terminals. So each symbol in the string must come from a terminal in one of the production rules.\n\nWait, in the original grammar, all the right-hand sides are two non-terminals or a mix of NTs and terminals. So for the string, each token must correspond either directly to a terminal production in the grammar or be part of a NT that can derive to that terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each token in the string is produced directly by an NT. For example, if NT34 can produce 't30', then 't30' is a terminal. So in the string, each token must be a terminal that some NT can produce as a single step.\n\nBut looking again, it's not that simple because some NTs expand into two NTs, possibly leading to more expansions. So the process is to start from S and derive the string step by step, ensuring all expansions match.\n\nBut let me approach this"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-620","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with determining whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a single terminal. The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t31 t68 t77 t0 t60 t34 t40 t60 t14 t70 t43 t16 t17 t52 t40 t6 t8 t14 t54 t16 t38 t50 t22 t71 t10 t49 t61 t0 t3 t52 t6 t69`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like the top-level non-terminals are S, and the productions for S are all the combinations of two NTs, like NT21, NT31, etc. Each of these NTs has their own productions, some recursive, others with terminal outputs (like 't3') or more complex non-terminals.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, the derivation process can be deterministic if the grammar is suitable, but here, with so many rules and possible cycles, it might not be straightforward. However, perhaps I can look for a leftmost derivation that constructs the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with `t31`. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT31 has a production: NT31 -> NT34 NT1. So, to get `t31`, the derivation must start with NT31, which becomes NT34 and NT1. NT34 is a terminal and has a production -> 't34', and NT1's production is -> 't1'. So, the first part of the string `t31 t68` doesn't seem to fit directly because I'm seeing 't34' in the string but the first token is 't31'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Looking at the grammar, the productions:\n\nNT31 -> NT34 NT1\nAnd NT34 -> 't34', NT1 -> 't1'.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is `t31 t68`. But according to the grammar, NT31 produces 't34' and 't1', not 't31'. So, maybe the first token is supposed to be 't34' or 't1'. But it's 't31'. That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the string is not in the language because the starting NT to produce 't31' must come from NT31, which only produces 't34 t1', not 't31 t68'.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me double-check.\n\nThe grammar's top-level productions are like S -> NT21 NT28, etc. So, S is the start symbol, and it's a combination of two non-terminals. The string starts with `t31`, so the first step would be to look for how to derive 't31'.\n\nBut looking at all the NTs, none of the productions produce 't31' directly except NT33 and others? Wait, no. Let me check each NT.\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\n- NT31: Only produces 't34' and 't1', as per the rule NT31 -> NT34 NT1, and NT34 -> 't34', NT1 -> 't1'.\n- So, NT31 never produces 't31' on its own. So, the first token in the string is 't31', which suggests that we have to find a way to derive 't31' from some NT, but none do that. Therefore, the string can't be derived because the initial part doesn't match any production.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check NT33 and others.\n\nLooking at the NTs:\n\n- NT33 has productions: NT33 -> NT18 NT22, NT29 NT28, etc. None of these produce 't31' directly.\n- NT15: I see NT15 -> NT21 NT23, NT27 -> ... Not producing 't31'.\n- It seems that none of the NTs have a production that starts with 't31' except possibly in some indirect way.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm considering the wrong NT. Or perhaps the string is supposed to have 't31' but it's not possible. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a recursive path.\n\nWait, the first token is 't31', which is supposed to come from NT31. But no production in the grammar produces NT31 as a terminal. So, the string can't be generated, meaning the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me make sure. The NTs that produce terminals are things like NT5 -> 't41', NT17 -> 't14', etc. So, the string starts with 't31', which is a terminal. Looking at all NTs, is there any NT that directly or indirectly can produce 't31'? No, because 't31' is a terminal and it's generated only by NT31, which cannot produce it as a terminal; instead, NT31 produces two other NTs.\n\nTherefore, since 't31' cannot be directly produced by any NT, the string cannot be in the language. Hence, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string cannot be generated by the provided grammar because the initial token `t31` is a terminal and there is no production rule that directly or indirectly produces `t31`.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. My string to evaluate is a series of terminals, so I need to see if there's a way to derive this string using the productions.\n\nThe string is: t68 t50 t68 t41 t40 t3 t40 t60 t60 t40 t65 t32 t77 t25 t25 t69 t25 t3 t0 t25 t54 t34 t66 t66 t30 t25 t38 t14 t30 t12 t30 t22.\n\nWow, that's a long string. Let me try to parse it. Each terminal corresponds to a production rule. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of terminals in the string should be one less than the number of steps in the derivation, but I might not need that right now.\n\nI think the best approach is to see which non-terminals can produce which terminals. The non-terminals are S, NT2, NT3, NT5, etc. Some of them directly produce terminals. Let me look for those.\n\nFrom the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> t3 (from NT3 \u2192 t3)\n- NT12 \u2192 t16 (from NT12 \u2192 t16)\nWait, looking deeper, I see:\n\n- NT12: NT12 \u2192 t16\n- NT12 \u2192 t14\n- NT3 \u2192 t12\n- NT34 \u2192 t30 or t14\n- NT7 \u2192 t84\n- NT14 \u2192 t51 or t84\n- NT18 \u2192 t66 or t84\n- NT25 \u2192 t77\n- NT15 \u2192 t68 or t84\n- NT10 \u2192 t0\n- NT27 \u2192 t71 or t74\nWait, maybe it's easier to start from the string and see if each terminal can be matched by a production. \n\nLet's list the terminals in the string in order:\n\nt68, t50, t68, t41, t40, t3, t40, t60, t60, t40, t65, t32, t77, t25, t25, t69, t25, t3, t0, t25, t54, t34, t66, t66, t30, t25, t38, t14, t30, t12, t30, t22.\n\nWait, some of these look like they might correspond to direct productions. Let's see:\n\n- t3: From NT3 \u2192 t3.\n- t41: Looking through the rules, I see NT5 \u2192 t41 or NT5 \u2192 NT5 t20. Wait, actually, NT5 can also produce NT3 t40. Hmm, but in the rules, NT5 has two options: NT5 \u2192 t41 and NT5 \u2192 NT5 t20. But since all productions are in CNF, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Wait, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So NT5 \u2192 t41 seems valid because it's a terminal.\n\nSo t41 could come from NT5 \u2192 t41.\n\nSimilarly, t34: I don't see any direct t34, but looking through the rules, NT17 \u2192 t34 OR NT17 \u2192 t17 t18? Wait, no, checking the rules again, I see:\n\nWait, the rules have NT17 \u2192 t49 or t16 t18, depending on which production. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps t34 comes from NT34. Looking through the rules:\n\nYes, I see NT34 \u2192 t30 or t14. So t34 would need to come from NT34 \u2192 t34, but wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT34 producing t34. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, NT34 is written as:\n\nNT34 -> t34 or t14? Let me check the given rules again. Wait, the rules include:\n\n- NT34 -> t30\n- NT34 -> t14\n\nSo NT34 can produce t30 or t14, but not t34. Hmm. Then how does t34 in the string get produced? Unless I'm missing a rule, perhaps t34 comes from another non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but I need to go with the given rules.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the number of non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe the string is built in a way where some NT dependencies are possible. Let me try to match the string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead try to work backwards or look for the start symbol S.\n\nThe string starts with t68. From the grammar, I need to see which non-terminals produce t68.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT15 \u2192 t68 or t84. So t68 can come from NT15 \u2192 t68.\n\nSo the start sequence is S \u2192 NT2 NT23 (from S \u2192 NT2 NT23). Wait, but S also has other options. Let me see all the S productions:\n\n- S can produce NT2 NT23, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25.\n\nLet me pick one and see if it can match the start of the string, which is t68 t50...\n\nWait, but if S \u2192 NT2 NT23, then let me see what NT2 and NT23 can produce. NT2 has a production: NT2 \u2192 t23 or t38. So perhaps S can produce t23 t23 or t38 t38. But starting with t68, let me see how that could work.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other S productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Let me see the production for NT32 and NT14.\n\nFrom the rules, NT32 \u2192 t54 or t18 (wait, checking the rules: I see NT32 \u2192 t54 or t2 (but t2 is a terminal?). Wait, no, in CNF, non-terminals can't produce terminals as rules, since all are two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, looking again: NT32 -> NT18 t14. Wait, no, according to the rules, NT32 is:\n\nNT32 -> NT18 t32 or something else? Let me check:\n\nThe rules for NT32 are: NT32 \u2192 t54 or t14. Wait, no. From the given rules, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nWait, I see:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 t54\n- NT32 \u2192 t2 (Wait, but t2 is a terminal? No, in CNF, only non-terminals can be on the left. So perhaps the actual rule is that NT32 can produce NT18 t23 or something else. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me go through the rules carefully.\n\nLooking at the top of the provided rules:\n\nThe first few lines after the grammar header are likely non-terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. CNF is useful for certain parsing algorithms and simplifies the structure of the grammar, making it easier to analyze for strings.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t60 t30 t70 t28 t23 t49 t32 t84 t7 t77 t38 t14 t51 t38 t22 t17 t23 t31 t65 t54 t43 t50 t65 t70 t8 t52 t30 t34 t70 t10 t10 t77 t50`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can be a terminal. However, in this case, the terminal symbols are evident from the string, so I'll need to see how they are derived from the non-terminals.\n\nI'll start by examining the first symbol of the string, which is 't60'. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals directly expand into 't' symbols. For example, NT24 \u2192 't22', so if 't22' is involved, that's a terminal.\n\nWait, no, 't60' isn't a direct terminal. I need to check if any non-terminal directly produces 't60'. Looking through all the production rules, I don't see any that directly give 't60'. That's a problem because if 't60' isn't a terminal on the right-hand side of any production, it can't be produced by the grammar. So, does that mean the string can't be derived?\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each production again:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't61' (among others)\nNT10 \u2192 't32'\nNT11 \u2192 't6'\nNT12 \u2192 't16' or 't14'\nNT14 \u2192 't51' or 't65'\nNT15 \u2192 't71' or 't10' or 't68'\nNT16 \u2192 't6' or 't18' or 't15' or 't6' or 't3' or 't66' or 't41' or 't68' or 't10' or 't84' or 't36' or 't70' or 't11' or 't27' or 't33' or 't18' or 't28' or 't10' or 't19' or 't84' or 't14' or 't23' or 't24' or 't71' or 't8' or 't6' or 't34'\nNT17 \u2192 't49' or multiple others\nNT18 \u2192 't66' or 't27' or 't14' etc.\nNT19 \u2192 't32' or 't50'\nNT20 \u2192 't29' or 't32'\nNT21 \u2192 't8' or 't69' or 't24' or 't77' etc.\nNT22 \u2192 't8' or 't22' or 't33' etc.\nNT23 \u2192 't43' or 't56' or 't73' etc.\nNT24 \u2192 't71' or 't70' etc.\nNT25 \u2192 't77' or 't27' etc.\nNT26 \u2192 't28' or 't18' etc.\nNT27 \u2192 't9' or 't9' etc.\nNT28 \u2192 't50' or 't27' etc.\nNT29 \u2192 't27' or 't22' etc.\nNT30 \u2192 Does any non-terminal produce 't30' directly? Looking through the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 't50', and another NT21 \u2192 't6'. Looking further, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly expands to 't30'. NT30 is not present in any rule as a direct terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. I think I might have misread the rules. For example, NT28 \u2192 't50' is present, but no 't30' as a standalone symbol. So the string starts with 't60', which isn't a direct terminal.\n\nIf that's the case, maybe the grammar doesn't include 't60' as a terminal. But wait, the start symbol is S, and the initial productions are S \u2192 NT21 NT28. So S starts by expanding into two non-terminals: NT21 and NT28.\n\nLooking at the initial rules, NT21 can expand into multiple things, including 't8' (from NT21 \u2192 't8'), and if 't60' is part of the string, perhaps it's derived from one of the non-terminals that eventually produce it through a series of productions.\n\nBut since 't60' isn't a direct terminal, unless it's produced by some non-terminal, the string can't be derived. So if none of the non-terminals directly produce 't60', the string isn't in the language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a connection where 't60' is part of a production. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that immediately expands to 't60'. So perhaps the grammar doesn't generate any string starting with 't60', making the answer 'No'.\n\nHowever, I might be overlooking something. For instance, maybe there's a path through the grammar where a non-terminal can produce 't60' after several steps. To check that, I would need to perform a derivation, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if 't60' appears as part of the derived string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nFrom NT21, possible productions include NT21 \u2192 't8', which would produce 't8' as part of S's expansion. Similarly, NT28 \u2192 't50'. So if S produces NT21 NT28, and NT21 \u2192 't8', NT28 \u2192 't50', then the string starts with 't8 t50', but our target string starts with 't60 t30...', which isn't compatible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a longer derivation where 't60' comes from somewhere else. For example, maybe NT0 can produce 't60' somehow. Looking at the rules, NT0 \u2192 't84', 't61', 't11', 't10', 't17', etc. But none directly produce 't60'.\n\nWait, maybe it's via a chain of productions. For example, NT0 \u2192 't10', which could be further expanded, but again, 't10' isn't a terminal. It seems that all the terminals are specific strings like 't28', 't14', etc., but 't60' isn't one of them.\n\nSo, if 't60' isn't a terminal in any production, the string can't be generated by this grammar. That would mean the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-645","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol. So, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided starts with S and has several productions. For example, S \u2192 NT2 NT28, which means the start symbol S expands into NT2 and NT28. Each of these NTs seems to be non-terminals. So, the string I need to check, which starts with 't68', must be derived by applying these productions until I only have terminals left.\n\nLooking at the string: `t68 t16 t60 t43 t22 t69 t36 t0 t43 t36 t61 t50 t69 t32 t22 t66 t71 t16 t61 t56 t66 t56 t56 t52 t30 t36 t7 t65 t61 t28 t11 t41 t70`.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number seems to be a terminal symbol. The task is to see if this string can be derived starting from S by applying the grammar rules.\n\nI need to think about how the string is built up. Starting from S, which is a non-terminal, and each production rule must generate the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step either combines two non-terminals or introduces a terminal.\n\nBut manually trying to parse such a long string would take a lot of steps. Maybe there's a pattern or something I can notice. Alternatively, I could look for the production rules that generate the terminals in the string and see if the structure matches.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string:\n\nt68, t16, t60, t43, t22, t69, t36, t0, t43, t36, t61, t50, t69, t32, t22, t66, t71, t16, t61, t56, t66, t56, t56, t52, t30, t36, t7, t65, t61, t28, t11, t41, t70.\n\nNow, looking at the terminals, perhaps I can trace back from the start symbol S and see if I can derive each terminal.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT2 NT28. So S is replaced by NT2 and NT28. Each of these is a non-terminal, so we need to expand them.\n\nNT2: Looking at the grammar, NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18. So NT2 becomes NT15 and NT18.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT21 NT23. So NT15 becomes NT21 and NT23.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6. So NT21 becomes NT26 and NT6.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT28 NT22. So NT26 becomes NT28 and NT22.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT18 NT32. So NT22 becomes NT18 and NT32.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT20 NT0. So NT18 becomes NT20 and NT0.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see t68 early on. Let me check which production introduces t68.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31. So NT6 can produce NT10 and NT31.\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT25 NT32 (from S \u2192 NT25 NT32) and other rules. Wait, from the grammar, NT10 can be produced by several rules, but looking for the first occurrence, NT10 \u2192 NT25 NT32. So NT10 \u2192 NT25 and NT32.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT5 NT13. So NT25 becomes NT5 and NT13.\n\nNT5 is a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT5 can be broken down in multiple ways. For instance, NT5 \u2192 NT41, which is a terminal. Or NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20, so it's a non-terminal production.\n\nWait, in the string, there's a t50, which is likely derived from NT50. But looking through the grammar, I don't see NT50 as a terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe starting from the string and trying to reduce it using the grammar rules. That might be more manageable.\n\nEach production in CNF either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal. So, looking at the string, let's see if we can group parts into the allowed productions.\n\nThe string starts with 't68 t16'. Since each step can produce two symbols, perhaps 't68' comes from a production of NT6. From the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31. So 't68' would be part of NT6, but NT6 \u2192 NT10 and NT31. Then, each of those would need to produce their respective terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, 't68' is the first symbol. So perhaps the initial parts are derived from NT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31. Then, let's see:\n\nt68 is part of NT6: so NT6 \u2192 something \u2192 t68. But NT6's productions are all to other non-terminals except in cases where it's the direct symbol. Wait, checking the grammar for NT6, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31. No direct terminal production, so the terminal t68 must come from somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the productions where a terminal is directly produced. Let me check the grammar for such instances.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31 (no terminal)\nNT10 \u2192 NT25 NT32 (no terminal)\nWait, wait. Let me scan the entire grammar for any production where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. For example:\n\nAt the bottom of the grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 't41', and NT17 \u2192 't14', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nSo, these are the bottom productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT21 \u2192 't8'\n- NT26 \u2192 't3'\n- NT18 \u2192 't36'\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\n- Wait, no, checking the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking deeper, I notice in the grammar, several rules produce terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' (from NT5 \u2192 't41')\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' (from NT17 \u2192 't14')\n- NT6 \u2192 't68' (wait, no. Let me recheck the grammar rules provided. Scanning through:\n\nI see:\n\n\"NT6 -> NT10 NT31\"\n\nAnd also:\n\n\"NT26 -> NT7\"\n\nWait, no, looking again carefully, perhaps I misread. Let's check:\n\nLooking for 't68', perhaps in the grammar, NT66 is 't68' or something. Oh, wait, in the lower part, I see:\n\n\"NT6 -> NT10 NT31\" (not a terminal)\n\"NT7 -> 't3'\"\n\nSo NT7 \u2192 't3'. Similarly, NT18 \u2192 't36', and others.\n\nWait, so some non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't3' (term)\n- NT18 \u2192 't36' (term)\n- NT6 \u2192 't68' (term)\n- And others?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, perhaps:\n\nLet me look for any rules that have a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt the bottom of the grammar, the rules are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't41'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32\n\nwait...

In CNF, every production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, the start symbol can appear on the right, but other productions must have two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Wait, no, let me correct that: Chomsky Normal Form requires that every production be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the initial production which can be A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But wait, in this case, looking at the grammar, it seems that some rules have three non-terminals, like S -> NT21 NT32 NT28. Wait, no, wait\u2014that's not the case. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the start symbol S produces NT21 NT32 and NT28, which are each non-terminals, so S -> NT21 NT32 NT28? No, wait, looking at the first few rules: the first rule is S -> NT21 NT32 NT28. Wait, no, looking at the first rule, it says S -> NT21 NT32 NT28. Wait, but that has three non-terminals on the right-hand side. That would mean the grammar isn't in CNF. Wait, am I misreading that? Let me check the given grammar again. Oh no, the first rule is S -> NT21 NT32 NT28, which is three non-terminals. Hmm, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding CNF\u2014that in CNF, all productions except the start symbol expansion have two non-terminals, but the start symbol can have three or more. Actually, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form allows the start symbol to have a terminal on the left, but all other productions have two non-terminals on the right. So maybe this grammar has a mix because S is the only one that can produce a start symbol plus two non-terminals? Or perhaps it's a variation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The standard CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC and A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, for each step, we can expand each non-terminal using these rules. The string provided consists of a sequence of terminals, each being either 't' followed by a number, like t61, t28, etc. The string is: t61 t28 t66 t60 t65 t11 t56 t3 t8 t7 t65 t23 t34 t12 t10 t30 t54 t7 t10 t28 t32 t77 t40 t36 t70 t61 t28 t0 t51 t36 t17 t30 t10 t84.\n\nSo, the string length is 36 elements, each being a terminal. Now, I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nBut doing this step-by-step for such a long string is time-consuming. An alternative approach is to see if each terminal in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar and whether they can be derived correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can reverse-engineer the parsing process. Starting from the start symbol S, I can see if the string can be split into segments that match the productions.\n\nBut given the time, maybe I can look for the production rules and see if each terminal in the string is a terminal that has a production in the grammar. Wait, no, because the string is a sequence of terminals, and the grammar's RHS consists of non-terminals, each of which eventually produce terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check each terminal in the string to see if it's a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that many of the NT symbols are further expanded, but some seem to be terminals. For example, NT17 is defined as NT5 NT28, but some other NT symbols have a 't' as a terminal. For example, looking in the grammar, I see rules like NT3 -> t3, NT4 -> t8, etc. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nYes, for example, NT9 -> t3, NT34 -> t14, NT0 -> t61, etc. So many of the NT symbols are either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each terminal must be present in the grammar. Let's check each terminal in the string:\n\nt61, t28, t66, t60, t65, t11, t56, t3, t8, t7, t65, t23, t34, t12, t10, t30, t54, t7, t10, t28, t32, t77, t40, t36, t70, t61, t28, t0, t51, t36, t17, t30, t10, t84.\n\nNow, let's see if all these terminals exist in the grammar. From the given rules, I can see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 -> t3 (so t3 is a terminal)\nNT17 -> t14\nNT0 -> t61\nNT10 -> t32\nNT15 -> t71\nNT21 is defined with multiple rules, but I see in the rules that NT21 can eventually derive t8, t14, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, for example, in the production NT21 -> NT26 NT6, and NT26 -> NT28 NT22, NT22 -> NT18 NT32, and so on, but some of the productions for NT21 have terminals. For example, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, no, actually, the grammar has some rules ending with 't' and numbers, like:\n\nNT5 -> 't41'\nNT17 -> 't14'\nNT0 -> 't61'\nNT15 -> 't6'\nNT7 -> 't3'\nNT18 -> 't66'\nNT0 -> 't17'\nNT26 -> 't28'\nNT18 -> 't41'\nNT3 -> 't31'\nNT14 -> 't65'\nNT3 -> 't7'\nNT6 -> 't68'\nNT13 -> 't6'\nNT24 -> 't22'\nNT14 -> 't51'\nNT10 -> 't0'\nNT28 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't41'\nNT25 -> 't77'\nNT15 -> 't6'\nNT23 -> 't43'\nNT21 -> 't8'\nNT26 -> 't71'\nNT18 -> 't36'\nNT11 -> 't6'\nNT18 -> 't70'\nNT34 -> 't30'\nNT34 -> 't14'\nNT7 -> 't84'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT12 -> 't14'\nNT3 -> 't12'\nNT16 -> 't10'\nNT19 -> 't25'\nNT33 -> 't49'\nNT15 -> 't28'\nNT33 -> 't60'\nNT15 -> 't34'\nNT24 -> 't71'\nNT14 -> 't84'\nNT32 -> 't54'\nNT21 -> 't77'\nNT15 -> 't68'\nNT23 -> 't52'\nNT22 -> 't8'\nNT23 -> 't56'\nNT13 -> 't71'\nNT5 -> 't84'\nNT19 -> 't22'\nNT2 -> 't23'\nNT17 -> 't49'\nNT23 -> 't40'\nNT2 -> 't38'\nNT21 -> 't69'\nNT31 -> 't75'\nNT11 -> 't14'\n\nHmm, from this, it's clear that certain NT symbols map to terminals, like NT21 -> t8, NT0 -> t61, etc. So, I'll check each terminal in the string to see if they are present as terminals in any of the NT rules.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt61: exists as NT0 -> t61\nt28: possible, NT28 -> t50 or NT28 is part of a production, but I see NT5 -> 't41', NT17 -> 't14', etc. Wait, looking at the NT definitions, is t28 a terminal?

{"custom_id":"request-666","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and it's rewritten in terms of non-terminals NT21, NT32, and NT24. Each of those non-terminals can be rewritten into combinations of other non-terminals. This seems a bit complex, but I'll note that all the non-terminals eventually derive into terminal symbols (like 't' followed by numbers) or other non-terminals.\n\nThe given string is: \nt31 t40 t51 t66 t8 t40 t71 t65 t11 t3 t25 t34 t84 t23 t30 t68 t84 t84 t31 t41 t65 t68 t50 t8 t65 t54 t54 t12 t11 t54 t10 t7 t30 t7.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI know that each step in the derivation uses the productions given in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal). The string is a series of terminals, so each symbol in the string must correspond to either a terminal production directly from a non-terminal or be broken down into smaller parts.\n\nI'll start by looking for non-terminals that directly correspond to these terminal symbols. For example, NT33 is 't33' and NT4 is 't4', etc. But first, I should probably list all the productions and see how each terminal is derived.\n\nWait, actually, instead of looking for direct terminal productions, let me think about the overall structure.\n\nThe start symbol S can generate NT21, NT32, or NT24. Each of these can then generate combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t31. From the grammar, looking at the non-terminals, NT3 is t3, but I don't see an NT31 with a terminal of t31. Wait, but looking back at the grammar, there's NT31 \u2192 NT25 NT13. But according to some productions, maybe NT31 has a terminal derivation. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT31 -> NT25 NT13\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7\nNT3 -> NT5 NT7\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\nNT12 -> NT4 NT0\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\nNT12 -> NT15 NT3\nNT0 -> NT18 NT5\nNT17 -> NT5 NT28\nNT10 -> NT12 NT21\nNT25 -> NT5 NT13\nNT15 -> NT21 NT23\n...\nWait, there's an NT3 -> 't3' and NT3 -> 't7'? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me scan through the grammar to find any productions that result in terminals.\n\nWait, some entries look like:\nNT17 -> 't14' \nNT0 -> 't61' \nNT15 -> 't71' \nNT10 -> 't32' \nNT16 -> 't6' \nNT7 -> 't3' \nNT18 -> 't66' \nNT0 -> 't17' \nAnd others like NT5 -> 't41' and so on.\n\nSo certain non-terminals correspond directly to specific terminal strings. For example, NT17 \u2192 't14', which matches the 4th symbol in the string, which is t14. So that's a match.\n\nLooking back at the string:\n\nPositions: \n1: t31\n2: t40\n3: t51\n4: t66\n5: t8\n6: t40\n7: t71\n8: t65\n9: t11\n10: t3\n11: t25\n12: t34\n13: t84\n14: t23\n15: t30\n16: t7\n17: t38\n18: t29\n19: t65\n20: t68\n21: t50\n22: t8\n23: t65\n24: t54\n25: t54\n26: t12\n27: t11\n28: t54\n29: t10\n30: t7\n31: t30\n32: t7\n\nWait, but I'm making a mistake in counting. Let me get the exact string again:\n\nt31 t40 t51 t66 t8 t40 t71 t65 t11 t3 t25 t34 t84 t23 t30 t68 t84 t84 t31 t41 t65 t68 t50 t8 t65 t54 t54 t12 t11 t54 t10 t7 t30 t7.\n\nSo, starting from the beginning:\n\n1. t31\n2. t40\n3. t51\n4. t66\n5. t8\n6. t40\n7. t71\n8. t65\n9. t11\n10. t3\n11. t25\n12. t34\n13. t84\n14. t23\n15. t30\n16. t7\n17. t38\n18. t29\n19. t65\n20. t68\n21. t50\n22. t8\n23. t65\n24. t54\n25. t54\n26. t12\n27. t11\n28. t54\n29. t10\n30. t7\n31. t30\n32. t7\n\nWait, that's 32 symbols. Now, I need to see how each of these terminals can be derived.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\n1. t31: NT31 \u2192 't31'. Looking at the grammar, NT31 is rewritten as NT25 NT13. However, the terminal 't31' is directly derived from NT31, but in the grammar, NT31's production is to NT25 NT13, not directly to t31. So how does it get t31?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the productions, yes, I see:\n\nNT31 -> NT25 NT13\n\nWait, but none of the rules for NT31 directly produce 't31'. Unless I'm missing something. Let me check if any other non-terminal directly ends with 't31' or if there's a way to have 't31' in the terminal string.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see each symbol and try to find a non-terminal that can directly produce it. If each symbol in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that can derive to it, then it's possible. Otherwise, if any symbol doesn't match, it's impossible.\n\nLooking through the string:\n\nt31: Is there an NT that directly produces 't31'? From the production rules, I don't see an NT with 't31'. NT31 is rewritten into NT25 NT13, which are non-terminals. So 't31' would have to come from somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe it's derived indirectly. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce 't31' through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, for example, NT17 \u2192 't14', which is another symbol. So that's a direct match for symbol 14 above.\n\nBut perhaps I should work my way down the string, seeing if each symbol can be matched by a production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should see if the entire string can be broken down into non-terminals that are part of the grammar.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck.

{"custom_id":"request-685","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string I'm supposed to evaluate.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. All the non-terminals are on the left, and the rules seem to be a mix of terminal and non-terminal productions. For example, S -> NT2 NT28 and similar rules.\n\nThe string I have to evaluate is a sequence of tokens with several spaces. I notice that the grammar uses several non-terminals that eventually derive into 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. For instance, NT25 -> 't77', NT22 -> 't8', etc. So, each non-terminal eventually translates into a specific terminal string.\n\nMy approach should be to check if the string can be broken down into the non-terminal rules as per the grammar. The string is a linear sequence, so I'll process it step by step, trying to match the productions.\n\nLet me write down the string to process: t69 t6 t77 t65 t23 t65 t40 t60 t8 t77 t84 t49 t43 t50 t10 t41 t10 t23 t38 t28 t38 t22 t38 t50 t11 t69 t28 t14 t34 t49 t6 t60 t66 t71 t51.\n\nI'll start from the beginning of the string and see if I can find a way to match the start symbol, which is S.\n\nLooking at S, it can derive into several combinations. The first few symbols are t69 t6 t77 t65 t23 t65 t40... Let me see which production of S could start with t69.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT0 -> 't61' and NT10 -> 't32' but not t69. Wait, is there any NT that starts with t69?\n\nWait, looking at the NT production rules, I don't see any NT that directly goes to a single 't69'. Let me check all the production rules for NT.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT0 -> 't61', NT10 -> 't32', NT20 -> 't54', NT7 -> 't3', NT18 -> 't66', etc. There's no NT that directly produces 't69'. Hmm, but the string starts with t69, which might be part of a longer derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all NT rules. No, I don't see any NT directly producing 't69'. So that might be a problem. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for terminals in the grammar. Some NTs produce multiple terminals, like NT23 -> t40, which is a single terminal, but another NT might lead to multiple. Wait, no, looking again, many NT productions derive into a single terminal. For example, NT0 -> 't61', so that's one terminal, NT10 -> 't32' is another, etc.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t69, which doesn't directly correspond to any NT production. That seems like a dead end. But perhaps t69 is part of a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again more thoroughly. Looking at the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produce a terminal 't69'. So that suggests that perhaps the string can't be derived because it starts with a terminal that isn't allowed by the grammar. But that seems unlikely. Maybe I'm missing a NT that eventually leads to 't69'.\n\nWait, looking through the NT rules, let's see if I can find a chain that leads to 't69'. For example, is there an NT that leads to 't69' through a series of productions?\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see NT15 -> 't71', NT23 -> t43, NT2 -> t23, and so on. But nothing leads directly to 't69'. So perhaps 't69' is not a terminal in the grammar, which makes the string invalid.\n\nBut that can't be right, can it? Maybe I should double-check if I missed any NT that produces 't69' elsewhere. Let me look again:\n\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n\n... and so on.\n\nNo, I don't see any NT production for 't69'. So, the string starts with 't69', which cannot be derived from any of the NT productions. Therefore, the string is not in the language because the first symbol is invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps the NT rules are nested differently. Maybe the NT rules can be composed in such a way that multiple steps derive the same terminal. For example, maybe some NTs derive into sequences that can produce 't69', but I don't see any such rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the NT rules. Let me re-examine the grammar for any NT that eventually leads to 't69'.\n\nLooking again, NT10 -> 't32', which leads to 't32' as a terminal. But 't69' isn't there. Similarly, NT2 -> 't23' leads to 't23', etc. I don't see any NT that produces 't69'. Therefore, the string starts with a terminal that the grammar doesn't allow, which means the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the user provided the string, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe 't69' is part of a longer derivation from a non-terminal that I'm not considering. Let me try to reconstruct a possible derivation.\n\nPerhaps the string starts with t69, which would require that the first symbol comes from a production that starts with NT0, but in the grammar, starting symbol S can't go directly to 't69' because its productions are combinations, like S -> NT2 NT28. So, the first two symbols must come from two NT productions.\n\nBut in the string, the first five symbols are t69 t6 t77 t65 t23... which would require NT2 (from S) to produce t69, but looking at the NT2 rule, NT2 -> 't23' among others. So, that wouldn't make sense, as the first symbol needs to be 't69', which isn't produced by NT2. Unless NT2 can produce t69 somehow, but looking at the NT2 rules, it doesn't. It can produce 't23' as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I need to see the possible ways NT2 can break down. Let me check NT2's rules.\n\nLooking back, NT2's rules are:\n- NT2 -> 't54' (possibly)\nWait, no, looking again: NT23 -> 't54'? No, I don't see NT2 directly producing t54.\n\nWait, NT23 is derived from other NS. Let me check all NT2 rules.\n\nWait, the grammar's NT2 rules:\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT2 -> NT15 NT18\n\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT6\n\n- NT22 -> NT29 NT2\n\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n\n- NT13 -> NT10 NT21\n\n- etc.\n\nWait, NT2 can be broken down into NT15 and NT18. Looking at NT15's production: NT15 -> NT21 NT23. So NT15 would need to derive into the concatenation of NT21 and NT23.\n\nBut this is getting too deep. Maybe I should approach this differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. So the left-hand side symbols generate pairs of symbols until they reach terminals.\n\nGiven the string starts with t69, which must come directly from a non-terminal that produces t69. But none of the NTs directly produce t69, as far as I can see. Therefore, the first symbol is invalid, so the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nThus, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-681","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar productions. Since it's in CNF, each production only has two non-terminals on the right side, and the terminals are single symbols. For example, I see S \u2192 NT2 NT28, so S can be replaced by NT2 and NT28. Then, each NTx can either be replaced by two other NTs or a terminal, like NT21 -> NT32 NT29 or NT21 -> NT21 NT6.\n\nThe string to check is: t16 t65 t40 t71 t65 t6 t22 t50 t65 t36 t60 t61 t61 t12 t34 t41 t7 t25 t34 t11 t22 t30 t10 t31 t28 t10 t0 t65 t50 t50 t32 t60 t11 t7 t12.\n\nI notice that most of these are 't' followed by numbers, which look like terminals. But some are like 't17' which might be non-terminals, but the grammar uses NTx instead. Wait, the grammar uses NT with numbers as non-terminals, but in the string, we have t followed by numbers. Maybe the t's are the terminals, and the numbers are the non-terminals?\n\nHmm, perhaps the terminals in the grammar are 't' followed by numbers, like 't28' is a terminal. So in the string, t16 is a terminal, t65 is a terminal, etc. So the string is a sequence of terminals, some of which are the non-terminals from the grammar, but as terminals, they might represent specific symbols.\n\nWait, the grammar's S is the start symbol, and each production starts with S. The string provided is a sequence of terminals, so the task is to parse this string starting from S and applying the productions to see if it can reach the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct a parse tree for the string. Let me see how long the string is. Counting the words: \n\nt16, t65, t40, t71, t65, t6, t22, t50, t65, t36, t60, t61, t61, t12, t34, t41, t7, t25, t34, t11, t22, t30, t10, t31, t28, t10, t0, t65, t50, t50, t32, t60, t11, t7, t12. \n\nThat's 35 tokens. So the string is 35 symbols long. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production reduces a non-terminal to two non-terminals, so starting from S, each step increases the number of symbols by 1 (because each production replaces one non-terminal with two). So the derivation of S would be to expand S into two non-terminals, then each of them could expand further until we reach terminals.\n\nWait, but when you reach a production that is a terminal, it's a leaf in the parse tree. So starting from S (1 symbol), after one expansion: 2 non-terminals. After two expansions: 4 symbols, etc. The length of the derived string would be 2^k, but the string length here is 35, which is not a power of two plus one (since 32 is 2^5, 2^6 is 64). 35 is in between, which suggests that the string might not be directly derived from S in CNF, but perhaps the grammar allows for left or right recursion, or some other structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be processed step by step. Let's look for a possible parse.\n\nFirst, perhaps the entire string can be divided into pairs or sequences that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nBut this is going to be time-consuming.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has several production rules, and the string provided is a series of tokens like 't66', 't52', etc. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That simplifies things a bit because it means each step in a derivation is straightforward\u2014replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals, which eventually lead to terminal symbols.\n\nI see a lot of production rules ending in terminals, like S -> NT2 NT28, and then later NT5 -> 't41'. So the terminals are represented by 't' followed by some number. That means the string consists of terminals, and our job is to see if the grammar can generate this exact sequence.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t66 t52 t41 t3 t71 t0 t34 t49 t14 t36 t0 t36 t38 t75 t36 t16 t84 t16 t14 t34 t54 t54 t50 t60 t17 t56 t41 t12 t50 t32 t38 t41 t34 t56 t50 t14`\n\nI notice it starts with 't66', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar rules, I need to find a production rule that starts with a non-terminal leading to 't66'. Let me check the rules to find where 't66' appears.\n\nLooking through the rule list, I see that rule NT18 -> 't66' and NT18 -> 't36'. So 't66' is derived from NT18: NT18 \u2192 't66'. That's one part.\n\nNow, where is NT18 used? Let me check the production rules for NT18. According to the grammar, NT18 can produce 't66' or 't36'. So in the string, after 't66', the next token is 't52', which must come from another production rule.\n\nWait, hold on. The string after 't66' is 't52'. So after 't66', the next token is 't52', meaning that there must be a rule that leads to 't66' followed by 't52'. How does that work in the grammar?\n\nI think I need to look at how terms are combined. The grammar is in CNF, so each step is replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, which eventually become terminals. That suggests that the string represents a leftmost derivation, where each step adds to the left.\n\nLet me try to reverse-engineer the possible derivations. The string starts with 't66' and 't52'. So perhaps in the derivation, we start with the start symbol S and follow the productions step by step to reach the string.\n\nBut looking back, the start symbol S is split into two options: NT21, NT21 again, NT20, etc. So S is split into two non-terminals, each leading deeper into the derivation.\n\nWait, the string has 33 tokens, which is a lot. Since the grammar is binary, each node in the parse tree would have two children. So the maximum depth of any branch would be such that 2^depth >= 33, but I think it's more about how the tokens are generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into a series of productions. Since each production is two non-terminals, the string must be a concatenation of such pairs.\n\nBut wait, the string is a list of terminals, so each terminal must be a result of a production that ends with that terminal.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe first token is 't66', which is from NT18. So at the top level, that must come from NT18. So before 't66', there must have been a production that introduced NT18. Let me see where NT18 is used.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT18: NT18 \u2192 't66' or 't36'. So to generate 't66', NT18 must produce 't66'. Now, looking at how NT18 is derived: What produces NT18? Let's trace back. \n\nLooking at the rules, are there any non-terminals that produce NT18? I'll need to find rules where NT18 is on the right-hand side. Scanning through, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces NT18. Wait, this is a problem because if NT18 is on the left-hand side of a rule, but to produce it, it needs to have a way to derive from other symbols. Or, perhaps, it's possible that NT18 is a non-terminal that needs to be part of a longer derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. The string is a series of terminals. So each 't' represents a terminal symbol, which is a production ending in that symbol.\n\nI think the best way is to see if each terminal in the string can be produced by some non-terminal, and that the structure of the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can attempt to build the derivation tree from the string backwards.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. The string starts with 't66', which comes from NT18 \u2192 't66'. So we'll start with NT18. Now, before that, there must be a rule that leads to NT18. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal leads to NT18. That seems like a problem. Because NT18 is on the right-hand side, but not on the left except as S's components.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see how S can lead to the string. Let me check S's rules again:\n\nS can be NT21 \u2192 NT21 and NT28, or NT21 \u2192 NT21 and something else? Wait, looking again:\n\nThe rules for S are:\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo S branches into two non-terminals. Let's see:\n\nLooking further, NT21 and NT28 are both non-terminals. So starting from S, we would choose one of these, say NT21, and NT28.\n\nBut in our string, the first 't66' is from NT18. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps S leads into another non-terminal that eventually leads to NT18. For example, S is NT21 \u2192 ... But I don't see a rule where S leads directly to NT18. So this suggests that maybe the string starts with a part that doesn't directly come from S.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. The entire string must be generated by starting from S and applying productions until all symbols are terminals. So the entire string must be a concatenation of two parts, each being the result of two non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to split the string into pairs, but since it's 33 tokens, which is odd, that complicates things. Wait, no, because each production is two non-terminals, so the string length must be even? Or maybe not, depending on the depth of the derivation.\n\nWait, actually, the string is in the form t... where each t is a terminal produced by a production. So each t is added one by one, with each production step adding one or two tokens. But in Chomsky Normal Form, each production produces two non-terminals, which themselves need to be resolved.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the string as a sequence of productions. Each step in the derivation would add a new non-terminal, which in turn would split into two more, until the entire string is a list of terminals.\n\nBut since each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two, the string must be a combination of these splits, leading to the exact sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the order in which the non-terminals might have been split.\n\nWait, another approach: each non-terminal must have rules that produce either two terminals or two non-terminals. So for the string to be valid, every other symbol must be a non-terminal that can split into the appropriate symbols to produce the required terminals.\n\nBut that seems complex without knowing the exact parse.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for chains of terminals that can be generated by the grammar. Let's see where 't66' appears. As I saw earlier, 't66' is from NT18 \u2192 't66' and NT18 \u2192 't36'.\n\nSuppose the first part of the string is 't66 t52', so NT18 must have produced 't66' and another non-terminal that produced 't52'. So somewhere in the grammar, there's a way for NT18's second production to lead to 't52'.\n\nWait, but looking at NT18's production rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Similarly, NT21 -> NT26 NT6 could have 't26' or 't6', which are also terminals.\n\nI should start by identifying which tokens in the string are terminals and which could be part of the structure. From the grammar, the non-terminals (NT) are the ones that start with NT and the rest are terminals, like 't3' or 't14'.\n\nLet me list the terminals and see how they appear. The string has the following 't's:\n\nt84, t51, t28, t17, t23, t66, t6, t31, t22, t54, t75, t69, t66, t40, t49, t61, t22, t41, t22, t32, t54, t10, t11, t10, t0, t69, t41, t60, t22, t16, t0, t84, t7, t65, t32, t7.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some produce terminals. For example:\n\n- S -> NT21 NT28, and from the rules, NT21 can be broken down further, but NT28 -> NT11 NT3. Wait, no, NT28 has a rule: NT28 -> NT11 NT3. Wait, looking back, the grammar has multiple rules, some of which produce terminals. Let me check specific rules:\n\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT6. Not sure if these are terminals. From the grammar, NT26 is another non-terminal, so perhaps not.\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3. Similarly, NT11 and NT3 could be non-terminals. Let's see their rules.\n\nLooking up each non-terminal:\n\n- NT11: Rule is NT11 -> NT25 NT13. Both seem non-terminals.\n- NT3: Rule is NT3 -> NT20 NT13 or NT3 -> NT5 NT7. Also non-terminals.\n- NT25: NT5 and NT10. NT5 is NT5 -> NT3 NT32 or NT5 -> NT5 NT20. NT32 is NT32 -> NT1 NT23. All non-terminals.\n- So, NT28 seems to produce non-terminals all the way down until perhaps reaching 't's.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck trying to expand each non-terminal. Maybe I should approach this by checking if the string can be generated step by step. The string ends with 't84', which appears in the grammar as a terminal in multiple places, like in NT21, NT17, etc. Looking at the grammar, the rule S -> NT21 NT28 can produce 't84' if NT21 and NT28 derive the necessary terminals.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT21:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT21 has several productions:\n\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT6\n- NT21 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT21 -> NT19 NT26\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT9\n- NT21 -> NT21 NT24\n- NT21 -> NT19 NT26\n- ... (probably cycles)\n\nNot seeing 't21' as a terminal directly, but other rules might generate 't21' as a terminal. Wait, maybe from NT25:\n\nNT25 -> NT3 NT32 OR NT25 -> NT23 NT28\n\nNT23 is NT23 -> NT22 NT27, NT27 is NT27 -> NT9 NT9, etc. Maybe down a chain.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, the first token is 't84'. Let me see which rules produce 't84':\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only 't84' I see is in NT14 -> 't65' and NT17 -> 't49'. Hmm, not 't84'. Wait, let's check more rules:\n\nWait, I see in the grammar:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT19 -> 't25'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT1 -> 't6 NT27'\nWait, actually, looking through all the rules for terminals:\n\nThe grammar has several rules where non-terminals reduce directly to terminals:\n\nNT5 -> 't41', NT17 -> 't14', NT0 -> 't61', NT15 -> 't68', NT3 -> 't31', NT14 -> 't65', NT6 -> 't68', NT13 -> 't6', NT24 -> 't22', NT14 -> 't51', NT10 -> 't0', NT28 -> 't50', NT5 -> 't41', NT25 -> 't77', NT15 -> 't6', NT23 -> 't43', NT21 -> 't8', NT26 -> 't71', NT18 -> 't36', NT11 -> 't6', NT18 -> 't70', NT34 -> 't30', NT34 -> 't14', NT7 -> 't84', NT12 -> 't16', NT12 -> 't14', NT3 -> 't12', NT16 -> 't10', NT19 -> 't25', NT33 -> 't49', NT15 -> 't28', NT33 -> 't60', NT15 -> 't34', NT24 -> 't71', NT14 -> 't84', NT32 -> 't54', NT21 -> 't77', NT15 -> 't68', NT23 -> 't52', NT22 -> 't8', NT23 -> 't56', NT13 -> 't71', NT5 -> 't84', NT19 -> 't22', NT2 -> 't23', NT17 -> 't49', NT23 -> 't40', NT2 -> 't38', NT21 -> 't69', NT31 -> 't75', NT11 -> 't14', NT8 -> 't27', NT8 -> 't6', NT26 -> 't28', NT18 -> 't66', NT0 -> 't84', NT10 -> 't0', NT28 -> 't50', NT5 -> 't41', NT25 -> 't77', NT15 -> 't68', NT23 -> 't52', NT22 -> 't8', NT22 -> 't40', NT13 -> 't71', NT5 -> 't84', NT19 -> 't22', NT2 -> 't23', NT17 -> 't49', NT23 -> 't40', NT2 -> 't38', NT21 -> 't69', NT31 -> 't75', NT11 -> 't14', NT8 -> 't27', NT8 -> 't6', NT26 -> 't28', NT18 -> 't66', NT0 -> 't84', NT10 -> 't0', NT28 -> 't50', NT5 -> 't41', NT25 -> 't77', NT15 -> 't68', NT23 -> 't52', NT22 -> 't8', NT22 -> 't40', NT13 -> 't71', NT5 -> 't84', NT19 -> 't22', NT2 -> 't23', NT17 -> 't49', NT23 -> 't40', NT22 -> 't40', ... some more.\n\nI see that 't7' comes from NT7 -> 't7', 't84' comes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-725","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down. First, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier, or at least structuring the approach.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of t's followed by numbers. The string is: `t40 t69 t75 t43 t17 t52 t60 t12 t41 t16 t31 t40 t60 t0 t23 t16 t25 t11 t22 t25 t51 t54 t16 t41 t41 t8 t31 t77 t10 t38 t70 t71 t40 t6 t22 t51 t41`.\n\nAlright, I notice that the string starts and ends with t40, which could be a helpful clue. The grammar's start symbol is S, which according to the rules, can be expanded into combinations like NT21 NT28, etc. Each of these non-terminals can further expand into other non-terminals or terminals (t's followed by numbers).\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two others, so the structure of the string should consist of a sequence of these terminals and numbers, each corresponding to the end symbols of the expansions.\n\nLet me start by sketching out how the string could have been built. Since the string is quite long, maybe over 40 elements, I need to see if each tX corresponds to a terminal production from a non-terminal.\n\nI should consider the productions for each term. For example, looking up the productions: \n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT2\n- NT27 \u2192 NT11 NT4\n- NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n- NT25 \u2192 NT5 NT13\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT32\n- NT3 \u2192 NT20 NT13\n- NT20 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT4 \u2192 NT29 NT10\n- NT10 \u2192 NT33 NT24\n- NT24 \u2192 NT7 NT23\n- NT7 \u2192 NT16 NT24\n- NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT22 \u2192 NT18 NT32\n- NT32 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT32\n- NT1 \u2192 NT6 NT27\n- NT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, that might be too time-consuming to track step by step. Maybe I can look for possible ways to split the string into valid chunks based on these productions.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each production leads to two terminals, so the string should be built in pairs. But looking at the string, it's a single sequence of t's and numbers, so each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with two symbols, so the overall structure should be a balanced binary tree.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string from the start symbol, S.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce either:\n\n1. NT21 NT28\n2. NT32 NT14\n3. NT20 NT25\n\nSo the string should start with one of these combinations, and each subsequent part would follow from the productions of the non-terminals involved.\n\nWait, the given string starts with t40. Let me see what non-terminals lead to t40.\n\nLooking at the production rules, t40 can be the result of certain non-terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 t49, but that's not 40. Let me look at where t40 appears:\n\nLooking through the rules, t40 is a terminal. I see that NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 't41', but I don't see a production leading to t40.

Each production is short, which might help in simulating the parsing process.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production seems to either expand a non-terminal into exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right. That aligns with CNF, so I think that's correct.\n\nNow, the main task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. The string consists of a series of t's followed by numbers, so I need to figure out which non-terminals expand into these tokens.\n\nI start by trying to break down the string into parts that correspond to the productions. Each production either adds two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S. S has productions like S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc. So, from S, the first expansion could be any of these.\n\nBut wait, each of these S productions leads to two non-terminals, so the string must start with terms that come from those. But the string starts with t54, which is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-738","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step because I'm a bit new to this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol here is S, as I can see from the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol S has several production rules leading to other non-terminals like NT21, NT32, NT20, etc. Each of these seems to eventually lead to terminal symbols 't' followed by some number. So the language consists of strings of these 't's.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is quite long: `t84 t68 t25 t36 t38 t31 t12 t60 t6 t10 t8 t10 t38 t40 t3 t52 t14 t11 t66 t56 t17 t68 t32 t61 t17 t75 t66 t56 t8 t14 t77 t54 t71 t31 t32 t77 t23 t22`.\n\nOkay, so the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nI remember from my studies that for a CFG in Chomsky normal form, we can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. But since I'm not very familiar with CYK, I might try a different approach.\n\nAnother method is to attempt to construct a derivation from S to the given string, making sure each step follows a grammar rule.\n\nBut considering the complexity of the problem, maybe I can start by mapping each 'tX' to see if there's a path in the grammar. Each 'tX' corresponds to a terminal symbol, which in the grammar must be produced by some rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT17 \u2192 't14', so 't14' is produced by NT17. Similarly, NT15 \u2192 't71', and so on. So each 'tX' corresponds to a specific non-terminal.\n\nSo perhaps I can reverse-engineer this. For each token in the string, check if the corresponding non-terminal is present in the grammar, and then see if production rules can chain together to produce this sequence.\n\nWait, but each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals, each produced by a specific non-terminal, which in turn must be produced by a chain starting from S.\n\nSo I can start from the end of the string and work backwards, trying to see if each token can be matched by a production rule that ends with that terminal.\n\nBut that's a bit abstract. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if any of the tokens can be derived from the same non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for whether each 'tX' corresponds to a non-terminal that can be expanded step by step towards the start symbol S.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to think about what each non-terminal produces. For example, NT17 produces 't14' directly. Similarly, NT0 produces 't61', which is a specific terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, most non-terminals seem to produce two terminals. Hmm.\n\nLet me pick one token and see how it can be derived. Let's take the first token, 't84'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminal produces 't84'? Checking the rules, I see that NT23 \u2192 't43', but that's not 84. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, perhaps NT18 is a non-terminal that produces 't84'. Let me check the productions. Yes, NT18 \u2192 't66' and NT18 \u2192 't70'. Wait, but in the string, the first token is 't84'. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back: I see that NT18 has production rules. Let me check. Oh, looking at the grammar, NT18 has production rules to 't49', 't66', and 't70'. So that's three different productions, but none produce 't84'. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, when I look at the grammar, I see that somewhere NT18 \u2192 't84' is not directly there. Wait, maybe I need to look higher up. Let me recount the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT18 \u2192 't84' directly. Hmm. Wait, in the given grammar, perhaps a higher-level non-terminal produces 't84'?\n\nWait, let me look through all the non-terminals and their productions again.\n\nLooking at NT17, it can produce 't14', yes. NT15 \u2192 't71', and so on.\n\nWait, but in the given string, we have 't84', which isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the first level. Hmmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the grammar produces the tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a chain of productions leading from S down to these tokens. So maybe 't84' is produced through some sequence.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a production rule that can expand into a chain containing 't84'. Looking elsewhere, I see NT18 has production rules to 't66', 't70', and another to 't49'. Hmmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write down the entire process step by step. But that might take a lot of time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for each token in the string, we need to see if it can be derived from a chain that ultimately can be connected to the start symbol S.\n\nBut wait, looking at the first token, 't84'. Is there a non-terminal that can produce 't84'? I'm not seeing it in the immediate productions. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again carefully.\n\nLooking through, I notice that in the grammar, some non-terminals produce two terminals. For example, NT21 \u2192 't8' and 't26'; NT23 \u2192 't52' and 't8'; and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the first token is 't84', which isn't directly produced by any non-terminal. Hmmm. Let me check NT18 again. The productions are:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't49', NT18 \u2192 't66', and NT18 \u2192 't70'.\n\nWait, but that doesn't include 't84'. So if the string starts with 't84', but NT18 doesn't produce 't84', then perhaps that means the string cannot be generated by the grammar, right?\n\nWait, perhaps no non-terminal in the grammar produces 't84' directly or through a production chain. So the string starts with 't84', which implies that somewhere in the grammar, a non-terminal must produce 't84' as part of a sequence. If that non-terminal doesn't exist, then the string can't be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't84' is part of a longer production that involves other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So the end of the string is produced by terminals, and the non-terminals before them must expand into those terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe 't84' is generated by a non-terminal that's not listed here, but that's impossible because the grammar is given, so all non-terminals are accounted for.\n\nSo, if 't84' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal, meaning it doesn't have a production rule A\u2192't84', then the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, checking the grammar: I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce 't84'. Therefore, the string starting with 't84' cannot be generated by this grammar. So the answer is No.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me double-check the grammar by listing all the production rules for each non-terminal.\n\nLooking again:\n\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT32 NT26\nNT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\nNT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT5 NT28\nNT6 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT29 \u2192 NT27 NT22\nNT7 \u2192 NT16 NT24\nNT27 \u2192 NT11 NT4\nNT4 \u2192 NT29 NT10\nNT5 \u2192 NT3 NT32\nNT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20\nAnd so on...

{"custom_id":"request-737","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token seems to correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means that every production either introduces a single terminal or involves two non-terminals on the right side. This structure is useful for parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm, which can efficiently determine if a string is in the language generated by a given grammar.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that the top-level productions are S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and S \u2192 NT20 NT25. Each of these right-hand sides consists of two non-terminals, which aligns with the CNF structure. \n\nBut the challenge is the string itself, which is quite long. The string is: t8 t25 t36 t28 t31 t23 t77 t10 t34 t16 t65 t0 t65 t16 t28 t7 t50 t50 t41 t43 t75 t25 t17 t70 t10 t54 t49 t49 t40 t60 t70 t66 t36 t10 t77 t40 t31 t52.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S through the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can approach this with a leftmost derivation or perhaps the CYK algorithm, but given the length of the string, manual expansion might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into the right symbols as per the grammar. Each production rule either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. Since every non-terminal must eventually be reduced to terminals, I can check each production to see if the string can be formed by combining the outputs of these non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the string is already given as a sequence of terminals, so each token must correspond to a terminal that can be derived from the grammar. So perhaps each token in the string must be matched by some production rule in the grammar, either directly or through non-terminals that reduce to it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have productions resulting in terminals, like 't28' from NT0 -> 't61' and others. Wait, wait. Wait, the grammar seems to have some rules that produce terminals, like:\n\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0 -> 't10' etc.\n\nBut for some non-terminals, they might reduce to other non-terminals, which in turn reduce further until terminal symbols are reached.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to see if there's a pattern or a way to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, considering the CYK algorithm, which parses strings by identifying possible non-terminals for every substring. But since I don't have a parser, maybe I can try to outline the steps.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long (50 tokens), manually applying CYK would take too long. Instead, perhaps I can look for critical points where the string must align with the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check the initial and final steps. The start symbol is S, which branches into three possibilities: NT21 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25. Each of these non-terminals must themselves be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet's take S \u2192 NT21 NT28 as a starting point. Then, both NT21 and NT28 must derive into substrings that align with the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t8. So let's see which non-terminals can produce t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT17 -> 't14' (twice)\n- NT21 -> 't8' (once)\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- Other NTs might produce t8?\n\nWait, from the list provided, NT21 -> 't8' is a production. So, if part of the derivation is NT21 and it produces 't8', then that would match the first token.\n\nThen, the next token is t25. So, if after NT21, we have NT28, then we'd need to see if NT28 can produce 't25'. Looking at the grammar, how does NT28 derive? \n\nFrom the grammar, NT28's productions:\n\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n- NT28 -> NT32 NT2\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT0\n\nSo, none of these directly produce t25. But perhaps one of those productions can produce a substring that includes t25.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because in CNF, each production either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the terminal symbols are the leaves of the parse tree. Therefore, the string must be built by a series of non-terminals each expanding into terminals.\n\nBut in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- And others.\n\nSo, to build the string, every terminal that appears in the string must be produced by a terminal symbol in the grammar. That is, every token in the string must correspond to a production in the grammar where a non-terminal produces exactly that terminal.\n\nWait, wait, actually, in the grammar, each rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the string must be composed of terminals that are directly produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given string: t8 t25 t36 t28 t31 t23 t77 t10 t34 t16 t65 t0 t65 t16 t28 t7 t50 t50 t41 t43 t75 t25 t17 t70 t10 t54 t49 t49 t40 t60 t70 t66 t36 t10 t77 t40 t31 t52.\n\nEach of these tokens must be a terminal directly produced by one of the grammar's rules. Let's check each token:\n\n- t8: Look at NT21's production: NT21 -> 't8' as well as NT21 -> NT26 NT6. Wait, actually in the grammar provided, the first set of NT21 rules is:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\n\nand \n\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0.\n\nBut in the latter part, there's:\n\nNT21 -> 't8'\n\nYes, so NT21 can produce 't8'.\n\n- t25: Looking for non-terminals that produce 't25'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT producing 't25' directly. Wait, let me scan the grammar again.\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\nI see NT25 -> 't41' and NT25 -> 't77', etc. Wait, where is t25?\n\nWait, let me look through all the production rules for terminals:\n\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0 -> 't10' (twice)\n- Other NTs: NT5 -> 't41', NT7 -> 't8', NT10 -> 't32', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see 't25' appearing as a terminal in any production. So, perhaps the string contains a terminal that is not present in the grammar's terminals. If that's the case, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n\nOk, so 't8', 't10', 't14', 't61', 't66', 't75', 't77', etc., are terminals, but where's 't25'?\n\nWait, perhaps 't25' is a variable in the grammar. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the terminals seem to be labeled as 't' followed by some number. But the question is whether the string is in the language, so each token in the string must correspond to a terminal in the grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t28 t40 t31 t40 t34 t77 t65 t51 t38 t22 t65 t11 t17 t56 t71 t28 t75 t28 t32 t3 t40 t23 t23 t61 t75 t50 t30 t50 t7 t60 t16 t41 t17 t75 t36 t32 t56 t84 t25`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has both non-terminals and terminals. Some non-terminals produce terminals directly, while others produce two non-terminals. The string consists solely of terminals, so I need to see if the grammar can derive this string by expanding all non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many non-terminals are productions into two other non-terminals. So, the string length must be 2^n - 1 for some n, as each non-terminal can potentially split the string into two parts. Let's check the string length: 37 tokens. Hmm, 37 is not one less than a power of 2. For n=6, 2^6=64, 64-1=63; for n=5, 32-1=31, which is less than 37. So 37 isn't possible. Does that mean it's invalid?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the grammar more carefully. Perhaps not all non-terminals split into exactly two parts; some might be terminals. But in the given grammar, the non-terminals can produce either two non-terminals or sometimes a terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 't41', which is a terminal, so that's possible.\n\nBut wait, the starting symbol is S, which can be expanded into various combinations. Let's see the initial productions:\n\nS can be NT21 NT28, NT32 NT14, NT20 NT25. So each of these is a pair of non-terminals.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals can further expand. For instance, NT21 and NT28 each have their own productions, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nBut considering that the string has 37 tokens, which isn't 2^n -1, it's possible because not all splits result in a full binary tree. That is, some non-terminals may be expanded entirely to terminals before others. So perhaps the structure is such that at each step, some parts are fully expanded while others remain as non-terminals and can be expanded further.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be matched by the grammar step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be more efficient, but the grammar is quite large, so that might take too long.\n\nAnother idea is to look for sequences in the string that match any of the direct productions. For example, in the grammar, many non-terminals directly produce terminals like 't3', 't7', 't8', etc.\n\nLooking at the given string, I see it starts with t28 t40. Let's check if t28 can be produced directly. In the grammar, NT12 \u2192 't14', NT34 \u2192 't14', NT0 \u2192 't61', etc. Wait, looking back, I don't see any non-terminals directly producing 't28' except in some cases.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, there's NT25 \u2192 't77', NT15 \u2192 't6', etc. Hmm, I need to see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't41', NT17 \u2192 't14', NT0 \u2192 't61', NT10 \u2192 't32', NT16 \u2192 't6', NT7 \u2192 't3', NT18 \u2192 't66', NT25 \u2192 't77', NT15 \u2192 't68', NT33 \u2192 't49', NT14 \u2192 't65', NT3 \u2192 't31', NT16 \u2192 't10', NT5 \u2192 't84', NT26 \u2192 't71', NT22 \u2192 't8', NT23 \u2192 't52', NT13 \u2192 't71', NT24 \u2192 't71', NT23 \u2192 't56', NT19 \u2192 't25', NT32 \u2192 't54', NT21 \u2192 't77', NT14 \u2192 't84', NT32 \u2192 't56', NT21 \u2192 't69', NT31 \u2192 't75', NT22 \u2192 't36', NT23 \u2192 't40', etc.\n\nWait, looking for where the string starts with t28. Maybe from NT21 or NT28? Wait, NT21 \u2192 't8' or other NTs. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed by building a derivation tree. Let's try to find a way to split the string.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t28 t40 t31 t40 t34 t77 t65 t51 t38 t22 t65 t11 t17 t56 t71 t28 t75 t28 t32 t3 t40 t23 t23 t61 t75 t50 t30 t50 t7 t60 t16 t41 t17 t75 t36 t32 t56 t84 t25.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built using some non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps checking if all the required non-terminals are present. For example, the string has t28 at the beginning and end. So maybe S can produce t28 through some chain.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, S can produce NT21 NT28. So S can go to NT21 NT28. Then each of those can be expanded.\n\nLet\u2019s try expanding S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nNow, NT21 can be \u2192 't8' or \u2192 NT5 \u2192 't41'. Wait, looking at the production for NT21: It can either produce 't8' or non-terminals. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT32 NT6 or NT6 NT0. Wait, but in the given productions, I think I may have misread some.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn the grammar provided, NT21 has two options:\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT6\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nSo, if we have NT21, it can split into NT32 NT6 or NT6 NT0.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 has:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\nNT28 -> NT5 NT10\n\nWait, the first token is t28, which in the string is the first. So perhaps NT28 can produce 't28'. Wait, no; in the grammar, NT28 has productions into non-terminals, but does any non-terminal produce 't28' directly?\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, the productions that result in terminals are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't41', NT17 \u2192 't14', NT0 \u2192 't61', NT10 \u2192 't32', NT16 \u2192 't6', NT7 \u2192 't3', NT18 \u2192 't66', NT25 \u2192 't77', NT14 \u2192 't65', NT3 \u2192 't31', NT16 \u2192 't10', NT5 \u2192 't84', NT26 \u2192 't71', NT22 \u2192 't8', NT23 \u2192 't52', NT13 \u2192 't71', NT24 \u2192 't71', NT23 \u2192 't56', NT19 \u2192 't25', NT32 \u2192 't54', NT21 \u2192 't77', NT14 \u2192 't84', NT32 \u2192 't56', NT21 \u2192 't69', NT31 \u2192 't75', NT22 \u2192 't36', NT23 \u2192 't40', NT23 \u2192 't56', NT19 \u2192 't25', NT34 \u2192 't30' and 't14', NT34 \u2192 't14'.\n\nWait, none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce 't28'.

{"custom_id":"request-761","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm staring at this problem here. It's about determining whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are pretty long, but let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has specific rules. Each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that most of the rules fit this pattern. For example, S \u2192 NT21 NT23 is a CNF production since both NT21 and NT23 are non-terminals. However, I notice some rules like S \u2192 NT21 NT28 or S \u2192 NT32 NT18. Wait, those seem a bit off. Let me check them again.\n\nLooking closer, S \u2192 NT21 NT28 and S \u2192 NT32 NT18 have two non-terminals each. That's fine in CNF because it allows for two-step expansions. But then I see a rule like NT0 -> 't61' which has a terminal directly. That should be fine too since terminals can be in the right-hand side.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t17 t7 t70 t23 t71 t34 t38 t7 t11 t22 t11 t40 t43 t41 t3 t66 t36 t28 t75 t54 t28 t36 t25 t61 t43 t16 t6 t61 t77 t12 t17 t23 t60 t68 t54 t0 t77 t75 t34`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will consist of a series of productions where each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string using the grammar, ensuring that each step follows the production rules. Starting with the beginning symbol S, which branches into two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT21 NT23, or others. But given the string starts with 't17', that terminal might have to be derived from a production that directly gives it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules like NT17 \u2192 't14' and NT25 \u2192 't77', etc. I'm specifically looking for any NT that can produce 't17'. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 't14' (nope), but also NT0 \u2192 't17'. Wait, that's NT0 producing 't17'. So if the derivation reaches NT0, it can produce 't17'.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't17', so perhaps the starting symbol S can produce a path that eventually leads to NT0. Let me look at the production rules for NT0. Scanning the grammar, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT10 NT27  \nNT0 \u2192 NT26 NT22  \nNT0 \u2192 NT21 NT16  \nNT0 \u2192 NT20 NT32  \nNT0 \u2192 NT12 NT21  \nNT0 \u2192 NT18 NT5  \nNT0 \u2192 NT12 NT17  \nNT0 \u2192 NT10 NT33  \nNT0 \u2192 NT8 NT17  \nNT0 \u2192 NT0 NT27  \n... and others.\n\nHmm, looking for a way to get 't17' from NT0. From the above, NT0 can produce 't17' through several rules. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT17, but how? Wait, no, NT0 \u2192 NT8 N... Actually, looking back, I realize some of the grammar rules might be longer. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, I might have mixed up the rules. Let me re-examine the grammar more carefully. The user provided the grammar in a long list, so maybe I missed some. For example, NT17 \u2192 't28' and others. Wait, the last part mentions NT17 \u2192 't14', but also other rules.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe I miscounted. The user provided the grammar with many rules, some of which are long, like NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT17. So this would mean NT0 can produce the non-terminals NT8 and NT17. And then, each of those can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for the string to start with 't17', if the last step is NT0 \u2192 't17' or a production that eventually leads to 't17'.\n\nWait, earlier I saw that NT17 \u2192 't14' is one rule, and NT0 \u2192 't17' via NT0 \u2192 NT8 N... Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should trace backwards from the string. Since the string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, we might try to see if each terminal can be generated by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the string starts with 't17'. So, the last step must derive 't17' from a non-terminal. Looking into the grammar, what non-terminals produce 't17'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't17' (if any rule has NT0 \u2192 't17') Wait, no, looking again, I don't see a rule like NT0 \u2192 't17' directly. Let me look through each line:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\nI don't immediately see a rule like NT0 \u2192 't17'. Wait, but one of the rules is 'NT0 -> 't61''... Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps NT17 can produce 't14', but how does that help?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each token in the string and see if it can be matched by a production in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, ensuring that each step follows a production rule.\n\nLet me try to think about each symbol and how it could be derived.\n\nThe string starts with 't17'. So, somewhere in the derivation, we must have a production that results in 't17'. Looking for NTs that can produce 't17'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't23'\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT25 \u2192 't77'\n- NT15 \u2192 't28'\n- And others, but not 't17' directly.\n\nWait, what about NT0? The rules for NT0 are:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT10 NT27  \nNT0 \u2192 NT26 NT22  \nNT0 \u2192 NT21 NT16  \nNT0 \u2192 NT20 NT32  \nNT0 \u2192 NT12 NT21  \nNT0 \u2192 NT0 NT27  \nNT0 \u2192 NT12 NT17  \nNT0 \u2192 NT10 NT33  \nNT0 \u2192 NT8 NT17  \n... and so on.\n\nLooking at NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT17: So if NT0 can produce NT8 and NT17, and then NT17 can produce something else. But how does NT8 produce a terminal?\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a rule NT8 \u2192 't27' and another NT8 \u2192 't29'. Also, NT17 \u2192 't14' and others.\n\nWait, does NT8 produce 't27'? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, yes, there's a rule NT8 \u2192 't27' and NT8 \u2192 't29'. Also, I see NT17 \u2192 't28' and others. But how do I get from NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT17 to 't17'?\n\nWait, NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT17 would mean that NT8 is followed by NT17. So the string after that would be whatever NT8 can produce followed by whatever NT17 can produce. Since NT0 is the start symbol, it must produce two symbols, and so on.\n\nBut in the string, the last token is 't34', which is 't34'. Looking back at the grammar, NT32 \u2192 't36', NT28 \u2192 't54', etc., perhaps. But let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to note that parsing such a string from the grammar is time-consuming, but given that the grammar is in CNF, which allows for efficient parsing using algorithms like CYK, which might be feasible.\n\nBut since I'm limited in time, perhaps a better approach is to note that the grammar is small enough, and perhaps the string is a concatenation of terminals that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the overall structure.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this because all the rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is: `t43 t34 t40 t8 t52 t41 t8 t23 t61 t43 t51 t84 t51 t54 t11 t41 t31 t61 t0 t75 t23 t36 t54 t17 t28 t41 t60 t75 t17 t71 t75 t61 t66 t70 t31 t43 t12 t56 t28 t23`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.

{"custom_id":"request-780","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's all in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces two NTs each time, ending up with a string of terminal symbols if everything goes right.\n\nThe string to verify is: `t30 t43 t14 t28 t16 t66 t8 t61 t34 t23 t75 t43 t69 t84 t11 t56 t43 t38 t54 t12 t34 t84 t38 t11 t51 t16 t50 t77 t41 t70 t43 t49 t17 t11 t69 t68 t34 t16 t23 t54`.\n\nWow, that's a long string. I'm going to need a systematic way to map this string to the grammar productions. \n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into tokens (the 't' followed by numbers). Each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. My goal is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by finding the right sequence of productions.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with 't30'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT34 -> 't30'. So, perhaps one of the NT34s is part of the derivation. Let me look for other NT34 productions.\n\nNT34 has two productions:\nNT34 -> 't30'\nNT34 -> 't14'\n\nSo, the first token 't30' must come from the first production. That means the first NT34 in the string (which is the first production) becomes 't30'. \n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces two NT2s. So the entire string is supposed to be two sequences of NT2s. Maybe each NT2 expands into a series of terminals.\n\nLet me check if there are any NT2 productions. Looking again, I see:\n\nNT2 -> NT15 NT18\nNT2 -> NT17 NT16\nNT2 -> NT5 NT20\nNT2 -> NT16 NT33\nNT2 -> NT32 NT23\nNT2 -> NT26 NT33\nNT2 -> NT22 NT27\nNT2 -> NT24 NT16\n\nHmm, each of these seems to involve other non-terminals. Maybe I can work backwards.\n\nThe string starts with t30, so let's see what leads to t30. It must come from NT34 -> t30. So where does NT34 appear? Looking through the grammar, the only NT34 is in NT34's production, which is why it can only be derived from itself or t14. \n\nWait, but the first token is t30, which means that the initial NT34 must have expanded to t30. So somewhere in the string, there's a t30, which comes from NT34. Similarly, the string ends with multiple ts, so the last non-terminals must produce those.\n\nBut this approach might be too time-consuming. Maybe I can look for a pattern or see if there are any mandatory rules.\n\nAnother approach: Since this is a parse tree, each production leads to a specific set of terminals. Let me consider the start symbol S: it produces two NT2s. So the string is two sequences of NT2s.\n\nEach NT2 can branch into various combinations. Let's take the first NT2. Looking at the productions, NT2 can go to many other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe using a recursive descent parser approach would help. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser with appropriate lookaheads can work.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, I can try to represent it as a series of steps, each time reducing a part of the string to a nonterminal using the grammar rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at the structure of the grammar. For example, NT5 can produce 't41' or other combinations, and NT17 can produce 't14'.\n\nLet me see if any of the terminals in the string can be directly matched to a production. For instance, the string starts with t30, which only comes from NT34, so that must come from the first NT34 from S's production.\n\nBut wait, S produces NT2 NT2, and each NT2 might be expanding into more nonterminals. So perhaps each NT2 can expand into multiple nonterminals, each which eventually produce the needed terminals.\n\nWait, but the string is very specific. Let me try to parse it step by step:\n\nThe first few tokens are t30, t43, t14, t28, etc.\n\nI know that t30 comes from NT34. So perhaps that first NT34 (from the first NT2) expands into t30. Then the next part must come from the second NT2 in S.\n\nBut this might not be the correct approach, as NT2s can produce combinations of nonterminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the entire string being a leftmost derivation. Let me try to match the string to the grammar.\n\nThe first symbol is t30. Since the only production for t30 is NT34 -> t30, I can assume that the first NT34 expands to t30. So the expansion starts with NT34 => t30.\n\nBut wait, S is NT2 NT2, so how does NT2 relate to NT34?\n\nWait, perhaps S is NT2 NT2. Let me think: each S must be NT2 NT2, so each S can be broken down into two NT2s, each of which can be further broken down.\n\nSo perhaps the first NT2 in S's production is the one generating t30, and the second NT2 is generating the rest of the string. Or maybe both NT2s contribute to the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT2 can generate a portion of the string.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I can try to see if the string has any patterns that align with the grammar's structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that NT25 produces t77, which is present in the string (near the end). Also, NT23 produces t54, which is earlier in the string. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: let's consider the length of the string. The string has 37 tokens, which is an even number, which makes sense because each S splits into two NT2s, each of which would then split into more non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBut 37 is a lot, so perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be produced by the grammar through a series of valid expansions.\n\nWait, maybe building a parse tree could help, but that might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm could determine if the string is in the language, but since the grammar is quite big, that's going to be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for certain patterns in the grammar that could correspond to parts of the string.\n\nLooking back, I see that NT34 can produce 't30' or 't14'. In the string, t30 appears once, and t14 appears a few times. So the 't30' must come from NT34->t30.\n\nThen, the next part starts with t43. Looking at the grammar, where does t43 come from? Scanning through the productions, I see NT23 -> 't43'.\n\nSo perhaps after the initial NT34 t30, there's a production that leads to a t43. Since the next non-terminal after the t30 is t43, perhaps the NT34 expansion continues with t43.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, is there a way to combine NT34 and NT23 with other nonterminals or terminals? Looking, I see that NT34 can be followed by other nonterminals, but not directly as a terminal. So perhaps t30 is just the initial step, and the rest of the expansion is handled by another NT34.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string is a combination of known terminal sequences.\n\nWait, looking again, the string starts with t30, followed by t43. Let me check if these come from a common nonterminal. For example, is there a production that combines t30 and t43? Hmm, but nonterminals don't directly produce terminals except in their productions.\n\nWait, maybe the initial S produces something like NT2 NT2, each NT2 could produce a series of nonterminals that eventually become the string. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the string, I can try to break it down into parts that match the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-801","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all non-terminals expand into two non-terminals or terminals, so it's definitely in CNF.\n\nThe string we need to check is: `t23 t32 t38 t10 t69 t12 t11 t54 t51 t28 t68 t10 t68 t49 t56 t40 t41 t30 t23 t6 t71 t52 t61 t10 t51 t7 t17 t61 t43 t10 t77 t32 t38`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals from the grammar. The grammar has many rules, some of which produce 't' followed by numbers, so these are the terminal symbols.\n\nThe goal is to see if the entire string can be derived by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions step by step.\n\nSince this can get complex, perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree or use a top-down parsing method. Alternatively, I can try to see if each substring of the string corresponds to the right-hand sides (RHS) of the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar's right-hand sides, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each 't' followed by a number in the string must correspond to a production rule.\n\nLet's break down the string into tokens:\n\nt23, t32, t38, t10, t69, t12, t11, t54, t51, t28, t68, t10, t68, t49, t56, t40, t41, t30, t23, t6, t71, t52, t61, t10, t51, t7, t17, t61, t43, t10, t77, t32, t38.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of these tokens. Since each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a terminal, the parsing would need to match the sequence with the RHS of the productions.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to match the string by decomposing it step by step. Each part of the string should match a production.\n\nLet me consider the string as a series of right-hand sides. For example, the first part is t23 t32 t38 t10 t69... Let's check if any production's RHS matches the beginning of the string.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that S is defined as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo, the start symbol S can be replaced with two non-terminals. Let's pick S -> NT23 NT32 first. Then, t23 t38 must match the RHS of NT23.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 has the production:\n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\n\nSo, the first two tokens t23 t32 would correspond to NT23 NT32. Now, t23 is produced by NT23 which expands to NT22 NT27, so we'd have t22 t27 t32. But let's focus on the first step. Starting with S -> NT23 NT32, so t23 t32 would be the first part. Then the remaining tokens would have to be parsed from the other non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the first token is t23. Let me check the rules for NT23. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27. But wait, the RHS doesn't have any terminals yet. So, maybe I'm wrong\u2014the initial production might have terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any terminal is present in the productions. Let me scan through all the productions to see if any of them result in terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice some like:\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\n\nNT1 -> 't27'\n\nNT0 -> 't61'\n\nNT2 -> 't23'\n\nNT12 -> 't14'\n\nNT21 -> 't8'\n\nNT22 -> 't71'\n\nNT23 -> 't52'\n\nNT24 -> 't32'\n\nNT26 -> 't28'\n\nNT18 -> 't66'\n\nNT19 -> 't22'\n\nNT25 -> 't77'\n\nNT33 -> 't33' ... Hmm, some have 't' followed by numbers, but they are still terminals.\n\nWait, actually, some of the productions result in terminals. For example, NT23 is defined as:\n\nNT23 -> 't52'\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals like NT24 and NT25 produce terminals like 't32' and 't77' respectively.\n\nSo, for example, NT23 can either produce 't52' or ... wait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking at the production rules, some non-terminals expand into terminals and others into non-terminals.\n\nFor instance, NT17 has a production that results in 't14':\n\nNT17 -> 't14' or NT17 -> NT21 NT23.\n\nWait, this is incorrect. Let me re-examine the given grammar. The initial parts are S -> NT23 NT32, which implies that S is the start symbol, and each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar again:\n\nLooking for any production that has a terminal on the RHS:\n\nFor example, looking through all the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\n\nNT1 -> 't27'\n\nNT0 -> 't61'\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\n\nNT10 -> 't0' (but that's a non-terminal '0'\u2014no, wait, NT10 is a non-terminal, and in the production it's written as -> 't0', which is a terminal? Wait, probably, but let me check.\n\nWait, the list seems long. Let me check for any terminals in RHS:\n\nLooking carefully, I see lines like:\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\n\nNT1 -> 't27'\n\nNT0 -> 't61'\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\n\nNT10 -> 't0'\n\nNT2 -> 't23'\n\nNT12 -> 't14'\n\nNT21 -> 't8'\n\nNT22 -> 't71'\n\nNT23 -> 't52'\n\nNT24 -> 't32'\n\nNT26 -> 't28'\n\nNT18 -> 't66'\n\nNT19 -> 't22'\n\nNT25 -> 't77'\n\nNT33 -> 't33'\n\nWait, but some of these are unclear. For example, NT25 -> 't77' is a production that produces the terminal 't77'.\n\nSo, the first step could be to apply S -> NT23 NT32, which would expect the string to start with t23 t32 as part of NT23's expansion.\n\nLet me check:\n\nt23 t32 t38... So after S -> NT23 NT32, the first part is t23 t32, which matches if NT23 produces t23 (as a terminal) and NT32 produces t32.\n\nWait, but looking at the productions, NT23 can be either a terminal 't52' or a non-terminal expansion. Wait, the initial rule for NT23 is:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the lines for NT23 are:\n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\n\nNT5 -> 't52' (but I think there's a mistake here; NT5's productions are:\n\nLooking for NT5: there are two rules:\nNT5 -> 't41'\nNT5 -> 't41'\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me scan through the given grammar again.\n\nLooking for NT23, I see:\n\nLine 140: NT23 -> 't52'\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. So yes, under NT23, there is a production that results in the terminal 't52'.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 has a production to 't32'.\n\nSo, going back, the string starts with t23 t32 t38...\n\nNow, if I take S -> NT23 NT32, the first two tokens should be t23 and t32.\n\nBut looking at the productions for NT23, there is a production that produces 't52', which is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-800","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem to solve where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t40 t34 t75 t60 t38 t49 t16 t28 t11 t10 t28 t56 t22 t52 t31 t22 t77 t17 t28 t25 t0 t7 t65 t0 t30 t7 t30 t34 t71 t65 t41 t3 t52 t75 t22 t84 t75 t10 t41 t75 t51`. \n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a Chomsky Normal Form grammar entails. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Additionally, the start symbol does not appear on the right-hand side of any production. This particular grammar seems to be in CNF because all the productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal followed by a non-terminal (but wait, no, in CNF, all productions are either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, so no terminal followed by non-terminal. Hmm, actually, looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT5 -> 't41', which would be terminal symbols. So perhaps the grammar allows for a mix, but the main structure is in CNF.\n\nNext, the string starts with `t40`, and I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol S can produce various combinations like NT21 NT28, etc. Each of these non-terminals eventually leads to terminal symbols through the productions.\n\nI think the best approach here is to parse the string using the grammar, trying to trace from the start symbol down to the string by matching the productions. Since it's a context-free grammar, it's suitable for a recursive descent parser or a reduction using the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t40`. I need to see which production can derive `t40`. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT4 is defined as `NT4 -> 't68'`. But I don't see `t40` appearing directly. Looking further, I see that NT23 and NT22 have `t49`, `t50`, and others. Wait, looking for `t40`, I don't see any NT directly producing it in the productions listed. Hmm, this might be a problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I notice that some non-terminals like NT16 have `t6` and `t10`, but I don't see any NT that directly produces `t40`. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me look through all non-terminals:\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see any NT \u2192 `t40`. For example, NT34 has `t30`, NT25 has `t77`, NT33 has `t49`, NT17 has `t14`, etc. Hmm, this suggests that maybe `t40` is not directly produced by any NT, so perhaps the string is invalid. But maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe the `t40` comes from a combination of two NTs. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So, to get `t40`, we might need a production where one side is a terminal and the other is a non-terminal that eventually leads to another terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, `t40` is the first symbol. So, the first production must be something that starts with `t40` as the first symbol. Looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce `t40`. For example, NT23 is `t43`, NT25 is `t77`, etc. So, perhaps the grammar doesn't have a production for `t40`, making the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Each production in CNF produces two symbols, each of which can be a terminal or a non-terminal. So, to produce `t40`, there must be a production where one side is `t40` and the other is another symbol leading to the rest of the string. But in the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces `t40`.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT production starts with `t40` as part of a two-symbol production, but I need to check. Looking at the grammar, for example, NT25 -> `t77 NT2`. NT25 could produce `t77` and another symbol, but the first symbol is `t77`, not `t40`. Similarly, NT23 has `t43`, etc.\n\nIf the grammar doesn't have any rule where `t40` is the left-hand side, then the first symbol `t40` can't be generated, so the string is invalid. Therefore, the answer is \"No\".\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-824","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. My task is to see if the string provided can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and it has a few productions:\n\n1. S -> NT2 NT28\n2. S -> NT32 NT14\n3. S -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo S can produce combinations of different non-terminals. The string given is a series of symbols separated by spaces, which I assume are either terminals or non-terminals. The terminals have specific string representations like 't12', 't32', etc., while non-terminals are denoted by 'NTx' or other letters.\n\nWait, actually looking at the grammar, all the productions have 'NTx' or specific symbols. But the terminals are strings, so in the string to evaluate, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, and the rest are likely non-terminals. My first step is to parse the string into terminals and non-terminals.\n\nThe given string is: `t12 t32 t43 t41 t51 t6 t68 t60 t17 t69 t52 t36 t12 t49 t84 t32 t54 t8 t17 t66 t71 t10 t0 t31 t22 t14 t51 t56 t28 t16 t70 t28 t43 t22 t28 t23 t51 t14 t40 t32 t75 t50`.\n\nSo, I can split this into individual components:\n\n1. t12\n2. t32\n3. t43\n4. t41\n5. t51\n6. t6\n7. t68\n8. t60\n9. t17\n10. t69\n11. t52\n12. t36\n13. t12\n14. t49\n15. t84\n16. t32\n17. t54\n18. t8\n19. t17\n20. t66\n21. t71\n22. t10\n23. t0\n24. t31\n25. t22\n26. t14\n27. t51\n28. t56\n29. t28\n30. t16\n31. t70\n32. t28\n33. t43\n34. t22\n35. t28\n36. t23\n37. t51\n38. t14\n39. t40\n40. t32\n41. t75\n42. t50\n\nEach of these should be matched by the symbols in the grammar productions. Now, I need to see if there's a way to derive this string starting from S.\n\nLet me look at the possible productions from S:\n\nThe first production is S -> NT2 NT28. Let's see what NT2 and NT28 derive to.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are many NTx symbols. For example, NT28 has a production NT28 -> NT11 NT3. Breaking this down, NT11 -> NT25 NT13, and so on. Each step needs to be followed to see how it can produce terminal symbols.\n\nAlternatively, S could also produce NT32 NT14. Let's see: NT32 has a production NT32 -> NT1 NT20, then NT1 -> NT6 NT27, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string starts with any of the possible combinations from S's productions. The string starts with t12, t32, etc., so perhaps I should see if any of the NTx combinations can produce these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t12. So in the parse tree, the first symbol derived must be t12. Now, looking at the grammar, are any NTx symbols producing t12? Let's check the productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT10 NT31\nNT10 -> NT25 NT13\nNT25 -> NT23 NT28\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\nNT27 -> NT11 NT4\n...\nWait, maybe that's too complex. Alternatively, let me look for an NTx that can directly produce t12. Scanning the grammar:\n\nLooking for NTx -> 't12'. From the list, I don't see any NTx that directly produce t12. However, t12 is a terminal and can be part of longer productions. Wait, looking again, maybe I missed something. Let me recheck.\n\nThe productions for NTx: None directly yield t12, but maybe through substitutions. Alternatively, perhaps t12 is part of a larger NT production. Wait, looking back at the input string, the first symbol is t12. So in the parse tree, the root must be S and derive into NT2 NT28 or other options. But looking at S's first production, S -> NT2 NT28. So if S starts with NT2, let's see what NT2 yields.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT2 has several productions, including NT2 -> NT15 NT18 and NT2 -> NT26 NT33, and others. Let me see what NT2 can produce. For example, NT2 -> NT26 NT33. Then NT26 -> NT28 NT22 (I think not; looking back, NT26: NT26 -> NT28 NT22? Wait, let me check the grammar rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, let me list out the relevant rules for NT26:\n\nNT26 -> NT28 NT22\nNT26 -> NT18 NT34\n...\n\nSo, if S -> NT2 NT28, then perhaps after expanding NT2, we get components that include NT28. Since the string starts with t12, t32, etc., perhaps NT2 can produce something starting with t12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is derived from another part of S's productions. Wait, the second production of S is S -> NT32 NT14. NT32 has a production NT32 -> NT1 NT20, and NT14 has NT14 -> NT34 NT7, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with t12, which would need to come from some NTx production. Let me try to see if any of the NTx can start with t12.\n\nLooking at NT12:\n\nNT12 -> NT25 NT3\nNT25 -> NT23 NT28\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\nNT27 -> NT11 NT4\n...\nNot helpful. Alternatively, NT25 has NT25 -> NT5 NT13, but that might not lead to t12.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this with a bottom-up method or look for sequences that could be reduced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be produced by any combination of S's productions. The string starts with t12, so let's see if any NTx can produce t12 and what follows.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 -> NT10 NT31. NT10 -> NT25 NT13, and NT31 -> NT25 NT13 (again). Hmm, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, looking for NT28: NT28 -> NT11 NT3. NT11 -> NT25 NT13, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should pick the first symbols of the string and see if they can fit into any NTx productions.\n\nThe first symbol is t12. So perhaps NT2, which is S's first production, might lead into t12. Let me see:\n\nNT2 -> NT15 NT18 (since S -> NT2 NT28)\nThen NT15 -> NT21 NT23\nNT21 -> NT21 NT24 (Wait, no: NT21 is in the grammar. Wait, looking back, the grammar says:\n\n\"NT21 -> NT21 NT24\"\n\nBut if NT21 is a non-terminal, perhaps we can substitute it again. But getting t12, which is a terminal, perhaps T12 can be produced by some NTx that expands into it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for t12 in the grammar. Let me scan through all the grammar rules to see if any NTx directly produce t12.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\nNT26 -> NT28 NT22\nNT22 -> NT18 NT32\nNot seeing t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-821","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out whether this grammar generates the given string. So, first, I need to understand the grammar structure. The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is good because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier, but in this case, I'm just trying to determine if the string is generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems that the start symbol is S, and S can produce combinations of NT2, NT3, etc. Each production is a combination of two non-terminals, which suggests that each step of the derivation splits the string into two parts. The string we need to check is 57 tokens long, and I'm given the full breakdown of each token, which can help me see how they might fit together.\n\nI should note that in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. I see that some of the productions do have terminals (like NT5 -> 't41'), but most are non-terminals combining other non-terminals. Since the string only contains terminals ('t' followed by numbers), I need to see if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals through some combination.\n\nThe string is: t10 t43 t17 t40 t84 t25 t56 t0 t34 t41 t68 t43 t43 t38 t65 t54 t54 t0 t71 t32 t68 t71 t3 t70 t10 t75 t61 t54 t66 t71 t70 t71 t54 t70 t71 t25 t56 t69 t60 t54 t6 t0.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with several terminals. Each production in the grammar combines two non-terminals, so perhaps each t is generated by a non-terminal, which might be the result of a series of productions.\n\nHowever, some of the non-terminals in the grammar directly produce terminals. For example, NT5 -> 't41', which is why I see both 't41's in the string. Similarly, NT17 -> 't14', which isn't in the string, but that's okay. I also see NT0 -> 't61', 't0', etc.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string from the end using a recursive descent or top-down approach. Starting from S, which is NT2 NT28. So, the first step would be to split the string into two parts, each corresponding to NT2 and NT28. Since the string is quite long, I might need to break it down into smaller parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the given string step by step through the grammar. The string starts with 't10'. Looking into the grammar, NT10 can produce 't32' or other combinations.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar productions. Looking for NT10:\n\nYes, there are a few NT10 productions, including NT10 -> 't32' and NT10 -> 't0'. Also, NT10 can derive other combinations, but in the given string, the first three terminals are t10, t43, t17. So, how might that work?\n\nLet me think: S is NT2 NT28. So, string starts as... well, perhaps NT2 produces the first part, and NT28 produces the second part, or vice versa, because the order is flexible.\n\nIf I take the first part as NT2, which can be 't10', and the second part as NT28.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions: I see NT2 -> 't23', 't17', etc. Wait, let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT2: The productions include NT2 -> 't17', 't23', etc. Wait, no, I think I need to list them.\n\nWait, I need to scan the grammar for each NT2 production:\n\nLooking through all the productions with NT2 as the left-hand side:\n\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT2 -> NT17 -> 't25'\n- NT2 -> NT18 -> 't38'\n- NT2 -> NT26 -> NT33\n- Wait, this might be getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parse the string step by step, applying the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: let's see if the entire string can be built by applying the grammar in a top-down manner.\n\nThe first symbol is t10. Let me see what NT10 can generate. From the grammar, NT10 -> 't32' and NT10 -> 't0', as well as possibly other combinations. So, t10 could be produced directly as 't32' or 't0', but in the string, t10 is the first symbol.\n\nWait, the string starts with t10, so if NT10 produces t10, but looking at the grammar, NT10's productions are 't32', 't0', and some combinations.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT10 -> 't32' or 't0', and perhaps other combinations.\n\nLooking for NT10:\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT10 -> 't32', and several combinations with other non-terminals. Additionally, there are NT10 -> 't0' and some others. So, in the given string, the first token is t10. Does NT10 produce 't10'?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT10 -> 't10'. It has 't32' and 't0'. So the only way to get 't10' is for a different non-terminal to produce it, but maybe a combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part is generated by NT2, which can produce t10.\n\nNT2 is one of the main symbols. Looking through NT2's productions:\n\nNT2 -> 't23', 't17', 't5', etc., but does NT2 produce 't10'?\n\nLooking everywhere, it seems NT2 has several productions:\n\nLooking through all the NT2 rules:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't10' from NT2. Let me check again.\n\nHere are NT2's rules:\n\n- NT2 -> 't17'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT2 -> 't54'\n- NT2 -> 't26' (Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT2 rules like:\n\nNT2 -> 't23', NT2 -> 't17', NT2 -> 't54', and NT2 -> 't0'? No, 't0' is produced by NT0.\n\nWait, more accurately: Checking each production with NT2 as LHS:\n\nLooking through, I don't recall NT2 directly producing 't10'. So if the string starts with t10, it must be produced by a non-terminal that produces 't10'.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, do any non-terminals directly produce 't10'?\n\nLooking through all the rules for terminals:\n\nI see NT0 -> 't61', 't0', etc.\n\nNT2: looking at NT2 -> 't23' etc., but 't10' is not among them.\n\nWait, I don't see any production where any non-terminal directly produces 't10'. So, perhaps 't10' is a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nFor example, if a non-terminal N produces X and Y, and X produces 't5' and Y produces 't5', or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't10' is produced as part of a larger combination.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to find a way to split the entire string into possible subcomponents that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is 57 symbols long, which is quite long, so perhaps each step in the parse corresponds to two parts of the string.\n\nStarting with the entire string, which should be split into two parts via S = NT2 NT28.\n\nLooking at the first half and the second half, maybe. Let's see.\n\nThe first part: t10, t43, t17, t40, t84, t25, t56, t0, t34, t41, t68, t43, t43, t38, t65, t54, t54, t0, t71, t32, t68, t71, t3.\n\nThe second half: t70, t10, t75, t61, t54, t66, t71, t70, t71, t54, t70, t71, t25, t56, t69, t60, t54, t6, t0.\n\nWait, if we split the string into two parts, each corresponding to NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-836","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol seems to be S, as it's the only one on the left side in the productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t30 t7 t54 t25 t60 t61 t54 t68 t84 t34 t28 t31 t68 t11 t77 t3 t40 t10 t7 t11 t16 t54 t54 t7 t6 t31 t68 t61 t32 t70 t6 t43 t60 t25 t50 t60 t60 t43 t54 t84 t17.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar has a lot of non-terminals and productions, this might get complex. Maybe I can use a top-down or bottom-up approach. Bottom-up might be easier for a single string.\n\nIn bottom-up parsing, I start with the string and try to reduce it using the productions until I reach the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll list all the symbols: t30, t7, t54, t25, t60, t61, t54, t68, t84, t34, t28, t31, t68, t11, t77, t3, t40, t10, t7, t11, t16, t54, t54, t7, t6, t31, t68, t61, t32, t70, t6, t43, t60, t25, t50, t60, t60, t43, t54, t84, t17.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is a step where a non-terminal expands into two symbols. The string can be thought of as a sequence of terminals (like t30, t7, etc.), and I need to group them in pairs that match the right-hand side of some production.\n\nSo, I'll try to match these terminals from the end, working backwards. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string ends with t17, which corresponds to the production NT17 -> 't14'. But wait, the non-terminals include NT and T, but let me check the productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT17 -> 't14', which is one of the productions. Also, NT17 -> 't49' which is another production. But the symbols in the string are t17 towards the end, which is one of the terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should start from the beginning. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree, but with a string of 41 symbols, it's quite long. Maybe I can look for symbols that correspond to the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can look at the first few symbols and see if they can be produced by any non-terminal. The first symbol is t30, which seems to be one of the terminals. Let me look through the productions to see if any non-terminal produces t30.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT23 -> 't60', NT24 -> 't22', etc. Wait, looking for t30: in the productions, I see NT33 -> 't33 NT19' and NT33 has other productions, but not 't30' directly. Wait, looking at the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't30'. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT17 -> 't14' or 't49'\n- NT7 -> 't3' or 't84'\n- NT18 -> 't66' or 't7' or 't68'\n- NT2 -> 't23' or 't38' or 't32' or 't26' or ... Hmm, not seeing 't30' as a terminal.\n\nWait a minute, looking again, I see in the productions:\n\n- NT33 -> 't33' NT19\n- Also, NT33 -> 't7 NT22' at the end: NT33 -> 't7 NT22' \n\nWait, looking for 't30' as a terminal. Let me check all the production rules for terminals:\n\nLooking at the entire grammar, the only terminals are the 't' symbols, which are fixed. Are any of the productions for non-terminals directly equal to 't30'? Let's see.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- For example, NT22 -> 't22' appears in NT22 -> NT26 NT22, and elsewhere. Wait, wait, in the productions:\n\nAh, yes! There's NT22 -> 't22'. Similarly, NT24 -> 't22'. Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the productions listed:\n\n- NT22 -> 't22' is a production? Wait, no. Hmm, I see NT24 -> 't22', but that's a production, but it's in NT24's case.\n\nWait, let me check the list again:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT24 -> 't22' is a production, and NT22 -> 't8' (does it?) Wait, actually, looking carefully, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't22', which is a production, so NT24 can produce 't22'.\n- NT22 -> 't22', but I'm not sure. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces 't30'.\n\nWait, in the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't30' directly. Or does one exist? Let me check again.\n\nWait, going through each NT production, do I see any that produce 't30'? For example, looking at all the 't' productions.\n\nWait, NT33 has some productions, but not 't30'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some. Alternatively, perhaps 't30' is the expansion of some non-terminal. Let me check if any NT production has 't30' as part of it.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\n- I see NT33 -> 't7' and NT22 -> 't22', but no 't30' as a terminal. So either the grammar doesn't have 't30' as a terminal, which is strange, but perhaps it's a non-terminal expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed differently. Maybe try to parse the string by grouping symbols into pairs that match the production rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the string can be processed by looking for pairs of symbols that match the right-hand side of a production.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t30. I need to see if there's a production that starts with t30, but looking at the productions, it seems that t30 is a terminal produced by NT33. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions for NT33, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> 't33 NT19'\n- Other NT33 productions: NT33 -> 't7 NT22', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for a production where a non-terminal is expanded into 't30' followed by something else. But if 't30' doesn't appear as a terminal directly, that complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the productions to see if 't30' is present as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Yes, the production NT24 -> 't22' is there.\n- NT22 -> 't22' is there.\n- NT5 -> 't41' and 't84' (as parts of other productions), but not 't30'.\n- Looking further, I see NT33 -> 't33 NT19' and other 't' productions, but no 't30' as a terminal.\n\nSo if 't30' is a terminal, but it's not part of any production as a terminal, maybe 't30' is part of a longer production, but in the grammar, that's not the case because in CNF, each production's right-hand side has exactly two symbols or a single terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I need to see if there's a production that includes 't30' in its RHS.

For example, the rule NT17 -> 't14' so 't14' is in the terminal set. Similarly, NT5 -> 't3' (since it's NT5 -> NT5 NT20, but wait, that's a production, not a terminal. Wait, looking closer, I see NT5 has a rule that includes 't41' or 't3'?

There are multiple non-terminals that directly produce terminals.

The string has 't75' at the beginning and end, so that's a problem because it wasn't in the grammar.\n- t3: Is 't3' present? Yes, NT3->'t31' which is 't31', but I don't see 't3. Wait, let me look again. Oh, wait, in the grammar, there's NT5->'t41' and other t's, but no 't3'. Wait, does any non-terminal produce 't3'? Let me scan the productions.\n\nLooking for 't3' in the grammar... Hmm, in the rules, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7, which doesn't directly produce a terminal. I don't see any NT producing 't3' except maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me check each production:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT21 \u2192 't8', 't6', 't0', 't28', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't31', 't7'\n- NT14 \u2192 't65'\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\n- NT24 \u2192 't22'\n- NT32 \u2192 't54', etc.\n- NT19 \u2192 't25', 't66', etc.\n- NT23 \u2192 't52', 't56', etc.\n- NT22 \u2192 't8', 't32', etc.\n- NT13 \u2192 't71'\n- NT7 \u2192 't3', but NT7 is a non-terminal that produces 't3'? No, wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, there's a rule NT7 -> 't3'. Yes, there's a production NT7 -> 't3'.\n\nSo, 't3' is permissible because NT7 can produce it. However, looking at the string, I see 't3's in the middle, so that's okay. Similarly, 't7' is produced by NT3 \u2192 't7', so that's allowed.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- t70: There's a production NT70 exists? Wait, the grammar has NT3->'t7' (if I remember correctly), but let me check: NT3 has a rule NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7 and another rule NT3 \u2192 NT32 NT20... Wait, no, I think 't70' is one of the outputs, looking in the rules, I don't see any NT producing 't70' directly. So that would be a problem because there's no 't70' terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking further, for 't69': checking the grammar, any NT producing 't69'? I don't see any.\n\nWait, let's go through all the terminals in the string and check if each is a terminal in the grammar. From the provided grammar, I can see that all terminals are either in the form 't1x', where x is a number. Looking through the rules, some of these 't's are produced by specific NTs:\n\nFor example, 't75' is not present anywhere in the terminals. The grammar doesn't have any NT that directly produces 't75'. So, any occurrence of 't75' in the string would make the string invalid, as there's no rule for that.\n\nSimilarly, 't3 t32 t17 t7 t36 t8 t69 t36 t66 t0 t41 t23 t36 t70 t31 t49 t69 t6 t84 t56 t30 t61 t38 t66 t0 t69 t75 t41 t16 t12 t36 t38 t14 t50 t75 t3 t3 t43 t60 t69 t11 t17'.\n\nWait, that's quite a long string. Let me list all the terminals:\n\nt75, t3, t32, t17, t7, t36, t8, t69, t36, t66, t0, t41, t23, t36, t70, t31, t49, t69, t6, t84, t56, t30, t61, t38, t66, t0, t69, t75, t41, t16, t12, t36, t38, t14, t50, t75, t3, t3, t43, t60, t69, t11, t17.\n\nSo, the terminals are:\n\nt75, t3, t32, t17, t7, t36, t8, t69, t36, t66, t0, t41, t23, t36, t70, t31, t49, t69, t6, t84, t56, t30, t61, t38, t66, t0, t69, t75, t41, t16, t12, t36, t38, t14, t50, t75, t3, t3, t43, t60, t69, t11, t17.\n\nNow, I'll check each terminal to see if it's present in the grammar:\n\n- t75: No rule in the grammar where a non-terminal directly produces 't75'.\n- t3: Yes, NT7 produces 't3'.\n- t32: Do any NT's directly produce 't32'? Looking through, no. Wait, NT32 has a rule, like NT32 \u2192 NT11 NT3, etc., but no terminal 't32' in the terminals. Or wait, maybe I'm looking for NTs that produce 't32'. Checking the rules, I see NT32 \u2192 NT11 NT3, which doesn't produce a terminal. Hmm. But earlier I saw NT7's rule, which is NT7 \u2192 't3', which would produce 't3'.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- 't3' is allowed because of NT7 \u2192 't3'.\n- 't32' is a terminal in the string. Looking through the grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce 't32'? The production rules: I don't see any NT producing 't32' directly.

{"custom_id":"request-844","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string is quite long, so I'll have to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to identify the start symbol, which is S. The given grammar has several productions from S, each involving combinations of NT2, NT3, NT12, and others. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from S through a series of these productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t66 t6 t66 t75 t34 t54 t16 t12 t10 t68 t14 t11 t41 t65 t16 t70 t61 t31 t8 t40 t40 t36 t30 t68 t77 t11 t66 t75 t56 t32 t22 t70 t49 t40 t23 t28 t77 t50 t65 t68 t0 t16 t56 t0.\n\nI need to break this string into tokens. Each token corresponds to a production's right-hand side. The grammar uses 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals, or non-terminals like NT2, NT3, etc.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string from the beginning. Let's look for any NT productions that directly produce the starting sequence.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t66, t6, t66, t75.\n\nI'll check if the beginning of the string matches any production. Since the start symbol is S, I'll look for the productions starting with NT2, NT32, etc.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n- S -> NT21 NT2 NT25 NT0\nOther S productions don't start with NT2 or NT21, so perhaps I should look for other initial productions.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's grammar list is a bit confusing, but I think I can better parse it by seeing which NTs have productions matching the string.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NTs have multiple productions. For example, NT5 -> 't41' or 't41' via NT17, etc. But it's unclear if this is the production, so perhaps focusing on starting with the first token t66.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider that the parsing process will involve starting with S and using leftmost derivation. So I'll attempt to match the string to the possible non-terminals starting S.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: t66, t6. Wait, but the grammar's S expansions start with combinations like NT21 NT32. For example, S -> NT21 NT2 NT25 NT0, so the initial expansion would produce multiple tokens. But the given string starts with four tokens: t66, t6, t66, t75. That suggests that perhaps the first production used is one that starts with a non-terminal that can produce the first token t66.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to check if the first token t66 is produced by any of the given NT productions.\n\nLooking, for example, NT17 -> 't41' or 't14', but none directly produce 't66'. Wait, looking through all NTs, I see NT17 -> 't14' (but that's in the grammar: NT17 -> 't14' ). Wait, actually, in the grammar, I see NT17 -> 't14' is under NT17 and also under NT2.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, under NT17: the productions are NT17 -> 't14' and NT17 -> 't49'. Similarly, under NT2: NT2 -> 't38' or others. So I need to see if any NT can produce 't66' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I see that NT24 -> 't22', NT3 -> 't31', NT5 -> 't41', etc. Wait, but I don't see NT2, NT3, etc., producing 't66'.\n\nWait, looking back, the string starts with t66, so perhaps a production NT something that can produce t66. Scanning all NTs, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't66' in their productions, except maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nLooking at each NT and their productions:\n\nFor example, NT6 -> 't68' or NT5. Oh, wait, I see NT17 can produce 't14' and 't49'. Where does t66 come from?\n\nWait, perhaps t66 is produced by NT17? But in the grammar, looking at the NT17 production, I see NT17 -> 't14' and NT17 -> 't49'. So I don't see t66 being produced by any NT except if perhaps there's a typo in my exam of the grammar, but I don't see that. Alternatively, maybe t66 is produced by an NT that isn't listed here, but given the provided grammar, I don't see such a rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has a long list of productions. I think I need to see if any NT can produce t66.\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14', 't49'\n- NT2 -> 't38', 't40', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that directly produces t66. So perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar, as the first token can't be produced by any NT. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but to double-check, maybe I missed a production. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the list provided:\n\nNT17 -> 't14', 't49'\n\nOther NTs:\n\nNT32: NT32 -> 't54'\n\nNT21 -> 't8'\n\nNT17 -> 't5' (Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar.\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar lines correctly. For example, some lines are indented after NTx:\n\nThe grammar seems long, so perhaps I need to find whether any NT can generate t66.\n\nBut in the given grammar, all the direct terminal productions are for specific 't' values. For example, NT5 -> 't41', NT17 -> 't14' and 't49', NT7 -> 't3', etc.\n\nI don't see any NT that directly produces 't66', so the first token t66 cannot be derived, so the entire string is invalid.

{"custom_id":"request-842","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has all production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is helpful because it simplifies parsing and analysis.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the production rules either have two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. This confirms that the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t22 t36 t49 t30 t43 t12 t51 t61 t61 t36 t54 t12 t38 t22 t69 t22 t65 t50 t69 t31 t50 t31 t40 t49 t12 t25 t16 t3 t49 t40 t69 t84 t69 t70 t14 t t68 t30 t32 t16 t31 t41 t3`.\n\nI notice that 't' is used in the string, which is different from 't' in the productions (e.g., 't28', 't6', etc.). So, I think the string uses 't' as a placeholder for something else. Wait, looking again, the grammar has productions like NT21 -> NT32 NT6, and some terminals are 't28', 't14', etc. So perhaps 't' is used as a separate terminal or represents a token produced by a rule.\n\nWait, some rules have single terminals, like NT17 -> 't14'. So, the terminals in the grammar are specific strings like 't28', 't14', etc. The input string uses 't22', 't36', etc., which may or may not correspond to the grammar.\n\nTo check if the string can be generated by the grammar, I'll need to see if there's a parse tree from the start symbol S that produces this string.\n\nThe grammar has S \u2192 NT21 NT28. So any valid derivation starts with two non-terminals. The string starts with 't22', which is a terminal. So, to get 't22', there must be a production rule that directly produces it. Looking through the rules, I see NT22 \u2192 't22'. So, 't22' can be generated from NT22.\n\nBut wait, S is NT21 NT28. So, the first step is to derive NT21 and NT28 from S. Each of these is a non-terminal, so they need to be expanded into terminals and other non-terminals until we reach the string.\n\nThis seems complex because the string is quite long. Maybe I can look for sequences in the string that could be generated by specific rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down according to the rules. For example, since S \u2192 NT21 NT28, the string should start with a production from NT21 and then from NT28.\n\nBut the string starts with 't22 t36 t49 ...', so let's see if NT21 and NT28 can generate these sequences.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions: NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT6 or NT26 NT6. So, NT21 can expand into two non-terminals, which have to be expanded further.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 can expand into NT11 NT3 (from S), and NT28 has other productions like NT28 \u2192 NT5 NT2.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't22', which is produced by NT22. So, to get 't22' as the first token, we'd need a production where NT21 or NT28 is generating 't22'. But checking the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't22' except NT22 \u2192 't22'. So, to start with 't22', the NT21 or NT28 would have to derive into NT22 somehow.\n\nWait, but S is NT21 NT28, so both are separate. So, the first part of the string should come from NT21 and the second from NT28. But if the string starts with 't22', then NT21 must generate 't22' directly, but there's no such rule except NT22 does. So, that doesn't fit because S would require NT21 to produce something else, not NT22. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAnother approach: Parse the string step by step. Let's see if the string can be divided into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: `t22 t36 t49 t30 t43 t12 t51 t61 t61 t36 t54 t12 t38 t22 t69 t22 t65 t50 t69 t31 t50 t31 t40 t49 t12 t25 t16 t3 t49 t40 t69 t84 t69 t70 t14 t t68 t30 t32 t16 t31 t41 t3`.\n\nWait, there's a 't' followed by 't68', which is 'tt68'. That seems to be a typo. In the grammar, terminals are things like 't28', 't14', 't6', etc. So 'tt68' would be a problem because the grammar doesn't have that. Maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps it's just 't68'.\n\nAssuming the string is correct, 't' followed by 't68' might be problematic unless there's a rule for that. However, in the grammar, all terminals are specific letters followed by numbers, so 't' by itself might not be a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, there's NT17 -> 't14', so 't14' is a terminal. Similarly, 't28' is a terminal. 't' by itself is not a terminal in the grammar; the terminals have two characters: a 't' followed by a number.\n\nBut in the string, we have 't' as a single character. That's odd because in the grammar, all terminals are at least two characters. So, the presence of single 't's might indicate an invalid string, but I'm not sure. Maybe the single 't's are actually typos and should be 't0' or something. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar allows 't' as a terminal, but in the productions, it's written as 't28', 't14', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar's production rules, I see:\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\nNT18 -> 't66'\nNT26 -> 't28'\nNT18 -> 't41'\nNT3 -> 't31'\nNT14 -> 't65'\nNT3 -> 't7'\nNT6 -> 't68'\nNT13 -> 't6'\nNT24 -> 't22'\nNT14 -> 't51'\nNT10 -> 't0'\nNT28 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't41'\nNT25 -> 't77'\nNT15 -> 't6'\nNT23 -> 't43'\nNT21 -> 't8'\nNT26 -> 't71'\nNT18 -> 't36'\nNT11 -> 't6'\nNT18 -> 't70'\nNT34 -> 't30'\nNT34 -> 't14'\nNT7 -> 't84'\nNT12 -> 't16'\nNT12 -> 't14'\nNT3 -> 't12'\nNT16 -> 't10'\nNT19 -> 't25'\nNT33 -> 't49'\nNT15 -> 't28'\nNT33 -> 't60'\nNT15 -> 't34'\nNT24 -> 't71'\nNT14 -> 't84'\nNT32 -> 't54'\nNT21 -> 't77'\nNT15 -> 't68'\nNT23 -> 't52'\nNT22 -> 't8'\nNT23 -> 't56'\nNT13 -> 't71'\nNT5 -> 't84'\nNT19 -> 't22'\nNT2 -> 't23'\nNT17 -> 't49'\nNT23 -> 't40'\nNT2 -> 't38'\nNT21 -> 't69'\nNT31 -> 't75'\nNT11 -> 't14'\n\nLooking at these, the single 't's are not used as terminals except in the rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a single non-terminal. \n\nThe start symbol here is S, and the string to check is: t51 t28 t40 t8 t11 t56 t61 t3 t23 t61 t41 t7 t7 t69 t23 t75 t49 t49 t12 t3 t56 t31 t8 t38 t7 t16 t56 t12 t43 t71 t40 t68 t43 t30 t43 t52 t7 t6 t38 t3 t49 t51 t71 t77 t0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar can generate this string. Since all the productions are deterministic and in CNF, I think the grammar could be parsed using a recursive descent parser, which builds a parse tree step by step. But doing that manually for a long string might be tedious.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the rules that can produce each of the terminal symbols in the string. Let's list out the terminal symbols in the string: t51, t28, t40, t8, t11, t56, t61, t3, t23, t61, t41, t7, t7, t69, t23, t75, t49, t49, t12, t3, t56, t31, t8, t38, t7, t16, t56, t12, t43, t71, t40, t68, t43, t30, t43, t52, t7, t6, t38, t3, t49, t51, t71, t77, t0.\n\nEach of these terminals must be generated by some production rule. Let's start from S and see if we can get these terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the possible productions are:\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, the first step from S is to expand into two non-terminals. Let's assume the string starts with the first production, S -> NT21 NT28. So, the first two symbols would need to be derived from NT21 and NT28.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t51. Now, are there any productions that produce t51 as the start symbol? Looking through the grammar rules, I see:\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7\nNT17 -> NT5 NT28\nNT7 -> NT27 NT1\nNT18 -> NT20 NT0\nNT21 -> NT8 NT27\nNT33 -> NT7 NT22\nNT19 -> NT32 NT28\nNT2 -> NT26 NT33\nNT16 -> NT18 NT6\nNT5 -> 't41'\nWait, some NTs have terminals directly. For example, several rules end with a terminal. So, looking for nt that produce t51. Let me check each rule as it's defined.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n- NT17 -> NT5 NT28\n- NT7 -> NT27 NT1\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT0\n- NT21 -> NT8 NT27\n- NT33 -> NT7 NT22\n- NT19 -> NT32 NT28\n- NT2 -> NT26 NT33\n- NT16 -> NT18 NT6\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\nWait, some rules have terminals. For example, look for any NT that has a terminal symbol like t51. Let me scan the productions.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, some of the rule bodies result in terminals. For example, I see:\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\nNT14 -> 't65'\nNT0 -> 't61'\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT0 -> 't17'\nNT7 -> 't3'\nWait, some of the rules for NTs directly give a terminal. So, for example, NT17 -> 't14', which produces the terminal t14. But I'm looking for where a non-terminal directly produces t51. Wait, maybe I missed one.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I spot NT25 -> 't77' and others, but none seems to produce t51. Hmm. So if the initial symbol is S, and it's split into NT21 and NT28, then NT21 needs to produce the first part, which is t51.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT21:\n- NT21 -> NT8 NT27\n- NT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nNeither of these directly include t51. So maybe the initial production is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the string doesn't start with NT21 NT28, but one of the other S productions.\n\nLooking at the second production for S: S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nLooking at NT32: production rules for NT32:\n- NT32 -> NT28 NT18\n- NT32 -> NT11 NT3\n- NT32 -> NT27 NT0\n\nWait, so let's see if any of these can produce t51 at the start. But none of these rules end with a terminal, so t51 would have to come from deeper symbols. Alternatively, maybe NT32 itself doesn't produce t51, so perhaps this path isn't correct.\n\nThird S production: S -> NT20 NT25.\n\nNT25 has the production NT25 -> 't77' and others like NT25 -> NT5 NT13. If we're starting with t51, but the first part would be NT20, which has production rules like NT20 -> NT29 NT32, etc. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S isn't the correct one. Alternatively, maybe the way the string starts doesn't match any of the S productions directly. Alternatively, perhaps the first symbol in the string can be generated by some other rules in the grammar.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t51. Looking for any non-terminals that directly produce t51. Scanning the rules, do any NTs have production to t51? Checking, I don't see any NT directly producing t51. So perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The given grammar rules are extensive, but I go through each production to see if any NT directly produces t51. Looking:\n\nLooking at each NT rule, checking if any rule for NT results in 't51':\n\n- NT5 -> 't41' \u2192 no\n- NT17 -> 't14' \u2192 no\n- NT14 -> 't65' \u2192 no\n- NT7 -> 't3' \u2192 no\n- NT8 -> 't27' and others \u2192 no direct t51.\nWait, no NT seems to directly produce t51. So if the string starts with t51, which can't be derived from any NT directly, that's a problem.\n\nWait, wait, looking further: the initial S options are NT21, NT32, NT20. Suppose the entire string is generated by S. Then the first two symbols come from NT21 and NT28 (if S->NT21 NT28). Then the first symbol in the string is t51, which needs to come from NT21, but NT21's rules don't produce t51. Alternatively, if S produced another pair, perhaps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S -> NT32 NT14. Then the first NT is NT32, which could produce a string that includes t51 as part of it. But NT32 rules only generate non-terminals, so how would that lead to t51? Well, perhaps through a chain of derivations.\n\nWait, but if the first symbol is t51, and it can't be directly produced by any NT, that suggests the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Because without a production rule that directly gives t51, it can't appear at the start of the derived string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t51 is in the middle of some longer string, but in the given string, t51 appears as the first symbol. Since no NT produces t51 directly, the string can't be generated.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the provided grammar, I notice that all the productions either combine two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT21 NT28) or sometimes include a terminal (like NT17 \u2192 't14').

In Chomsky Normal Form, all productions except the start symbol are terminals on the right-hand side. The start symbol can have terminals. So, that's acceptable. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF because all the non-terminals (NT) are on the right side of the productions, and the right side can have a mix of non-terminals and terminals after the first symbol.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is `t40 t77 t54 t7 t43 t49 t84 t23 t3 t77 t50 t10 t10 t60 t84 t28 t28 t28 t17 t3 t23 t84 t6 t36 t50 t38 t23 t30 t77 t69 t51 t84 t23 t25 t50 t6 t7 t28 t41 t56 t75 t65 t6 t68 t70`.\n\nI need to parse this string from left to right, applying the grammar's productions to see if I can derive the entire string.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps a top-down parsing approach would work, starting from S and expanding terminals as we go. But since some non-terminals produce terminals directly, like NT17 \u2192 't14', I can replace those immediately.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc. So, the first step is to decide which production to take for S. But since the string starts with t40, I need to see which non-terminals can produce t40.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice certain non-terminals map to specific terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 't43', NT24 \u2192 't22', and so on. I should make a list of which non-terminals produce each terminal. This could help in tracing back from the start symbol.\n\nLet me check if the string contains any t's that correspond to known non-terminals:\n\nt40: Do any NT produce t40? Looking at the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 't43', which is close but not exactly t40. Hmm, maybe t40 is a non-terminal that eventually leads to something else. Wait, looking more carefully, none of the non-terminals directly produce t40. Alternatively, maybe t40 is part of another production. Or perhaps t40 is a terminal that's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, no. In the given grammar, all terminals are 't' followed by numbers, so t40 is a terminal. But in the grammar, the only NT productions I see are combining non-terminals or producing terminals. Let me scan through the grammar rules to see where 't40' appears.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT25 NT13\nNT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27\nNT24 \u2192 NT22 NT9\nNT19 \u2192 NT26 NT32\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\nNT31 \u2192 NT25 NT13\nNT22 \u2192 NT18 NT32\nNT13 \u2192 NT10 NT21\nNT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\nNT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\nNT2 \u2192 NT24 NT16\nNT12 \u2192 NT25 NT3\nNT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31\nNT5 \u2192 NT3 NT32\nNT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20\nBut nowhere do I see a production where an NT produces t40 directly. So, t40 must be a result of a series of substitutions.\n\nSimilarly, other t's like t77: I see NT15 \u2192 't71', NT18 \u2192 't66', NT25 \u2192 't77', etc. So, t77 comes from NT25.\n\nSo, let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t40. Looking at the grammar, which NT can produce t40? If none directly, perhaps t40 is a result of an NT production in a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar doesn't have any NT producing t40, which would mean that the string cannot be generated, but I need to check.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any where an NT's RHS includes t40. So perhaps the initial symbol S cannot derive t40 because none of the S productions start with t40. Let me check the S productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, S \u2192 NT20 NT25.\n\nWait, none of these S productions directly produce t40. So, in the derivation, the first symbol must be the result of an S production, which combines two NTs. But if the string starts with t40, which is a terminal, then perhaps the first NT in the S production must produce t40. But looking at the S productions:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n- NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20\n- NT20 \u2192 NT29 NT3\n\nNone of these directly produce t40. So, unless one of these NTs can eventually derive t40, we can't start with t40.\n\nWait, but for example, NT25 can produce t77, right? So, perhaps an S production like S \u2192 NT32 NT14 may lead to deriving t40 via NT32 and NT14. Let's see:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20, and NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT7. Then NT1 \u2192 NT6 NT27, etc. This could take a while, but perhaps it can lead to t40.\n\nAlternatively, the initial S production might not lead to t40, so maybe the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let's consider each S production and see if any can derive t40 as the first symbol.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28: The first symbol is the result of NT21. From the grammar, NT21 can only be expanded into NT25 NT13. Neither NT25 nor NT13 produce t40 directly. So, this path can't start with t40.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14: The first symbol is NT32. From NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20. NT1 \u2192 NT6 NT27. NT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31. NT10 \u2192 NT25 NT3. NT25 \u2192 't77', which is a terminal. So, NT32 could eventually derive 't77', but the first symbol is 't77', not 't40'.\n\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25: The first symbol is NT20. NT20 \u2192 NT29 NT3. NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT2. NT7 \u2192 't3', which is a terminal. So, the first symbol would be 't3' from NT7 or something else, but not 't40'.\n\nTherefore, none of the S productions directly produce t40 as the first symbol. So, the string cannot be generated because the first symbol in the string is t40, which cannot be derived from any of the S productions.\n\nBut wait, could there be a way to have S -> NT... and one of the NTs produces t40 through multiple productions?\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me clarify: Each production for an NT is replaced by either other NTs or a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a single NT with two NTs or one terminal. So, to derive a string starting with t40, one of the NTs in the starting production must be able to derive t40.\n\nBut looking at the initial S productions, none start with NT that can produce t40 as the first symbol. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the string is part of a larger substitution where a NT eventually produces t40. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14 could produce something that starts with a NT that eventually leads to t40. But from above, NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20 \u2192 ... \u2192 't77', which doesn't help. Similarly, the other S productions don't seem to generate t40.\n\nSo, based"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-871","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar provided is long and detailed, which is a bit intimidating, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals or one terminal on the right-hand side. This structure helps in parsing and also makes it easier to generate or check strings.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that many of the productions are for the non-terminals ending in numbers, like NT2, NT3, etc., and some of these produce terminals like 't' followed by numbers or 't28', 't14', etc. For example, NT34 -> t30 or t14. These terminals seem to be part of the string we need to check.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \n`t56 t23 t49 t60 t7 t75 t28 t56 t12 t65 t75 t22 t3 t23 t60 t22 t36 t43 t84 t3 t7 t43 t84 t77 t71 t65 t71 t34 t3 t69 t50 t36 t12 t70 t77 t70 t51 t36 t40 t38 t28 t25 t65 t41 t7 t61`.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into components and see if each can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation reduces the non-terminals into terminals or further non-terminals, but each production is exactly two symbols on the right.\n\nI think the approach here is to work backward from the given string, trying to match each part to the productions. That is, group the string into possible sequences that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the string. Starting from the beginning:\n\n1. t56: Looking at the grammar, I see NT23 -> t56. So, t56 corresponds to NT23.\n\n2. t23: Next, NT23 also produces t56, but since we've already used t23, which is another production. Wait, NT23 has multiple productions. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\nNT23 -> NT24 NT7\nNT23 -> NT21 NT23\n\nHmm, but in our string, we have t23 again after the first t23. Wait, no, actually, the string is: t56 t23 t49 t60 t7...\n\nWait, perhaps I need to track each symbol or each production step more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see how the string can be constructed step by step using the grammar, ensuring that each part matches a production.\n\nWait another thought: The grammar is in CNF, so each production step replaces a single non-terminal with exactly two symbols on the right. This implies that the derivation tree has a certain structure, and the string's length can be determined by the number of production steps, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the only way to generate terminals is through productions that directly produce a single terminal. The other productions substitute non-terminals with two non-terminals, which in turn can be further expanded.\n\nSo, the string consists of a series of terminals, and each terminal must appear as a direct production from a non-terminal. So, for the string to be in the language, every terminal in the string must be produced by some non-terminal. But wait, the grammar can't produce 't's from the start symbol S; instead, S must be expanded into non-terminals, and those non-terminals expand further until we get terminals.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have misread the grammar. Let me check: the given grammar starts with S -> NT21 NT28, etc., and then each NT has its own productions. Looking at the NT productions, many of them produce terminals. For example, NT23 -> t56, so NT23 can generate the terminal t56 when applied.\n\nSo, the string we're given is a sequence of terminals, and our job is to see if S can derive exactly that string through some series of productions.\n\nBut the grammar is in CNF, which typically implies that all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a. However, in the given grammar, some NT productions produce a single terminal, like NT23 -> t56, which fits the A->a form, and others produce two non-terminals, like NT21 -> NT26 NT6, which fits A->BC.\n\nSo, to check if the string can be generated, I need to see if the entire string can be constructed by expanding S (or some non-terminals) through these productions.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, I might need to look for possible patterns or see if each terminal in the string appears as a direct production of some non-terminal.\n\nLet me list out the terminals in the string:\n\nt56, t23, t49, t60, t7, t75, t28, t56, t12, t65, t75, t22, t3, t23, t60, t22, t36, t43, t84, t3, t7, t43, t84, t77, t71, t65, t71, t34, t3, t69, t50, t36, t12, t70, t77, t70, t51, t36, t40, t38, t28, t25, t65, t41, t7, t61.\n\nThat's a lot of terminals. Each of these must correspond to some production. So, the first question is: can each of these 't' symbols be directly produced by a non-terminal?\n\nLooking into the grammar:\n\nNT23 -> t56, so t56 corresponds to NT23.\n\nNT21 -> t28? Let's check:\n\nLooking at NT21 productions:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\nWait, no NT21 directly produce t28. Wait, looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for any NT21 -> t28. Hmm, looking through:\n\nIn the given grammar, I don't see a production like NT21 -> t28. So, perhaps that's problematic because t28 would need to come from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT28's productions are:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3, etc.\n\nWait, none of them produce t28 directly. Wait, actually, looking at the NT21 productions:\n\nWait, let's double-check the grammar. I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nLooking back, the grammar includes NT32 -> t50, so for example, NT23 could be t56, but perhaps not directly for each 't' in the string.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe each 't' is a terminal, and the non-terminals are supposed to represent the starting symbols. Maybe I need to see if the entire string can be derived from S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, and each non-terminal either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the string must be such that every step in its derivation replaces a non-terminal with two things, either both non-terminals, or as a final terminal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string's length must be 2^n - 1 for some n, where n is the number of production steps. But the given string has 46 terminals, which isn't of the form 2^n -1, so that might invalidate the possibility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer, but that might not be possible.\n\nWait, wait a minute, perhaps I should count the number of terminals. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the string: \n\nt56 t23 t49 t60 t7 t75 t28 t56 t12 t65 t75 t22 t3 t23 t60 t22 t36 t43 t84 t3 t7 t43 t84 t77 t71 t65 t71 t34 t3 t69 t50 t36 t12 t70 t77 t70 t51 t36 t40 t38 t28 t25 t65 t41 t7 t61.\n\nCounting the number of 't's: Let's count each occurrence.

Let me start by recalling how Chomsky Normal Form works. Each production has at most two non-terminals on the right side, and the start symbol is S. The string seems to consist of terminals (like t54, t36, etc.) which are the result of replacing non-terminals in the derivation.\n\nI notice that the grammar ends in a bunch of production rules that replace non-terminals with terminals, such as NT2->t23, NT5->t41, etc. So the string is a sequence of these terminal symbols. \n\nThe first step is to check if the string can be generated by the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can try to build a parse tree for the string or use the pumping lemma, but maybe a better approach is to see if the string follows the production rules.\n\nLet me look at the first symbol: t54. In the grammar, I see that NT28 can produce t50, and NT21 can produce t8. Looking elsewhere, NT32->t54 is a production. So to get t54, we might have NT32 on the left side. \n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t54 t36 t11 t7 t71 t69...\n\nt54 is from NT32, which is a non-terminal. t36 is from... Let me check the productions. NT18->t66 is a terminal, but wait, t36 is here. Looking, NT18->t36 is a production, right? So t36 comes from NT18.\n\nSo the first part is S->NT32 NT2. NT32 is t54, and NT2 is t36. So the first two symbols t54 t36 would come from S->NT32 NT2, which is allowed.\n\nNext, after t36, we have t11. Let's see where t11 comes from. Looking at the grammar, I see NT12->t16 and t14, and NT11->t6. Wait, t11 is directly a terminal because NT11->t6? No, looking again, NT11->t6 is not a production. Wait, the grammar says NT12->t16 and t14, and NT11->t14 and t6. Hmm, no, checking the production rules: there's NT8->t84 and NT8->t8, perhaps? Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar doesn't have NT11 producing t11. So t11 must come from another non-terminal that produces t11. Looking through the rules, I don't see a direct production where NTx->t11. So that's a problem because the third symbol is t11, but I can't find a production that directly produces t11. Maybe I'm missing a production.\n\nWait, let me look again. The grammar has productions like NT0->t61, NT10->t32, etc. But I don't see any NTx->t11. So unless t11 is part of a larger production, but in the string, it's just t11 as a terminal.\n\nHmm, that's a red flag. So if t11 is a terminal symbol, but looking through the grammar, I don't see a production rule that produces t11. That means t11 must be a non-terminal, but it's used as a terminal in the string. That can't be unless it's produced by a non-terminal. But if it's a non-terminal, it must have a production rule. Since I don't see one, that means perhaps the string can't be generated because it uses t11 without a corresponding production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding, and t11 is an abbreviation for a non-terminal that eventually produces t11, but from the given rules, I can't find any NT that directly produces t11. So that would imply that the string is invalid because it contains a terminal that isn't the result of any production.\n\nWait, but let me cross-check. Perhaps t11 is part of another production. Let me look at the production rules again. I see NT12->t16 and t14, but that's for NT12, not t11. Also, NT18->t66. No t11 there. So yeah, no NT directly produces t11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows for multiple steps to reach t11, but I don't see any such path. For example, does any non-terminal A produce a production that includes NT that produces t11 as a terminal? Like A->B t11 C? Wait, that would require B and C to be non-terminals, but t11 is a terminal in A's production. But since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions have only two non-terminals or one, so it's probably not allowed. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is at most two non-terminals. So a production like A-> t11 B would be allowed if B is a non-terminal. But do any productions have t11 as a terminal?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production rule where a non-terminal is followed by a terminal like t11. For example, if I have a production like NTx-> NTy t11, that would mean that t11 is a terminal and NTx can derive to that string. But since I don't have such a rule, the production is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps t11 is a non-terminal with a production rule that I'm missing. Let's check again. The production rules don't include t11 as a result. So t11 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal. But in the string, it's a terminal symbol. That's a problem. Because in the derivation, t11 would have to be replaced by some non-terminal which in turn must expand into something.\n\nSo since t11 isn't generated by any production, the string can't be part of the language because it contains t11 without a corresponding production.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t70 t66 t68 t3 t75 t34 t22 t12 t66 t34 t34 t60 t17 t65 t56 t41 t12 t34 t6 t31 t30 t71 t25 t68 t31 t3 t36 t28 t60 t14 t84 t60 t14 t3 t43 t36 t51 t28 t60 t52 t0 t50 t60 t49 t54 t7`.\n\nThe grammar has a lot of productions, each splitting into two non-terminals or terminals. Looking at the productions, for example, S \u2192 NT2 NT28, but these are uppercase NTs, and in the string, we have lowercase 't's like 't6', 't70', etc. So I need to map these uppercase NTs to the 't's in the string.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT3 is sometimes 't3'. Specifically, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT20 NT13\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7 again\nAlso, NT3 appears to resolve into 't31', which is 't3' in the string. So there's a connection between NT3 and 't3'\/'t31'.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 appears to resolve into 't84' and 't14', etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the grammar as a parser and see if the string can be derived.\n\nGiven the size of the grammar, this could get complex. Instead, perhaps I can build a parse tree for the string.\n\nLet me try breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't6'. Looking at the grammar, where do 't6's come from? Checking the productions, I see NT6 \u2192 't68' and NT24 \u2192 't22', but not sure yet.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which is derived from NT2 and NT28. So S is built by combining two NTs. Let's see what NT2 and NT28 resolve into.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18\n- NT2 \u2192 NT26 NT33\n- NT2 \u2192 NT20 NT31\n- NT2 \u2192 NT26 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT28\n- NT2 \u2192 NT17 NT26\n- NT2 \u2192 NT18 NT32\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT31\n- NT2 \u2192 NT26 NT22\n- NT2 \u2192 NT24 NT16\n- NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT33\n- NT2 \u2192 NT24 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT18\n- And other NTs.\n\nHmm, this is getting too detailed. Maybe I can find where 't6' comes from.\n\nLooking for productions that result in 't6'. For example, NT24 \u2192 't26'? No, let me check:\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't28'\n- NT25 \u2192 't77'\n- NT9 \u2192 't27' (from NT27 \u2192 NT11 NT4, but that's not helpful directly)\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\n\nWait, maybe I should look for where 't6' is directly produced.

Hmm.\n\nWait, checking all terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT3 \u2192 't31' which is 't3'.\n\nAlso, NT6 \u2192 't68'\n\nBut where is 't6'? Looking through the terminal productions, I don't see any NTs directly resolving to 't6' except NT13 maybe, but NT13's productions don't directly produce 't6'. Let me check:\n\nNT13's productions:\n- NT13 \u2192 NT10 NT21\n- NT13 \u2192 NT10 NT21\n- NT13 \u2192 NT18 NT18\n\nSo, no 't6' directly. Maybe 't6' comes from another NT.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe NT34 produces 't30' and 't14':\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT16 NT1 (which probably don't produce t6)\n- NT34 \u2192 't30' and 't14'\n\nNo, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider that the string is a concatenation of 't's, and each 't' must come from a terminal production of some NT.\n\nSo, for each 't' in the string, I need to find a NT that can produce it.\n\nLet me list the 't's in the string and see where they come from:\n\n1. t6 \u2192 which NT? Looking for a production where NT6 \u2192 't6', but in the list, I see NT24 \u2192 't26', NT13 \u2192 t6 via NT13 maybe?\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a reverse mapping: for each terminal, list which NTs produce it.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- 't6' comes from NT24: wait, no, NT24 \u2192 't26' and 't71' (looking back):\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT22 NT27. No, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT71 NT51 (from the list: looking for where NT24 is produced)\n\nWait, actually, the list is:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT71 NT51\n\nNo, that's not right. Let me go through the list again.\n\nThe list provided is long; perhaps an easier way is to scan for each NT and see what terminals they produce.\n\nLooking through the list line by line:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT22\n- NT33 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT22\n- NT7 \u2192 NT27 NT1\n- NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n- NT26 \u2192 NT18 NT9\n- NT18 \u2192 NT16 NT24\n- NT22 \u2192 NT33 NT21\n- NT13 \u2192 NT10 NT21\n- NT24 \u2192 NT71 NT51\n- NT18 \u2192 NT5 NT32\n- NT25 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n- NT15 -> NT21 NT23\n- NT33 -> NT18 NT28\n- NT29 -> NT7 NT2\n- NT8 -> NT27 NT6\n- NT26 -> NT18 NT9\n- NT18 -> NT29 NT7\n- NT22 -> NT33 NT21\n- NT26 -> NT34 NT2\n- NT10 -> NT2 NT22\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT6\n- NT2 -> NT24 NT16\n- NT16 -> NT18 NT6\n- NT20 -> NT29 NT32\n- NT12 -> NT10 NT18\n- NT21 -> NT21 NT24\n- NT16 -> NT5 NT32\n- NT9 -> NT26 NT34\n- NT18 -> NT27 NT1\n- NT12 -> NT10 NT18\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT12 -> NT15 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, the grammar provided should fit that structure. \n\nLooking at the rules, I see that most of them are non-terminals producing two non-terminals. The terminal symbols are things like 't' followed by numbers, which suggests these are the actual terminal tokens. So the grammar seems to be structured correctly.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals, and we need to parse it to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S, which branches into different non-terminals like NT2, NT32, etc. I'll need to see if each part of the string can be matched by the productions.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step. Since the string is quite long, I'll try to see the possible paths.\n\n1. The first symbol is t71. Looking at the productions, I see that NT0 \u2192 t71, and NT33 \u2192 t71, etc. But how do I get to t71? Maybe through NT0.\n\nWait, let's see the rules. NT0 has multiple productions, for example, NT0 \u2192 't61', NT0 \u2192 't17', etc. But I'm not sure how to get to t71. Oh, wait, the user's production rules include NT33 \u2192 t71, but wait, looking back, I see:\n\nAt the bottom, under the grammar, there's a production NT33 \u2192 t71, but I don't see any other NT33 productions. Wait, actually, in the last lines, there are:\n\nNT33 \u2192 t49, t60, t34, etc. Hmm, but maybe some productions lead to NT33.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting a bit overwhelmed. Let me see if I can map the first part.\n\nThe first token is t71. So looking at the grammar, does any variable produce t71? Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT rule that leads to t71. Here's where I notice a lot of rules ending with 'tX', like NT33 \u2192 t33 NT19, etc. But I need to see if any NT directly produces a single tX.\n\nYes, I see towards the end:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't71', and also NT10 \u2192 't32', NT11 \u2192 't6', etc. So, it seems that the grammar does have rules that produce individual tX tokens.\n\nWait, but looking more closely, I notice that some rules for NT are more complex. For example, NT5 \u2192 't41' is a rule, as is NT4 \u2192 't29' and 't10', but I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nNow, starting from S, which has productions like S \u2192 NT21 NT28. So the first step is choosing between different S productions. The string starts with t71, so perhaps the first part of the string comes from some rule leading to t71.\n\nWait, let me see if any rule leads to t71. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t61, t17, t32, t10, t77, t25, t68, t66, t16, t0, t77, etc. I don't see a direct production for t71. Wait, wait, looking again at the rules:\n\nUnder NT33, there's NT33 \u2192 't33' NT19, but I don't see a direct t71. Wait, but there's NT7 \u2192 't3', which is a terminal. But I don't see NT7 producing t71. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the first part is built from a chain of non-terminals leading to t71. For example, if S \u2192 NT21 NT28, and NT21 leads to t7, then perhaps combining with NT28 might lead to other things.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or check the leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each token can be derived from some non-terminal, and the structure makes sense.\n\nLet me try to list the tokens:\n\n1. t71\n2. t77\n3. t43\n4. t49\n5. t31\n6. t50\n7. t17\n8. t34\n9. t34\n10. t66\n11. t68\n12. t10\n13. t16\n14. t65\n15. t38\n16. t61\n17. t38\n18. t30\n19. t28\n20. t61\n21. t75\n22. t14\n23. t10\n24. t68\n25. t66\n26. t16\n27. t0\n28. t77\n29. t25\n30. t84\n31. t43\n32. t61\n33. t11\n34. t50\n35. t34\n36. t50\n37. t70\n38. t51\n39. t69\n40. t30\n41. t71\n42. t69\n43. t38\n44. t52\n45. t8\n46. t49\n47. t43\n48. t43\n\nThis is 48 tokens. Let's see if we can construct a derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nLooking at the first token t71. Let's see if NT21 can produce 't71' as a terminal. Looking at the rules for NT21:\n\nLooking back at the rules, under NT21, I see NT21 \u2192 't8' and NT6. So no direct 't71' production, but perhaps through another step.\n\nWait, perhaps NT21 can lead to a terminal. Let's see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 t8. Hmm, not t71.\n\nAnother look: Is there any rule that produces 't71'? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking again, I see:\n\nUnder the terminal rules towards the end, the last rule is NT18 \u2192 't36', but not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the non-terminal productions and mistaking the t tokens for non-terminals.\n\nWait a minute, no. In the CNF grammar, all grammar symbols are non-terminals except for the terminal symbols. So the 't71' is a terminal token, so a production must end with that. But looking at the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces a single terminal like 't71'. That's a problem.\n\nWait, because in the grammar, are any of the non-terminals directly producing a terminal t71? Looking through the rules, perhaps in the later ones, like:\n\nWait, in the rules under 'terminal rules', I see lines like NT22 \u2192 t8, NT34 \u2192 t30, etc., but none of them produce t71. Hmm. That suggests that the production for NT0 can produce t71, but does it through a chain?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused. Let me retrace.\n\nIn the grammar, some non-terminals produce single terminals. For example, NT0 \u2192 't61', etc., but is there any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't71'?\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nLet me check for NT33, which has rules like NT33 \u2192 t33 NT19, but no rule directly producing t71.\n\nWait, maybe under NT33, is there any production that could lead to t71? No, I don't see any. So is there any non-terminal that directly produces 't71'? Looking through all the rules, it seems no. Then how does the parser generate the string starting with t71?"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar provided seems to fit CNF since all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to check consists of a series of terminals: t0, t32, t69, etc. Each of these must correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that there are several productions that directly correspond to terminals. For example:\n\n- S -> NT2 NT28\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT29\n- NT31 -> NT34 NT1\n- And so on.\n\nBut each of these NT symbols can potentially be expanded into other symbols, including other NTs or terminals.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I should attempt a top-down parsing approach, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if the string can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me break down the string:\n\nThe string starts with t0. Looking at the grammar, S can produce NT2 NT28, among others. So S -> NT2 NT28.\n\nFrom the first character, t0, I need to see if any production starts with a terminal. Looking at the grammar, for example, NT26 -> 't28', so perhaps there's a way for NT2 to produce t0? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT10 -> 't32', and NT28 -> 't50', but not directly t0.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT0 can produce 't61' (among others). Let me check: NT0 has several productions leading to terminals.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 -> 't17'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT0 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't10' (I think that's an earlier mistake, perhaps NT0 -> 't10' is in the grammar, but in any case, the main terminals leading from NT0 include t61, t17, and t11.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, I see several NT0 productions:\n\n- NT0 -> 't61' (from the top of the list)\n- NT0 -> 't17' (later)\n- NT0 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't10', etc.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t0, which is 't0' or 't0'? Wait, no, in the string, the first token is t0, which is lowercase t0. Wait, actually in the string, it's written as \"t0\", but in the grammar, the terminals are written as 't61', 't17', etc. So, perhaps the string uses 't61' as a terminal, not 't0' with two letters. Wait, but the string given is \"t0 t32...\", so each token is a single 't' followed by a number.\n\nIn the grammar, we have various terminals like 't61', 't17', etc. So perhaps in the string, 't0' corresponds to a terminal symbol, perhaps one of the NT0 productions.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any production where NT0 directly produces 't0' as a terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT14 -> 't51'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT33 -> 't7'\n- NT29 -> 't7'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT19 -> 't13'\n- NT20 -> 't50'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT21 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- And so on.\n\nI see that none of these directly produce 't0'. Wait, perhaps the NT0 productions have 't17' or 't61', but not 't0'. So perhaps 't0' is not a terminal but a non-terminal, which would mean that the initial 't0' in the string cannot be a terminal, which would make the string invalid? Wait, but in the string, the tokens are all lowercase 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think: in the grammar, 't28' is a terminal, so in the string, each token like 't0' is a terminal. But in the grammar, NT21 -> 't28', meaning that NT21 can be replaced by the terminal t28 and stop. But for NT0 to produce 't0', we'd need a production like NT0 -> 't0', which I don't see in the grammar. So perhaps the string cannot be generated because 't0' is not in any production.\n\nWait, but the string given starts with 't0', which is a terminal. If none of the productions in the grammar have 't0' as a terminal, then the string cannot be generated, so the answer would be No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any terminal 't0', only 't17', 't61', etc. So if the first symbol is 't0', the parser cannot derive that because there's no production leading to it.\n\nTherefore, the string is invalid.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-923","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I'll read the grammar and the string carefully.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the start symbol S, it can produce two different NT2s. Each of these NT2s seems to have their own productions. For example, NT21 can produce NT32 and NT6, and so on.\n\nThe string to check is: `t22 t28 t16 t43 t0 t22 t60 t0 t6 t70 t70 t11 t30 t50 t11 t84 t22 t54 t69 t41 t12 t23 t71 t8 t68 t54 t30 t22 t60 t54 t36 t0 t22 t51 t84 t68 t52 t14 t12 t75 t3 t52 t10 t49 t6 t36 t10 t25 t7`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each symbol is either a terminal or a non-terminal. So each step in a derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols, either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT21 or NT32. Let's see both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's take S \u2192 NT32 NT28. So the string starts as t22 (from NT28) t28 (from NT32), but looking at the string, the first token is t22. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the first symbols are t22 t28, but according to the grammar, NT28 can produce 't50' or 't27'. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar's NT28 is defined as NT27 NT0, with NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9 and so on. So each of these non-terminals will eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to construct the parse tree. Each production in the grammar ends in terminals, so every string derived from the grammar will be a sequence of these terminals, with the structure dictated by the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens include various t's with numbers. Each of these t's corresponds to a specific production. For instance, 't6' could come from NT6 \u2192 't68' or NT6 \u2192 't10' or others. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't15' NT18\nNT26 \u2192 't28' NT22\nNT8 \u2192 't27' NT6\nand so on. Each production has a non-terminal followed by another non-terminal, except for when it's a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, for example, look at NT5: NT5 \u2192 't41' and NT5 \u2192 't5 NT20'. So NT5 can sometimes produce a terminal ('t41') or a non-terminal followed by a non-terminal.\n\nBut in our string, we start with 't22', which is a terminal. Let's see where 't22' can come from. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't22' NT23\nNT22 \u2192 't8' NT32\nSo 't22' appears in these productions. Let's check the entries for NT24 and NT22.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, I see lines like NT24 \u2192 't22' NT23 and NT22 \u2192 't8' NT32, yes. So 't22' is a terminal, which must come from these rules.\n\nSo let's consider the first production starting with 't22'. It must be NT24 \u2192 't22' NT23, or perhaps another NT that produces 't22' as a terminal. Wait, looking through the grammar, NT24 \u2192 't22' NT23 and NT22 \u2192 't8' NT32, so 't22' is only directly from NT24.\n\nSo the string starts with 't22 t28...'. So perhaps the first NT is NT24, which produces 't22' and then NT23. Then, the next token is 't28', which must come from the second symbol of NT24's production, which is NT23. Let's check if NT23 can produce 't28'. Looking at NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27. So NT23 can't produce 't28' directly; it's a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals. So perhaps that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two tokens are from a different start, like S \u2192 NT21 NT21. Let's see. NT21 can produce 't8' or 't25' directly via NT21 \u2192 't8' NT6 (when NT21 is via NT26 \u2192 't28' NT22, and maybe others), but wait, looking back, the grammar is a bit tangled. I think I need a more systematic approach.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a derivation starting from S and seeing if I can construct the string step by step. Since the string is quite long, perhaps a top-down approach with memoization would help, but it's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the grammar is in CNF, I can parse the string using a recursive descent parser with lookaheads.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe it's better to think in terms of whether all the t's in the string can be generated by the grammar. Each t must correspond to a terminal production, which are defined when a non-terminal directly expands into a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, terminal productions are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't27' NT6\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' and 't5 NT20'\n- NT16 \u2192 't29' NT7\n- NT25 \u2192 't77' NT23\n- NT15 \u2192 't6' NT32\n- NT10 \u2192 't32' NT24\n- NT28 \u2192 't50' NT30\n- NT5 \u2192 't84' NT22\n- NT7 \u2192 't84' NT12\n- NT26 \u2192 't28' NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 't8' NT10\n- NT2 \u2192 't15' NT18\n- NT17 \u2192 't49' NT28\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' NT27\n- NT33 \u2192 't49' NT18\n- NT29 \u2192 't7' NT2\n- NT19 \u2192 't25' NT14\n- NT14 \u2192 't65' NT3\n- NT11 \u2192 't6' NT3\n- NT6 \u2192 't68' NT13\n- NT13 \u2192 't6' NT21\n- NT24 \u2192 't71' NT14\n- NT14 \u2192 't51' NT7\n- NT10 \u2192 't0' NT22\n- NT8 \u2192 't27' NT6\n- NT26 \u2192 't28' NT22\n- NT18 \u2192 't66' NT0\n- NT3 \u2192 't31' NT1\n- NT14 \u2192 't65' NT3\n- NT3 \u2192 't7' NT1\n- NT6 \u2192 't68' NT13\n- NT13 \u2192 't6' NT21\n- NT24 \u2192 't71' NT14\n- NT14 \u2192 't51' NT7\n- NT10 \u2192 't0' NT22\n- NT28 \u2192 't50' NT30\n- NT5 \u2192 't84' NT22\n- NT25 \u2192 't77' NT23\n- NT15 \u2192 't6' NT32\n- NT23 \u2192 't43' NT28\n- NT21 \u2192 't8' NT6\n- NT26 \u2192 't28' NT22\n- NT22 \u2192 't8' NT32\n- NT13 \u2192 't71' NT1\n- NT21 \u2192 't25' NT26\n- NT16 \u2192 't18' NT6\n- NT20 \u2192 't29' NT32\n- NT12 \u2192 't14' NT24\n- NT12 \u2192 't14' NT24\n- NT3 \u2192 't12' NT1\n- NT16 \u2192 't10' NT31\n- NT9 \u2192 't26' NT34\n- NT12 \u2192 't14"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive with multiple non-terminals and terminals. The string to evaluate starts with 't54 t12 t31 ...' and ends with 't50 t36 t49 ...' etc. My first thought is that each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal symbol, so I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which has productions like S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc. I need to check how these non-terminals expand into terminals. For example, NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29, and so on. Each step should lead to terminals or other non-terminals until everything is resolved into terminals.\n\nI'll try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. Starting with 't54', I need to see which production could result in 't54' as the first terminal. Looking at the grammar, 't54' appears in NT23 \u2192 NT21 NT53? Wait, no, looking again, I don't see 't54' in any immediate production. Wait, maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, 't54' appears in the grammar as a terminal from NT23. Let me check: NT23 \u2192 NT24 NT27 \u2192 NT22 NT98? Hmm, no, I'm getting confused. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT24 NT27. But 't54' is a terminal. Wait, let me check all the terminals:\n\nI see that some NT productions directly map to terminals like NT17 \u2192 't14', NT0 \u2192 't61', NT26 \u2192 't28', and so on. Each of these is a production where a non-terminal becomes a single terminal 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, perhaps each of these NT rules produce a single terminal. So in the grammar, for example, NT5 \u2192 't41', which is a production with a single terminal on the right. So that's a way to produce a single 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, to get the string, each 't' followed by digits must come from a production that terminates at that node. So, for example, if 't54' is a terminal, it must come from some NT that directly produces 't54', or through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces a terminal starting with t54 except maybe by following some path. For instance, maybe NT23 \u2192 't54'. Looking back at the grammar entries, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't41'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't61'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't32'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't49'\n\nWait, but I don't see any NT that produces 't54' directly. Hmm, perhaps I need to follow the chain of NTs until I reach a terminal, and see if 't54' is the result of some production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each terminal is a single step in some production. So I need to see if the given string can be broken down step by step into symbols derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't54', I need to find a production in the grammar that eventually produces 't54'. For example, looking at NT23, it's defined as NT24 NT27. Then NT24 is NT22 NT33, which is NT26 NT22, and NT22 is NT18 NT32, and so on. It seems like each of these NTs is a chain of other NTs until it hits a terminal.\n\nWait, let's take NT23. NT23 \u2192 NT24 NT27 \u2192 NT22 NT33 NT27 \u2192 NT18 NT32 NT33 NT27 \u2192 NT26 NT22 NT33 NT27 \u2192 NT18 NT9 NT22 NT33 NT27 \u2192 NT16 NT18 NT32 NT33 NT27 \u2192 ... This might not be the right approach. Maybe I need to look for a path that ends with 't54'.\n\nWait, 't54' is produced by NT21 \u2192 't54'? No, actually, looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't54'. Wait, perhaps I need to check all the NT rules for any that have 't54' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any direct 't54' production. So perhaps 't54' is a result of expanding some NTs until we reach that terminal. Let me check. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT24 NT27. NT24 \u2192 NT22 NT33. NT22 \u2192 NT18 NT32. Then NT18 \u2192 NT26 NT7. NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT2. Wait, but NT28 is 't50', and NT2 is 't23', but NT23 again and so on. It's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long and contains many 't's that aren't covered by the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps I should try to check if each step can be derived.\n\nWait, another approach: build a parse tree step by step. Let's take the string and try to parse it. The string is:\n\nt54 t12 t31 t43 t56 t70 t75 t69 t60 t7 t10 t3 t11 t51 t38 t41 t11 t3 t32 t71 t6 t8 t16 t12 t71 t77 t68 t17 t40 t68 t49 t66 t49 t60 t36 t56 t10 t50 t56 t7 t14 t6 t17 t31 t23 t3 t60 t12 t10.\n\nThat's 45 tokens. Hmm. Let's try to see how each of these starts.\n\nLooking at the first token, 't54'. Does any NT in the grammar produce 't54'? Looking through the entries, I don't see 't54' as a production on the right-hand side of any NT. So perhaps the first token comes from a complex derivation that eventually produces 't54'. Or maybe not, and that's the issue\u2014the first token is 't54', but the grammar doesn't have any NT that produces 't54', so it might not be in the language.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The grammar's terminals are all the 't' followed by numbers like 't54', 't12', etc. Each of these is produced by some NT rule. So, for example, NT5 \u2192 't41', so the string 't41' is present, but we don't have 't54'. So perhaps the string contains a 't54' that isn't part of any NT production. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother check: perhaps I should see which terminals are present. The NT rules produce terminals like 't54', 't32', 't12', etc. So if 't54' is a terminal, it must be the result of some NT production, but looking at the provided grammar, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly can produce 't54'. All the NT productions terminate in some 't' with digits, but none of them, upon expansion, produce 't54' as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string contains a 't54' which is not produced by any NT in the grammar, so the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

S -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo whatever string we're evaluating, it must start with either NT2 followed by NT28, or NT32 followed by NT14, or NT20 followed by NT25.\n\nLet me check the string: the first token is t66. Wait, but in the grammar, the terminals are things like t28, t14, etc. So t66 is a terminal. Let me see if t66 corresponds to any production.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT14 -> 't51'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't71'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT33 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't34'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- NT14 -> 't84'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT21 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT23 -> 't56'\n- NT13 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n- NT19 -> 't22'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT11 -> 't14'\n\nWait, I see that NT18 -> 't66'. So the first token t66 must be the result of NT18.\n\nLooking at the grammar, where does NT18 come from? From the rules, I see NT18 is produced by:\n- NT16 -> NT18 NT6\n- NT22 -> NT18 NT32\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT0\n- NT18 -> NT27 NT1\n\nHmm, but none directly produce t66 except for NT18 -> 't66'. So that must be the path: NT18 -> t66.\n\nSo the first part of the string is generated by NT18, which must derive to t66. Then, from NT18, we have other possibilities. Let's look at the first two tokens: t66 and t32.\n\nWait, the string starts with t66, then t32. But in the grammar, the NT18 can produce t66 alone, but to get t32 after t66, the NT18 must produce more. But looking at the production rules for NT18, the only terminal is t66, so if NT18 -> t66, then the next symbol would have to come from another production. Wait, perhaps I got this wrong.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The grammar uses Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So NT18 can produce t66 directly, but that's the only terminal in its production. So if the string is t66 followed by t32, then after NT18 produces t66, the next step must involve another production.\n\nWait, perhaps the first part is S -> NT20 NT25. Let me check the grammar rules for NT20 and NT25.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- NT20 -> NT32 NT13\n- NT25 -> NT5 NT13\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me list all the rules for NT20 and NT25.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n- NT3 -> NT20 NT13\n- NT25 -> NT5 NT13\n\nWait, from the given rules, I think:\n- NT20 -> NT32 NT13 (is that right? Let me check the list.)\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT3 -> NT20 NT13\n- NT25 -> NT5 NT13\n\nSo yeah, NT20 -> NT32 NT13, but wait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT3 -> NT20 NT13\n- NT25 -> NT5 NT13\n\nBut in the rules provided, I see:\n\n- NT3-> NT20 NT13\n- NT14-> NT5 NT34\n- Not directly for NT20. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to approach this differently.\n\nSince the string starts with t66, which must come from NT18 -> 't66'.\n\nAfter producing t66, the next symbol is t32. So, where does t32 come from?\n\nLooking at the grammar, t32 is produced by:\n\n- NT32 is a non-terminal that can produce various things, such as NT1 NT28, etc. But in terms of terminals, one of the productions is NT21 -> NT26 NT6, but that's non-terminal. Wait, no.\n\nLooking for terminal symbols in non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for the productions that result in terminal strings.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, the terminals are the strings between spaces, like t66, t32, etc. But in the grammar, these are actually terminals in C-F G, so the non-terminals are the NT followed by numbers, and the rest are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the representation. Let me clarify:\n\nIn a typical C-F grammar, non-terminals are, for example, S, NT1, NT2, etc., and terminals are letters or symbols that don't split into further non-terminals.\n\nBut in the provided grammar, every production starts with a non-terminal and either expands into two non-terminals or a mix, and the terminals are strings like t66, t32, etc.\n\nSo to parse the given string, we need to see if it can be constructed starting from S, expanding according to the rules until we reach the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to build a parse tree step by step, starting from S.\n\nThe string is: t66 t32 t17 t30 t66 t31 t61 t3 t22 t14 t17 t6 t43 t7 t22 t25 t40 t34 t84 t65 t6 t77 t7 t75 t7 t52 t51 t10 t75 t8 t50 t0 t25 t0 t68 t11 t51 t32 t3 t75 t65 t38 t3 t0 t68 t70 t10 t34 t50 t3.\n\nLet me try to see which part of the grammar can produce this.\n\nStarting with S. S can produce NT2 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25.\n\nLooking at the first symbol,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-932","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. There are several productions starting with S and NT, which I assume are non-terminals. The terminal symbols at the end of the productions indicate that certain parts are literal symbols, like 't28' or 't6', which I should treat as terminal tokens.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t68 t16 t25 t41 t23 t70 t84 t22 t60 t28 t52 t6 t17 t65 t36 t41 t71 t3 t0 t6 t31 t51 t61 t0 t49 t60 t40 t32 t7 t16 t50 t69 t22 t25 t28 t77 t66 t70 t54 t16 t28 t34 t8 t23 t60 t32 t43 t52 t75 t25`.\n\nEach of these is a terminal symbol, meaning that the string is a sequence of these tokens. My task is to parse this sequence according to the grammar rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation should match the string. I can try to construct a parse tree or use a recursive descent approach, but given the complexity, perhaps a better method is to simulate the parse step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. Let's see what the productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo S can split into two non-terminals each time. The string starts with t68, which corresponds to NT6 (from the terminal list, where NT6 is 't68'). So maybe NT6 is a production leading to 't68'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production for NT6 is: NT6 \u2192 NT13 NT21.\n\nWait, but NT6 is a non-terminal, so it can't directly produce a terminal. It has to produce other non-terminals. Then, those non-terminals need to produce terminals eventually.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up. The productions for NT6 are: NT6 \u2192 NT13 NT21, and I also see that NT6 \u2192 't68'? Wait, looking back at the productions:\n\nUnder the 'NT' rules, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT13 NT21\nNT13 -> NT10 NT21\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\nNT6 -> 't68'\n\nAh, so NT6 can be either NT13 NT21 or 't68'. That's crucial. So in the string, we have 't68' which must come from NT6.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t68, which comes from NT6. Now, NT6 can't be the root; the root is S. So in the parse tree, S would split into NT21 and NT25, each of which would need to produce tokens that together form the string.\n\nWait, but 't68' is a terminal, so it must be the result of NT6 expanding to 't68'. That means that the first part of the string must be produced by NT6. Let's see how that happens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 has two rules:\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT13 NT21\n2. NT6 \u2192 't68'\n\nSo the first token 't68' suggests that the initial NT6 must expand to 't68', which is possible. Therefore, in the parse tree, the leftmost symbol would be S \u2192 NT21 NT25, and then one of the NTs must generate 't68' from NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT21 NT25. Then, in the string, the first token is t68, which comes from NT6 expanding as 't68'. But which NT is responsible for that? Since the leftmost is S, it splits into NT21 and NT25. So perhaps NT21 is generating the t68. But looking at the productions, NT21 has several rules, including NT21 \u2192 't69' (from the list: NT21 -> 't69'), and 't8', etc.\n\nWait, let me look at the NT21 productions:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT25 NT18\nNT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\nNT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\nNT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24\nNT21 \u2192 NT21 NT26\nNT21 \u2192 NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18\nWait, some are complex. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a top-down parsing approach, since the grammar is in CNF. Let's think of each non-terminal and see how they can produce the tokens.\n\nThe string starts with t68, which is 't68'. Looking at NT6's productions, it can produce 't68' directly. So if the root is S, and S \u2192 NT21 NT25, then perhaps one of the non-terminals needs to produce 't68'. But in the initial split, S is NT21 NT25, which don't directly produce 't68'. So that's a problem. Wait, that can't be. Because 't68' is the first token in the string, derived from NT6, which is the leftmost NT in some expansion.\n\nSo perhaps after S \u2192 NT21 NT25, one of those NTs must generate another NT6, which then generates 't68'. But then NT21 and NT25 would have to somehow produce the rest of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts by expanding S into NT6 NT25 or another combination. Wait, but S's first production is NT21 NT25, and then we have to consider the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT6 NT25? Let me check: S's productions are:\n\nS -> NT21 NT25\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo the first is NT21 NT25, the second is NT32 NT14, the third is NT20 NT25. So in the initial step, S splits into NT21 and NT25, because it's their production.\n\nSo the leftmost token is 't68', which must come from NT21's expansion. So in the initial step, S \u2192 NT21 NT25, then NT21 must expand to 't68', which can happen if NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0, but NT6 can produce 't68', but wait, NT21's rule is:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT25 NT18\nNT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\nNT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\nNT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24\nNT21 \u2192 NT21 NT26\n...\n\nLooking for a way for NT21 to produce a 't68'. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe another production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not possible because in the initial step, S \u2192 NT21 NT25, and the first token is 't68', which would require NT21 to expand into something that starts with 't68'. But looking at the possible expansions of NT21, I don't see a direct production that starts with 't68'. The only production for NT26 is 't68' or other combinations.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLooking at NT26's productions:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT28 NT22\nNT26 \u2192 NT22 NT8\nNT26 \u2192 NT18 NT34\nAnd also, looking earlier: NT26 \u2192 't28', 't1'...

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it makes the structure of the grammar easier to analyze.\n\nFirst, I look at the start symbol, which is S. From S, the productions are:\n\nS -> NT2 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nI notice that the start symbol S branches into three different options. Each of these involves other non-terminals (NTx). My goal is to see if any of these options can eventually lead to the string \"t54 t65\".\n\nLooking at the string, it's two tokens: t54 and t65. I need to see which non-terminals can produce these tokens. Scanning through the productions, I find that some terminals like t54 and t65 are directly produced by certain NT productions.\n\nLet me check NT28 because \"t54\" appears in the production for NT28. Wait, looking back, I see that NT28 -> 't50', but that's not matching \"t54\". Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I made a mistake. Oh, wait, I need to check all the productions for each NT.\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I see that NT28 is defined in the productions, but it goes into terminals like 't14', 't50', etc. Wait, in the list, I see NT28 is derived from other NTs, but for the given string, the terminal symbols are t54 and t65. So I need to check if any NTs produce t54.\n\nLooking again, I see that NT5 produces 't41' and 't84'. Hmm, that's not it. Wait, perhaps I'm not looking correctly. Let me go through all the NTs and see which ones can produce t54.\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\n- NT5: 't41', 't84'\n- NT14: 't65'\n- NT28: 't50', 't14', 't27', 't0', 't70', etc.\n- NT34: 't14', 't30', 't40', 't49', 't53', 't68', 't76', etc.\n\nWait, I see that NT14 -> 't65' is a production. So NT14 can produce 't65'.\n\nNow, going back to S's productions:\n\nS -> NT2 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo S can split into combinations where the second part is NT14. Let's see, for example, if we take S -> NT32 NT14, then NT32 and NT14 might produce some strings.\n\nI need to see what NT32 can produce. Let's check NT32's productions:\n\nNT32 -> NT1 NT20\nNT32 -> NT28 NT18\n\nSo NT32 can split into NT1 and NT20 or NT28 and NT18. Let's follow both paths.\n\nFirst path: NT32 -> NT1 NT20.\n\nNT1: Looking through all NTs, NT1 has a production -> 't6' and also goes to other NTs. Wait, in the list provided, does NT1 have a terminal production? I see NT18 -> 't66', NT16 -> 't10', etc., but looking for 't6' under NT1.\n\nWait, looking at the list, I see that NT1 -> 't8' and NT8 -> 't27' and other things, but not directly. Wait, let me check again.\n\nIn the NTs, I see that NT15 -> 't68', NT11 -> 't6', NT6 -> 't68', etc. I'm looking for a production where NT1 ends in a terminal, like 't6' or 't31' etc.\n\nWait, looking through all NTs, I see that NT18 -> 't66' and NT16 -> 't10' and so on. Hmm. Wait, does any NT end with 't6'? I'm checking:\n\nLooking through the NTs, I see that NT11 -> 't6', yes. Because in the productions, NT11 -> 't6'. So NT11 can produce 't6'.\n\nSo if NT32 -> NT1 NT20, and NT1 may produce some other non-terminals, perhaps leading to 't6' or others.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's think of the string as two tokens: t54 and t65.\n\nWe know that \"t65\" is produced by NT14.\n\nSo let's see if any of S's productions can generate a string that includes these tokens.\n\nLooking at S -> NT32 NT14. So the second NT is NT14, which can produce 't65'. The first part is NT32, which needs to produce 't54'.\n\nSo can NT32 produce 't54'?\n\nLooking at NT32's productions: NT32 -> NT1 NT20 or NT28 NT18.\n\nIf NT32 -> NT28 NT18, then we have NT28 and NT18.\n\nNT28 can produce 't50' in one of its productions, but that's not 't54'.

Let me scan again:\n\nLooking for t54:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT2: 't23'\nNT7: 't3'\nNT18: 't66', 't70'\nNT0: 't17', 't61'\nNT15: 't68', 't71'\nNT0: 't11'\nNT10: 't32', 't27', 't0', 't16'\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the notation. Wait, the NTs are written with N, so for example, NT5 -> 't41', 't84' (look for that in the list under NT5: yes).\n\nSimilarly, NT14 -> 't65' as per the list: looking at NT14's productions.\n\nWait, in the NT14 productions, I see 't65', correct. So NT14 -> 't65'.\n\nNow, what about NT54? Or wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place because in the grammar, the NTs are written as like NT5, so their direct terminals would be with the 't's.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the NT numbers with the 't's. So the NTs in the grammar are defined with certain terminals, and when a production is for example NT28 -> 't54' 't65', but looking at the list again, I don't see that.\n\nWait, let me look at the list again carefully.\n\nUnder the NTs, I see:\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\nNT5 -> 't41' and 't84' (so two production rules where NT5 produces 't41' and 't84').\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT14 -> 't65' is one production and others.\n\nLooking for a production for NT28:\n\nWait, in the initial list, I don't see any NT28 productions directly leading to a 't54'. Let me check all NT28's production rules.\n\nWait, in the initial list, the NT14 production is:\n\nNT14 -> 't65'\n\nAnd under NT14, it also has other productions like NT14 -> NT15 NT7, but none directly leading to 't65' except itself.\n\nWait, but I think I'm making a confusion here.

{"custom_id":"request-10","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t54 t84`, and the grammar is quite extensive with a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar rules to find how `t54` and `t84` might be derived. Looking through the rules, I notice that some symbols are terminals, which are the `t` followed by numbers. For example, `NT2 -> t28`, `NT1 -> t6`, etc. So, the terminals are words like `t54`, `t84`, and so on.\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the string `t54 t84`, I'll check if each `t54` and `t84` can be produced by the grammar.\n\nStarting with `t54`: I search the rules to see if any rule produces `t54` directly or through intermediates.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see `S -> NT2 NT28`. Also, `NT2 -> t28`, and `NT28 -> NT11 NT3`. Continuing, `NT11 -> NT25 NT13`, `NT25 -> NT5 NT13`, and so on. It seems like expanding NT2 eventually leads to `t28` but I'm looking for `t54`.\n\nWait, another rule: `NT5 -> t41`, and `NT25 -> NT5 NT7`, `NT5 -> t41`, `NT7 -> t3`. So `NT25` can produce `t41 t3`. Not helpful for `t54`.\n\nWait, looking for `t54`, I search the rules and find `NT23 -> t40`, but `t54` isn't directly there. Hmm, let me check if any non-terminal expands to `t54`. I don't see any rule where the right-hand side is just `t54`. So maybe `t54` can only be directly produced by a non-terminal, if any.\n\nWait, looking again, is there any production where a non-terminal directly gives `t54`? Scanning all the rules, I don't see any. So maybe `t54` can't be produced directly and isn't part of any production's RHS except through multiple steps. That's a problem because the grammar, being in CNF, should have productions that either split a non-terminal into two or produce a single terminal. So if `t54` isn't a terminal and isn't produced directly, the only option is that it's part of a longer chain, which in this case, doesn't seem possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe `t54` is part of a production that's actually generated by a series of non-terminals expanding to `t54`. Let me think, is there any production that can lead to `t54`?\n\nLooking at the rules, I find `NT2 -> t28`. Let's see `NT23`: `NT23 -> NT22 NT27`, and `NT22 -> NT29 NT2`, `NT2 -> t23`, which might lead somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps `NT5 -> t41`, and I don't see `t54` coming from any of these. \n\nWait, the rule `NT29 -> NT27 NT22`, and `NT27` can produce `t33`, `t54` is not among them. Let me see: `NT26 -> NT28 NT22`, and `NT28 -> NT11 NT3`, which again doesn't lead to `t54`.\n\nAlternatively, looking for `t54` as part of a production, perhaps in the higher layers. For example, `S -> NT21 NT28`. `NT21 -> NT26 NT6` and so on. But I still don't see `t54` being produced.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the entire string. The string is two terminals: `t54` and `t84`. The grammar starts with S, which produces two non-terminals. Each of those can produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, the string `t54 t84` must be generated as S \u2192 A B, where A produces `t54` and B produces `t84`, or A and B each expand to the appropriate terminals through their productions.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, can any non-terminal produce `t54`? I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly goes to `t54`. Similarly, for `t84`. Let me check if any non-terminal can produce `t84`.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see `NT17 -> t14`, `NT18 -> t66`, `NT21 -> t8`, etc. Not seeing `t84`. Wait, in the rules, `NT14 -> t65` and `NT32 -> t54`. Also, `NT15 -> t68`, `NT7 -> t3`, and `NT34 -> t30` or `t14`.\n\nWait, maybe `t84` can be produced by multiple paths. Let's see, `S -> NT5 NT14` (that's another production). So, if the string is `t54 t84`, it could come from S \u2192 NT5 NT14, but NT5 would have to produce `t54` and NT14 produce `t84`. \n\nLooking at NT5: `NT5 -> t41` directly, and `t41` is there, but how do I get `t54` from NT5? It doesn't seem possible because NT5 only directly goes to `t41`. Wait, but maybe through other rules? Let me check.\n\nWait, I don't see any production for NT5 where it leads to `t54`. So that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and `t54` can be derived through another chain.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe I can build the parse tree step by step. Let's see:\n\nThe string is `t54 t84`. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT21 NT28 or NT5 NT14. Let's consider NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6 and NT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31. Hmm, but NT6 doesn't go to `t54`. Alternatively, maybe another path.\n\nWait, perhaps NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27, and NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT2, NT29 \u2192 NT27 NT22. This seems like a loop.

For example, `NT23 -> t40`? No, wait, looking again:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see `NT3 -> t31`, `NT14 -> t65`, `NT5 -> t41`, `NT17 -> t14`, `NT0 -> t61`, etc. Oh no, wait, the rule that has `t54` is in the list of all rules, but the ones I see, for example, `NT32 -> t54` and `NT32 -> t50`.\n\nWait a minute!

Hmm, Chomsky normal form means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with two terminals on the right, right?\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules provided. It's quite long, but I'll scan through them to see how `t23`, `t56`, and `t51` can be formed.\n\nFirst, I notice that the start symbol is S, which can produce various combinations like NT21 NT28, NT32 NT14, etc. Each of these seems to be combinations of non-terminals, so I'll need to break them down step by step.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I need to see if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol. Let's take each token one by one.\n\n1. `t23`: From the rules, NT23 can produce NT22 NT27. Then, NT22 can be NT29 NT22, but that seems recursive. Wait, no, looking again, NT22 -> NT29 NT2 (from earlier: NT22 -> NT18 NT23). Oh, wait, perhaps I should find a direct production.

That seems like a loop. Hmm, maybe there's another way. Or perhaps NT23 can produce `t32` or `t52` based on some other rule. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the list, NT23 -> NT24 NT2 is one rule. Another rule is NT24 -> NT71 NT5. Wait, NT24 can be broken down further. Maybe I can find a way to get `t23` eventually.\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's see if each token is present as a direct terminal production.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions, I see:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT19 -> 't25'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT33 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT8 -> 't27 NT6' --> wait, no, looking again, I see some rules might be cut off. For example, NT8 has two rules: NT8 -> NT27 NT6 and NT8 -> NT16 NT10. Also, NT34 has two rules: NT34 -> NT16 NT1 and NT34 -> NT14.\n\nWait, let me check more carefully. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't71'\n- NT18 -> 't36'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT27 -> 't9 NT9'\nWait, no, looking again: NT27 has rules like -> NT9 NT9, but also NT27 -> NT29 NT22. Hmm, but I also see NT27 can be 't50' because NT28 -> 't50'.\n\nWait, the string is `t23 t56 t51`. So I need to see if each token is produced.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- `t23`: Is there a rule that produces `t23` directly? Looking through the rules, I see NT23 has rules like NT23 -> NT24 NT2, which don't directly produce terminals. But then, looking for `t23`... Wait, is there an NT23 that can produce `t23`? Alternatively, perhaps `t23` is not directly produced by any rule, but maybe it's produced further down.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me see all the rules for NT23. Looking through the provided rules, I see NT23 -> NT24 NT2, and NT24 -> NT71 NT5, and NT5 can produce various things. Wait, does NT5 have a direct production to a terminal? Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT5 -> 't5 NT20'\nWait, so NT5 can produce the terminal 't5' (since t5 is present). Wait, no, 't5' isn't in the string, but perhaps 't41' is an intermediate.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this. Let me see if `t56` can be produced. `t56` is from NT25's production: looking through the rules, NT25 -> NT23 NT28, and NT28 -> NT11 NT3. Wait, but NT11 can produce 't6' (from NT11->'t6'). Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a direct production for NT25.\n\nWait, the string includes `t56`. Let me see if NT26 can produce 't56'. Wait, looking through the rules, NT26 -> 't50' because NT28 -> 't50'. Hmm, not directly. Or maybe NT26 can go through other steps.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nLet me try to find a production path for each token in the string.\n\nStarting with `t23`. Since NT23 seems to be a non-terminal that only produces other non-terminals, unless there's a way to expand it into a terminal. Wait, looking back, I see NT23 might not directly produce a terminal, but maybe through multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for recursive relations or see if any of the mentioned terminals can be connected. Alternatively, perhaps I can construct the parse tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is too short to be generated by the grammar. Alternatively, maybe each token is part of a production.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces combinations of non-terminals. Each non-terminal breaks down into more until terminals are reached.\n\nBut since each production in Chomsky normal form is either A->BC or A->a, the grammar is unambiguous in that sense.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps the string is too short or the required non-terminals don't produce those tokens.\n\nWait, let me consider each token individually.\n\n- `t23`: If NT23 is `t23`, perhaps that's possible. But looking back, I don't see any production directly for NT23 leading to a terminal. From the rules, NT23->NT24 NT2, which requires further expansions.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe NT23 can generate a terminal through a chain. Let's see: NT23 -> NT24 NT2; NT24->NT71 NT5; NT5->'t41'; NT71->'t71'; NT2->... Hmm, that doesn't seem to lead to 't23'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way for NT23 to produce 't23' through different expansions, but I can't see it from the provided rules.\n\n- `t56`: Looking for NT26, which seems to produce 't56' perhaps. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, the rules show NT26 -> 't50' and NT26->'t50' again. Wait, no, let me check. No, NT26->'t50' is from NT28->'t50'.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the provided grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces `t56`, but perhaps through NT25.\n\nWait, NT25->'t77' or NT25->'t7' or something else. Wait, from the provided rules, NT25 can be NT23 NT28 or 't77' or other. Hmm, not seeing a direct `t56`.\n\n- `t51`: I'm unsure where this comes from. Looking at NT17->'t14', NT5->'t41', but 't51' isn't directly evident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is impossible because each token doesn't appear in the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is 't23 t56 t51', three tokens. Let's see if each can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nGiven that S can generate two NT2 and one NT28, or other combinations, but whether each of the tokens in the string can be part of such a breakdown?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each token in the string must be part of the left-hand side of a production, but without seeing any production that directly leads to the given terminals, it's impossible.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is where each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, right? So the grammar consists of a set of production rules, and I need to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S, which has several productions. The initial step is to try to break down the string into a sequence of these symbols, ultimately starting from S.\n\nThe string is \"t54 t68 t41\". I need to check each of these tokens against the right-hand sides of the production rules.\n\nFirst, let's list the production rules provided. Some key rules to note are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT2 NT28\n- NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT6\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT7\n- NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20\n- NT5 \u2192 't28'\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT33 \u2192 't33 NT19' (Wait, that might not be right. Looking back, some rules have 't' as terminal symbols, others don't. Maybe I need to correct that. Let me double-check. NT33 \u2192 NT33 NT19? No, that seems like a self-producing rule which might not make sense unless it stops. Maybe I misread. Looking again, NT33 has multiple rules, but some are 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT33 \u2192 NT33 NT19 and NT15 \u2192 NT28. Hmm, I think I need to get a clearer view.\n\nWait, maybe I should look specifically for rules where the right-hand side is a terminal, like 't28', 't14', etc., as these correspond to individual terminals in the string.\n\nSo let's go through each token in the string: 't54', 't68', 't41'.\n\nStarting with 't54'. Let's see which non-terminal can directly produce 't54'. Looking through the rules, some non-terminals have direct terminals as their products.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice that NT10 has a production NT10 \u2192 't32', but that's 't32', not 't54'. Hmm, wait, looking through the rules, I see NT5 has 't28', NT17 has 't14', NT25 \u2192 't77', but not seeing 't54' yet.\n\nWait, looking back, NT28 is defined as NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3. NT11 has a production NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13. NT25 can produce 't77' or more. Hmm, maybe looking for a non-terminal whose production includes 't54'.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the string can be broken down into these components, each corresponding to a terminal that a non-terminal can produce.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to start from the end of the string and try to match each token to possible non-terminals that can produce that token.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string must be derived from the start symbol S. S can split into several possibilities: S \u2192 NT2 NT28, or S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc.\n\nLet me see: S \u2192 NT2 NT28. So from S, I can go to NT2 and NT28. Now, looking at the string: t54 t68 t41. If I can have NT2 produce t54 and NT28 produce t68 t41.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT28 can produce the whole substring t68 t41. Wait, but NT28 is a non-terminal that can split into other non-terminals. So perhaps I need to see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the approach is to find which non-terminals can produce each token.\n\nLooking for which non-terminals can produce 't54', 't68', and 't41'.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't28' (Wait, no, some rules for NT32, like NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20, others like NT32 \u2192 NT5 NT7? Wait, maybe I need a different approach. Let me check each rule for NTs that have terminals.\n\nWait, I need to parse this correctly. Let's list all the rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't28' (Wait, no, in the rules, NT5 \u2192 't41'? Or is it another option? Wait, looking back, some rules seem to be in the pattern NTn \u2192 something. For example, NT5 has several rules, like NT5 \u2192 't41' and also NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20. Wait, perhaps I should check each rule line to see if any are direct.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't31', 't20' (Wait, in the rules, I see lines like NT3 \u2192 NT20 NT13, and also NT3 \u2192 't12'?\n\nWait, the rules are split by newlines. So for example, the first line is S \u2192 NT2 NT28. Then S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc.\n\nLooking for any rule where the right-hand side is a single terminal, like NTx \u2192 'txx'.\n\nLooking at all the production rules, I find:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't28'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n\nWait, but that's not helpful for getting 't54', 't68', 't41'.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the rules have multiple options where a non-terminal leads to two terminals.\n\nFor example, perhaps some rules lead to two terminals, like NT28 \u2192 't54' and another rule. Wait, let me look.\n\nLooking at NT28, in the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3 and also NT28 \u2192 't50'. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, in the rules, some lines are:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\nBut is there another rule for NT28 that ends with NT28 \u2192 't50'? Let me check the given grammar.\n\nLooking back, I see a line: NT28 \u2192 't50' as one of its productions. So NT28 can directly produce 't50'. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 't14', and others.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the key. Let's note the rules where a non-terminal can produce a single terminal symbol:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I can list all non-terminals that have a production of the form NTx \u2192 'ty':\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't28'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' ?\n\nWait, maybe more.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see lines like:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n\nWait, for example, there is a line:\n\nNT5 -> 't41'\n\nWait, that's important. Similarly, NT25 -> 't77'. So, let me note:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't28', 't41'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n\nWait, that's helpful.\n\nNow, looking at the string: 't54 t68 t41'.\n\nEach of these must correspond to a production starting from the start symbol S. Let me see how to split these tokens.\n\nSince the first symbol is 't54', I need a non-terminal that can produce 't54'. Looking at the rules, is there any non-terminal NTx that has a production ending with 't54'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT producing 't54'. Similarly, 't68' is another token. Again, looking through the rules, no NT directly produces 't68'.\n\nWait, does any production rule have a terminal with that number? Let me check each rule.\n\nLooking through all the rules, sometimes a production is of the form NTx \u2192 something, where the something includes another NTy or a terminal. For example, NT28 \u2192 't50', so NT28 can produce 't50'.\n\nBut 't54', 't68', 't41'\u2014none of these seem to have direct rules. So maybe these terminals are produced via multiple steps.\n\nWait, but how can I build up 't54', 't68', 't41'?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each part corresponds to a derivation from some non-terminal that can be built from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the derivation:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, context-free grammars can be tricky, but let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into two terminals or two non-terminals. The given grammar seems to follow CNF since all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of symbols: t71, t66, t52, t84. To see if this string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if there's a derivation path that starts from the start symbol S and ends with the given string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has several productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo, S directly produces combinations involving NTs. Let's break down these NTs to see if any produce terminals (like t...).\n\nWait a minute, in the grammar, several NTs have productions that eventually produce 't's and numbers. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' (from NT5 \u2192 't41')\n- NT17 \u2192 't6' (NT17 \u2192 't6')\n- NT34 \u2192 't14' (NT34 \u2192 't14')\n\nLooking further, to get 't71', let's check the NTs that can produce 't71':\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT15: \n- NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT28 (but both are NTTs)\n- NT15 \u2192 NT23 NT28 (more NTTs)\nBut there's another production for NT15:\n- NT15 \u2192 't71' directly. Oh wait, I saw that in the grammar. Right, Ntt15 \u2192 't71'.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 can produce 't61' (from NT0 \u2192 't61') and 't17' (from NT0 \u2192 't17'). But in our string, the last part is t84, so maybe NT14 can produce that? Let me check NT14's productions:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT34 NT7 (which are NTs)\nNT14 \u2192 't65' (from NT14 \u2192 't65') and also NT14 \u2192 't51' (see NT14's other productions: \u2192 't65' and \u2192 't51').\n\nWait, in our string, the last symbol is t84, which corresponds to NT14 \u2192 't65' would give t65, but our desired last symbol is t84. Hmm, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for NTs that can produce t84. Let me check each production in the grammar for NTs leading to t84:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't27' (from NT8 \u2192 't27') and 't24' (NT8 \u2192 't24' and NT8 \u2192 't24').\n- NT17 \u2192 't32' (from NT17 \u2192 't32').\n- NT34 \u2192 't30' and 't14' (Wait, NT34 has two productions: \u2192 't30' and \u2192 't14').\nWait, no: looking again, NT34 has \u2192 't30' and \u2192 't14'? Or was it other?\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking for terminal symbols:\n\n- NT34: Looking at the production lines, I don't see NT34 \u2192 't30' or 't14' as terminal. Let me scan the grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNo, it seems that NT34 might be non-terminal as its productions go to other NTs. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again:\n\nIn the grammar provided, the last lines seem to have terminals:\n\nWait, here's a production: NT14 \u2192 't51' and 't65'. So NT14 can produce t51 and t65. But we have t84, which isn't directly in these.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NTs. Let me consider whether t84 can be produced by any NT. Let me check NT19's production:\n\nNT19 \u2192 't22' and 't28' (from NT19 \u2192 't22' and \u2192 't28')\n\nHmm. Let me think about how the string is built. The string is four symbols: t71, t66, t52, t84. Each symbol must be produced by a terminal production of an NT or a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking for 't66', 't52', and 't84' to see if they correspond to any NT. Let's check each:\n\n1. NT7: \u2192 't3', \u2192 't84' (look through the grammar).\nLooking through NT7's productions, I see NT7 \u2192 't3' in some, but does it have 't84'? Let me check each occurrence of NT7.\n\n- In the grammar, there's a production: NT7 \u2192 't3' and another: NT7 \u2192 't84' (under NT7's productions: NT7 \u2192 NT28, NT7 \u2192 't3', NT7 \u2192 NT22, NT7 \u2192 't32', NT7 \u2192 't64', etc.). Wait, no, let me find it:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar lines, I don't see NT7 \u2192 't84' explicitly. Wait, but there is a production for NT14 \u2192 't65' and 't51', but that's different.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each NT for terminal symbols:\n\n1. NT7: productions are all to other NTs except NT7 \u2192 't3' and NT7 \u2192 't84'?\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully: in the grammar, I found a production NT7 \u2192 't84' which is present here: \"NT7 \u2192 't84'\u201d.\n\nSo, yes, NT7 can produce 't84' when NT7 \u2192 't84'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't66': does any NT produce that? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 't68' (but that's '68'), NT34 \u2192 't30', NT34 \u2192 't14', but perhaps other NTs. Wait, looking for any terminal 't66'\u2014I see NT5 \u2192 't41', NT17 \u2192 't6', etc. Let's look through the grammar for any 't66'.\n\nIn the given grammar, I don't see any NTs with 't66'. Hmm, that's a problem. Because our string has 't66', which isn't produced by any terminal NT in the grammar as per the provided productions.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed it. Let me scan all the productions for NTs and see if any have 't66'. Let me look:\n\nGo through each line:\n\nNT5: only 't41', not 't66'.\n\nNT17: \u2192 't6' and NT17 \u2192 't32'? No, but actually, I think 't32' was from NT17 \u2192 't32'? Or was it another production.\n\nWait, actually, according to the grammar provided, NT17's productions are:\n\n\"NT17 \u2192 't32' (from earlier)\" and \"NT17 \u2192 't14' (another production)\"? Or maybe I have to count correctly.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at the lines:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT5 NT28.\n- NT17 \u2192 NT9 NT18. Hmm, not a terminal.\nWait, I might have to re-examine this.\n\nLooking at the entire grammar, I don't see any production that results in 't66'. That's a problem because the string includes 't66', which isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. So if 't66' can't be derived, the string can't be in the language. That would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me go through the NTs one more time. The productions that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't61' and 't17'\n- NT17 \u2192 't6' (from NT17 \u2192 't6')?\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'\n- NT34 \u2192 't14' and 't30'?\nWait, no\u2014the actual production for NT34 may be getting a bit tangled.

Hmm, CNF is a specific form where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, right? And the start symbol is the only one that can produce a string directly. So, looking at the grammar, I see a bunch of rules where S or other symbols like NT2, NT3, etc., produce two non-terminals. But wait, the start symbol seems to be S, which can produce NT2 NT28, for example, and other combinations. \n\nAlright, the string we're trying to derive is \"t28 t49 t40 t51\".

Let's go through each production:\n\nFor example, NT17 has:\nNT17 -> 't14'\nand NT17 -> NT5 NT28\nand NT17 -> NT16 NT19\n\nSimilarly, NT5 has:\nNT5 -> 't41'\nand a production NT5 -> NT5 NT20\nOkay, so NT17 can produce 't14' directly. So in the string, there's 't14'? Wait, no, in the given string, it's 't28', 't49', 't40', 't51'. So maybe I need to see where each 't' comes from.\n\nWait, I think I need to map each 't' in the string to a production. Let's take each 't' and see if any NT produces it.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- 't28' is a terminal. In the grammar, I see some NTs like NT14 -> 't28' and NT22 -> 't28' or something similar? Wait, let's check the NT productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT14 -> 't28' (Yes, I see NT14 -> 't65' earlier, no, wait. Wait, let me look. I think I see NT14 -> 't65', but also NT3 -> 't31', etc. Wait, maybe I should search for any NT that directly produces these terminals.\n\nWait, here's a part of the grammar:\n\nNT21 -> 't28' (Yes, line: NT21 -> 't28') so NT21 produces 't28'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't49', perhaps NT17 is involved because in the NT17 rules, there's a 't49'. Let's see. Checking the grammar:\n\nNT17 -> 't49'? Or is it that another NT produces 't49'?\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT5, I see NT5 -> 't41' and NT5 has a production that seems to produce 't84'? Wait, looking for 't49', perhaps NT17 produces 't49'.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT17 has a production NT17 -> 't14' (line: NT17 -> 't14')\n- Is there a line where NT17 produces 't49'? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I see lines like NT17 -> 't49' perhaps? Or maybe NT17 can produce 't49' through another production? Wait, in the list, I see:\n\nNT17 -> NT16 NT19 and NT17 -> NT5 NT28, but does any NT17 production produce 't49'? Yes, wait, in line NT17 appears in production rules where it's broken into non-terminals, but also in other lines, like NT17 -> 't14' and maybe another rule NT17 -> 't49'? Let me re-examine the given grammar. \n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThere is a line NT17 -> 't14' and another line NT17 -> 't49' maybe? Or perhaps NT17 is involved as part of a production for another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a list of all NTs that directly produce terminal symbols:\n\nFrom the given grammar, I see the following NTs that directly produce terminals (in the productions):\n\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't14' (and maybe 't49')\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT21 -> 't28'\n- Are there others? Let's check each production:\n\nLooking for any rule where an NT directly leads to a terminal, not via another NT.\n\nSo, let's go through each line that ends with a number (I think those are the terminals):\n\n- S -> NT2 NT28 (non-terminal rules)\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT6 (non-terminals)\n- NT31 -> NT25 NT13 (non-terminals)\n- NT25 -> NT5 NT13, etc.\n\nWait, so looking for any production where the right-hand side (RHS) has a terminal symbol. I think only specific NTs produce terminals.\n\nLooking deeper, I notice that in some lines, right-hand terminals are present:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT21 -> 't28'\n\nWait, let me look at each NT and their rules:\n\nLet me re-examine the grammar again and pick out all the NTs that have a terminal production:\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nS -> NT2 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n...\nAnd so on. So S is a non-terminal that can produce non-terminals.\n\nLooking further down, there are rules like:\n\nNT21 -> 't28' (from NT21 -> 't28' line)\nNT17 -> 't14' (from NT17 -> 't14' line)\n\nAlso, looking for other NTs:\n\nLooking through the entire list line by line:\n\n- NT25 -> NT3 NT23\n- NT13 -> NT5 NT7\n- NT26 -> NT18 NT22\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT0\n- Wait, does any NT produce a terminal?\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let's go through each line methodically.\n\nStart from the top and go down:\n\n1. S -> NT2 NT28\n   Both NTs are non-terminals (since '2' and '28' are numbers; wait, no, in the grammar, the NTs are given with a leading 'N', like NT2, but in this case, the production is written as NT2 and NT28, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, the grammar is in a specific format, but from the way it's written, the rules are all of the form"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding what each part means and how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all the production rules are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That simplifies things a bit because I can apply the CYK algorithm or look for a leftmost derivation.\n\nThe string provided is \"t38 t56 t71 t10 t22\". I notice there are spaces between the tokens, but in the grammar, each production leads to a terminal or a non-terminal that eventually becomes a terminal. So, the space probably isn't an issue because each token is a terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, there are a lot of non-terminals (like S, NT2, NT3, etc.) and a bunch of terminals (like 't3', 't10', etc.). My goal is to see if this string can be generated by any combination of the productions.\n\nI think the best approach is to check if the start symbol S can be rewritten into the string by replacing non-terminals with terminals step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has productions like NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29. Let me see what NT21 produces. Wait, no, the start symbol S has multiple productions:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, each S production is a pair of non-terminals. The string I have has 5 terminals, but each S production gives two non-terminals. Hmm, but each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, so the string would have 2^n non-terminals after n steps. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals or a single terminal. But a string is generated by a series of replacements where each step reduces the number of non-terminals by producing from them. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of building the string backward, like how the CYK algorithm does.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can trace back from the string to see if each terminal can be generated by some production.\n\nLooking at the string: t38, t56, t71, t10, t22.\n\nLet me check each of these tokens to see if they have any production rules that produce them.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\nWait, I'm looking for t38, t56, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT22 -> 't8' or 't23' or others? Let me check.\n\nWait, I think I need a better approach. Let me list all non-terminals and terminals and see their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to map each terminal to its possible non-terminal parents.\n\nLet me list the productions that produce each terminal:\n\nt3:\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals produce t3. For example, NT27 -> 't7' and NT22 -> 't23' and others. Wait, I might have made a mistake here. Let me go through each production that ends with a terminal and check for these t's.\n\nWait, let's look for each terminal in the grammar:\n\n- 't3' appears in NT18 \u2192 't66', NT33 \u2192 't33', etc. Wait, maybe looking through each non-terminal:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce 't38', 't56', 't71', 't10', 't22'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT0 \u2192 't61'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23' or 't8' depending on the rule, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I need a list of each terminal and what non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking again:\n\nt3: NT31 \u2192 't75' is not t3. Wait, wait, let me check each production:\n\nLooking for any production that results in these t's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find each terminal and its possible sources.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me start by trying to see if each of the terminals in the string can be part of a derivation.\n\nThe string is: t38, t56, t71, t10, t22.\n\nLet me think about how each of these can be produced.\n\nt38: Looking for which non-terminals produce t38. Scanning through the productions, I don't see any direct production for t38 except perhaps if a non-terminal has a production ending with t38. Wait, looking through the production rules, I don't see any NT \u2192 t38. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, looking at the productions again, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check production rules for each non-terminal that ends with a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14': so 't14' is produced by NT17.\n- NT0 \u2192 't61' (in one production, but also in another it's 't17' via another rule).\n- NT15 \u2192 't71': looking at the productions, is there any NT that produces t71? Looking back, yes, NT15 \u2192 't19' and 't6' and other things. Wait, actually, there's a production for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT23, which might produce other things. Wait, perhaps I'm missing the productions.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to find the exact rule for each terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the productions again:\n\nI see that NT17 \u2192 't14' because the rule is NT17 -> 't14'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 't75' (which isn't helpful here).\n- Wait, no, actually, some of the rules have terminals, like:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT0 -> 't49' (I'm not sure, maybe a typo).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Perhaps I should look for each of the terminals in the string and see if there's a production that ends with them.\n\nt38: Do any NTs produce t38? Looking back, I don't see any NT \u2192 t38. Hmm, so maybe this string cannot be generated because t38 is not present in any production.\n\nWait, but the string includes t38 as the first token. If the grammar doesn't have any production that produces t38, then it's impossible. So that would mean the string cannot be generated, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- 't38' appears as NT17 \u2192 't14' (t38 isn't this), but in the productions, I don't see any NT producing t38.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe some non-terminal expands into a sequence that includes t38, but since the string is the direct sequence of terminals, each must directly result from a production step.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let's see:\n\nLooking through each production for all the NTs, are any of them directly producing t38?\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT29\n- NT31 -> NT34 NT1\n- NT3 -> NT20 NT13\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n- NT12 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n- NT32 -> NT1 NT20\n- NT17 -> NT5 NT28\n- NT6 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT7\n- NT27 -> NT11 NT4\n- NT14 -> NT15 NT7\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT12 -> NT15 NT3\n- NT0 -> NT10 NT27\n- NT17 -> NT9 NT18\n- NT10 -> NT12 NT21\n- NT25 -> NT5 NT13\n- NT13 -> NT18 NT18\n- NT33 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT22 -> NT29 NT2\n- NT7 -> NT16 NT24\n- NT27 -> NT9 NT9\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT0\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT6\n- NT21 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT15 NT18\n- NT11 -> NT25 NT13\n- NT10 -> NT33 NT24\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT0\n- NT4 -> NT29 NT10\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is S. The string given consists of terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived from S through a series of these productions.\n\nStarting from S, according to the first production, S can go to NT21 NT28, but looking through the productions, I see that S has multiple options: S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, S \u2192 NT20 NT25, etc. So the first step is to see which of these can derive the given string.\n\nThe string starts with t22, which is a terminal, so I need to find a production that can produce t22.

Maybe I should trace possible paths.\n\nLooking at the string `t22 t28 t49 t14 t12`, let's reverse-engineer the possible derivations.\n\nEach step in the string is a terminal, which must come from direct productions of non-terminals.\n\nLet's reverse each step to see how S can derive the string.\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nThe last token is t12, which we need to get from a production. Looking at the rules, I see NT12 has S \u2192 NT12 NT4 (but wait, NT4's rules include producing t14). But maybe I should check which non-terminals produce t12. Scanning through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal producing t12 directly. Wait, maybe t12 comes from a longer chain.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by considering the grammar as trees. Each terminal in the string must be produced by a non-terminal directly.\n\nSo, the string is t22 t28 t49 t14 t12. So working backward, each terminal must be produced by a non-terminal in one step.\n\nLet's start from the last element, t12. There's a production NT12 \u2192 't16', but that's a terminal which leads to another non-terminal. Hmm, no, that's just part of a production. Alternatively, I might need to see if any of the non-terminals can generate t12 through their production rules that include terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, NT12 has a production NT12 \u2192 NT25 NT3. Let me check if NT25 or NT3 can produce terminals that eventually lead to t12.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT5 NT13. NT5 has two productions: NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT32 and NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20. Hmm, NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7 and NT3 \u2192 NT20 NT13. NT7 \u2192 NT16 NT24, and so on, but I'm not seeing an immediate t12. Alternatively, maybe t12 comes from NT12 \u2192 't16' or another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to match the string step by step.\n\nThe string is five parts: t22, t28, t49, t14, t12.\n\nStarting with t22, which must come from some non-terminal. In the productions, I don't see any direct production of t22, so it's part of a chain. Wait, maybe t22 is from NT22 \u2192 't71', which is a terminal, but that's not t22.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that can produce t22. Scanning the productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't71'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT7 \u2192 't84'\n- NT15 \u2192 't68'\n- NT17 \u2192 't49'\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'\n- NT34 \u2192 't14'\n- NT19 \u2192 't52'\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\n- NT18 \u2192 't66'\n- NT23 \u2192 't52' (Wait, no)\n- NT16 \u2192 't18', 't3', etc.\n- NT21 \u2192 't8' (Yes, 't21' outputs 't8')\n- NT31 \u2192 't75'\n- NT14 \u2192 't65', 't12', etc. (Wait, 't12')\nWait, hold on: NT14 has a production NT14 \u2192 't12'. Because looking at the productions, for NT14 \u2192 't12' is present.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nNT14: S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc.\n\nWait, looking specifically, I see NT14 \u2192 't12' as a direct production, so NT14 can produce t12.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t22, perhaps via NT23 \u2192 't43' or other, but that's not helpful. Or maybe NT19 \u2192 't22'?\n\nWait, NT19's productions: one of them is NT19 \u2192 't25', another is NT19 \u2192 't22'. So yes, NT19 can directly produce t22.\n\nSo, in the string, we have t22 first. That suggests that the first part of the derivation might involve NT19 \u2192 t22.\n\nSimilarly, let's map the rest:\n\nt22: comes from NT19 \u2192 t22.\n\nNext is t28, which could come from NT28 \u2192 't50', but wait, looking at the production NT28 \u2192 't50' isn't there. Wait, checking the NT28 productions: S \u2192 NT28 NT27, etc., and NT28 is defined as NT28 \u2192 't50' directly. So yes, NT28 can produce 't28'.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the NT28 productions:\n\nNT28: S \u2192 ... and a rule NT28 \u2192 't50'. So yes, NT28 can produce t28.\n\nThird, t49. Looking for a non-terminal that produces t49. Scanning the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 't49' is a production. So NT17 can produce t49.\n\nFourth, t14. We've already noted that NT14 \u2192 t12, but here it's t14 in the string. Wait, no: the fourth token is 't14'. So where does 't14' come from.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 't14' is present, as one of the NT6 productions is 't14'. So yes, NT6 can produce t14.\n\nFifth, t12, as we know, is produced by NT14 \u2192 't12'.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let's map each terminal in the string to the correct non-terminal and see the sequence.\n\nString: t22 t28 t49 t14 t12\n\nMapping:\n\nt22 \u2192 NT19 \u2192 't22'\n\nt28 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 't28'\n\nt49 \u2192 NT17 \u2192 't49'\n\nt14 \u2192 ? Wait, in the string, fourth token is t14. So we need a non-terminal that produces t14. Looking back, NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 't14'. So t14 is from NT6.\n\nt12 \u2192 NT14 \u2192 't12'\n\nSo that gives us a sequence: NT19 \u2192 t22, NT28 \u2192 t28, NT17 \u2192 t49, NT6 \u2192 t14, NT14 \u2192 t12.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's a path starting from S that can generate these non-terminals in some order, possibly through other rules.\n\nLooking back at S's productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\n\nS \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nI need to see if the string can be derived from one of these.

{"custom_id":"request-93","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It seems complex with many non-terminal symbols and production rules. The grammar starts with S and has several options for expanding S, like S -> NT2 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, and so on. Each of these NTs eventually leads to terminals like 't1', 't2', etc., or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t54 t6 t84 t38 t3 t71`. So, my goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of expansions.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top-level production for S. The options for S are:\n\n1. S -> NT2 NT28\n2. S -> NT32 NT14\n3. S -> NT20 NT25\n\nI need to see if any of these can lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't54'. Let's check the NT2 and NT32 productions to see if they can produce 't54' when expanded.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3 (from the top)\n- NT33 -> NT33 NT19 (this is a recursive production and might not help)\n- NT22 -> NT29 NT2 (but that's not relevant here)\n- Let me focus on NT28. NT28 can lead to NT11 and NT3. NT11 is NT34 NT12 or NT32 NT2. NT34 can lead to certain terminals.\n\nWait, looking back at the NT production rules, I see NT28 -> NT11 NT3, and NT11 is defined as NT25 NT12 or NT32 NT2. Wait, no: looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see for example:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\nNT11 -> NT25 NT13\n\nBut I might be getting confused here. Let me approach this more systematically.\n\nLet's consider the first production: S->NT2 NT28.\n\nNT2 is a non-terminal. Looking at NT2's productions, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 -> NT15 NT18\n\nAnd NT18 expands to NT20 NT0, etc. But I don't see NT2 directly leading to 't54'. Let me check what NT28 can do.\n\nNT28: according to the grammar, it can expand to NT11 NT3. Let's see what NT11 can do.\n\nLooking at NT11's productions: I see NT11 -> NT25 NT13 and NT11 -> NT32 NT2. So it can produce combinations of NT25, NT13, NT32, NT2.\n\nNT25, in the grammar, has several productions. One of them is NT25 -> NT33 NT19. NT33 and NT19 may lead to more NTs. But let's see if any NT25 production leads to 't54'.\n\nWait, elsewhere in the grammar, I see NT25 -> 't77', which is a terminal. So NT25 can directly produce 't77'.\n\nWait, let me check: the grammar has multiple NT entries where they produce terminals. For example, NT5 -> 't41', NT17 -> 't14', NT0 -> 't61', etc. There's one where NT25 -> 't77' and another where NT25 -> NT5 NT20. Similarly, NT28 can go to 't50'.\n\nWait, so if S -> NT28 NTsomething, but in the given string, the first symbol is 't54'. So let's see what NT28 can directly produce.\n\nLooking at NT28's rules:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\nNT28 -> NT27 NT0\nNT28 -> NT27 NT22\nNT28 -> NT0 NT32\n\nWait, no, according to the given grammar, NT28's productions are:\n\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT0\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT22\n- NT28 -> NT0 NT32\n\nAnd then other rules, but I think those are the main ones leading to terminals or other NTs.\n\nSo for NT28, can it produce 't54' directly? Let me check all the NT28 rules. I don't see any direct terminal in NT28. It seems that all of its productions involve other NTs. So perhaps NT28 can't directly produce 't54' but might after expanding further.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first symbol is 't54', so let's see if any path for NT2 or NT28 can result in 't54' as the top symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Looking back, the first production for NT28 is:\n\nBut actually, according to the given grammar, I think I have to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's consider the entire string `t54 t6 t84 t38 t3 t71` and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the given grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So the expansion is straightforward.\n\nWe can model this as a tree where the root is S, and the leaves are the terminals in the string, in the correct order.\n\nGiven the string, I'll try to see if it can be built by replacing non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet's look at the first symbol 't54'. So somewhere in the expansion, the production must produce 't54' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT32 -> 't54' (Wait, in the given grammar, I see: NT32 -> NT1 NT23, and also NT32 can lead to terminals? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, there's a rule like NT32 -> 't54' as well?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT32 -> NT1 NT23\n\nAnd in other productions, like NT28 -> 't50'. So, does any NT produce 't54' directly? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT32 -> NT1 NT23\n- NT28 -> 't50', but that's part of a production that's inside NT28's expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me go through all the NT production rules to find which NTs directly produce 't54', 't6', etc.\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT3 -> 't12'\n- NT4 -> 't14'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't27'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT16 -> 't10'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT19 -> 't25'\n- NT20 -> 't29'\n- NT21 -> 't77'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT25 -> 't5'\n- Wait, no, let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look at each NT's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT5 -> 't41' and 't84', and also NT5 -> NT3 NT32.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs produce terminals.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, the NTs that directly produce terminals are:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41', 't84'\n- NT17 -> 't14', 't16', 't6' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT17 has NT0->'t17' and others?)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go line by line.\n\nLooking for any NTs in the grammar that have a production which includes a terminal as the first symbol.\n\nFor example, in the given grammar:\n\nNT17 -> NT0 -> 't14' ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to identify all terminal symbols directly produced by NTs.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I'm trying to spot where a terminal comes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-87","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string `t38 t56 t43 t6 t52 t23` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a set of production rules that define how the non-terminal symbols (like S, NT2, NT3, etc.) can be expanded into other symbols, which can be terminal or non-terminal. My task is to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string given is `t38 t56 t43 t6 t52 t23`. Since each t... is likely a terminal symbol, I need to see if there's a production sequence that results in exactly these terminals in the correct order.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the start symbol S. The grammar has three initial productions for S:\n1. S -> NT21 NT28\n2. S -> NT32 NT14\n3. S -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, any string starting with the symbols generated from these will be considered. Let me check each possible starting point.\n\nLooking at option 1: S -> NT21 NT28. The string starts with t38, which corresponds to NT21 \u2192 t38. That's because in the production rules, NT21 is mapped to 't8' (from the list above, NT21 -> 't8'). So the first part is correct. Now, the second symbol in the string is t56. Looking at NT28, in the grammar, NT28 can be produced to t50 or 't52'. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT28 has two productions: NT28 -> NT11 NT3 and NT28 -> NT5 NT10. Neither are terminals yet. Hmm, wait, I need to check if any of the rules for NT28 result in 't56'.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the terminal symbols are things like 't28' and 't14', etc. So, for NT28, when we look at its productions, none of them directly produce a terminal t56. Instead, NT28 can go to NT25 and NT11 or NT5 and NT10. Let me check NT5: NT5 can produce either 't41' or NT3 NT32. Wait, no, looking back, each line in the grammar seems to be an alternative for a particular non-terminal. So for NT5, it's production is NT5 -> 't41' or NT5 -> NT3 NT32.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Each non-terminal's productions are listed under their own line. For example, NT5 has two productions: NT5 -> 't41' and NT5 -> NT3 NT32. So, to produce 't56', which is part of the string, I must have a production that leads to it.\n\nWait, but 't56' is a terminal symbol in the string, so I need to see if any of the non-terminals produce 't56'. Looking through the rules, I see NT23 has a production to 't52' and 't56'. Specifically, under NT23, it's written as NT23 -> NT22 NT27, but then under NT25, NT25 -> 't77' and other stuff. Wait, looking again, I notice that in the rules, NT23 can produce 't56' via a production. Let me check the production rules for NT23.\n\nLooking through the rules: NT23 has `NT23 -> NT22 NT27` and `NT23 -> NT24 NT21`. Wait, perhaps I'm missing one. Oh, near the end, I see NT23 -> 't56'? Wait, no. Let me parse the rules correctly. Each production is written as something like NT23 -> NT22 NT27 or NT23 -> 't56'. Wait, actually, looking at the end of the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT23 -> NT24 NT21\n- NT23 -> 't40'\n- NT23 -> 't56'\n\nWait, I think I need to correct myself. Each line under a non-terminal's name represents a production. So for NT23, the productions are:\n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\nNT23 -> NT24 NT21\nNT23 -> 't43'\nNT23 -> 't52'\nNT23 -> NT24 NT21\nNT23 -> 't40'\nNT23 -> 't56'\n\nWait, that's contradictory because NT23 can't have multiple same productions. Wait, perhaps each line is a separate production. So, if I scan through the rules, for NT23, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT23 -> NT24 NT21\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT23 -> 't40' (twice?) No, probably a typo. Maybe it's NT23 -> 't56'.\n\nWait, it's a bit unclear. Perhaps I should list all productions for NT23 correctly. For example, looking at the given rules:\n\nThere's an NT23 -> 't23' line, which is probably a typo, but let's see. No, wait, looking through each line, I see:\n\nLooking at the full grammar, I notice that under NT23, the productions are:\n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\nNT23 -> NT24 NT21\nNT13 -> NT10 NT21  (Wait, no, NT13 is different.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the productions from the rules where NT23 is involved.\n\nLooking again, for NT23:\n\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27 (one production)\n- NT23 -> NT24 NT21 (another production)\n- NT23 -> 't43' (third)\n- Wait, no, let me check the rules again, maybe I copied wrong.\n\nWait, the user provided the rules as one big block. So looking through:\n\nUnder 'NT23', I see:\n\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT23 -> NT24 NT21\n- Then later in the list under NT23, I see:\n\nNT23 -> 't43'\nNT23 -> 't52'\nNT23 -> NT24 NT21\nNT23 -> 't40'\nNT23 -> 't56'\n\nWait, that seems like multiple productions with the same start. That doesn't make sense; each non-terminal has a set of productions, each a possible replacement. So for NT23, perhaps the correct productions are:\n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\n\nNT23 -> NT24 NT21\n\nNT23 -> 't43'\n\nNT23 -> 't52'\n\nNT24 -> NT21\n\nWait, no, the user's grammar has under NT23 the following:\n\nLooking through, I think I might have miscounted. Let me scan the entire block for lines starting with 'NT23'. \n\nAh, here are some lines:\n\n- NT13 -> NT10 NT21\n- NT16 -> NT15 NT33\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- NT14 -> 't84'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't71'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT11 -> 't14'\n- NT19 -> 't22'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't56'\n\nSo, I think I have:\n\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT23 -> NT24 NT21 (no, I think I see only NT23 -> NT22 NT27 and NT23 -> NT24 NT21)\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the NT23 productions correctly as per the given rules:\n\n1. NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n2. NT23 -> NT24 NT21\n3. NT23 -> 't43'\n4. NT23 -> 't52'\n5.

{"custom_id":"request-109","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t14 t23 t49 t54 t50 t6 t31`. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The terminal symbols here seem to be the t followed by numbers, like t14, t23, etc. So, my string is a sequence of these terminals, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol S is given by three productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nI should check these options to see if any can lead to our string. Let me look at each possibility.\n\nFirst, let's take S \u2192 NT21 NT28. So, we would need to derive the entire string from NT21 and NT28. Let's see what NT21 and NT28 can produce. Looking through the productions, NT21 has the rule NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT2 or NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0. Hmm, both options for NT21 involve non-terminals, so that's not helpful immediately.\n\nSimilarly, NT28's production is NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3. NT11 and NT3 are also non-terminals, so that's another dead end. So, starting from S \u2192 NT21 NT28 might not get us anywhere with this string, as the entire string consists of terminals.\n\nNext, let's look at S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Let's see what NT32 and NT14 can produce. NT32 has production NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20. NT1 is a terminal (as in the rules, NT1 \u2192 't14'), so NT32 can produce 't14' followed by whatever NT20 can produce.\n\nWhat about NT14? NT14's productions are NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT1 or NT14 \u2192 NT15 NT7. Both involve non-terminals, which would then have to be further expanded. Looking at the options, NT34 is a terminal (as per NT34 \u2192 't30'). So, if NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT1, that would give 't30' 't14'. But in the string, we don't have 't30' followed by 't14'; instead, we have 't54' and 't14' in that order.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let me verify: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. If NT32 becomes 't14' (from NT1 being a terminal) and NT14 becomes some other terminals. But looking at the string, after 't14', we have 't23', 't49', etc. I'm not sure if that directly helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at S \u2192 NT20 NT25. NT20's production is NT20 \u2192 NT29 NT3. NT29 \u2192 NT27 NT22. Both are non-terminals, which might produce more non-terminals. NT25 \u2192 NT5 NT13, which are both non-terminals that produce further non-terminals.\n\nThis seems more complicated, so maybe the best starting point is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Let's focus on that.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. NT32 can be NT1 NT20. NT1 is a terminal 't14', so let's see: S \u2192 't14' NT20 NT14. Now, NT20 is NT29 NT3. NT29 is NT27 NT22. Both are non-terminals. Let me check their productions.\n\nNT27 produces NT9 NT9, and NT9 is a terminal 't84'. So NT27 \u2192 't84' 't84'. Then, NT22 can be NT18 NT32, which would lead NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT0, and so on. But this seems like a detour because our string starts with 't14 t23', not 't14 t84 t84 ...'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT14 can produce 't34' 't1' if I look at the rules. Wait, NT14 \u2192 't65' 't6' from one production or 't15' 't7' from another. Both don't match 't23' as in our string.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I need to build a parse tree for the string. Let me see if all the terminals in the string can be derived from the start symbol by expanding the non-terminals correctly.\n\nThe string is: t14, t23, t49, t54, t50, t6, t31.\n\nLet's list the terminals:\n\n1. t14\n2. t23\n3. t49\n4. t54\n5. t50\n6. t6\n7. t31\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the possible productions are NT21, NT32, or NT20.\n\nLet me check NT32 first because the first token in the string is t14, and NT14 can produce 't34' 't1' or 't15' 't7', neither of which is t14. But in the S \u2192 NT32 NT14 production, NT32 is NT1 NT20. Wait, NT1 is a terminal 't14', so if S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then the first symbol would be t14, which matches the start of our string.\n\nSo, start with S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then, NT32 is 't14' (from NT1 and NT20: NT1 is 't14', NT20 could be 't29' 't3', but that's a non-terminal path.\n\nWait, no. NT32's production is NT1 NT20. NT1 is a terminal 't14', so the first step is S \u2192 't14' NT20 NT14.\n\nNow, the next symbol in the string is t23. Let's look at NT20. NT20's production is NT29 NT3.\n\nNT29 is NT27 NT22. NT27 is NT9 NT9. NT9 is 't84', so NT27 \u2192 't84' 't84'. NT22 is NT18 NT32. NT18 is NT20 NT0, and NT0 is 't61' perhaps? I'm getting confused. Maybe this isn't the right path because the string has t23, which might be derived from NT32.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each non-terminal in the productions can only produce a certain type of terminal. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27, which could then lead to specific terminals. But without a clear path, it's tough.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the longest possible derivations. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to identify what each non-terminal produces. For example:\n\nLooking at NT23: production NT22 NT27.\n\nNT22: NT18 NT32. NT18: NT20 NT0. NT20: NT29 NT3. NT29: NT27 NT22. NT27: NT9 NT9. NT9: 't84'. So, following that, NT27 \u2192 't84' 't84', and NT22 \u2192 NT18 NT32. Wait, NT18 \u2192 't20' 't0' maybe.

{"custom_id":"request-116","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and a string that I need to check whether it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t3 t34 t41 t28 t70 t40 t77`. My goal is to figure out if this string can be generated by the provided grammar, and if so, answer 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'. \n\nFirst, I recall that a CFG in CNF has rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, or a terminal. The structure is important because it simplifies the application of the pumping lemma and makes it easier to parse strings, especially when using a table-based method like CYK. But here, since I need to check a specific string, maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some rules have non-terminals on the right-hand side, like S -> NT2 NT28, etc. The terminals start with 't', like 't3', which probably corresponds to a production rule ending in a terminal. So, the string consists of several terminals, each likely corresponding to some NT rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which from CNF should produce other symbols. S's productions are all pairs of NTs, like NT2 NT28, etc. So, to generate the string, S must somehow lead through these NTs using the rules.\n\nNow, the string has seven tokens: `t3`, `t34`, `t41`, `t28`, `t70`, `t40`, `t77`. The first step is to see how these could fit into the NT production rules.\n\nEach token in the string must correspond to a terminal in some NT rule. So, let's look at the grammar's rules where terminals appear as the RHS. For example, NT17 -> 't28', which means whenever NT17 is derived, it produces 't28'. Similarly, NT25 -> 't77', so NT25 would expand to 't77'.\n\nSo, for each terminal in the string, I need to find which non-terminals can produce them. Let's list the possible sources for each token:\n\n- `t3`: Looking in the rules, NT3 appears in some productions. For example, NT3 -> NT20 NT13, which is all non-terminals, so how does `t3` come in? Wait, in the given grammar, do any non-terminals produce `t3`? Looking through the rules, I see NT31 -> 't31' and NT3 -> 't3'. So, NT3 can produce 't3', and NT31 can produce 't31' which is another terminal.\n\nWait, let me check all rules for terminals. Wait, in the grammar provided, some NT rules end with a terminal:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT31 -> 't31'\n- NT34 -> 't34'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT14 -> 't51' (Wait, NT14 -> 't51'\u2014but NT14 might have other rules as well. Also, NT12 -> 't16' or 't14'.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, I think I might have miscounted.

{"custom_id":"request-129","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar. I remember that with parse trees and leftmost derivations, but this grammar has a lot of rules, so it might be tricky. The string to check is `t3 t23 t65 t6 t22 t38 t54 t65`. \n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals (like NT2, NT3, etc.) have productions that eventually lead to terminal symbols (like 't28', 't14', etc.). So the grammar probably defines some language in terms of these t's, and I need to see if the sequence of t's can be generated step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t3. Let me check where t3 comes from. In the grammar, I see that NT3 has productions like NT3 -> NT20 NT13 and NT3 -> NT5 NT7. Also, the terminals have NT3 -> 't3'. So t3 can come from either NT5 or NT7 being 't3' or from NT3 directly. \n\nWait, but looking at the terminals, NT3 is 't3' when it terminates. Wait, no, some terminals are mapped via NT3. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the terminals:\n- NT3 -> 't31' (from NT31 to 't31')\n- NT3 -> 't7' (from NT3 to 't7')\n- NT32 -> 't23'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT15 -> 't25'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT13 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT14 -> 't65' (from NT14 -> 't65')\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- Other t's are spread out, like NT14 is 't65', etc.\n\nSo t3 in the string must come from a rule where NT3 is a terminal. Looking at the NT3 rules, I see NT3 -> 't3' isn't present because in the provided terminals, NT3 can be 't31' or 't7', but not directly 't3'. Wait, that might be an issue.\n\nHold on, the grammar as given defines NT3 in several ways and also as terminals. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the productions for NT3:\n- NT3 -> NT20 NT13\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT7\n- NT3 -> NT18 NT18 (from the terminals)\nWait, no. Wait, in the rules, the only NT3 rule is NT3->NT5 NT7. Are there any NT3 rules that produce terminals? Wait, yes. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the provided NT3 productions, the ones I see are:\n\nNT3 -> NT20 NT13\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT7\n\nAnd also:\n\nLooking through the terminals, I see NT5 -> 't41', but that's under NT5.\n\nWait, no, in the 'Terminals' part:\n\nI see lines like NT5 -> 't41', NT5 -> 't5 NT20', etc. So wait, are there any rules where NT3 is a terminal? The list seems to be long, but I don't see NT3 directly mapping to a terminal. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait in the 'Terminals' section, is there any NT3 producing a terminal? Let me check:\n\n- NT31 -> 't31' (Yes, but that's for NT31)\n- NT3 -> 't7' (Yes, in NT3: NT3 -> NT5 NT7, and NT7 is 't7', but also NT3 can be 't7'?

Here's the grammar:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\n\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThen, for NT21, NT32, etc., each of these can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut for NT3, looking at the rules:\n\nNT3 can be:\n\nNT3 -> NT20 NT13\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT7\n\nWhich are the only rules for NT3. Then, in the 'Terminals' part, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't31' (from NT31)\n\nBut wait, is there any production where NT3 itself becomes a terminal? It doesn't seem so. Wait, in the 'Terminals' part, for NT18, there's NT18 -> 't66'. Similarly for NT25: 't77', etc.\n\nWait, in the terminal mappings, is there a rule where NT3 is mapped to 't3'? Let me look: the terminal list shows:\n\nLooking for NT3:\n\nNT3->'t31'\n\nNT3->'t7'\n\nSo no, NT3 does not directly produce 't3'. Therefore, any occurrence of 't3' in the string must come from another non-terminal that eventually reduces to NT3 or via a production that includes NT3 and produces 't3' as part of a larger production. Wait, no, 't3' might be produced by another non-terminal that has a rule leading to it.\n\nWait, perhaps 't3' is produced by another non-terminal that eventually reduces to NT3. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any production for any NT that directly leads to 't3'. So 't3' must come from a terminal NT. Wait, but in the provided NT rules, NT3 only has two production rules leading to other non-terminals, not to terminals. So 't3' cannot come from NT3. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar. Did I miss any NT that directly goes to 't3'? Looking through all the rules:\n\nLooking at NT32 -> 't23', NT3->'t31' etc. Wait, wait: in the term 'Terminals' part, there's a line: NT25 -> 't77', but is there any NT that produces 't3'? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through all the lines in the 'Terminals' part, I see NT17->'t14', NT5->'t41', NT25->'t77', etc., but I don't see any rule with 't3'. Therefore, in the given grammar, 't3' is not a terminal. Wait, that's a problem because the string presented has 't3 t23 t65 t6 t22 t38 t54 t65', which includes 't3'. So unless 't3' is produced by some other path, this string might not be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me scan all the terminal mappings again. The 'Terminals' section is quite extensive. Let me look for any NT that might produce 't3':\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT31 -> 't31'\n\n- NT3 -> 't7' (from NT3 production NT3->NT5 NT7, and NT7->'t7')\n\n- NT13->'t71'\n\n- NT6->'t68'\n\n- NT18->'t66'\n\n- NT17->'t14'\n\n- NT5->'t41'\n\n- NT25->'t77'\n\n- NT21->'t8'\n\n- NT3->'t31'\n\nWait, no NT in the terminals produces 't3'. So 't3' can't be generated by any rule. So if the string has 't3', the string can't be generated because there's no production in the grammar that leads to 't3'. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Could the production of one non-terminal lead to another non-terminal that, through some other rules, ultimately includes 't3'? No, because in the grammar, 't3' isn't a terminal at all. Therefore, the string containing 't3' can't be part of any generated string.

Hmm, I remember CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? So each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLet me look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, which immediately branches into several possibilities, like S \u2192 NT21 NT28 or S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc. Each of these NTs (non-terminals) have their own productions, either producing other NTs or terminals. Wait, but I noticed some mix between NT symbols and actual terminals like 't6', 't14', etc. Oh, right, some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals, so they act as leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nNow, the given string is `t6 t36 t14 t38 t14 t28 t30 t11`. I need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. The string has elements separated by spaces, which I assume are the terminals. So let's list them: t6, t36, t14, t38, t14, t28, t30, t11.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how the string can be broken down. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. So the string should be possible to split into a sequence of production steps that can generate it.\n\nLet's think about possible ways the string could be constructed.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT21 NT28. So to get the string, we need the production chain that starts with NT21 and NT28.\n\nLooking at NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3. So to get t11 and t3, but in our string, the first few elements are t6, t36, t14... Hmm, that might not directly connect. Wait, maybe I need to look for a production that directly produces a terminal or see the connections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another production for S: S \u2192 NT20 NT25. Let's see NT20 \u2192 NT4 NT13? Not sure if that's directly helpful.\n\nLooking at NT3: it can go to NT20 NT13 or NT5 NT7. NT20 could produce t4 and t13? Wait, not sure. Maybe checking individual NT productions for terminals.\n\nWait, some NT symbols directly produce terminals. For example, NT5 \u2192 't41', NT7 \u2192 't3', NT18 \u2192 't66', etc. So any NT that produces a terminal in one step will consume that terminal in the parsing.\n\nWait, looking back at the given grammar, some NTs produce terminals immediately, like NT5 \u2192 't41', NT18 \u2192 't66', etc. But if a production has a terminal and a non-terminal, that might complicate things.\n\nBut the string starts with t6. Let's see which NTs produce t6. Looking down the list: NT6 is produced when NT24, NT13, NT6 are involved. But perhaps some NTs directly produce t6. Wait, maybe NT18 \u2192 't66', which is not t6. Wait, does any NT in the productions transform into t6 directly?\n\nLooking through, I don't see any production such as NTx \u2192 't6'. All the terminals are like 't14', 't6', etc., but I might have to look for cases where the production chain ends with t6 as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t6, which might come from a production like NT6 \u2192 something that terminates with t6. Looking at NT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31, NT6 \u2192 NT31 NT13, etc. Hmm, not directly leading to a terminal t6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this step by step. Maybe I can try to find a way to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. The string is t6 t36 t14 t38 t14 t28 t30 t11. Let's number them as positions 1 to 8.\n\n1: t6\n\nThe start symbol S must produce two non-terminals. Let's check which productions of S can start with t6.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28. Let's see what these NTs produce.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6. NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t6. So let's think about NT21 and NT28's productions.\n\nNT21: Possible production is NT26 NT6. So to get t6, the NT6 in NT21's production could be a terminal. But looking through the NTs, I don't see any NT6 \u2192 't6', but perhaps NT6 can produce t6 through a series of productions.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, which might not give t6. Or another possibility is that S's first production is S \u2192 NT21 NT28, which would produce NT21's symbol and NT28's symbol. Suppose NT28 can produce t3 and something else, but our first symbol is t6, so maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another production for S: S \u2192 NT20 NT25. Let's see. NT20 \u2192 NT4 NT13. NT25 \u2192 NT5 NT13 or NT28 NT18.\n\nWait, maybe looking for the first symbol t6. Maybe NT26 can produce t6. Let's check NT26's productions.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT28 NT22 or NT22 NT2? Or looking deeper, NT22 is more complex. Alternatively, NT26 \u2192 NT18 NT24.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find a way to decompose the entire string into productions.\n\nAlternatively, think backwards from the string. The last symbol is t11, which I need to find a production that produces t11.\n\nLooking at the productions, where does t11 come from? Let's see. Let's check the NTs:\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT directly producing t11, but perhaps via a chain.\n\nWait, maybe NT10 \u2192 t32, but that's not t11. Alternatively, NT11 \u2192 something? Wait, looking through the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing t11. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT10 \u2192 't32', NT0 \u2192 't17', etc. Hmm, actually, I don't see any NT in the productions that directly produce t11. So maybe t11 is the result of a production that ends in t11. Or perhaps it's produced indirectly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the productions again:\n\nLooking at NT10: it's defined as NT10 \u2192 NT12 NT21, NT10 \u2192 NT33 NT24, and NT10 could eventually lead to t33, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, NT0 \u2192 NT10 NT27, NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9, etc. But I don't see any NT producing t11 directly.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let's check NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT15 NT3, NT12 \u2192 NT10 NT18. If I go down NT12's production to NT10, which is \u2192 NT33 NT24, and so on, maybe there's a path to t11. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer than the given productions, or maybe there's no way to produce t11, so the string is invalid. But I feel like I might be missing something here. Maybe I should look for possible parse trees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long or doesn't fit the structure of the grammar's productions. Let me try to see if the length makes sense.\n\nIn a CNF grammar, each production step increases the length by one non-terminal. The start symbol S produces two non-terminals, each of which may produce more until the terminals are reached. Since the string has 8 symbols, the derivation would have 7 internal nodes, each corresponding to a production that turned a non-terminal into two symbols (non-terminals or terminals). But it's quite a long string to check manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a shorter string example to see how the grammar works.\n\nWait, maybe starting from S, S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6. Let's see NT26's production. NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT22.\n\nWait, then NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3.\n\nSo let's try to follow this path:\n\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT28 NT22\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n\nBut that seems like a chain that would"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-147","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is \"t3 t28 t70 t6 t12 t23 t56 t56 t50\". Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule on the left side having two non-terminal symbols, and there are no epsilon productions. Each non-terminal can expand into other non-terminals or terminals. The start symbol is S, and we derive strings by expanding non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a big one with multiple non-terminals and terminals. The terminals are represented by symbols ending with 't', like t3, t28, etc. So, the string consists of several terminals.\n\nThe process to check if the string is generated by the grammar is to see if there's a derivation path from the start symbol S that can produce the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right, so each step in the derivation will produce two symbols until the terminals are exhausted.\n\nThe string has nine terminals, which is an odd number. Wait, wait, hold on. Each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two, so starting from S, after each step, the number of symbols increases by one. So, starting from 1 (S), then 2, then 3, and so on. To get to 9, we need 8 splits, because 2^k symbols after k steps, right? Wait, no. Wait, actually, it's more like each step increases the count based on the splits.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to model the reduction. Each terminal in the string must be matched to a production that eventually terminates. So, let's see how each terminal can be derived.\n\nLooking at the string: t3, t28, t70, t6, t12, t23, t56, t56, t50. Each of these should correspond to some non-derivation that leads to these terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from left to right, matching each terminal to possible productions in the grammar.\n\n1. Start with S -> NT21 NT28. Let's see if we can get t3 t28... Wait, but looking at the productions, t28 is a terminal. Let me check where t28 appears.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT28 -> NT11 NT3. And NT3 has other productions. But eventually, does NT28 ever become a terminal? Looking through all the productions, I see that NT28 can be NT27 NT0, and then NT11 and NT0 each have more productions. None of these produce t28 directly. Wait, but in the last section, NT28 is written as a terminal in the grammar? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see some entries like:\n\nNT28 -> 't50' and NT28 -> 't27 NT0'. So, if NT28 can produce 't50', then when it's expanded to t50, that's a terminal. So, perhaps somewhere in the grammar, NT28 has a production that results in a terminal.\n\nYes, looking more carefully, there's a rule NT28 -> 't27 NT0' and another NT28 -> 't50'. So, when deriving, we can replace NT28 with t50. So t28 could be t50. Wait, but in the string, it's t28 as the second symbol. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up numbers.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the string is \"t3 t28 t70 t6 t12 t23 t56 t56 t50\". So the order is t3, then t28, then t70, t6, t12, t23, t56, t56, t50. Since it's a CFG in CNF, each production splits into two, so to get a string of length 9, we must have a derivation that expands as follows:\n\nEach step produces two symbols, so the number of symbols doubles each time until terminals are reached. But since it's in CNF, it's more like a tree structure where each internal node has two children. The total number of leaves would be 2^k, but here the string has 9 leaves, which is not a power of 2. Therefore, it's impossible because with CNF, the number of terminals must be a power of two, or it's impossible. Wait, but the example given here is a string that isn't a power of two, so maybe the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm this. Because the number of non-terminals and the structure might allow it. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think again.\n\nIn CFGs in CNF, the number of symbols in the resulting string after m steps is 2^m. Therefore, if we start with S and perform m expansions, we get 2^m non-terminals. Then, each terminal is reached via further expansions. But wait, in this case, we have a mix of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. So, to generate the string, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by replacing one with two, but in a tree-like expansion.\n\nBut the key point is that the final string must consist of an odd number of symbols if it was produced by S, because each production in CNF increases the count from 1 to 2, etc. Wait, no. Let's say each production step adds one symbol, but in a binary tree fashion, the count would actually be a power of two. So if the string length is not a power of two, it can't be generated.\n\nHere, the string has 9 symbols. 9 is not a power of two (2^3=8, 2^4=16). So this suggests that the string cannot be generated by a CFG in CNF. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Because in some cases, we can have overlapping productions leading to a non-power-of-two count. But I don't think so. Each production in Chomsky Normal Form requires exactly two non-terminals, so the number of symbols generated must be 2^n, where n is the number of production steps.\n\nSince 9 is not a power of two, it's impossible for this grammar to produce a string of length 9.

{"custom_id":"request-155","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG). The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except for the case where a non-terminal could produce a terminal. Also, every right-hand side has exactly two symbols, which is a characteristic of CNF. The string to evaluate is `t14 t23 t14 t28 t14 t17 t41 t34 t70`.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand how the grammar works. The given grammar consists of several production rules, many of which produce terminal symbols. For example, `NT0 -> \"t61\"` directly produces the terminal `t61`. Similarly, others like `NT17 -> \"t14\"` produce `t14`. So, some non-terminals directly correspond to terminals with specific codes.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it has several `t14`, `t23`, `t28`, `t17`, `t41`, etc. These correspond to specific non-terminals. So, to check if the string can be generated, I need to trace back from the start symbol S and see if the string can be produced through a series of productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the given rules, S can produce either `NT21 NT28`, `NT32 NT14`, or `NT20 NT25`. So, the initial expansion from S must be one of these combinations.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string is: t14 t23 t14 t28 t14 t17 t41 t34 t70.\n\nWait, but actually, the string is a sequence of terminals, and each step in the parsing process would need to match each terminal in order. So, the string is a concatenation of these terminals, and we need to see if there's a derivation path that produces this exact sequence.\n\nLet me outline the possible starting point. S can go to NT21 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25. Since the first symbol in the string is `t14`, let me check which productions produce `t14` terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, `NT14` can produce `t65` and also `t14` as per the rules. So, `NT14 -> \"t14\"` and `NT14 -> \"t65\"`. Also, `NT17 -> \"t14\"`, as per one of the rules. So, the first symbol `t14` could come from either NT14, NT17, or perhaps another rule? Wait, no, let's check.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT14 -> \"t65\"\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT8, but I don't think that's relevant here since it's non-terminal.\n- NT17 -> \"t14\"\n\nSo, NT14 can produce `t14` or `t65`, and NT17 directly can produce `t14`.\n\nSo, the first `t14` could be from NT14 or NT17.\n\nLet me assume the first `t14` comes from NT17 because that's a direct production. Let's see where this leads.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT17 NT26. Wait, no. Wait, the first symbol is `t14`, which is from NT17, which is one part of the production. So, the initial production would be S \u2192 NT20 NT25, but that produces 't14'?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to map this step by step.\n\nWait, S can produce three options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nNow, the first symbol of our target string is `t14`. Let me see which of these productions could lead to `t14` as the start.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- S \u2192 NT21 NT28: Let's see what NT21 and NT28 produce. NT21 has two rules: NT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24 and NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6. Neither directly produce a terminal. Wait, but looking further, maybe via other rules. NT21 can eventually go to NT26, then perhaps to NT28, etc. But I think NT21 can produce NT26, which then produces NT28 (as per `NT28 -> \"t50\"` is terminal). Wait, no, looking back, NT26's rules are multiple, but I don't see NT26 directly producing a terminal. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, from the rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT18 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT27 NT1\n- NT27 \u2192 NT11 NT4\n- etc. Hmm, maybe NT26 eventually leads to a terminal through NT28 or another path. Alternatively, perhaps looking at the possible steps for NT14.\n\nWait, maybe the first symbol `t14` comes from NT14. Let's see: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, the first part is NT32, which can produce `t23` because looking at the rules, NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23, and NT23 can produce `t22`, wait, no: Let's see. NT32's rules:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n  - NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13 \u2192 that's going to deep into terminal strings like `t34` or others.\n  - Alternatively, NT32 \u2192 NT17 NT28 \u2192 NT17 is `t14` and NT28 \u2192 `t50` (wait, does NT28 produce a terminal? Looking back, in the rules, there's NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, which is non-terminal, but then in other places, looking like in the rule `NT28 -> \"t50\"` is written. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nWait, let me parse the rules again. Yes, several rules have 't' followed by numbers, which are terminal symbols. So, for example, `NT0 -> \"t17\"` (terminal), `NT32 -> \"t50\"`.\n\nWait, looking at NT28's rules:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT3\n- NT28 \u2192 \"t50\" ?\n\nWait, looking back: The rules are listed as:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\nNT28 -> NT20 NT3\nNT28 -> \"t50\" ??\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the initial provided rules:\n\nI see lines like:\n\nNT28 -> \"t50\"\n\nWait, I think I might have missed that.\n\nLooking through the rules more carefully, I see:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- NT32 \u2192 NT17 NT28\n- NT32 \u2192 \"t23\"\n\nWait, wait: For NT32, does it have a rule `NT32 -> \"t23\"`? Let me check.\n\nLooking again:\n\nYes, the rules state:\n\nNT32 -> NT11 NT3\nNT32 -> NT17 NT28\nNT32 -> \"t23\"\n\nSo, NT32 can directly produce the terminal \"t23\". Similarly, other non-terminals may have direct terminal productions.\n\nSo, going back, let's analyze the production steps.\n\nThe first step is S. Let's see which production starts with `t14`. Looking at the options, the second option is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So if we take S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then the first part is NT32, which can produce \"t23\", and the second part is NT14, which can produce \"t14\". So that would give us the string start as `t23 t14`, but our target string starts with `t14`. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, is there another production that starts with `t14`?\n\nLooking at the options, the third option is S \u2192 NT20 NT25. NT20 can produce \"t14\", and NT25 can produce \"t70\".\n\nYes, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT20's rules includes NT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32, but also in other lines, we see `NT20 -> \"t14\"`.\n\nYes, one of the rules is:\n\nNT20 -> NT29 \u2192 \"t17\"\n\nWait, no. Let me check. In the rules, for NT20:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32\nNT20 \u2192 NT12 NT25\nNT20 \u2192 \"t14\"\n\nYes, the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t68 t17 t23 t52 t56 t52 t66 t52 t71 t41\". Hmm, I need to figure out if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, and B, C are non-terminals or terminals.

Did I miss that? Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see a rule for NT23: NT23 -> NT22 NT27. Also, looking at NT5, it's 't84', which I don't see in the string, so maybe 't56' is another one. Let me check again. Hmm, perhaps I misread the mapping. Wait, maybe some other NTs are mapping to different terminals.\n\nWait, the user listed a lot of rules, but in the last section, many of them are mapped to 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT5 -> 't41', NT17 -> 't14', etc. So, looking at the string, each terminal corresponds to a non-terminal: t68 is NT6, t17 is NT17, t23 is NT23, t52 is NT25, t56 is... Hmm, maybe the NT23 also contributes to t56? Wait, that can't be right because each NT's production is fixed.\n\nWait a second. Let me re-examine the grammar to see if any non-terminals map to 't56'. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that maps directly to t56. That's a problem because 't56' is in the string. So, maybe that's not possible unless there's a mistake in the mapping or the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly maps to 't56'. Let me double-check. The rules include NT17 -> 't14', NT0 -> 't61', NT6 -> 't68', etc. There's NT21 -> 't8', but that's t8, not t56. So perhaps this 't56' terminal is a problem because there's no NT rule that defines it. That would mean the string isn't possible because it includes a terminal that's not defined in the grammar.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding something. Let me see: each rule's right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So if a terminal is involved, it's because one of the rules defines it. If the string has a terminal that's not part of any production's terminal, then the string can't be generated. So if the string has 't56', but there's no NT5,56, that's an issue.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal is defined as 't56'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because it includes a terminal that's not part of any non-terminal's production. So the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I overlooked a rule? Let me go through the grammar again. Hmm, in the rules, I see NT17 maps to 't17', NT23 maps to 't52', and some others. But where is 't56'? It seems absent. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread a rule. Let me check the rules again. For example, looking at NT23: it's defined as NT22 NT27. Both NT22 and NT27 are non-terminals, so 't56' isn't a terminal there. How about NT25? It's defined as NT32 NT18. So 't52' from NT25 is okay. But 't56' isn't in any of the productions I see.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has a typo? But I don't think so; the question is as presented. So, the string has 't56', which is not mapped to any non-terminal in the grammar because I don't see any rule where NTx is 't56'.

{"custom_id":"request-168","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm presented with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t28 t30 t70 t28 t14 t30 t61 t36 t34 t84`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) consists of productions where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals, two terminals, or a combination thereof. However, in some definitions, all productions in CNF produce two non-terminals. Wait, but looking at the given grammar, I see that some productions have a mix with terminals and non-terminals. For example, `S -> NT28 NT14`, that's two non-terminals. But there's also `NT5 -> 't28'`, which is a terminal. So perhaps the grammar allows for productions that result in terminals directly.\n\nI need to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the start symbol is S, and S is defined as `S -> NT28 NT14`, I can derive the string by seeing if it can be built from these components.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t28`. I see that in the grammar, there are several non-terminals that can directly produce 't28' or other terminals. For example, `NT17 -> 't14'`, `NT0 -> 't61'`, etc. Wait, let me check each non-terminal that can produce a terminal and see if any of them produce 't28'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find `NT5 -> 't28'` and `NT17 -> 't14'` (but that's different). Also, NT0 doesn't produce 't28', but NT5 does. So, if any production can produce 't28' as a terminal, that part of the string could be part of a derivation.\n\nNow, considering the first symbol of the string is 't28'. So, perhaps the first production is `S -> NT28 NT14`. Then, 't28' would come from NT28, which in the grammar can be derived into 't28' or other terms.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example, `NT5 -> 't28'` and `NT28 -> 't28'` is not directly present. Wait, looking more carefully: the productions include `NT28 -> NT5 NT10`, which is two non-terminals. There's also `NT28 -> 't28'`? Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, I see that `NT28 -> NT5 NT10` and `NT5 -> 't28'` as a production. Wait, let me go step by step.\n\nThe start symbol S expands into NT28 NT14. So, to generate the string, we might need to expand each non-terminal step by step, considering if each part can produce the corresponding sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of this as a bottom-up approach, trying to parse the string using the grammar. Alternatively, top-down parsing using the productions.\n\nBut given the string length is 10 tokens, perhaps I can work through each level.\n\nThe string is: t28 t30 t70 t28 t14 t30 t61 t36 t34 t84.\n\nFirst, S must expand to NT28 NT14. So, S -> NT28 NT14.\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals must expand until they reach terminals. Let me consider each part.\n\nStarting with the first part, NT28. Looking at the grammar, NT28's productions are:\n\n- NT28 -> NT5 NT10\n- NT28 -> 't28'\n\nSo, NT28 can either be 't28' or expand further. Since the first symbol is 't28', we can use NT28 -> 't28'.\n\nThen, the second part is NT14. Looking at grammar, NT14 has productions:\n\n- NT14 -> NT34 NT1\n- NT14 -> 't14'\n\nIn the string, the next token is 't30', which isn't 't14' or 't34' or anything derived from NT14 yet. So perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a parse tree. Since the string starts with t28, which can be either NT28 producing 't28' directly or by expanding. But since the string is long, it's likely that NT28 and NT14 will have to expand further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet's consider the string token by token:\n\n1. t28: this could come from NT28 or NT5. Since NT28 can produce 't28', perhaps S -> NT28 NT14, where the first NT28 is 't28'. But let's check.\n\n2. Then, we have t30. The next non-terminal after S might be NT14, but NT14 can be 't14' or produce further. Wait, but after 't28' we have 't30', which isn't something NT14's production directly provides unless NT14 expands to produce a longer string.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the entire string as a series of expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a sequence of symbols in the string and see if each can be matched by the grammar.\n\nLet me try to segment the string and see if each segment can be derived from a production.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to see if the string can be generated by tracing through possible expansions.\n\nGiven that S -> NT28 NT14, let's consider each part.\n\nStarting with NT28: looking for a production that can start with 't28'. The immediate production for NT28 is 't28' or more likely, it would expand into other non-terminals which eventually produce 't28' (like through NT5).\n\nSimilarly, NT14 can produce 't14' or more non-terminals further down.\n\nBut in the string, after 't28' comes 't30', which suggests NT14 must expand to include a 't30' somewhere. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built from multiple branches of the grammar. Maybe some parts are 't28' and others are 't30', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that after S -> NT28 NT14, each part is expanded as follows:\n\n- NT28 can be 't28' or expands into NT5 and NT10.\n- NT14 can be 't14' or expands into NT34 and NT1.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nIf NT28 -> 't28' and NT14 -> NT34 NT1, then the next few symbols would involve NT34 and NT1.\n\nLooking at NT34's productions, I see `NT34 -> NT16 NT1` and `NT34 -> 't30'`. So, if NT34 produces 't30', that could explain the 't30' in the string. Then NT1 must produce 't6' as per the string, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the string is: t28 t30 t70 t28 t14 t30 t61 t36 t34 t84.\n\nLet me try a possible expansion:\n\n1. S -> NT28 NT14. The first symbol is 't28', so NT28 -> 't28'.\n2. NT14: Next token is 't30'. How? Maybe NT14 -> NT34 NT1. Then NT34 must produce 't30', and NT1 produces 't6'.\n3. So, after NT14 is 't30', the next symbol is t70. Let's check.\n4. Wait, maybe it's better to break down the string into possible parts.\n\nAnother approach: Let's list all the possible non-terminals and their productions to see if the string can be parsed.\n\nLooking at the string, each token is either a number (t followed by digits) or a non-terminal. However, wait, in the grammar, the terminals are 't' followed by numbers like 't28', 't30', etc. So, in the string, each symbol is a terminal, either as 'tXXXX' or as a non-terminal symbol (but in the string, it's represented as 'tXXXX').\n\nWait, this may be a point of confusion. In the given grammar, all the non-terminals are prefixed with 'NT' and numbers, but in the string, it's all 't' followed by numbers. So, for example, NT5 is a non-terminal that can produce 't28' as"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-188","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is \"t68 t41 t56 t28 t3 t23 t3 t50 t41 t56 t8\", and the grammar consists of various production rules leading to terminal symbols ('t' followed by numbers) and non-terminals (abbreviated as S, NT2, NT28, etc.). \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe initial production rules of the grammar all start with S and go through a series of non-terminals until they eventually expand into terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT21 NT28, and NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT6, and so on. Each non-terminal step likely leads closer to the terminals 't' followed by numbers.\n\nMy approach is to try to parse the given string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, any valid derivation would be a leftmost derivation, and the parse tree would have the string as the leaves in left-to-right order.\n\nThe string has 11 tokens. Let me break it down:\n\n1. t68\n2. t41\n3. t56\n4. t28\n5. t3\n6. t23\n7. t3\n8. t50\n9. t41\n10. t56\n11. t8\n\nI'll start from the start symbol S. The first step is to see which production for S can generate the first token. Looking at the productions for S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nThe first token is t68, which is a terminal. So, looking at the possible derivations, for example, if S \u2192 NT21 NT28, then NT21 must expand to start with t68. Let's see the NT21 production: NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT6. Hmm, so to get t68, we need to see if any non-terminal directly produces t68.\n\nLooking at the NT25 production, for example: NT25 \u2192 NT5 NT13. Wait, maybe I should go through each non-terminal to see where t68 comes from.\n\nLooking at all productions, I notice a production NT6 \u2192 't68'. So, NT6 can be expanded to t68.\n\nSo, to get t68 as the first symbol, we'd need to have a production that produces t68. Looking for t68 directly, but in the given grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 't68'. So, if I have NT6, it can generate t68.\n\nSo, perhaps the derivation starts with:\n\nS \u2192 NT20 NT25 (assuming S uses this production because NT20 might generate t28, which is the next token).\n\nWait, the string starts with t68, but S's productions don't directly yield t68, because all S's productions go to non-terminals. So, we have to go through NT20 or others.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of leftmost derivation.\n\nLet's list the string's tokens again:\n\nt68, t41, t56, t28, t3, t23, t3, t50, t41, t56, t8.\n\nThe first token is t68. So, somewhere in the derivation tree, a non-terminal must produce t68. Looking through the productions, I see that NT6 \u2192 't68', and NT13 \u2192 't6'... Hmm, but t6 is t6, not t68. So, does any non-terminal directly produce t68?\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nLooking for '->' to a terminal with 68.\n\nI see NT6 \u2192 't68' (line 68: NT6 -> t68)\n\nAlso, NT29 -> NT27 NT22 (and so on), but not producing t68 directly.\n\nSo, to get t68 as the first symbol, we must have a non-terminal that produces it, which is NT6. Thus, somewhere in the derivation, we must have a production that introduces NT6 to produce t68.\n\nSo, maybe S \u2192 NT20 NT25, and then NT25 \u2192 NT5 NT13 leads to NT13, but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, S \u2192 NT32 NT14: NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20, and NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT21 NT28: NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT6. NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20, and NT6 \u2192 t68. So, that would be NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT6 \u2192 (NT1 NT20) t68.\n\nWait, but that would mean NT6 is the last symbol in the production for NT21. So, perhaps the first two tokens would be NT1 and NT20, leading to their expansions.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let's try to see each step.\n\nFirst, I need a production that starts with t68, so that must come from NT6.\n\nLooking at how NT6 can be derived.\n\nLooking up the productions for NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't68' (line 68). So, in the leftmost derivation, the first step would be to have NT6 leading to t68.\n\nBut how do we get NT6 as the first non-terminal in the derivation? Because S starts the derivation.\n\nSo, S must have a production that starts with NT6 as the leftmost symbol.\n\nLooking at the productions for S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo, none of these produce NT6 directly. Thus, S can't start with NT6. Therefore, the first token can't be t68 because there's no production for S that starts with a non-terminal that produces t68.\n\nWait, but that contradicts because the first token is t68. So, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Perhaps the first non-terminal in the S's production is NT21, which then expands, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nLet's see what NT21 and NT28 expand to.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT32 NT6.\n\nNT28 \u2192 't27' in line 114, but wait, looking back:\n\nLine 114: NT28 -> NT11 NT3.\n\nThen NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13: line 87: NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13.\n\nSo, NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3 \u2192 NT25 NT13 NT3.\n\nBut that's getting too deep. Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nLet me consider the entire string structure. The string is a sequence of terminals. Each non-terminal in the grammar must expand to a sequence of terminals and non-terminals correctly.\n\nAnother approach: try to construct a parse tree for the string, starting from the root (S) and expanding non-terminals until we reach the string.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will have each step add exactly two symbols (non-terminals or terminals). Since the string has 11 symbols, the derivation would have 10 steps (since each step adds one symbol, starting from S which is one symbol).\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, S (1 symbol) \u2192 A B (2 symbols), then A \u2192 C D, and B \u2192 E F, etc. So, the number of symbols increases each time a non-terminal is replaced.\n\nBut the given string has 11 symbols. So, to parse 11 symbols, the derivation would have 10 productions applied.\n\nWait, let me check: starting from 1 symbol (S), each non-terminal expansion increases the count by 1 (if replacing with two non-terminals). So, for a string of n tokens, the derivation length is 2n-1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a CFG in CNF, the length of the string is 2^k, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to find the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backward, looking for the possible derivations that can lead to the last symbols.\n\nLooking at the string's last symbols: t56, t8. \n\nWhere do t56 and t8 come from?\n\nLooking for rule for NT56:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT56 directly.

Let's see. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar. It\u2019s in Chomsky normal form, each production has two non-terminals on the left and one on the right. That should help in building a parse tree.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it\u2019s S, and the productions from S are:\n- S -> NT21 NT28\n- S -> NT32 NT14\n- S -> NT20 NT25\n\nWait, but S can produce any of these combinations. The string we have starts with \"t71\", so I wonder if any of these initial productions lead to t71.\n\nLet me see the productions for NT21. Oh, I see NT21 -> NT19 NT26. Then NT19 -> NT5 NT18, and NT18 could lead to 't's. Hmm, but it's a bit complicated.\n\nWait, maybe there's a more straightforward approach. Let me look at the terminals in the string. The tokens are t71, t3, t23, t84, t28, t0, etc. \n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminal symbols. For instance, NT3 -> 't31' and some others. But I need to check if these can produce the specific 't' values in the string.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step. The first token is t71. Looking at the grammar, I see NT0 -> 't61' and NT7 -> 't3'. Hmm, not directly t71. Wait, maybe there's an NT that produces t71. Looking through, I don\u2019t see any NT directly producing t71, except maybe in the productions for NT21 or others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack. Let's see, t71 occurs twice: first and third tokens. Looking for NTs that produce t71. From the grammar, NT7 -> 't3', which is not t71. Wait, perhaps t71 is produced by a non-terminal that eventually leads to t71. Let me check.\n\nLooking through, I see NT26 -> 't28' and NT26 -> NT18 NT9. Wait, maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe the parser can derive 't71' from some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to parse the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if I can generate the string using the given productions.\n\nThe string is: t71 t3 t23 t84 t28 t0 t71 t68 t41 t70 t7.\n\nLet me start by trying to match this string with the grammar. Let's consider the length. The string has 10 tokens. Let me see how a tree can be built.\n\nAssuming the string is the result of a leftmost derivation. Let me consider the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the productions for S: the first few possible are S-> NT21 NT28, S-> NT32 NT14, S-> NT20 NT25, etc. Let's see if any of these can lead to the first token t71.\n\nLet me examine the possible first symbols from S's productions.\n\n- NT21: Its first production is NT19 NT26. Then NT19 -> NT5 NT18, and NT5 can produce 't41' or other things. Not sure.\n- NT32: NT32 -> NT1 NT20. Then NT1-> NT6 NT27, etc. Hmm.\n- NT20: NT20-> NT4 NT13. Then NT4-> NT29 NT10, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S can go to NT32 NT14.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the leftmost non-terminal is NT32, and NT14 is the second non-terminal.\n\nWait, but let's approach this more methodically. The first token is t71. Let's see which non-terminals can derive t71. I need to check for any NT that can produce t71.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces t71. Let me check the productions:\n\nNT7 -> 't3', not t71.\n\nLooking for NT that can derive t71: Maybe through a series of productions.\n\nWait, maybe there's a NT that eventually leads to t71. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT70: It's in the production of NT27 -> NT70 NT22. Wait, NT70 isn't a terminal, it's a non-terminal, and if NT70 can produce 't70', then NT70 can help.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to find a parse tree for the given string.\n\nAnother approach: look for tokens that must be matched by certain non-terminals.\n\nThe string is:\n\n1. t71\n2. t3\n3. t23\n4. t84\n5. t28\n6. t0\n7. t71\n8. t68\n9. t41\n10. t70\n11. t7\n\nWait, that's 11 tokens. Wait, in the original string, is it 11 tokens? Let me count: The user wrote the string as \"t71 t3 t23 t84 t28 t0 t71 t68 t41 t70 t7\". So that's 11 tokens.\n\nWait, but when I look at the productions, each step produces two non-terminals. So the derivation starts with S, which is two nodes, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nGiven that the string is a concatenation of 11 tokens, it's possible that some non-terminals expand into multiple tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for the first token in the string, t71, and see if any NT can produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does any NT produce t71?\n\nLooking through, I see NT17 -> 't14', not t71.\n\nWait, let me see the productions where the first symbol leads to a terminal. For instance:\n\nNT17 -> 't14' which is the production NT17 -> 't14'.\n\nSimilarly, other rules where NTx -> 'tX' are:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT12 -> 't14' (NT12->'t14' perhaps not, looking back: Looking at the grammar, NT12 is produced by:\n\nNT12-> NT4 NT3, etc., and I think some NT12 productions lead to 't14'.\n\nWait, looking more closely, for NT12: It's in NT3-> 't23' and some others, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the first token, t71, and see if any NT can derive it.\n\nLooking through the production functions, I don't see an NT directly producing t71. For example, NT21's production NT21 -> NT19 NT26 would need to go through several steps to reach t71.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a non-terminal whose expansion results in t71. Let's see, perhaps via NT21: NT21's production is NT19 NT26.\n\nThen NT19 is NT5 NT18.\n\nNT5 -> 't41' or NT5 -> NT3 NT32.\n\nIf NT5 is NT5 -> 't41', then NT5 produces t41. Then NT18: looking at NT18 -> 't36' or 't36' could be. Then NT17's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost here. Alternatively, maybe I can check using the provided grammar if the string can be generated.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to represent this as a tree. Let me attempt:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt71, t3, t23, t84, t28, t0, t71, t68, t41, t70, t7\n\nMaybe the first token is from NT71, but in the grammar, I don't see any NT with the name '71' in the production. Instead, non-terminals are named with numbers, like NT1, NT2, etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I see that some NTs are attached to numbers, like NT10, NT12, etc. Let me see:\n\nFor example, NT26 -> 't28' or NT21 -> NT19 NT26.\n\nWait, maybe t71 comes from NT71, but in the productions, I don't see any NT71, so perhaps that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first t71 comes from NT21, which could"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-207","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string `t41 t71 t14 t60 t6 t70 t56 t6 t7 t6 t41 t3` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule produces two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the rules seem to be branching out from there.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, I see it can produce combinations like NT21 NT28, NT31 NT32, etc. Since the string starts with t41 and ends with t3, I should track how these terminals are derived from the non-terminals.\n\nI notice that several non-terminals have productions that end in terminals. For example, 't41' can come from NT5->t41, and t8 comes from NT18->t8. So, each terminal in the string could correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nLet me map the string to possible non-terminals:\n\n- t41 could come from NT5 or perhaps another path if NT5 has another production, but looking at the rules, NT5->t41 is one option.\n\n- t71 is interesting because it appears multiple times. Looking at the grammar, NT33->t71 and also NT17->t71. So t71 can come from either of these.\n\n- t14: NT21->t14? Wait, looking back, NT21->t8. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT21 has several productions, like -> NT26 NT6 or -> t8. So to get t14, perhaps from NT14->t14 directly?\n\nWait, looking more carefully, in the grammar, NT14 has two rules: one is NT14->NT34 NT7, and another is NT14->t65 (since NT14->t65 is in the production list). So t14 comes from NT14 producing t65. Wait, but in the string, we have t14. That's a bit confusing because t65 isn't in the string. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking again, in the grammar, NT14 can produce t65, but the string has t14. Maybe I got the rules wrong. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7\n\nNT14 -> t65\n\nSo, to get t14 in the string, it's not directly in the grammar. That's a red flag. The string has t14, but according to the grammar, I don't see a production that directly results in t14. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe t14 is part of a larger production. Let me think again. NT14 can produce t65, but the string has t14, so unless t65 is somehow abbreviated as t14, which seems unlikely, this might be an issue. Alternatively, perhaps t14 is derived from another path, but I'm not seeing it directly.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again more carefully. The rules for NT14 are:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7\n\nNT14 -> t65\n\nSo, the only t's are t65, which is probably a different terminal. Therefore, the string having t14 is problematic because it's not directly produced by any rule of NT14. Maybe the string is incorrect, but I'll proceed.\n\nNext, t60: Looking at the grammar, NT15->t60, so that could be possible.\n\nt70: NT25->t70? Looking at the grammar, NT25 has productions like ->t77, ->t3, etc. Wait, in the grammar, NT25 has:\n\nNT25->t77\n\nNT25->t3\n\nBut I don't see a direct rule for t70. Wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT25 has rules like -> NT23 NT28, etc., but perhaps t70 comes from another non-terminal. Let me check where t70 is defined.\n\nWait, NT25 doesn't have t70 as a terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, perhaps it's through another path. Maybe NT25 can produce t70 via a chain, but I don't see that. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt2, t3, t4, t6, t7, t8, t10, t14, t16, t17, t18, t20, t21, t22, t23, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t29, t31, t32, t33, t34, t41, t5, t60, t68, t70, t71, t77, t84, t10.\n\nWait, t70 appears in the string. In the grammar, I don't see a terminal t70. Maybe it's produced by another non-terminal. Maybe via NT21 or NT18.\n\nLooking at NT21->t6, which is NT6->t68. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT6: NT6->t68. So if a rule leads to NT6, then t68 is produced.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the string:\n\nThe string is `t41 t71 t14 t60 t6 t70 t56 t6 t7 t6 t41 t3`.\n\nSo each part is a terminal, like t41, t71, etc.\n\nNow, considering each terminal in the string:\n\n1. t41: NT5->t41.\n\n2. t71: Could be from NT33 or NT17.\n\n3. t14: No direct production for t14. Only NT14->t65.\n\n4. t60: NT15->t60.\n\n5. t6: NT5->t41, but wait, no, t6 is NT18->t68, right?\n\n6. t70: I don't see a direct terminal rule for t70.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in mapping. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps building a parse tree.\n\nBut this might take too long. Alternatively, maybe it's better to run through the string step by step, expanding each terminal and seeing if it can align with the grammar.\n\nWait, the string ends with t3, which in the grammar is a terminal. So that's possible from NT3 or others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be derived through a series of productions. Maybe it's better to work backwards.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be derived from S.\n\nFirst, S can go to NT21 NT28, or others. Let's say S-> NT21 NT28. Now, NT21 has several productions: like -> NT26 NT6 or -> t8.\n\nIn the string, the first part is t41, t71, etc. Maybe that's not the right branch.\n\nAlternatively, S->NT31 NT32. NT31 has rules leading to t31, and NT32 to t54. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, S-> NT20 NT25. NT20 can go to NT29 NT32 or t16, and NT25 can go to t77, etc. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, S-> NT32 NT2. NT32 can be t54, or t23, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of each terminal in the string and see if they can be produced by the grammar.\n\n- t41: comes from NT5->t41\n\n- t71: comes from NT33 or NT17\n\n- t14: comes from NT14->t65. Wait, wait, but t14 is in the string. There is no rule in the grammar that produces t14, except if it's a non-terminal that can eventually produce t14, but I don't see that.\n\nHmm, this could be a problem. Because the string has t14, but according to the grammar, NT14 can only produce t65, not t14. So perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. In the given rules, I don't see a production that produces t14. Only ND14 can produce t65. Therefore, t14 cannot be in the string since it's not directly produced by any rule.\n\nTherefore, the string must be invalid because NT14 can't produce t14, only t65. So, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: t38 t40 t71 t14 t84 t23 t23 t8 t70 t50 t70 t54 t61. \n\nFirst, I should recall Chomsky normal form. In this form, each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All non-terminals have at least two non-terminals on the right side or are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, every production seems to fit Chomsky normal form. For example, S -> NT2 NT28 is correct because it's two non-terminals. Also, NT0 -> 't61' is a terminal, so that's okay too. Each NT production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is a sequence of terminals, so we can model this as a parsing problem.\n\nI remember that in CNF, the parsing can be done efficiently with certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, I'm more comfortable using a step-by-step approach here, building up the parse trees incrementally.\n\nLet's list the terminals in order: t38, t40, t71, t14, t84, t23, t23, t8, t70, t50, t70, t54, t61.\n\nI should check if each terminal is present as a production in the grammar. Let's look through the grammar:\n\nLooking for t38: Checking the rules, I see NT18 -> 't38'. Yes, so t38 is produced by NT18.\n\nt40: Looking through the rules, NT23 -> 't40' is there. So t40 is from NT23.\n\nt71: NT21 -> 't71' yes.\n\nt14: NT14 -> 't14' yes.\n\nt84: NT18 -> 't84' yes.\n\nt23: NT23 can produce 't40', but wait, the NT23 production is NT23 -> NT24 NT27. So I can't directly produce 't23' unless it's a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT23 producing a terminal except for t40. That seems conflicting. Wait, looking back, yes, NT23 -> 't40'? Wait, no. Checking the productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT23 is defined as NT23 -> NT24 NT27. There's no production for NT23 that ends with 't23'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for t23 in the productions. I see NT23 -> 't40'? No, that's NT24 -> 't40'. So where is NT23? NT23 is a non-terminal, but it's only defined as NT23 -> NT24 NT27. So, to produce 't23', it's not present in the grammar. That could be an issue. Wait, but t23 is in the string, so if it's not in the grammar, does that mean the string can't be generated? Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the productions again. Oh no, none of the productions end with 't23' except possibly in another part. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT23 -> 't40' in some place? Wait, no, let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production that ends in 't23'. The closest is NT23 -> NT24 NT27. So unless 't23' is a terminal, and if a production for NT23 exists that produces 't23', but it's not here. Therefore, 't23' is not present as a terminal in the grammar, so the string can't be generated. But that can't be right because the string has 't61', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me make sure. I'll scan each production to see if any end with terminals other than 't14', 't17', 't0's, etc.\n\nLooking through all productions:\n\nS is transformed into non-terminals, as are all NT1-NT44, and some produce terminals like 't14', 't17', 't61', etc. But I don't see any production of NT23 that ends with 't23'. Instead, NT23 -> NT24 NT27. So, the string includes 't23' twice, but there's no production that allows that.\n\nWait, this might mean that the string can't be generated because 't23' isn't present in the grammar. That would indicate a 'No' answer.\n\nBut I should double-check. Maybe I missed a production. Let me go through all the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT23-> NT24 NT27: This is the only production for NT23, and it's two non-terminals. So it doesn't produce 't23'. Therefore, 't23's in the string can't be generated. Hence, the string can't be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the string was written differently, but according to the provided grammar, 't23' isn't present as a terminal. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S and has four productions:\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nThis means that the start symbol S can derive into any of these combinations. Now, looking at the productions, I notice that several NT symbols eventually produce terminal strings consisting of 't' followed by a number. For example:\nNT17 -> 't14'\nNT3 -> 't3'\nNT0 -> 't61'\nAnd so on. So, each of these NT symbols represents a production rule that leads to a terminal string.\n\nThe given string is \"t28 t41 t50 t6 t65 t28 t14 t30 t28 t36 t30 t68 t11\". This is a sequence of 't' terms separated by spaces. Since these are terminals, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nTo approach this, I should map the sequence of 't's to the NT symbols and see if there's a way to derive this sequence using the productions provided.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into components:\n1. t28\n2. t41\n3. t50\n4. t6\n5. t65\n6. t28\n7. t14\n8. t30\n9. t28\n10. t36\n11. t30\n12. t68\n13. t11\n\nLooking at these, I can think of each 't' as a terminal symbol, and from the grammar, each corresponds to specific NT productions.\n\nLet me list the NT symbols and their corresponding terminal strings from the grammar:\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT21 -> 't8' (Wait, no, looking back, I see: NT21 has multiple productions, such as NT21 -> 't8' (from production NT18 -> 't36' and NT23 -> 't52', etc. Actually, perhaps it's easier to identify each 't' to its NT symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I should instead reverse-engineer the string. Each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a specific NT production. For example, 't14' comes from NT17, 't28' from NT17 as well (from production NT17 -> 't14' and NT17 -> 't28'). Similarly, other 't's correspond to their NTs.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the NT symbols have various productions leading to 't' strings. For example:\n- NT17 -> 't14' (from production NT17 -> 't14')\n- NT17 also has NT17 -> 't28'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT21 has production NT21 -> 't8' (from NT16 -> NT0 -> 't61' but maybe that's getting too complicated)\nWait, perhaps it's better to note each 't' in the string and map it to possible NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if the entire string can be generated by S through some sequence of productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce three main combinations:\n1. NT21 NT28\n2. NT32 NT14\n3. NT20 NT25\n\nEach of these needs to produce the given string. Let me analyze each possibility.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT21 NT28\nLet's see what NT21 and NT28 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT21 has multiple productions, including NT21 -> 't8', 't14', 't25', 't3', etc. Looking back, I think I see:\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT21-> NT25 NT13 (earlier)\nBut eventually, it can derive to 't' terms. For example, perhaps NT25 can produce 't50', etc.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT symbols that can produce 't' strings:\nNT17: t14, t28\nNT21: t8, t14, t25, t3, t6, t7, t8, etc. Wait, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Maybe it's better to create a mapping from each 't' to the NT symbols that produce it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire string as a sequence of terminals and see if I can build it from the grammar.\n\nBut this seems time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that each 't' is a terminal, so the string must be derived by fully expanding all non-terminals into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the given string can be broken into parts that match the grammar. For example, starting with S, which can produce NT21 NT28.\n\nLet me try to see if the string starts with any of the NT productions. Looking at the string, the first term is t28. So I need to see if t28 is produced by any NT. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT21 can produce t28 (from production NT21 -> 't8'), wait, no, actually, looking back: I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, to clarify, I need to look through the grammar and note each NT and the 't' strings they produce.\n\nLooking through each production, I can list:\n\nNT3 -> t12\nNT5 -> t41 (I think.

{"custom_id":"request-252","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got to figure out if the given string \"t71 t71 t50 t22 t38 t51 t84 t6 t41 t23 t52 t61 t50\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's structured in CNF, meaning each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This is helpful because it simplifies the analysis, especially when using methods like CYK parsing, but since I might not be using a parser, I'll approach it differently.\n\nEach production rule expands a non-terminal into two other non-terminals or terminals. The string consists of terminals (like 't71', 't70', etc.) and non-terminals (like S, NT2, NT3, etc.). The goal is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by identifying which non-terminals correspond to the start symbol. In the given grammar, S has several production rules:\n- S -> NT21 NT28\n- S -> NT32 NT14\n- S -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo the string must be derived from one of these. The string begins with \"t71 t71 t50 t22 t38 t51 t84 t6 t41 t23 t52 t61 t50\". Let's see if any of these can be matched by any of S's productions.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: \"t71 t71\". So, the first two symbols are 't71's. I'll check if any of the productions for S can start with these.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I'll scan all production rules to find any that result in 't71' as the terminal. For example:\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- Other rules like NT3, NT6, etc., also have specific terminal values.\n\nWait, I need to find a production that starts with S and has two terminals as the first step. Since S's productions involve non-terminals, the string must have sequences that match the expansion of S.\n\nI think a better approach is to consider the structure of the string. Each production rule replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols. Since the string starts with two 't71's, I'll look for a production that can lead to that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only production that results in a terminal like 't71' is NT0 -> 't61' and NT10 -> 't0', but not directly. Maybe a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the string as a sequence of terminal symbols and see if they can be derived from some combination of non-terminals expanding step by step.\n\nAnother way is to look for the longest possible match. For instance, the string starts with 't71 t71'. Let's see what that could correspond to. Looking for a production that leads to 't71 t71'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see rules like NT0 -> 't61' (only one terminal), NT10 -> 't0', etc. I don't immediately see a production that directly gives 't71 t71', so perhaps it's derived from a non-terminal that expands into two non-terminals which then expand into 't71's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the derivation of the string starts with one of the S productions, and then each non-terminal expands further.\n\nLooking at the first production of S: S -> NT21 NT28. Let's see what NT21 and NT28 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\nSo NT21 expands into NT26 and NT6. Let's follow these:\nNT26 -> NT28 NT22\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\nSo, NT26 expands into NT28 (which expands into NT11 NT3) and NT22. Also, NT22 expands into NT18 NT32.\n\nThis seems a bit too deep without matching the string immediately. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the last part of the string: ends with 't50'. Looking back, rule NT5 -> 't41', which isn't helpful. Let's check all rules that result in 't50'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\nLooking at NT5 -> 't41' (no), NT10 -> 't0', NT19 -> 't25', etc. Wait, I see:\n\nNT28 -> 't50' (last production is NT28 -> NT11 NT3, but also directly NT28 -> 't50'?)\n\nWait, checking all the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for 't50' \u2013 I see NT28 -> 't50' as the last rule under the grammar. Wait, in the provided grammar, under the initial part, there's a rule:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3, and also another one? Wait, looking through the grammar, yes, under the list, I think I see:\n\nYes, looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar list, under NT28, it's defined as:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\nWait, but I also see:\n\nNT20 -> 't53'?\n\nWait, checking more carefully, the grammar seems to have several rules ending with terminals. I notice:\n\nLooking through all the rules, some terminals are defined as:\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\n\nNT0 -> 't61'\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\n\nNT10 -> 't0'\n\nNT28 -> 't50'?

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a CNF grammar has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, all productions seem to fit this structure, so that's correct.\n\nThe task is to determine if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is a series of terminals, so each part must correspond to the right-hand side of some production rules, working our way from the start to the leaves.\n\nLet me look at the grammar again. The start symbol is S, and the initial productions from S are:\n- S \u2192 NT21 NT28 (rule 1)\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14 (rule 2)\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT25 (rule 3)\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT2 (rule 4)\n\nSo S can split into any of these pairs. I'll need to see which of these can lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t71 and t49. But let's check the grammar to see what each terminal could come from.\n\nFirst, let's map each terminal to possible non-terminals:\n- t71: Checking the grammar, I see that NT15 \u2192 t71 (from rules: NT15 \u2192 t71, twice) and NT26 \u2192 t71 (from NT26's production as t28, which isn't matching). Wait, NT15 \u2192 t71 is present in multiple rules (rules 15 and 16 under NT15). Similarly, NT26 also has a rule with 't71', but looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nWait, I need to check the grammar again. Let me list the grammar more systematically.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT15 \u2192 t71 (twice)\nNT26 \u2192 t71\nOther NT15 \u2192 t71.\n\nSo, t71 comes from NT15 and NT26. Hmm, but let me double-check. From the grammar provided:\n\nLines:\nNT15 -> t71\nNT15 -> t71\n\nSo yes, NT15 produces t71, and NT26 is another option.\n\nSo the initial step: S can choose between four options, each of which is a pair of non-terminals. The first token is t71, so maybe the first part of S's split is NT15. So perhaps S \u2192 NT15 NT? Let's see the four options:\n\n1. NT21 \u2192 the string's next token after t71 is t49. So after NT15, which must produce t71, we have the next non-terminal, which needs to produce t49.\n\nWait, actually no. Wait, when S splits into NT15 and another non-terminal, both must derive into sequences of terminals. So the string starts with t71 followed by t49. So maybe S \u2192 NT15 NTsome.\n\nBut wait, let's think about each production. Let's consider each S option:\n\nIf we take S \u2192 NT21 NT28, then the string starts with t71 (from NT21) and then the next would be t49 from NT28. Let's check the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT21: One production is NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6. Another is NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0, and another is NT21 \u2192 NT19 NT26. Hmm, none of these directly produce terminals. Wait, but in the grammar, NT21 has:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\nNT21 -> NT19 NT26\n\nSimilarly, we need to see what NT28 produces. NT28's productions are:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT1 NT23\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\n\nNone of these produce terminals directly. So NT28 is a non-terminal that needs to split into other non-terminals, which in turn may produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe this isn't the right path. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t71, then t49, t36, and so on. Let me list all the tokens in order:\n\n1. t71\n2. t49\n3. t36\n4. t38\n5. t56\n6. t6\n7. t84\n8. t71\n9. t34\n10. t70\n11. t50\n12. t49\n13. t25\n14. t22\n15. t84\n\nSo, 15 tokens.\n\nNow, I'll try to split the string into pairs based on the initial S productions.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nSo the first part is NT21, which needs to derive to the first part of the string, which is t71, then the second part NT28 should derive to the rest.\n\nBut looking at NT21's production, none of its rules produce a terminal directly. It always splits into other non-terminals.\n\nSo let's see, if NT21's first production is NT26 \u2192 which again doesn't produce terminals. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at other initial S options.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nLooking at NT32's productions:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20\nNT32 \u2192 NT28 NT18\nAnd so on. I don't see a production where NT32 directly produces a terminal. So perhaps this isn't the right spot either.\n\nOption 3: S \u2192 NT20 NT25.\n\nNT20's productions:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32\nSo that doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe NT32 could be in the second part. Let's see.\n\nWait, another approach: check which non-terminals can produce the first token t71 or t49, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are t3, t6, t7, t14, t15, t16, t17, t18, t20, t21, t22, t23, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t36, t38, t39, etc.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals produce each of these.\n\nLooking for NT that produce t71:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 t71\n- NT26 \u2192 t71\n\nSo t71 comes from NT15 or NT26.\n\nSimilarly, t49 is produced by:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 t31, but that's from NT24 \u2192 t31? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT31 \u2192 NT25 NT13, and looking at NT13, which is NT25 \u2192t31?\n\nWait, let me check: from the grammar, the production NT25 is:\n\nLooking, the line is NT25 -> NT34 NT20, etc. Wait, I need to find what produces t49.\n\nLooking, NT47 is not present. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again from the start.\n\nWait, the provided grammar seems to have a lot of rules, but let me check for which NTs produce the terminals in the string.\n\nFrom the grammar, t36 is a terminal. Looking at where it appears:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t36. Hmm. Wait, maybe I should look for which rules produce certain terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the breakdown of the string into pairs based on the initial productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to split the string and see if each pair can derive from a production in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a CNF grammar, every production starts with terminals or non-terminals, but since we're dealing with the whole string, maybe we can split the string into pairs that correspond to the non-terminals' first two components.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: check the string for possible groupings that could correspond to each part of the production. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, perhaps each non-terminal in the initial S split will produce a substring that needs to be matched.\n\nLet's take option 1: S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nNT21 needs to produce the first part of the string: t71 t49 t36 t38 t56 t6 t84 t71 t34 t70 t50 t49 t25 t22 t84.\n\nBut wait, that seems"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-273","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is: \n\n`t84 t38 t3 t71 t71 t68 t61 t43 t70 t50 t50 t66 t22 t6`.\n\nWait, hold on, I think the string is actually written with spaces for clarity, so maybe I should list them out without the spaces in my mind.\n\nBut first, I should understand the grammar. The grammar has rules like S -> NT2 NT28, and other non-terminals branching into different NTs and sometimes terminals. Some of the NTs are replaced with specific strings ending with 't' followed by numbers. \n\nI see that NT34 and NT15 have rules that expand to 't30' and 't6' respectively, among others. NT0 is used in several places, including S production. The goal is to see if the given string can be derived from S through a series of productions, with all non-terminals being expanded into terminals.\n\nThe first step is to parse the string. Let me count the tokens:\n\nt84, t38, t51, t10, t71, t71, t68, t61, t43, t70, t50, t50, t66, t22, t6.\n\nThat's 15 tokens in total. The grammar's S starts with NT2 NT28, and each production in CNF produces two non-terminals. So each step processes two non-terminals, which can themselves be terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nSo the maximum length of a string generated by this grammar is 2^n, where n is the number of productions. The string length here is 15, which is odd, so 2^n must be at least 15. 2^4 is 16, which is just above. So the depth of the grammar is 4, meaning that each step could have been expanded 4 times. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nLet me consider each production in the grammar. Some of the non-terminals produce terminal strings:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT19 -> 't25'\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT16 -> 't6'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT12 -> 't14'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT14 -> 't51'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT23 -> 't56'\n- NT13 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n- NT19 -> 't22'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT11 -> 't14'\n\nHmm, there's a lot here. I notice that NT2 -> 't23' is used in some cases, and NT21 -> 't8' and so on.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't84'. I need to see which productions produce 't84'. Let's look through the rule definitions:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6', etc.\n- NT34 -> 't30' or 't14'\n- NT23 -> 't43' or 't52' or 't56', etc.\n- NT19 -> 't25' or 't22'?\n\nWait, I'm trying to find which nt produces 't84'. Looking through, I see that NT5 -> 't41' and 't41' is used elsewhere, but I don't see a rule where NT25 or NT17 or NT23 produce 't84'. Wait, looking back at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41' is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule. Scanning through the rules:\n\nNT5 -> NT3 NT32 was one, but further down, I see NT5 -> 't41' and another NT5 -> 't84'. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, under NT5:\n\n- NT5 -> NT3 NT32\n- NT5 -> NT5 NT20\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n\nSo NT5 can produce 't41' or 't84'. So the first token 't84' must come from a production where NT5 -> 't84'.\n\nSo the first step in the derivation is S -> NT2 NT28.\n\nThen, NT2 and NT28 must each produce sequences leading to the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at NT2:\n\nNT2 -> 't23' or via other productions. Let me check the rules for NT2:\n\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT21 -> 't8' via NT23's rule?\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules for NT2:\n\nNT2 -> 't23'\nNT23 -> 't43' or 't52' or 't56' etc., but actually, the rules for NT23 are:\n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\nNT23 -> NT22 NT23\nNT23 -> NT27 NT22\nNT23 -> NT24 NT16\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT23, the first line is NT23 -> NT22 NT27, then another -> NT22 NT23, then another -> NT27 NT22, and another -> NT24 NT16. So NT23 is a non-terminal, not a terminal.\n\nBut wait, looking back, in the grammar, I see NT23 is part of rules, but does any production for NT23 end with a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking for NT23's rules:\n\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT23\n- NT23 -> NT27 NT22\n- NT23 -> NT24 NT16\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT7\n- NT23 -> NT24 NT32\nWait, I might have missed. Let me look again:\n\nLooking further in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> NT24 NT16\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT7\n- NT23 -> NT24 NT32\nWait, no, actually, looking through, I don't see NT23 ending with a terminal. The only NT23 rules are in combinations.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck NT2's rules.\n\nWait, under NT2:\n\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT23 -> various non-terminals.\n\nSo NT2 can produce 't23' directly, which matches the first token.\n\nSo the first production is S -> NT2 NT28. The first token is 't84', which must come from NT8. Wait, no, in the string, the second token is 't38'.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, except for the terminals, which are the leaves. The grammar given has several productions, mainly splitting the start symbol S into combinations of non-terminals, which in turn split further until terminals are reached. \n\nLooking at the initial productions, S can produce combinations like NT21 NT28, NT31 NT32, etc. So the string provided starts with \"t3 t23...\" which suggests that the terminals generated might come from specific productions. \n\nI need to check the productions for each terminal to see what non-terminals they originate from. For example, 't3' occurs multiple times. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT3 produces 't7' and also has a production NT3 -> NT5 NT7, which is further expanded. Similarly, 't23' appears a couple of times, and I can see that NT23 is part of some productions. \n\nWait, but in the initial part of the grammar, I notice that NT23 -> NT22 NT27. So if the string has \"t23\", it must come from a production that splits into NT22 and NT27. But looking at the given string, I don't see any 't23' in between. It seems like the string is composed of various t's and numbers, so I need to trace back how these ts could have been generated.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the sequence of terminals can form a leftmost derivation according to the grammar. Since CNF grammars are usually right-derivations, but sometimes leftmost can also be possible, especially since they are context-free. \n\nStarting with S -> NT21 NT28. Then, each of these non-terminals would produce more non-terminals until we reach terminals. So, S would first split into two, each of which splits again until we get down to terminals. \n\nFor example, S could produce NT21 NT28, and then NT21 could split into other non-terminals, and NT28 could split as well. Let's see if the string can be broken down into these parts. \n\nLooking at the string, it starts with \"t3 t23...\", so maybe the first part is from NT21 producing t3 and t23. Wait, but I thought NT23 is an internal node. Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps 't3' comes from NT3, which in the grammar has a production NT3 -> NT5 NT7, and NT5 could produce 't41' and NT7 could produce 't3'. So NT3 would give 't41 t3'. But in the string, after the first 't3', there's a 't23', which might come from a different production.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string. Let's split the string into individual tokens (assuming spaces separate them) so it's a list of 15 tokens: [\"t3\", \"t23\", \"t22\", \"t50\", \"t70\", \"t28\", \"t14\", \"t28\", \"t14\", \"t32\", \"t66\", \"t69\", \"t75\", \"t14\", \"t40\", \"t77\"] but wait, the count is off. Wait, the string as given is: \"t3 t23 t22 t50 t70 t28 t14 t28 t14 t32 t66 t69 t75 t14 t40 t77\" which is 16 tokens. Let me count: 1. t3, 2. t23, 3. t22, 4. t50, 5. t70, 6. t28, 7. t14, 8. t28, 9. t14, 10. t32, 11. t66, 12. t69, 13. t75, 14. t14, 15. t40, 16. t77. So 16 tokens.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, each production is two non-terminals. So starting from S, which splits into two non-terminals. Each of those could in turn split, leading to a binary tree of splits and finally terminals at the leaves. So, the string must correspond to a sequence of terminals that can be generated by such a process.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is to check if each terminal in the string can be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar. Let's see the productions where each terminal is present. For 't3', looking at the grammar, NT16 -> 't3'; NT7 -> 't3'; NT5 -> 't41'; etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S. It divides into two parts, say A and B. A and B each divide further until we get terminals. So A could produce a sequence leading to 't3', 't23', etc. Let's try to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can reconstruct the derivation steps.\n\nStarting with S -> NT21 NT28.\n\nSo after the first step, we have [NT21, NT28]. Now, each of these can split further.\n\nNT21 can produce NT26 NT6 and NT6. NT6 can produce NT10 NT31. NT31 could produce NT25 NT13. NT25 can produce NT5 NT13. NT5 can produce NT3 NT32. NT3 could produce NT5 NT7, but this seems recursive. Maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, NT21 could produce NT6 NT0. NT6 -> NT10 NT31, and NT31 -> NT25 NT13, and so on. This seems too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part of the string is t3, so the first non-terminal in the S split is producing t3. So, for example, S -> NT21 NT28, and NT21 -> t3 t23. Wait, but I don't remember if that's possible, because NT21's productions don't directly split down to terminals. NT21's productions are into more NTs. So maybe that's not the right way.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT3 -> 't7' occurs in some productions, and NT3 also has a production NT3 -> NT5 NT7. Similarly, NT5 -> 't41' and 't5 NT20', etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should consider that the grammar is recursive, but let's try to see if the string can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting from the first term, t3, let's see if it can be generated by some NT. Looking at the production NT3 -> 't7'; but to get 't3', I think NT3 would have to come from NT5 NT7, where NT5 -> 't3' somehow. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT5 -> 't41' or 't5 NT20', not directly to t3. Similarly, NT7 is 't3'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to draw a parse tree in my mind step by step.\n\nStart with S.\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\n\nSo after one step, we have two nodes, NT21 and NT28, which each need to be expanded.\n\nNow, let's see NT21. Its productions are:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\nNT21 -> NT19 NT26\nNT21 -> NT21 NT24\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nSo, for example, we could choose one of these productions.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 has several productions:\n\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3\nNT28 -> NT32 NT18\nNT28 -> NT27 NT0\nNT28 -> NT26 NT22\nNT28 -> NT22 NT0\nNT28 -> NT17 NT26\n\nWait, the first token is t3, so perhaps one of these NTs produce t3.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT3 -> t7,\nNT16 -> t3,\nNT7 -> t3,\nNT26 -> t3,\nand so on.\n\nSo, for example, if NT28 produces t3 and something else, but I don't recall any NT28 production that starts with t3.\n\nWait, let's go back. The first token is t3. So the first non-terminal (after S) must produce t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-289","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to figure out if the string t41 t6 t12 t3 t23 t38 t14 t14 t71 t30 t66 t41 t66 t22 t36 t68 is generated by it. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal replaces two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the productions are given here. The string provided has a bunch of terminals like t31, t28, etc., so I guess these must be terminals in this grammar.\n\nEach production in the grammar seems to be broken down into two parts. For example, S can be replaced by NT21 NT2 NT28 or other combinations. Then each NT... has its own production, ultimately leading to some terminal. So, I think each production chain must end with the terminals given.\n\nLooking at the string, it's separated by spaces, so each token is a terminal. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string is:\n\nt41, t6, t12, t3, t23, t38, t14, t14, t71, t30, t66, t41, t66, t22, t36, t68.\n\nThat's 16 terminals. Each step in the derivation of a string from S will produce two symbols, which can themselves be terminals or non-terminals. So the number of symbols doubles at each step. Wait, but in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal into two symbols, so the number of symbols can be thought of in terms of a binary tree.\n\nBut here, we're trying to see if the given string can be generated. So, perhaps I should try to build a parse tree from the start symbol S to reach this string.\n\nAnother approach is to see if all the terminals in the string can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar. For example, certain terminals like 't28' might be produced by multiple non-terminals, so I need to check if they can appear in the derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for how each terminal is generated. For instance, some of these like t14 and t41 appear in the string. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT17 -> 't41'\n\nOkay, so 't14' is generated by NT17, and 't41' is generated by NT17 as well. That might be useful.\n\nNow, looking at t6, which is part of the string. Checking the rules:\n\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT6 -> 't6' 't8'\nWait, no, looking more carefully, I think I might have misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT6 -> NT10 NT31\n\nAnd looking further, NT10 is a rule that ends up producing some terminals. Hmm, maybe I should look for all the NTs that can produce these terminal tokens.\n\nWait, but actually, perhaps it's easier to work backwards. Let me check each terminal in the string and see if it's covered.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- t41: Look for NTs that can produce 't41'. Scanning the rules, I see NT17 -> 't41' and NT5 -> 't41', so that's good.\n\n- t6: Possible from NT6 -> 't68'? Wait, no. Let me check. Wait, in the grammar, NT6 is -> NT10 NT31. Then NT10 -> NT28 NT13. Wait, maybe I'm getting lost here.\n\nWait, maybe an alternative approach: Each of these terminal strings is a series that must have their parent rules resolved.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to attempt to reconstruct the derivation. Let's consider that starting from S, we have S -> NT21 NT2 NT28, S -> ... etc. So the string derived from S is two parts: NT21 NT2 NT28, or another combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the given string can be split into multiple parts generated by each production. Alternatively, maybe I should see if each of these tokens can be reached through some path of productions.\n\nWait, but let's take it step by step. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string has 16 tokens. Let's think about how it would split.\n\nSince each production splits into two, the initial S will produce two parts. Each of those can produce further splits. Since 2^4=16, perhaps this string is a result of four levels of splitting from S.\n\nSo let's try to see if each group of two symbols can be generated from the productions.\n\nLet me try to pair the tokens and see if each pair can be generated by a production.\n\nPairing the string:\n\n[t41], [t6], [t12], [t3], [t23], [t38], [t14], [t14], [t71], [t30], [t66], [t41], [t66], [t22], [t36], [t68]\n\nWait, that's 16 tokens, which is 8 pairs. Wait, perhaps each pair forms a non-terminal. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each step in the derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two terms. So after four steps, starting from S, you have 2^4 = 16 symbols. So the string is 16 symbols, which would be the result of four productions applied starting from S.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be that each production splits into two symbols, so if you have four levels, you get 2^4 = 16.\n\nAlternatively, the initial step from S gives two non-terminals, then each of those give another two, so after three steps, you'd have 8, then 16?\n\nWait, maybe I should try tracing the string step by step, seeing if each part can be traced back through the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check for each terminal if it can be generated by some NT, and if their parents can be generated accordingly.\n\nLet me take the string:\n\nt41 t6 t12 t3 t23 t38 t14 t14 t71 t30 t66 t41 t66 t22 t36 t68.\n\nLet me see if these can be grouped into possible NTs.\n\nPerhaps think in terms of building a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just build a possible parse step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start from the top and try to see if the string can be decomposed based on the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, each production is a non-terminal replacing two symbols, which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo let's see the main productions:\n\nS can go to several options, but the string starts with t41, which is produced by NT17.\n\nSo let's assume that S starts with NT17 NT... something.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT21 NT2 NT28\n\nBut t41 is in the string, so perhaps one of the NTs in that production is NT17.\n\nWait, in the productions, S has several options, but the first is S -> NT21 NT2 NT28. So each of these NTs can derive into terminals.\n\nWait, but NT21 can produce, for example, 't71' as in the rule NT21 -> 't71'.\n\nWait, but the first token is t41, which is produced by NT17, so perhaps NT21 is not the one. Alternatively, perhaps the starting productions are different.\n\nWait, no, actually, the first production for S is S -> NT21 NT2 NT28. So from S, you immediately get two NTs. So perhaps the string is generated by S, producing two NTs, say A and B, so that the string is A B, each of which are generated from the NTs.\n\nWait, but the string has 16 tokens, so perhaps each of A and B contribute 8 tokens each. So A and B are sequences generated by NT21 and NT2 NT28, respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps S -> NT21 NT2 NT28, which is the first option. So then, to get the string, NT21 would have to generate the first half of the string, and NT2 NT28 would generate the second half.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is split as follows:\n\nFirst part: t41 t6 t12 t3 t23 t38 t14 t14\n\nSecond part: t71 t30 t66 t41 t66 t22 t36 t68\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 8 each makes 16. Alternatively, maybe the split isn't even.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production gives two symbols, so let me think about how"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t23 t8 t30 t71 t60 t22 t14 t14 t7 t70 t50 t77 t30 t66 t28 t30 t49`. \n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. In CNF, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side has either one or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some symbols are terminals, like 't23', 't8', etc. These are the leaves in the parse tree. Non-terminals are the symbols that can be replaced by other symbols, like S, NT2, etc. \n\nThe string provided starts with 't23', which is a terminal. So I need to see if 't23' can be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar. Looking at the rules, I see `NT23 -> NT22 NT27`. Hmm, wait, that's not a terminal. So how does 't23' come into play? Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, looking deeper, I see that 't23' is actually a terminal rule for NT23. For example, `NT23 -> t40` isn't directly listed, but looking through the rules again, I spot `NT22 -> NT27 NT2` and `NT23 -> NT22 NT27`. Hmm, but 't23' itself isn't directly a production. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, actually looking through the grammar rules, I see that several non-terminals have terminal strings. For example, `NT3 -> t3` and `NT32 -> t54`. So each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal string.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't23', so I need to find a path from the start symbol S to 't23' through the grammar. Let's see how the start symbol S is used. The initial productions are S -> NT21 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, S -> NT20 NT25. So S can go to three different non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with 't23', so one of these non-terminals needs to derive to 't23'. Looking at the rules for NT23, it seems that NT23 is broken down into NT22 and NT27. But I'm not seeing 't23' directly as a production from NT23. Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, let me look at the rules again. I see NT23 -> NT22 NT27, but 't23' isn't a direct production. So perhaps 't23' comes from elsewhere. Let me check N terminals that might lead to 't23'. Looking through, maybe NT23 is used somewhere else?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t23 t8 t30 t71 t60 t22 t14 t14 t7 t70 t50 t77 t30 t66 t28 t30 t49`.\n\nEach token is a terminal. So the parse tree needs to have each of these tokens as leaves.\n\nLet's start from the root, S. S can produce NT21 NT28, so let's see if the string can be broken down that way.\n\nBreaking the string: `t23 t8 t30 t71 t60 t22 t14 t14 t7 t70 t50 t77 t30 t66 t28 t30 t49` divided into two parts for NT21 and NT28.\n\nWait, NT21's rules: looking through, NT21 -> NT26 NT6, and NT6 can produce 't66', 't68', etc. Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at NT21, which has `NT21 -> NT26 NT6`, and for NT26, `NT26 -> NT28 NT22`, and NT22 has `NT22 -> NT18 NT32`. NT18 is a terminal (t36?), wait, no, in the rules it's `NT18 -> t36`. But in the string, we have 't36' elsewhere? Wait, actually, looking at the string, I don't see 't36' but I do see 't30' and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's try to assign each token to a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better approach is to see if each token is reachable from the start symbol through the grammar.\n\nWait, the first token is 't23'. So does any derivation from S go to 't23'? Let me look at the rules.\n\nLooking at NT23: in the rules, I don't see a direct production for NT23 yielding 't23', but maybe it's derived from other symbols. Wait, no, NT23 is defined as NT22 NT27. So unless NT22 or NT27 can derive 't23', but that doesn't make sense because 't23' is a terminal.\n\nHmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the rules again. I see that `NT23 -> NT22 NT27`, which are non-terminals, so until those produce terminals, we can't get 't23'.\n\nWait, unless 't23' is another terminal. Wait, maybe I'm mistaken, perhaps 't23' is a terminal. Let's check: looking through the rules, when do terminals appear?\n\nWait, actually, the rules don't explicitly list all the terminals as their own symbols. Instead, some non-terminals produce terminal strings. For example, `NT3 -> t3`, which means that NT3 can produce the terminal 't3'. Similarly, NT5 -> t41, so 't41' is a terminal.\n\nSo, a terminal like 't23' must come from a non-terminal that can derive it. But looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't23'. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, did I miss any production? Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- `NT23 -> NT22 NT27`\n- No production for NT23 that ends in 't23' as a terminal.\n\nSo 't23' doesn't appear as a direct production in the grammar. That would mean that the grammar doesn't have a production that produces 't23'. Therefore, the string `t23 ...` cannot be generated by the grammar. But wait, is 't23' a terminal in the language? Or are all non-terminals supposed to derive into terminals, but in this case, maybe 't23' isn't in the language?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and 't23' is a terminal that's directly derived. Wait, let me check the start of the string again. It starts with 't23', which suggests that NT23 must be part of the derivation.\n\nSo, the question is: does the grammar have a path where S can produce something that starts with 't23'? Let's try.\n\nS can derive into NT21 NT28. So to get a 't23', perhaps NT21 or NT28 can produce 't23'. \n\nLooking at NT21: It can derive into NT26 NT6. Then NT6 can derive into 't66', 't68', 't10', etc. So 't66' is possible, but not 't23'.\n\nLooking at NT28: It has rules like -> NT11 NT3, but eventually, does any path produce 't23'? I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the entire string. Maybe the first token is 't23', so the top-level NT that starts the parse must be able to derive 't23'. But in the grammar, the only NTs that can derive 't23' would be NT23, I think. But does NT23 have a production that ends with 't23'? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at NT23, the production is `NT23 -> NT22 NT27`. Neither of these produce 't23' as a terminal. So unless 't23' is part of some other derivation, which doesn't seem possible, because NT23 is two non-terminals. So 't23' cannot be a terminal in the language because there's no production that makes it a terminal. Therefore, 't23' cannot be in the string, making the entire string invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe there's a rule I overlooked that I'm missing where a non-terminal can produce 't23' through another path.\n\nLooking again through all"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-316","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. CNF means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the starting symbols. Looking at the grammar, I see that all the productions start with a non-terminal and have two others. So, that checks out.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t84 t34 t66 t10 t3 t6 t36 t51 t84 t3 t38 t40 t50 t6 t12 t41 t84`. I notice that the terminal symbols are 't' followed by numbers. Some of these might be non-terminals, but looking at the grammar, some terminals are not assigned, but that's okay because in the grammar, some rules terminate with terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, the right-hand side should be two non-terminals, but some rules might have symbols that are terminals. Hmm, but in the grammar provided, each production rule is of the form Non-terminal -> Non-terminal Non-terminal, which aligns with CNF.\n\nBut wait, some of the terminals in the string are given directly, like 't84', 't34', etc. The grammar might have rules where the right-hand side includes terminals. Let me check the provided grammar. No, looking at it, all production rules have two non-terminals on the right-hand side. For example, S -> NT21 NT28. So, the grammar only produces non-terminals without any terminals. But the string has terminals. That seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is being used in a way where the non-terminals are expanded into terminals. But in the grammar, the right-hand sides are all non-terminals. So, the initial derivation would produce non-terminals, which would themselves be expanded into other non-terminals until the terminals appear. Hmm, but in this case, the given string only has terminals, so maybe the grammar is such that certain non-terminals directly produce terminals. But looking at the provided grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly leads to a terminal (except maybe some in the initial rules, but no, all rules are non-terminal to non-terminal).\n\nWait, looking again, I see that the grammar includes some terminals in parentheses after non-terminals. For example, some lines say NT21 -> 't28'. Oh, so some non-terminals can produce a terminal. That makes sense because otherwise, the string couldn't include terminals. So, the grammar allows some non-terminals to expand into terminals, others stay as non-terminals.\n\nSo, the production rules are: if a non-terminal has a rule ending with something like NT21 -> 't28', then that NT21 can produce that terminal. So, the string has a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but actually, the string only includes terminals. So, I need to see if all elements in the string are produced by the grammar through some path.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string according to the grammar and see if each element can be derived. But that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into components that are part of the parse tree in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: `t84 t34 t66 t10 t3 t6 t36 t51 t84 t3 t38 t40 t50 t6 t12 t41 t84`\n\nI should note the positions of the terminals and see if they can be matched by the grammar.\n\nLet me list the terminals in order: 84, 34, 66, 10, 3, 6, 36, 51, 84, 3, 38, 40, 50, 6, 12, 41, 84.\n\nI'll start from the beginning.\n\nLooking for the first 't84'. What non-terminal can produce 't84'?\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that:\n\n- NT14 -> 't51' (line NT14 -> 't51')\n- NT18 -> 't66' (line NT18 -> 't66')\n- NT2 -> 't23' (line NT2 -> 't23')\n- NT17 -> 't49' (line NT17 -> 't49')\n- NT8 -> 't27' (line NT8 -> 't27')\nBut wait, line NT18 -> 't49'? Wait, no, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking back, the grammar includes:\n\nLine NT18 -> 't66' (Wait, original lines may have formatting issues, but from the provided grammar, looking for rules where a non-terminal is assigned a terminal.\n\nAh, in the grammar provided, some rules have terminals, like:\n\nNT21 -> 't28' (from line NT21 -> NT28, and some others)\n\nWait, no, the initial grammar shows:\n\nNT21 -> NT28, but then some lines say NT21 -> 't28' or NT21 -> 't69', etc. Let's see:\n\nIn the grammar, there are lines like:\n\nNT21 -> 't28'\nNT21 -> 't69'\n\nYes, these are non-terminals that can produce terminals. Similarly:\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\nNT0 -> 't61'\nNT10 -> 't32'\nNT16 -> 't6'\nNT7 -> 't3'\nNT18 -> 't66'\nNT0 -> 't17'\nAnd many others.\n\nSo, to break down the string, each part must be either a terminal produced directly by a non-terminal or a non-terminal that can be further expanded.\n\nSo, first token is 't84'. We need a non-terminal that can produce 't84'.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't84' (line NT0 -> 't84') and NT25 -> 't77' (line NT25 -> 't77'), but I don't see a rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't84' except NT0.\n\nSo, first, the string starts with 't84', which can be produced by NT0.\n\nSo, the first step is: NT0 -> 't84'\n\nNow, we look into the structure of NT0's production. From the grammar, NT0 has multiple production rules. For example, NT0 -> NT11 NT16, among others, but the initial production is S -> NT21 NT28.\n\nWait, NT0 in the grammar has several rules, including:\n\nNT0 -> NT10 NT27\nNT0 -> NT17\nNT10 -> NT2 NT22\nNT11 -> NT25 NT13\nNT16 -> NT29 NT7\nNT27 -> NT9 NT9\nNT0 is one of the non-terminals, and it has several production rules, including:\n\nNT0 -> NT17 (line NT0 -> NT17?), but looking at the grammar provided:\n\nLines like NT0 -> 't84', but in the grammar, the rules for NT0 include:\n\nNT0 -> NT10 NT27\nNT0 -> 't66' (Wait, original line is NT18 -> 't66'), so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me get this straight.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see NT18 -> 't66', but NT0 is another non-terminal. Let me correct that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals that produce terminals are:\n\nNT21 -> 't28' (line NT21 -> NT28, then NT21 -> 't28' and others)\nNT26 -> 't28'\nWait, no. Each line is a production. For example:\n\nThe line NT21 -> 't28' is a direct production, meaning NT21 can produce 't28'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT0 -> 't84'\nNT0 -> 't61'\nNT0 -> 't17'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nNT0 -> 't0'\n\nWait, no, looking at the lines:\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nYes, the lines have rules where NT21 ->'t28', NT26 ->'t28', NT0 -> 't84', NT0-> 't61', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT0 has production NT0 -> 't84', so that's how it's generated.\n\nSo, moving back: first token 't84' comes from NT0. Now, the next production for NT0 could be, for example, S -> NT21 NT28, but that's about S. Alternatively, NT0 can produce 't84' directly.\n\nBut in this case, the string is a sequence of terminals, which suggests that each is produced directly by some non-terminal.\n\nSo, considering the string as a list of terminals, each should appear as the output of a production.\n\nBut first, the string starts with 't84"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-331","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar consists of several production rules starting from the start symbol S. Each non-terminal symbol can be expanded into two other non-terminals or, in some cases, terminals denoted by 't' followed by numbers. For example, S can produce NT21 NT28, which are non-terminals that eventually will expand into terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is: `t6 t84 t38 t54 t30 t68 t30 t22 t6 t30 t71 t30 t50 t41 t41 t84 t6 t12`.\n\nI'll start by working backwards, trying to match the string to the grammar. Since the last part of the string is 't12', I can look for production rules for t12.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that t12 is produced by NT12. The rule is NT12 -> NT4 NT0. So, t12 comes from NT12. The prior non-terminals in the string must be NT4 and NT0.\n\nLooking at the string, before 't12' is 't30', so the next step is to check if 't30' can be from NT0. Looking at NT0, it has multiple production rules, one of which is NT0 -> t31, another is NT0 -> t17, another is NT0 -> t61, and others. Wait, wait, looking at the grammar provided, I need to see what NT0 can produce.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rules for NT0 include:\n- NT0 -> t61\n- NT0 -> t17\n- NT0 -> t11\n- NT0 -> t0\n- NT0 -> NT13 NT26\n- NT0 -> NT29 NT7\n- And others? Checking further, it seems NT0 has several rules, including some that take t61, t17, t11, and so on.\n\nWait, the last part of the string is 't12', which comes from NT12. Before that is 't30' which must come from NT0, because the production for NT12 is NT12 -> NT4 NT0, so the symbols before 't12' must be NT4 and NT0, with the NT0 producing 't30'.\n\nSo, to reach 't30', I look for NT0 rules that produce 't30'. Looking through the production rules, I notice that NT0 has a rule NT0 -> NT29 NT7. Checking NT29 and NT7, I see that NT29 can produce t50 and NT7 can produce t3. But looking for a direct terminal production, I see:\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, there are several NT0 rules that result in t as terminals, like NT0 -> t8, t6, t17, etc. Wait, I noticed that there are NT0 rules like NT0 -> t8, NT0 -> t6, NT0 -> t17, but wait, looking more carefully, for example, NT17 -> t14? Or does it go to 't14' as a terminal?\n\nWait, no, I think in the grammar, the terminals are the ones where the non-terminal directly become t followed by numbers. Let me check the given grammar rules line by line.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see:\nNT29 -> NT27 NT22\n...\nNT27 has some rules but none produce t directly. \n\nNT17 has:\nNT17 -> NT5 NT28\nNT7 -> NT3\nThen looking for where 't28' comes from, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t6 t84 t38 t54 t30 t68 t30 t22 t6 t30 t71 t30 t50 t41 t41 t84 t6 t12.\n\nI'll reverse engineering, starting from the end.\n\nStarting with t12, which must come from NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0. So the last two symbols before t12 in the string are 't30' and 't12'. Wait, no, the string is in order, so it's 't30' followed by 't12'.\n\nWait, no, the string is in order: t6, t84, t38, t54, t30, t68, t30, t22, t6, t30, t71, t30, t50, t41, t41, t84, t6, t12.\n\nSo, t12 is the last element, so in terms of the parse tree, it's the deepest leaf. So the production for t12 must be a terminal, but in the grammar, looking through the rules, I don't see 't12' as a terminal. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, in the terminal rules, I see some 't's, but not 't12'. So maybe 't12' comes from a non-terminal that eventually expands into multiple 't's.\n\nWait, the grammar's rules include NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0. So to get 't12', the NT12 would have to derive to 't12' via NT4 and NT0. But in the grammar, unless there's a rule for NT12 that directly produces 't12' and other symbols, it's not possible.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking through the production rules, I see that NT12 appears in two production rules: NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0 and NT12 \u2192 NT15 NT3. But none of these directly produce 't12'. Therefore, the symbol 't12' must come from a terminal symbol. However, in the provided list of productions, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't12' as a terminal.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check more carefully. Scanning through all the productions, I see:\n\nI see rules for NT12:\n\nNT12 -> NT4 NT0\nNT12 -> NT15 NT3\n\nSo, the only way to get 't12' is if one of these two productions produces 't12' directly, which they don't. Because NT12 is an internal non-terminal that depends on NT4 and NT0, both of which are non-terminals in the grammar. Hence, 't12' would have to be derived through multiple steps.\n\nBut in the string, the last token is 't12'. That would imply that at the deepest level, the parse tree ends with t12, which would mean that 't12' is a terminal symbol, but in the grammar, there's no such rule.\n\nWait, then perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again. Oh, wait, no. Looking through the provided rules, I don't see a production where any non-terminal directly expands to 't12'. So perhaps the string 't12' is invalid because the grammar doesn't have that terminal.\n\nWait, that can't be right. The problem says the string may or may not be in the language. So either it is or it isn't. But I think 't12' must come from some production in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again. Let me list all terminal productions.\n\nLooking back through the rules:\n\nNT25 -> NT5 NT13\n...\nBut looking through, I don't see any direct terminal production of 't12'. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread some part. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, the only way to get t12 is if the grammar allows for a non-terminal that directly produces t12, which it doesn't. So that would mean that the string cannot be derived because it ends with t12, which is not a terminal in the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the terminal symbol 't12', which is not directly produced by any production rule in the grammar. All productions involving 't's end up with other 't's or variables that further expand. Therefore, the string is not generated by the given grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which simplifies things a bit because each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar rules and see how they can produce the given string. The string consists of a series of \"t\" followed by numbers, which are probably the terminals in the grammar. The grammar has non-terminals like S, NT2, NT3, etc., and production rules that connect them.\n\nI notice that the string starts with \"t71\", which must correspond to one of the productions that start with NT71 or something similar. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT0 produces \"t61\", which is one of the terminals. There's also NT16 that leads to \"t6\" and other terminals.\n\nWait, but looking more closely, I think the non-terminals in the grammar don't have \"t\" as part of them. The grammar seems to have non-terminals like S, NT2, NT3, etc., and the productions transform these into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. So each production on the left is a non-terminal, and the right side is a combination of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for example, S can produce NT2 followed by NT28, or NT32 followed by NT14, etc. So the string we're given must be a series of terminal symbols, each corresponding to a production step in the grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens: t71, t70, t6, t84, t68, t70, t54, t38, t70, t66, t71, t14, t14, t28, t30, t61, t70, t77.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by following the production rules.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\nStarting from S, which can go to NT2 NT28 or other options. Since the string starts with t71, I'm looking for where \"t71\" appears as a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT0 produces \"t61\", which is t61.\n\nSimilarly, for example, NT0 can produce \"t8\" and other terminals as per the rules.\n\nWait, I might need to see if the entire sequence can be parsed step by step. Let me look at the grammar's terminals:\n\nLooking through all the productions, the terminals are things like \"t28\", \"t14\", \"t6\", \"t3\", etc. The string in question has a lot of these.\n\nTo parse the string, perhaps I can reverse engineer the steps.\n\nLet me consider the string as a series of terminal symbols and check if each can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the first token, t71. I need to see if any non-terminal in the grammar produces t71 as a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see that NT16 -> \"t6\", NT0 -> \"t61\", NT10 -> \"t32\", NT0 -> \"t17\", etc. Wait, I don't see any production that directly yields \"t71\". Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces \"t71\". Wait, perhaps I can derive \"t71\" through a series of replacements.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t71, which would need to be derived from some non-terminal. If no non-terminal directly produces \"t71\", then the string cannot be derived from S because none of the productions start with \"t71\".\n\nSo perhaps the answer is No. But I should make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a production. Let me go through the rules again:\n\n- NT16 -> \"t6\"\n- NT0 -> \"t61\"\n- NT15 -> \"t71\"\nWait, looking back, yeah, there is NT15 -> \"t71\", and there is also NT10 -> \"t32\", but \"t71\" is a direct production from NT15.\n\nWait, in the initial list of grammar rules, I see NT15 -> t71, yes. So if the first token is t71, that could be from NT15.\n\nSo, let me correct myself: the first token t71 can be the terminal output of NT15.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with NT15 -> t71.

So if after NT15, the next part must be connected through a production rule.\n\nWait, no. The production of NT15 is only \"t71\".

{"custom_id":"request-349","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. CNF means that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. The productions like S \u2192 NT2... suggest non-terminals, and some end with a terminal, like NT0 \u2192 't61'. But I notice that all productions ending with a terminal have exactly one terminal. I'm not sure if that's correct because in CNF, a production can produce a single terminal, but perhaps some are missing steps.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, most productions have two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT2 NT28, which is two non-terminals. However, there are also productions like NT22 \u2192 NT18 NT23, and so on. So it seems the grammar is mostly in CNF, except some non-terminals might produce terminals. But I see that in the grammar, some non-terminals directly map to a single terminal, like NT0 \u2192 't61'. So maybe the grammar is technically in CNF, but I need to be careful about the terminals.\n\nHowever, one thing that catches my eye is that in some productions, like NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT22 or NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT9, these are two non-terminals, which is fine in CNF. But there are also several productions where a non-terminal is written twice, such as NT32 \u2192 NT28 NT18 and NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27. Some non-terminals even have the same index, like NT0 appears multiple times, but that's allowed.\n\nNow, the given string to check is: `t6 t6 t3 t71 t60 t0 t10 t6 t7 t70 t40 t23 t65 t23 t54 t36 t41 t36 t65`. This string seems to consist of several 't' followed by numbers, which are likely terminal symbols. My task is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nTo do this, I'll try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production generates either a single terminal or two non-terminals, which in turn can be expanded.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which branches into several options: S \u2192 NT2 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, S \u2192 NT20 NT25. Each of these is a pair of non-terminals, so the first step is to expand one of these pairs.\n\nEach of these non-terminals has their own productions. For example, NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18, etc. It might get complex to track, so perhaps I can construct a parse tree or try to find a path that generates the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the terminals in the string and see if their production chains align.\n\nLet me list out the terminals in the string:\n\nt6, t6, t3, t71, t60, t0, t10, t6, t7, t70, t40, t23, t65, t23, t54, t36, t41, t36, t65.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So I need to find a way that each of these terminals is derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT0 \u2192 't61', NT10 \u2192 't32', etc. So those are single-step terminals.\n\nI should try to see if I can find a path where the non-terminals chain down to these terminals.\n\nLet me start by trying to match the first part of the string: t6 t6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps the first 't6' is from NT0 \u2192 't61' (but that's not t6). Or NT6 \u2192 't68'? Wait, I'm looking for 't6', so I should check if any non-terminal directly produces 't6'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT* \u2192 't6'.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar. One of the productions is NT24 \u2192 't22', NT27 \u2192 't28', etc. Hmm, I don't see any NT* directly producing 't6'. Wait, actually, I see NT26 \u2192 't28' and NT17 \u2192 't6'. Wait, is there any production NT17 \u2192 't6'? Let me check.\n\nNo, looking back, I see: NT17 \u2192 't14' (since it's NT0 \u2192 't17' and the production is 't14'). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look carefully.\n\nIn the grammar, the production NT17 isn't directly listed except as NT17 \u2192 't14'. Wait, actually, looking at the list:\n\nNT17 is not directly a production. Wait, perhaps in the grammar, NT17 is the right-hand side of another non-terminal? Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let's check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't14' (from NT0 \u2192 't17' and NT17 \u2192 't14'). Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps some NT produces 't6' directly. Wait, looking through, I don't see any NT* \u2192 't6'. Maybe I need to construct the chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's possible that 't6' comes from NT6 \u2192 't68' or something else, but that would require multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for a non-terminal that can derive 't6'.

Wait, perhaps that's not direct.)\n\nWait, NT3 has one production: NT3 \u2192 NT20 NT13. Wait, that doesn't end with a terminal. NT3 also has NT5 NT7, etc.\n\nOh, I see!

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if this sequence can be derived from S using the given rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S branches into NT21 and NT32, each further splitting into two NTs. So, the initial step is to see if the string can be matched starting with either of these initial productions.\n\nBut the string starts with 't22', which is a specific terminal. So I need to look for a production path that starts with 't22'. Scanning the grammar rules, some terminals are directly 't...', like 't28', 't14', 't61', etc. I see that 't22' is a terminal, so it must be generated directly by some NT \u2192 't22' production.\n\nLooking through the rules, I spot that NT26 \u2192 't28' and NT22 \u2192 't71' \u2014 no 't22' as a direct terminal. Wait, no, looking more carefully, I realize that NT22 \u2192 't71' isn't 't22'. Let me check again. Oh, actually, looking at the rules, I see NT22's productions: NT22 \u2192 NT23 NT27 and NT22 \u2192 NT18 NT32. Hmm, no direct 't22' terminal. Similarly, NT19 \u2192 't25' and 't84', so no direct 't22'. This is a bit confusing because the string has 't22' at several points, so maybe 't22' is generated through more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps 't22' is an intermediate node. Let's check if 't22' is ever a terminal. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any terminal production that results in 't22'. So perhaps 't22' is not a terminal, but that can't be because in Chomsky Normal Form, all terminals are at the leaves. If 't22' isn't a terminal, how can it appear in the string? That would mean it's not possible. But the string contains 't22', so either the grammar generates it or the string isn't valid.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me look again. In the grammar rules, I see NT7 \u2192 't3', NT5 \u2192 't41', etc. Looking for 't22', I don't see any production that ends with 't22' as a terminal. This suggests that 't22' might not be a terminal in the grammar. However, in the parsing steps, perhaps 't22' is derived from some combination, but if 't22' isn't a terminal, then it's an internal node, which would complicate the derivation because terminals must appear at the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me scan more carefully:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that NT17 \u2192 't14', NT10 \u2192 't32', NT12 \u2192 't16', etc. Oh, wait, I don't see any production that directly generates 't22' as a terminal. So, unless 't22' is present in the grammar via some intermediate steps, it shouldn't appear in the string. Therefore, the presence of 't22' indicates that the string might not be in the language because the grammar doesn't have 't22' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps 't22' is generated via some path? Let me see if any NTs have a production that ends with 't22'. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't22'. So 't22' must be derived from intermediate steps, but that would mean that 't22' is a non-terminal. However, in the given string, it's a terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because 't22' isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n\nThis suggests that the string contains a terminal that the grammar doesn't have, making it impossible for the grammar to generate such a string. Therefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This might be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. The string to check is `t3 t40 t50 t32 t69 t12 t34 t60 t71 t23 t71 t60 t49 t14 t7 t70 t31 t38 t52 t6`.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S. From S, the productions are S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and S \u2192 NT20 NT25. So the first step is to determine which production rules can generate the entire string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t3`, which is a terminal. So I need to see if any non-terminals can directly produce `t3`. Scanning through the grammar rules, I notice several places where non-terminals are assigned to terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't3', which is useful because the string starts with `t3`.\n\nBut to start, let's see which production rules have `t3` as a result. Checking NT3, I see that NT3 can produce 't3' (from the rule NT3 \u2192 't3 18'), but wait, that's not a direct production. Looking again, maybe I missed it. Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT3 has several productions with 't3' in them. For example, NT3 can produce 't31' (from NT3 \u2192 NT31 NT13?), but that's not `t3`. Wait, let's double-check the grammar rules provided.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT3 has multiple rules: NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7, NT5 NT7, ND etc., but none of them directly produce 't3'. Wait, actually, looking at NT13's rules, I see NT13 \u2192 't6' and more. Hmm, maybe I didn't look carefully. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't7', NT10 \u2192 't6', NT0 \u2192 't61', and others. Wait, NT31 \u2192 't31' which is another string, not sure. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to approach this differently.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string step by step, starting with the start symbol S. Since S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, or S \u2192 NT20 NT25, the string starts with a non-terminal that needs to produce the first symbol of the string, which is `t3`.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is `t3`, a terminal. So the leftmost symbol generated by S must be `t3`. Let's see which production rule of S can generate `t3` in the first position.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28: The first symbol is NT21. I need to see if NT21 can derive `t3`.\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14: The first symbol is NT32. Does NT32 produce a terminal?\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25: The first symbol is NT20. Do any of these produce `t3`?\n\nLooking at NT21's productions, I see NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6, NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0, etc. But does any of these produce `t3`? Let's see all NT21's rules:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT21 has several productions, but none directly produce `t3`. Hmm, so maybe NT21 is not the starting point here.\n\nLet's check NT32's productions. NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20, and looking at the other rules, does NT1 produce a terminal that could lead to `t3`? Or maybe check NT32's rules again. Wait, looking in the grammar, I see NT32 \u2192 NT28 NT18. NT28 is another non-terminal. So if NT32 starts with NT28, then NT28 might produce something else. But the string starts with `t3`, so perhaps this is not the path.\n\nWait, maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So NT32 is the first symbol. Let's see if NT32 can produce `t3` as its first symbol.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT32 is defined in several ways. Let's see:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20\n\nThen NT1 has rules like NT1 \u2192 NT6 NT27, etc., but none produce `t3`. Alternatively, NT32 \u2192 NT28 NT18. NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, and NT3 has some rules.\n\nWait, this might not be direct. Let me check the NT32 rules in the grammar:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT28 NT18\n\nSo NT32's first production leads to NT28 and NT18. Let's see if either of these can produce `t3`.\n\nNow, NT28 has rules: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, which could lead to NT3, which may produce `t3`. Or NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0. Hmm.\n\nLooking further, NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13. NT25 has options like NT5 NT1, but perhaps NT25 could produce `t6`. Hmm, but we need to reach `t3`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach is better. Let's think about which non-terminals produce `t3`. From the grammar, the non-terminals that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't3' (not directly, from the rules above? Wait, no, let me check all the rules again. I think I might have missed some.)\n\nWait, looking through the grammar again, I see:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 NT18 NT28\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT16 NT24\n\n- NT16 \u2192 NT29 NT7\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT2\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT24 NT16\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT32 NT23\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT16 NT24\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT18 NT6\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should list all non-terminals that produce terminals as direct results.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for any rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal:\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT1 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't61'\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't32'\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't16', etc. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't61'\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't32'\n\n- NT12 has two rules: NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0 and NT12 \u2192 NT15 NT3, but not directly 't12'\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for NT3's production:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find that NT33 \u2192 't7' and another rule is NT3 \u2192 't31', but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps NT31 \u2192 't31', so maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct NT3 is in a production where it's applied but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nWait, considering the complexity, maybe it's better to approach this differently. Perhaps the string starts with `t3`, so I need to find a derivation starting with `t3`.\n\nLooking at S's production options:\n\nS can be NT21 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then the first symbol is NT32.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly two symbols on the right. All productions start with the start symbol S, and that's the top of the parse tree.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are:\n1. S -> NT21 NT28\n2. S -> NT32 NT14\n3. S -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with one of these combinations. Therefore, the first token in our string should come from one of these options. Our string starts with t14, which is a terminal. Let's see which productions can produce t14 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking for productions where t14 is derived directly or through a chain:\n\n- S can go to NT32 NT14. Let's look at NT32 and NT14 rules.\n\nNT32's rule is: NT32 -> NT1 NT20. So, NT32 can be expanded further. But wait, the first symbol is t14, so we need to see if t14 can be the leftmost symbol.\n\nWait, the first production is S -> NT32 NT14. So, the first two symbols would be whatever NT32 and NT14 produce. If NT14 is a terminal, then its expansion might contribute to the first symbol. Let's see what NT14 expands to.\n\nLooking up NT14 in the rules: NT14 has several productions, including those that expand into terminals. The rule NT14 -> 't14' is present. So, NT14 can produce t14 directly. Therefore, S -> NT32 NT14 can contribute the string starting with t14 through NT14.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol, and the first symbols are generated by the two parts NT32 and NT14. So, if NT32 and NT14 both produce terminals directly, like NT14 -> 't14', then the string would start with the result of NT32's expansion followed by 't14'.\n\nAlternatively, if NT32 produces a terminal, let's see:\n\nLooking at NT32's rules: NT32 -> NT1 NT20, but NT1 can expand further. However, it might not be possible for NT32 to directly produce a terminal. So maybe S -> NT32 NT14 wouldn't generate a string starting with t14 unless NT32 can produce something that ends with t14.\n\nWait, this seems a bit confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try constructing the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't14', so let's see which non-terminals can produce 't14' directly or indirectly.\n\nFrom the rules, NT14 has a production that directly gives 't14'. So, possible that the first two symbols are part of NT32 and NT14. Let's assume the first production S -> NT32 NT14. So, then the first part is NT32, and the second is NT14, which gives 't14'.\n\nHmm, but this would require NT32 to produce something that starts with a non-terminal that can produce t3, perhaps? Wait, the string is 't14 t3 t6 ...', which means after t14 comes t3.\n\nSo, S -> NT32 NT14 would mean NT32 comes before NT14, and if NT32 is a non-terminal that produces t3, that might match. But wait, do any of the rules for NT32 produce a terminal like t3?\n\nLooking at NT32: NT32 -> NT1 NT20. NT1 can expand, but looking through the rules, NT1's rules all involve other non-terminals. Similarly, NT20 also seems to expand into non-terminals (like NT28, etc.), until eventually, there might be a point where a terminal is produced further down the chain.\n\nWait, but from the rules, there's a rule for NT1: NT1 -> 't27'. So, somewhere in the expansion chain of NT32 or NT14, we might reach a terminal.\n\nLet me start by building the parse tree. The string starts with t14, so let's see which non-terminals can derive t14. From the rules:\n\nNT14 can directly derive 't14' (rule NT14 -> 't14'). So, if NT14 -> 't14', then the second symbol is t14. But in our string, after the first t14 comes t3, t6, etc. So that can't be a direct parse since S -> NT32 NT14 would have NT14 -> 't14' as the second symbol, but our string starts with t14 followed by t3. Therefore, S can't be S -> NT32 NT14 because that would require the second symbol to be t14, not the first.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the order. Wait, in S -> NT32 NT14, that would mean the expansion starts with whatever NT32 produces, then whatever NT14 produces. So, if NT32 can produce a terminal like t3, and NT14 can produce a terminal like 't14', then S -> NT32 NT14 would allow the string to start with t3 t14, but our string starts with t14 t3, which is reversed. Therefore, S can't be S -> NT32 NT14 because the resulting string would have t3 followed by t14 at the beginning, but ours has t14 followed by t3.\n\nWait, so maybe that production isn't the right one. Let's look at the other productions for S.\n\nNext, S -> NT20 NT25. Let's see if either NT20 or NT25 can produce t14.\n\nLooking at NT20's rules: NT20 -> NT29 NT32, which presumably leads to more non-terminals, but I don't see NT20 producing a terminal directly. Wait, looking at NT25: NT25 has a production -> 't54' which is a terminal, but does any NT25 production lead to t14?\n\nWait, the rules for NT25 are: NT25 -> 't77', 't33', 't54', etc. None of these directly give t14. So maybe S -> NT20 NT25 would produce something that starts with NT20, which may produce a terminal like 't54', which is further on in the string, but let's see.\n\nWait, our string starts with t14, so S -> NT20 NT25 would require NT20 to produce t14 and NT25 to produce something else, but looking at NT20's rules, it's unclear if it can produce t14 directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S -> NT21 NT28. Let's check what NT21 and NT28 can derive.\n\nNT21 has a production -> 't8' and others, but does any NT21 produce t14? Looking through the rules, I don't see NT21 -> 't14'.\n\nNT28 has rules like -> 't50' or other paths, but not directly t14.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the correct approach. Let me try to think differently. Since the string starts with t14, let's see which non-terminal can derive t14.\n\nFrom the rules, NT14 can directly derive 't14'. So, if the entire string is a result of S -> NT14 NT... but wait, S is a rule that's either S -> NT21 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, or S -> NT20 NT25. None of these have a single NT14; the S rules only split into two non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, for S -> NT32 NT14 to produce a string starting with 't14', the NT32 would need to derive some sequence, and NT14 would derive t14 as the last symbol. But the string starts with t14, which would require NT32 to produce something ending with t14, followed by NT14 producing t14. That seems impossible because the NT32's part would come before NT14's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the string is entirely generated through the NT32 NT14 production, but NT32 produces the first part, and NT14 produces the rest.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the production S -> NT32 NT14, which would allow the string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is: `t6 t71 t14 t66 t14 t84 t84 t8 t30 t30 t60 t22 t25 t28 t32 t8 t14 t84 t3 t70 t77`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is given in a very long list, and it's in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where A is a terminal. But looking through the rules, I see some look a bit off. For example, some entries like \"NT5 -> 't41'\" might indicate that they're terminal productions. So perhaps the non-terminals generate sequences of terminals through these steps.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminal symbols (t followed by numbers), so I need to see if this string is generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can model the generation process as a series of substitutions, expanding S step by step until we get down to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of this as building a parse tree for the string by decomposing it according to the grammar rules. But given the string is quite long, that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a sequence that can be traced through the grammar. Let's start by looking for the beginning of the string: `t6 t71 t14 t66...`\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that S can produce combinations starting with NT21, NT31, etc. For instance, S \u2192 NT21 NT25, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc. Also, looking at the terminals, for example, 't6' appears in several places, like NT21 -> 't6' NT31, or NT18 -> 't6' NT24, and also NT5 -> 't41', etc.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string, the first token is 't6'. Looking at the rules, 't6' is produced by NT17, which is derived from NT18 and NT24, and NT18 is 't6' NT24, and NT24 is 't22', etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the possible expansion paths. For example, the first part of the string is t6 t71 t14... So 't6' can come from several places. Let's check the rules for 't6' as a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT18 -> 't6' NT24\n- NT6 -> 't68' NT13 ... hmm, no 't6' here.\n- NT24 -> 't22' ... nope.\n- NT26 -> 't28' ... nope.\n- Others look like NT17 is 't14', NT0 is 't61', etc. So the earliest occurrence of 't6' seems to be in NT18, where NT18 produces 't6' followed by NT24.\n\nSo if the first token is 't6', perhaps the initial expansion involves S -> NT18 something, then NT18 -> 't6' NT24, but then we have another 't66', 't14' following. Wait, but in the string, after 't6' comes 't71' then 't14', so the breakdown is: t6, t71, t14, t66, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the parse from the end, using the given string and working backward or something. Alternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from the start.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of possible steps using the grammar. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't6', which is a terminal. So looking at the grammar, where can 't6' appear?\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't6' is used in:\n\n- NT18 -> 't6' NT24\n- NT24 -> 't22' ... but no 't6' here.\n- NT26 -> 't28' ... no.\n- NT5 -> 't41' ... no.\n- Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT18 -> 't6' NT24\n- NT6 -> 't68' NT13\n- NT7 -> 't3' NT18\n- NT16 -> 't18' NT6\n\nSo 't6' is directly produced by NT18.\n\nThen, the next token is 't71'. Looking for where 't71' is produced. Looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> 't71'\n- NT21 -> 't71' NT26\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n\nSo 't71' is produced by NT0 and NT21 and NT15. Let me check what's after 't71' in the string: 't14', which is a token after 't71'.\n\nSo the tokens after 't6' are: t71 t14 t66 t14 t84 t84 t8 t30 t30 t60 t22 t25 t28 t32 t8 t14 t84 t3 t70 t77.\n\nSo after 't6', the next is 't71' (which could be from NT0, NT21, or NT15), followed by 't14' (produced by NT14, for example, but looking in grammar, Nt14 is in some rules).\n\nWait, looking for 't14' as a terminal: the grammar has:\n\n- NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n- But also, looking through other rules, I can't spot where 't14' is directly a terminal. Wait, checking again, maybe I missed it. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, actually, the user provided the grammar and the string, but the grammar includes several entries where NT14 is replaced with something, but no production for NT14 being a terminal. Perhaps that suggests that 't14' is from some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's check again the grammar: looking at all the entries, I see that NT14 is in rules like S->NT32 NT14, so possibly NT14 is a non-terminal and doesn't directly produce a terminal, unless it's in another rule.\n\nWait, no. Let me relook through the grammar entries:\n\nLooking for any rule where NT14 is a terminal:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list. Let me check again:\n\nI see NT14 -> NT34 NT1, NT14 -> 't65' because in the following rules:\n\nLooking, for example:\n\n- NT34 -> 't14'\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT1\n- etc.\n\nAh, no, looking more carefully, I don't see any direct terminal for NT14. Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe 't14' comes from another non-terminal's expansion. Let me think: 't14' is in the string, so perhaps the production is something like NT34 producing 't14', or other. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see several instances where a terminal is written, which indicates a terminal production. For example:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT12 -> 't14'\n- Also, NT7 -> 't3', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT17 directly produces 't14'. So perhaps one of the non-terminals is NT17.\n\nWait, let's recap: Starting with the entire string being a sequence starting with 't6 t71 t14 t66 t14 t84 t84 t8 ... etc.\n\nSo the first step is 't6', which is produced by NT18.\n\nThen, after 't6', it's 't71', which is produced by, say, NT0, which is a non-terminal.\n\nBut to produce 't71', NT0 could be from S as well, because S can produce NT32 NT14 or others.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated, so maybe I should model it step by step, starting from the entire string and working backward to see if it can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nSo the string is:\n\nt6 t71 t14 t66 t14 t84 t84 t8 t30 t30 t60 t22 t25 t28 t32 t8 t14 t84 t3 t70 t77\n\nWe can"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar has production rules starting from S and several other non-terminals (NT). The string to check is a sequence of terminal symbols, some of which are 't' followed by numbers. \n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals have productions that lead to terminal symbols. For example, NT17 -> 't14', which is a terminal. Similarly, other non-terminals resolve to various 't' symbols. \n\nThe string is: t71 t30 t71 t14 t84 t49 t25 t69 t8 t30 t38 t14 t71 t14 t75 t68 t49 t36 t40 t6 t12.\n\nI notice that 't71' appears multiple times. From the grammar, I see that NT0 -> 't61' and NT15 -> 't71'. Also, looking at the productions, NT10 -> 't32' and NT15 can be derived from NT31 (NT31 -> NT25 NT13; NT25 -> 't34' and NT13 -> 't12', combining as 't34 t12'). Wait, no, that doesn't give 't71'. Let me correct that: NT15 has a production NT15 -> NT21 NT23, and NT21 -> 't8' (from NT18 -> 't8'). NT23 has a production NT23 -> 't30' (from NT22 -> 't30'). So 't8 t30' is one possible string for NT15. Similarly, NT31 -> 't25' ('t31 is 't25'). \n\nWait, another way: Looking for where 't71' comes from. NT15 can become 't71' if NT15 -> 't71' (from the rule NT15 -> 't71' in the list). So starting from S, which is NT21 NT28. NT21 produces 't8' and 't71' (if we go via some path). Wait, let me try breaking down the string.\n\nThe string starts with t71. How can I get t71?\n\nFrom the grammar, NT31 -> 't25' and NT31 can also come from NT25 (which goes to 't34' and something else). Alternatively, NT15 -> 't71' directly. So to get t71, maybe the start can go through NT15.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can be NT21 NT28.\n\nNT21 has a production NT21 -> NT26 NT6 or NT21 -> NT6 NT0. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose NT21 -> NT26 NT6, then NT26 -> NT28 NT22 (as per NT26's production). Then NT28 -> 't50' (from NT28 -> 't50') and\/or other options. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a path that leads to t71.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another approach: parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me list the string as a list of tokens: ['t71', 't30', 't71', 't14', 't84', 't49', 't25', 't69', 't8', 't30', 't38', 't14', 't71', 't14', 't75', 't68', 't49', 't36', 't40', 't6', 't12'].\n\nI need to find a way to derive this string from S. Let's see.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nAssume NT21 produces some part of the string. Let's see: looking at the first token 't71'. How can NT21 derive to include 't71'?\n\nLooking at NT21's productions:\n\nNT21 can go to NT26 NT6 or NT21 can go to NT6 NT0.\n\nWait, let me check the options:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT21 has multiple productions:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\n\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nWait, earlier in the list, it's written as:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\n\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT21 entries:\n\n\"NT21 -> NT26 NT6\"\n\n\"NT21 -> NT6 NT0\"\n\nWait, no, earlier I think the list shows:\n\n\"NT21 -> NT26 NT6\"\n\n\"NT21 -> NT6 NT0\"\n\nSo, NT21 can be broken into two paths. Each of these can lead to different things.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t71, perhaps we need to see if either of these paths can lead to a t71.\n\nLooking at the first step: S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nSuppose NT21 is broken into NT26 NT6, and NT28 is something else.\n\nWait, or perhaps it's better to try to parse the string.\n\nLet me attempt to split the string into chunks that match the grammar.\n\nThe first token is t71. Let me see which non-terminals can derive to t71.\n\nFrom the grammar, looking for any production that results in t71. \n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n\n- NT15 -> NT21 NT23, which could produce a string that includes t71 if either NT21 or NT23 does.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be built by starting with S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nWait, but let's try breaking down t71. If t71 comes from NT15 -> 't71', then somewhere in the derivation, S must produce something that includes NT15.\n\nBut S is NT21 NT28.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with t71 because of NT21 or NT28.\n\nLooking at NT21: NT21 can derive to t71? Let me check the productions for NT21.\n\nNo, NT21's productions are terminals and other non-terminals. It doesn't directly produce t71. The only NT that directly produces t71 is NT15.\n\nSo, to get t71, I need to have a NT15 in the derivation.\n\nSimilarly, NT15 can be obtained via NT15 -> NT21 NT23. NT21 might produce t71 via some path.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think in terms of the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the entire string can be reduced to the start using the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to simulate a parsing process.\n\nAnother approach: see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string is 20 tokens long. Let's see if it can be split into non-terminals that can produce these tokens.\n\nLet me start by looking for the first token, t71.\n\nWhich NT can produce t71? Only NT15 and NT31: wait, looking at the grammar, NT31's production includes t25 (from NT31 -> NT25 NT13; but NT25 can be 't34' or something else, perhaps leading to t25 NT13 which might not give t71.\n\nAlternatively, looking again: \n\nLooking through the list of productions, I see that:\n\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n\n- NT22 has a production to 't30'\n\nBut none seem to directly produce 't71' except NT15. So to produce the first token, the parser must have derived an NT15 that directly gives 't71'.\n\nBut S can't directly give NT15, it can only give NT21 and NT28. So how can we get NT15 to be part of S's derivation?\n\nWait, no. S is NT21 NT28. So each of these can be replaced by their own rules. So, S can be rewritten as NT21 NT28, each of which is a non-terminal. These non-terminals can be expanded into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps one of NT21 or NT28 can produce a sequence that starts with 't71'.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n\nLooking at NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT22\n\nAnd NT28 \u2192 't50' or other options, but 't71' is not directly produced by NT26 or NT28"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-410","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user has provided a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it belongs to the language generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that a Chomsky normal form grammar has production rules where each non-terminal is rewritten as two non-terminals or a terminal. That makes parsing easier, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the rules produce two non-terminals, except some produce terminals like 't14', 't6', etc. My first thought is that each terminal in the provided string must be matched by either a direct production or generated through some chain of productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t28 t14 t70 t70 t66 t68 t68 t71 t14 t14 t71 t60 t14 t71 t28 t54 t30 t30 t14 t17 t70 t84`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S producing combinations like NT2 NT28, NT32 NT14, etc. So, each production from S results in two symbols.\n\nSince the string has 21 tokens, each move from S would double the number of symbols, but that might not be the case because some symbols might be terminals. However, it's complicated because the grammar's structure might allow for certain sequences.\n\nLet me try to see if each terminal in the string is directly produced by some rule. For example, looking at the rules, 't14' is produced by NT14 in a few places, like NT14 -> NT34 NT7 and NT14 -> NT15 NT7. Also, 't28' is produced by NT28 -> NT11 NT3, and 't70' is produced by NT18 -> NT70 NT7. Wait, no, in the rules, I see 't70' isn't directly produced. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, 't70' isn't directly produced. Hmm, that could be an issue. Wait, let me re-examine. I see:\n\nLooking at NT18 -> NT26 NT6, and NT6 has some rules. Let me check NT6: NT6 -> NT10 NT31, NT31 -> NT25 NT13, and NT13 -> NT10 NT21, etc. I might be going too deep here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach this differently. The string starts with t28, which I see is produced by NT28: NT28 -> NT11 NT3. Then, t14 is produced by NT14, but the grammar has NT14 -> NT34 NT7, and NT14 -> NT15 NT7. Also, NT34 can produce 't30', 't14', etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should build a tree. Starting from S, which can produce NT28 NT2, etc. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t28. So, perhaps the first production is S -> NT28 NT2. Then, the next symbol is t14. So, looking at NT2, what's the production? NT2 -> NT15 NT18. Hmm, then t14 is the next symbol, which would come from NT18. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production is S -> NT2 NT23, but that would produce 't54' and something else. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for each 't' in the string and see if they can be generated directly from some non-terminal. Let's list the 't's:\n\nt28, t14, t70, t70, t66, t68, t68, t71, t14, t14, t71, t60, t14, t71, t28, t54, t30, t30, t14, t17, t70, t84.\n\nWait, 't66' is one of the terminals. Looking through the rules, I don't see 't66' being directly produced. Wait, let me search the rules. I see 't30' is produced by NT30: looking at where NT32 is, it's produced by NT11 NT3, and NT3 can produce t7. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT18 -> 't66' when NT18 -> 't66' NT2. So 't66' is produced by NT18.\n\nSo, in the string, when we have t66, that must be generated by NT18. Let me try to map this.\n\nBut this is getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps using a CYK parser approach would help, but given the time, maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the last token: 't84', which is produced by NT15 -> 't68' NT2, and NT2 produces NT15 NT18. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the string contains t66, which isn't directly produced by any of the initial S productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at S's productions, none of them produce 't66' directly. The initial productions of S are combinations of non-terminals, so to get a 't', that non-terminal must eventually produce a terminal symbol. \n\nBut in the given grammar, most non-terminals are terminals, except for the initial S which branches into pairs of non-terminals. For example, the first production is S -> NT2 NT28. Then, NT2 and NT28 have further productions, which might produce terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string provided, we have 't66', which needs to be generated by some rule. Looking through the grammar, I see that 't66' is produced by NT18 -> 't66' NT2. So, to have 't66' in the string, there must be a derivation where NT18 is expanded to 't66' and another symbol.\n\nBut wait, let's see if 't66' is present anywhere else. Only NT18 can produce 't66'. So, if 't66' is in the string, then the grammar must have derived from it. Therefore, 't66' must come from a chain: NT18 -> 't66' NT2, and then NT2 must be expanded into something. \n\nLooking at NT2's productions: NT2 -> NT15 NT18. So, if NT2 is followed by NT15 NT18, which can then produce more symbols.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t66 comes t68, then t68, etc. So, perhaps the derivation has to include 't66' followed by 't68'.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to outline a possible parsing sequence.\n\nStarting with S, it can produce combinations like NT28 NT2. So, the first step could be S -> NT28 NT2. Then, NT28 -> NT11 NT3, and NT2 -> NT15 NT18.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t28, which is produced by NT28. So, if the first symbol is t28, it must come from a production of NT28. Looking at the rules, NT28 can be NT11 NT3 or something else? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, the user provided the grammar and the string. Let me recount the initial rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, S's first production is S -> NT2 NT28. Then, NT28 -> NT11 NT3. So, if the string starts with t28, that would correspond to NT28 -> 't28' NT2.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT28 is only being used in two places: NT28 -> NT11 NT3 and NT28 -> NT5 NT32? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT28 has two productions: NT28 -> NT11 NT3 and NT28 -> NT32 NT18. Wait, no, let me look:\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier. Let me recount.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n\n- NT17 -> NT16 NT19\n\nLooking again, I see: \n- NT3 -> NT20 NT13\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n- NT2 -> NT15 NT18\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.

The string in question is `t6 t22 t38 t77 t43 t6 t23 t40 t56 t23 t38 t40 t75 t6 t43 t77 t84 t71 t66 t50 t28 t84`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the approach to solving this. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or terminals. But looking at the provided grammar, I notice that some rules have two terminals. Wait, no, many of them have two non-terminals, which fits CNF. However, some rules like NT21 -> NT25 NT13 are in CNF because they have two non-terminals. But some other rules, like NT5 -> 't28', have a terminal and maybe a newline or something? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT5 -> 't41', which suggests that some non-terminals are generating terminals directly. So perhaps the grammar is in a mix, but since it's supposed to be in CNF, maybe each non-terminal expands to two non-terminals or terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. But the key point is that in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So perhaps some of these rules have two terminals on the right side, which might complicate things.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT5 -> 't41', which is a terminal, so that's allowed as a production in CNF. So the rules can have either two non-terminals or one terminal. That means each production is in the form A -> X Y or A -> a, where X and Y are non-terminals, or a is a terminal.\n\nNow, the problem is to parse the given string using this grammar. The string consists of a sequence of tokens (t6, t22, etc.), which correspond to terminals in the grammar. The question is whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar uses leftmost derivation and is in CNF, the parsing can be done using the CYK algorithm, but since I might not remember that right now, perhaps a better approach is to check if each token can be generated by the grammar by tracing back possible derivations.\n\nBut considering the size of the string, 21 tokens, and the complexity of the grammar, it might be better to see if I can map the tokens to the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in a CFG in CNF, the string must be a sequence of terminals generated by leftmost productions, with each step expanding non-terminals into other non-terminals until the terminals are reached.\n\nSo, to check if the string is in the language, I can try to find a derivation path that matches the string.\n\nLet me try to see which non-terminals generate which terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several rules where non-terminals produce a single terminal:\n\nFor example:\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT12 -> 't14'\n- NT3 -> 't12'\n- NT33 -> 't49'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT14 -> 't51'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't71'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't70'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT34 -> 't14'\n- NT7 -> 't84'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT12 -> 't14'\n- NT3 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't10'\n- NT19 -> 't25'\n- NT33 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't28'\n- NT33 -> 't60'\n- NT15 -> 't34'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- NT14 -> 't84'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT21 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT23 -> 't56'\n- NT13 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n- NT19 -> 't22'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT11 -> 't14'\n\nLooking at some of these, I can see that each terminal corresponds to a specific string:\n\n- 't6' could come from NT7 (since NT7 -> 't3')... Wait, no. Wait, looking back, I see NT7 -> 't3', which is 't3' not 't6'. Hmm. Or perhaps, some other non-terminals may produce 't6'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT26 -> 't6' (since NT26 -> NT9 NT2, but that's not terminal; wait, no, looking again, NT26->'t71' is not correct. Wait, looking back, I see NT26 -> 't28' from another rule, but I'm getting confused. Wait, maybe I should list all the non-terminals and their direct terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me go through each rule and see which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking through each production, here's a list of non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41' (but the string doesn't have 't41', so maybe that's not used)\n- NT17 -> 't14' (string has multiple 't14's)\n- NT0 -> 't61' (the string doesn't have that)\n- NT10 -> 't32' (string has 't32')\n- NT24 -> 't71' (string has 't71')\n- NT25 -> 't77' (string has 't77')\n- NT12 -> 't16' (string has 't16')\n- NT12 -> 't14' (string has multiple 't14's)\n- NT3 -> 't12' (the string doesn't have that)\n- NT33 -> 't49' (string has 't49')\n- NT14 -> 't65' (string doesn't have that)\n- NT6 -> 't68' (string has 't68'? No, the string has 't6').\nWait, in the string, the first token is 't6', but looking at the rules, no non-terminal directly produces 't6'. So that's a problem. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because in the grammar, NT13 -> 't6' (since looking back, one of the rules is NT13 -> 't6'). Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see rules like:\n\n- NT13 -> NT10 NT21\n- NT16 -> NT18 NT6\n- NT18 -> NT27 NT1\n- NT26 -> NT18 NT9\n- NT7 -> NT27 NT1\n- NT18 -> NT7 NT24\n- NT8 -> NT27 NT6\n- NT17 -> NT16 NT19\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through the rules again to find which non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT28 -> 't50' (string has 't50')\n- NT7 -> 't3' (doesn't match 't6')\n- NT13 -> 't6' (does this exist?)\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I think I might have missed one.

{"custom_id":"request-432","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t14 t70 t28 t14 t30 t70 t36 t71 t30 t14 t14 t60 t69 t22 t60 t22 t66 t54 t50 t41 t41 t41 t70`, and the grammar is quite extensive with a bunch of rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols. However, in this case, I notice that some rules have terminals on the right-hand side, like `NT5 -> 't41'`. So, this grammar isn't exactly in strict CNF because some productions have terminal symbols on the right side. But I think it's still acceptable because in some variants, productions can have one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate consists of 21 tokens, all of which are terminal symbols (they end with 't' followed by digits). My approach is to try to parse the string step by step using the given rules, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has three productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nI'll start by choosing one of these. Let's pick S \u2192 NT21 NT28 because I see that the string starts with t14, which could be derived from NT14.\n\nNT21 has the production NT21 \u2192 NT8 NT34. So, the first production for NT21 is two non-terminals. Then, NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3. So, the second part is also two non-terminals.\n\nNow, breaking down NT8 and NT11:\n- NT8 has two options: NT8 \u2192 NT16 NT23 or NT8 \u2192 NT16 NT19 or NT8 \u2192 NT8 NT11. Hmm. Let's pick NT8 \u2192 NT16 NT23 first.\n- NT11 has productions: NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13 or NT11 \u2192 NT18 NT16.\n\nLet's go with NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13.\n\nNow, NT25 \u2192 NT5 NT1. So, NT25 is split into NT5 and NT1.\n\nNT5 \u2192 't41' directly. So that resolves NT5 to t41.\n\nNT1 has the production NT1 \u2192 NT29 NT14. So, we need to resolve NT29 and NT14.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT27 NT22. NT27 can produce either NT11 or NT18. Let's choose NT27 \u2192 NT11 NT18.\n\nSo now, NT27 is NT11 (which we already have) and NT18. NT18 has a production NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT0. So, NT18 becomes NT20 and NT0.\n\nNow, looking at NT20: NT20 has a production NT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32. NT29 \u2192 NT27 NT22, which we've already done. So let's get back.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, and I might be going into a loop. Maybe I should try a different approach. Instead of starting with S \u2192 NT21 NT28, perhaps I should look for terminals in the string and see if they can match the productions.\n\nWait, another approach is to build a parse tree step by step using the string, starting from the left and right, trying to match the production rules.\n\nLet me write down the string:\n\nt14 t70 t28 t14 t30 t70 t36 t71 t30 t14 t14 t60 t69 t22 t60 t22 t66 t54 t50 t41 t41 t41 t70\n\nWait, no, actually, the string is correct as given. Let me list them:\n\n1. t14\n2. t70\n3. t28\n4. t14\n5. t30\n6. t70\n7. t36\n8. t71\n9. t30\n10. t14\n11. t14\n12. t60\n13. t69\n14. t22\n15. t60\n16. t22\n17. t66\n18. t54\n19. t50\n20. t41\n21. t41\n22. t41\n23. t70\n\nWait, no, wait, the string has 23 tokens. Wait, let me count:\n\nThe string provided is: `t14 t70 t28 t14 t30 t70 t36 t71 t30 t14 t14 t60 t69 t22 t60 t22 t66 t54 t50 t41 t41 t41 t70`\n\nYes, that's 23 tokens. I think I miscounted earlier.\n\nSo, I need to make sure I process each token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the recursive descent parsing method would be more feasible, but since this is a thought process, I'll try to simulate it.\n\nLet me start by looking for possible productions that can produce the first token, t14.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t14?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT14 can be 't65' or 't51' or 't84' or 't6' or 't14' or 't34' or 't41' or 't16' etc. Wait, specific rules:\n\nLooking through the productions for NT14:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't65'\n- NT14 \u2192 't51'\n- NT14 \u2192 't84'\n- NT14 \u2192 't6' (like when NT14 is derived from NT21 \u2192 NT8 NT34 \u2192 't16'?)\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the rules for NT14:\n\nLooking back, the NT14 rules are:\n- NT14 \u2192 't65'\n- NT14 \u2192 't51'\n- NT14 \u2192 't84'\n- NT14 \u2192 't6' (probably not, looking back: looking for NT14 producing a terminal)\nWait, let me check the full productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT14: 't65' (from NT34 \u2192 't30' or NT14 \u2192 't65')? Wait, looking at each rule:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, specific to NT14:\n\nLooking line by line, find NT14 \u2192 ...\n\n- NT14: 't65' (line: find NT14 \u2192 't65')\n- NT14: 't51' (another NT14 \u2192 't51')\n- NT14: 't84' (found in NT33 \u2192 't49' and others, wait: looking at the lines, in NT33 \u2192 't49' perhaps not. Alternatively, looking through each line, in lines like \"NT12 -> NT4 NT0\", so maybe not.\n\nWait, I think I should methodically check each production rule for NT14.\n\nLooking through each rule in the grammar:\n\n- Line: \"NT33 -> 't33 NT19'\" no.\n- \"NT22 -> NT29 NT2\"\n- \"NT13 -> NT10 NT21\"\n- \"NT21 -> NT26 NT6\"\n- \"NT21 -> NT6 NT0\"\n- \"NT2 -> NT15 NT18\"\n- \"NT11 -> NT25 NT13\"\n- \"NT10 -> NT33 NT24\"\n- \"NT28 -> NT11 NT3\"\n- \"NT5 -> 't41'\"\n- \"NT17 -> 't14'\"\n- \"NT0 -> 't61'\"\n- \"NT15 -> 't71'\"\n- \"NT0 -> 't11'\"\n- \"NT10 -> 't32'\"\n- \"NT16 -> 't6'\"\n- \"NT7 -> 't3'\"\n- \"NT18 -> 't66'\"\n- \"NT0 -> 't17'\"\n- \"NT26 -> 't28'\"\n- \"NT18 -> 't41'\"\n- \"NT3 -> 't31'\"\n- \"NT14 -> 't65'\"\n- \"NT3 -> 't7'\"\n- \"NT6 -> 't68'\"\n- \"NT13 -> 't6'\"\n- \"NT24 -> 't22'\"\n- \"NT14"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This structure helps in generating strings where each production step doubles the number of symbols, leading to a length that's a power of two. But wait, in this case, the given string doesn't seem to have an exponential length, but maybe that's not directly the issue here.\n\nLooking at the string, it contains a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols in the string should be a power of two. The string has 24 tokens here. Let me count: 24. Is 24 a power of two? 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. So 24 is between these, meaning it's not a power of two. \n\nIf that's the case, the string might not be possible because each production step in a CNF grammar doubles the number of symbols. So starting from a single non-terminal, after one step, we have two symbols. After two steps, four, and so on. Therefore, the total length should be 2^n, like 2,4,8,16,32 etc. \n\nIn this case, the input string has 24 symbols, which isn't a power of two. So that would mean it's impossible for such a string to be generated by the grammar, regardless of the specific productions. \n\nHowever, to be thorough, maybe I should check if the last token is compatible. The last token is `t14`, which is the production of NT14 -> 't14'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT14 has a production that generates 't14'. \n\nBut that's just the last token. The main issue is the total length not being a power of two.

{"custom_id":"request-455","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with determining whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t52 t50 t84 t3 t34 t70 t22 t3 t34 t41 t6 t3 t23 t32 t84 t23 t71 t3 t22 t8 t31 t70 t6 t3`. That's quite a long string, so I'll need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, I recall that context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have production rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. In this grammar, I notice that each production is of the form NT(n) \u2192 NT(m) NT(p) or sometimes directly to a terminal. For example, some rules start with NT(n) \u2192 NT(m) NT(p), others like NT3 -> t3, which is a terminal production.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals starting with t52 and ending with t3. My goal is to see if this string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking at the production that starts with S. The grammar has three main initial productions for S:\n- S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nI need to see if any of these can lead to the given string. Let's break down the string into parts and see if these initial S productions can generate parts of it.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t52. Let's check if any of the non-terminals derived from S can produce t52. From the productions, I see:\n\nLooking at NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27, and NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT2, and NT27 can lead to NT22 or other productions. Hmm, not sure if that leads directly to t52.\n\nWait, let's look at NT21: NT21 can produce t8 (as per NT21 \u2192 t8). Also, NT21 has productions like \u2192 NT26 NT6 or \u2192 NT6 NT0. But t52 is a terminal. Let me check which non-terminals derive t52. Looking through the productions, I see NT13 \u2192 t12, NT15 \u2192 t6, NT22 \u2192 t8, NT23 \u2192 t43? Wait, no, looking more carefully: NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27, but I don't see t52 as a terminal from NT23. Wait, looking back at the productions, in the list, I see NT23 \u2192 t71? No, not directly. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the productions provided. The user provided a long list; I need to find if any non-terminal directly produces t52.\n\nLooking through the list, I can see lines like:\n- NT34 \u2192 t34\n- NT17 \u2192 t14\n- NT0 \u2192 t61\n- NT15 \u2192 t71\n- NT10 \u2192 t32\n- NT16 \u2192 t6\n- NT7 \u2192 t3\n- NT18 \u2192 t66\n- NT0 \u2192 t17\n- NT26 \u2192 t28\n- NT18 \u2192 t41\n- NT3 \u2192 t31\n- NT14 \u2192 t65\n- NT3 \u2192 t7\n- NT6 \u2192 t68\n- NT13 \u2192 t6\n- NT24 \u2192 t22\n- NT14 \u2192 t51\n- NT10 \u2192 t0\n- NT28 \u2192 t50\n- NT5 \u2192 t41\n- NT25 \u2192 t77\n- NT15 \u2192 t6\n- NT23 \u2192 t43\n- NT21 \u2192 t8\n- NT26 \u2192 t71\n- NT18 \u2192 t36\n- NT11 \u2192 t6\n- NT18 \u2192 t70\n- NT34 \u2192 t30\n- NT34 \u2192 t14\n- NT7 \u2192 t84\n- NT12 \u2192 t16\n- NT12 \u2192 t14\n- NT3 \u2192 t12\n- NT16 \u2192 t10\n- NT19 \u2192 t25\n- NT33 \u2192 t49\n- NT15 \u2192 t28\n- NT33 \u2192 t60\n- NT15 \u2192 t34\n- NT24 \u2192 t71\n- NT14 \u2192 t84\n- NT32 \u2192 t54\n- NT21 \u2192 t77\n- NT15 \u2192 t68\n- NT23 \u2192 t52\n\nAh! I see now. Looking at NT23 \u2192 t52. Yes, there's a production NT23 \u2192 t52. Great, that's useful. So NT23 can directly produce t52. Similarly, NT21 can produce t8, and NT28 can produce t50, etc. So perhaps the string starts with t52 being produced by NT23, which has other rules.\n\nWait, but looking at the initial productions, S's first option is S \u2192 NT21 NT28. So S \u2192 NT21 \u2192 t8 and NT28 \u2192 t50. So S would produce t8 t50 immediately. But our string starts with t52, so that can't come from S's first option.\n\nAlternatively, S's second option is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Let's check what NT32 and NT14 can produce.\n\nLooking for NT32: From the list, NT32 \u2192 t54 (from NT32 \u2192 t54). So NT32 produces t54. But our string starts with t52, so that can't be it either.\n\nThird initial production: S \u2192 NT20 NT25. Let's check what NT20 and NT25 can produce.\n\nNT20 \u2192 t29 NT3, but wait, in the list, NT20 \u2192 t29 NT3, but not directly t29. Wait, maybe I should trace further. \n\nLooking more carefully, NT20 can produce t29 NT3. Then, NT29 can produce t7 NT2. NT7 produces t3. So NT20 can produce t29 t7 t3, but that's three steps. Alternatively, NT29 \u2192 t7 NT2, and NT2 \u2192 ... Let's see, NT2 has several productions. For example, NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18, which then can break down further.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me look back at the string.\n\nThe string is: t52 t50 t84 t3 t34 t70 t22 t3 t34 t41 t6 t3 t23 t32 t84 t23 t71 t3 t22 t8 t31 t70 t6 t3.\n\nStarting with t52, so that must come from NT23 \u2192 t52. Then the next term is t50, which comes from NT28. But S's options for S require NT21 NT28 or other non-terminals that can generate t52 and t50? Wait, no, because S \u2192 NT21 NT28 would produce t8 t50, which starts with t8, but our string starts with t52 t50. So that can't be it.\n\nWait, unless NT23 is inside S somehow. Let me think: S \u2192 NT21 NT28 \u2192 t8 t50, which starts with t8 t50, but our string starts with t52 t50. So that can't match the initial S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which we saw starts with t54, but the string starts with t52, so that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the string is longer, and the initial part doesn't have to be generated directly by S, but perhaps part of a larger derivation. For example, perhaps S \u2192 NT23 ... which then breaks down into more parts.\n\nWait, but according to the initial productions, S only generates two non-terminals. So the entire string must ultimately be a sequence of terminals generated by the non-terminals in the initial productions of S and their expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of multiple expansions of the same S production, but that doesn't seem likely because S's production is fixed as two non-terminals each time.\n\nWait, but let's consider that perhaps the S is rewritten via multiple steps, so the string could be the concatenation of multiple steps, but the initial expansion would be two non-terminals, each of which can expand further until terminals are reached.\n\nSo perhaps the string is the result of expanding S in multiple steps, each time breaking down the non-terminals into their components.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with a part derived from S \u2192 NT23 NT22,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-474","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t14 t6 t71 t30 t70 t66 t71 t30 t14 t14 t23 t30 t17 t8 t14 t30 t8 t32 t66 t54 t0 t11 t66 t28 t66`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have productions where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is a binary split. The given grammar has several non-terminals (like S, NT21, NT31, etc.) and terminals (like t14, t6, etc.).\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the given CFG seems to have three initial productions:\n- S -> NT21 NT28\n- S -> NT32 NT14\n- S -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo the first step is to see which of these can generate the given string. Let's look at the string structure. The string starts with t14, t6, etc., so I need to see if any of the initial productions can lead to this.\n\nLooking at the first production S -> NT21 NT28. NT21 and NT28 are non-terminals. I need to see their productions.\n\nNT21 has productions:\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT6\n- NT21 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT6\n- NT21 -> NT18 NT26\n- NT21 -> NT19 NT26\n\nLet's see if any of these can lead to t14 at the beginning. Looking at NT21's productions, none of them directly produce a terminal string with t14 except the initial production is something else. Hmm, maybe I should look at the other initial productions.\n\nS -> NT32 NT14. NT32 is a non-terminal, and NT14 can produce t65 or t84, but in the given string, the first two terminals are t14 and t6, which don't match.\n\nWait, looking back, S cannot directly produce t14 because S is a non-terminal and the first terminal in the string is t14. So the first production is S -> NT32 NT14, which would produce two non-terminals. So the string must be generated by expanding S into NT32 and NT14, then each of those into terminals.\n\nLooking at NT32, the production is NT32 -> NT1 NT20. NT1 might be a non-terminal that can produce t31? Or looking into the productions, NT1 has a production -> NT29 NT14. NT14 in the initial productions can become t65 or t84, but in our string, after t14, we have t6. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace the string step by step, simulating the parse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another initial production. Let me check the other initial productions for S.\n\nAnother initial production is S -> NT20 NT25. NT20's production is NT20 -> NT29 NT32. NT25 -> NT5 NT13 or others.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t14, and to get t14, maybe one of the non-terminals that can produce t14? Let's look in the grammar for terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT14 has productions:\n- NT14 -> NT65\n- NT14 -> NT84\nBut also, perhaps other NT14s? Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT14 -> t65, NT14 -> t84, but I also see other NT14s being transformed, perhaps.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for t14: I see NT5 -> 't41', NT17 -> 't14', NT1 -> 't6', NT21 -> 't14', etc. Looking for any production that results in 't14' as a terminal. \n\nWait, I see NT21 has a production NT21 -> 't14'. Let me check that. In the grammar, under NT21, indeed there's a production: NT21 -> 't14'. So if we have NT21, it can directly produce a 't14' terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 is another non-terminal that can produce 't14'. And wait, S has a production S -> NT17 NT28. But looking at the initial productions of S, no, the initial productions are S -> NT21 NT28, S -> NT32 NT14, and S -> NT20 NT25.\n\nWait, but looking through the entire grammar, it seems that NT17 can become 't14'. So if we have NT17, we can get 't14'. Similarly, NT21 can produce 't14'.\n\nSo, in the given string, the first part is 't14 t6 t71...'. So to get 't14', the first step could be that S is expanded into NT21 NT28, and then NT21 becomes 't14', then the next symbols are t6, t71, etc.\n\nLet me try to see how the string could be generated step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with 't14', which can be produced by NT21.\n\n2. The remaining string after 't14' is 't6 t71 t30 t70 t66 t71 t30 t14 t14 t23 t30 t17 t8 t14 t30 t8 t32 t66 t54 t0 t11 t66 t28 t66'\n\nBut how does that proceed? Since S starts as NT21 NT28, then expanding NT21 as 't14', the first terminal is 't14'. Then, the next symbols must come from the NT28 side.\n\nWait, no. The initial expansion is S -> NT21 NT28. So the first two symbols come from NT21 and NT28. Or depending on the expansion order.\n\nWait, S is NT21 NT28. So the first terminal from NT21 can be 't14'. Then the next part comes from NT28.\n\nSo after 't14' from NT21, the next part is the NT28 expansion.\n\nLooking at NT28's possible productions. In the grammar, NT28 can be:\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n- NT28 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT28 -> NT5 NT10\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT0\n- etc.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar. Looking for NT28:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT28, I see: NT28 -> NT11 NT3 and NT28 -> NT8 NT6 and other productions, but none directly produce t14. Instead, NT28 can be split into two non-terminals.\n\nSo the next symbols after 't14' would start with the expansion of NT28.\n\nLooking at the given string, after 't14' comes 't6', which is in our case the first symbol after. So perhaps, the first t6 comes from some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me try to plan this step by step.\n\nWe have S -> NT21 NT28.\n\nNT21 can be expanded as 't14', giving us the first 't14'.\n\nThen, the next part comes from NT28, which needs to generate 't6' as the next symbol.\n\nLooking at NT28's productions:\n\nNT28 can be:\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n- NT28 -> NT8 NT6\n\nAh, here's a possibility. NT28 can expand into NT8 and NT6. NT6 can be a non-terminal that produces 't6' or other terminals.\n\nLooking into NT6's productions: NT6 is in several productions, like NT6 -> NT10 NT31, NT6 -> NT5 NT20, NT6 -> NT29 NT10, NT6 -> NT31 NT7, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way for NT8 to produce 't6'. Looking at the grammar, under NT8, there's NT8 -> 't6' and NT8 -> 't14' perhaps?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nUnder NT8, there are a few productions:\nNT8 -> nt27 => check, wait, in the grammar, the productions for NT8 are:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT8:\n\nWait, let me look.\n\nThe grammar lines with 't' seem to be in the last part:\n\nLooking again, yes, in the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT8, I see in the grammar:\n\nNT8 -> 't27"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-469","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it simplifies certain parsing methods, but for determining string generation, I can analyze it by trying to derive the string step by step or see if each component follows the rules.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The starting symbol is S, and from the rules, I can see that S can produce various combinations involving NT2, NT3, etc. Each rule seems to be of the form NT X \u2192 NT Y1 Y2, where Y1 and Y2 are other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: `t28 t30 t66 t71 t30 t28 t84 t8 t22 t68 t50 t8 t30 t28 t30 t36 t22 t23 t52 t70 t41 t56 t54 t84 t71`. This looks like a sequence of symbols, some of which are terminals (like t28, t30) and others are non-terminals or other symbols.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So each non-terminal must expand to two symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. The string to evaluate consists of terminals, so I need to see if each t (like t28) can be generated by a non-terminal.\n\nLet me look for rules that produce terminals. Looking through the grammar, many rules have terminals on the right-hand side, such as NT5 \u2192 't41', NT17 \u2192 't14', etc. So each of these non-terminals can produce a specific terminal. \n\nSo, to check if the string is generated, each symbol in the string must correspond to a production starting with a non-terminal that can generate that symbol. For example, the first symbol is t28. I need to check if there's a rule where some non-terminal can produce t28.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT32 can produce t2 from NT29 NT18, but I don't see a direct rule for NT32 \u2192 t28. Wait, looking for terminal symbols, I see NT5 \u2192 't41', NT17 \u2192 't14', NT10 \u2192 't32', NT16 \u2192 't6', NT25 \u2192 't77', etc. But I don't see any NT X that directly produces t28. Wait, but looking at the grammar, some rules have t28 as part of a sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production is of the form NT X \u2192 NT Y1 NT Y2. So each step of expansion is replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols. So starting from S, which can produce options like NT21 NT2, I can try to see if each component can eventually produce terminals.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if the start symbol S can derive this string by a series of productions, replacing non-terminals with terminals and non-terminals as needed.\n\nTo approach this, I should see if each terminal in the string can be the result of some non-terminal production. For example, t28 can be produced by NT25 via NT25 \u2192 NT19 NT28 (so NT25 can lead to t28 if NT19 is a terminal). But wait, NT19 has productions like NT19 \u2192 NT6 NT24, etc. So NT19 doesn't produce a terminal directly but another non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each t in the string needs to be derived from a non-terminal that can expand to that t. But I think each terminal is directly produced by a non-terminal. For example, t28 is produced directly by NT25, as per NT25 \u2192 t77? Wait, no, looking back, I don't see that. Wait, looking at the rules, many have 't's in the right-hand side. For example:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT16 -> 't6' (in multiple places)\n- NT25 -> 't77' and 't30' (so NT25 can produce 't77' and 't30')\nWait, let's check the rules again for 't's.\n\nLooking at the rules, there are several where a non-terminal is directly associated with a terminal, like:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT10 \u2192 't32'\n- NT16 \u2192 't6' (multiple rules)\n- NT25 \u2192 't77' (multiple rules)\n- NT21 \u2192 't8' (from NT21 \u2192 NT14 NT2, but in another rule, NT21 \u2192 t8)\nWait, looking through all the rules, any non-terminal that directly produces a terminal?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the non-terminals that directly produce terminals, i.e., have a production rule where the RHS is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT10 \u2192 't32'\n- NT7 \u2192 't3' (from NT7 \u2192 't3')\nWait, no, looking again: NT7's rules include NT7 \u2192 't3', so right, NT7 can produce t3.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT8 has two rules: NT8 \u2192 't27', 't24'\n\n- NT14 has rule NT14 \u2192 't65'\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't77', 't30'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't26', 't84'\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nSo each of these non-terminals can produce specific terminals. But wait, looking through the entire list, some NTs produce other NTs, but some produce terminals.\n\nSo, for example, if the string includes 't6', that could be produced by NT25, which produces t77 and t30? Wait, no: looking at the rules, NT25 \u2192 NT23 NT28 and also has a production where it directly produces 't77' and 't30'? Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nThe rules for NT25 are:\n\nNT25 -> NT5 NT13\n\nNT25 -> NT23 NT28\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see NT25 directly producing any terminal. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking at the entire list of rules:\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\n- NT25's productions: None of its RHSs are terminals beyond NTs. So NT25 doesn't directly produce any terminal. Similarly, other NTs:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' (terminal)\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' (terminal)\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't32' (from NT10 \u2192 't32')\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't77'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again:\n\nWait, in the rules, some lines have 'tX' as RHS. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't32'\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't6' (multiple rules)\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't77' (multiple rules)\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't8' (from NT21 \u2192 't8')\n\nSimilarly, NT7 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't27', 't24'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't65'\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo many non-terminals directly produce terminals, while others don't.\n\nBut in the string, I see t28, which is a terminal. So I need to see if any non-terminal can produce t28.\n\nLooking for rules where a non-terminal can directly produce t28. Let's scan the rules:\n\nLooking through all RHSs for 't28's:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3 (non-terminals)\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't40' (I think, no, looking back, I don't see 't40'. Wait, looking at the list, I don't see any 't40'. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for any RHS that includes 't28' as a terminal:\n\nWait, in the initial problem statement, under the grammar, here's the line:\n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\n\nAnother line:\n\nNT14 -> NT15 NT7\n\nWait, and further down:\n\nNT2 -> NT23 NT33\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production where a non-terminal directly produces 't28'.

The grammar is quite complex with multiple production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure. CNF means each production is non-terminal -> two non-terminals or non-terminal -> terminal. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S branches into various combinations starting with NT21, NT32, etc. \n\nThe string provided is: `t6 t22 t38 t50 t70 t7 t54 t71 t68 t14 t14 t84 t84 t38 t22 t77 t6 t84 t8 t71 t75 t14 t6 t71 t38 t32`. \n\nIn CNF, the string should be derived by expanding non-terminals, each time replacing them with two symbols. Each symbol in the string corresponds to either a production rule ending with a terminal or part of a production that leads to terminals.\n\nI'll start by looking for the initial non-terminals that produce the first few symbols. The string starts with 't6'. Looking at the production rules, 't6's have several sources. For example, NT7 -> 't3' and NT18 -> 't66', but that's not relevant here. Wait, looking again, NT6 is 't68', NT0 is 't17' and 't61', NT26 is 't28', NT18 is 't66', NT3 is 't31' or t7, and NT14 is t65 or t51. \n\nWait, let me list the rules for terminals from the grammar. I see NT7 -> 't3', NT18 -> 't66', NT1 -> 't27', etc. But wait, in the problem statement, there are numerous productions where non-terminals like NT18, NT6, etc., are mapped to 't's.

Let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar, I see:\n- NT14 -> 't51'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- NT14 -> 't84'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT21 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't56'\n- NT13 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n- NT19 -> 't22'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT11 -> 't14'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT0 -> 't17' and 't61'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT16 -> 't10'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT18 -> 't36'\n- NT12 -> 't16' and t14\n- NT3 -> 't31' and t7?\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. It seems like some non-terminals directly correspond to terminals as per the production rules. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't31' (and perhaps another rule)\nWait, actually, looking at the bottom of the grammar:\n\nI see:\n\nNT3 -> t31\nNT14 -> t51\nNT3 -> t7\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me scan through the given grammar more carefully to find all the terminal rules.\n\nLooking again, from the grammar provided, the rules that end with a string of letters (i.e., terminals) are:\n\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT14 -> 't51'\n- NT3 -> 't7' (two rules for NT3)\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT1 => I'm not seeing any, but maybe NT1 doesn't map to a terminal.\n- NT0 -> 't17' and 't61'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\nWait, but the productions for NT0 include 't17' and 't61', but I don't see NT1 having a terminal rule. But in the input string, the symbols include numbers like 't66', 't14', etc.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't6', which is a terminal. Looking for where 't6' is the result of a production.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT18 -> 't66' (not t6)\n- Wait, none of the rules produce 't6' except perhaps NT18 is mapped to 't66', which is 't6' followed by '6'? Or maybe it's 't6' literally?\n\nWait, in the string, it's 't6' as a single symbol. Looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nThe rule ND6 -> 't68' is not t6. Wait, maybe I missed a rule that maps a non-terminal to 't6'. Looking again:\n\nLooking into the grammar, do any of the rules produce 't6'? Let me check:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT15 -> 't6' is not present. Wait, no:\n\nLooking through the bottom sections:\n\nNT15 -> 't6', yes? Wait, looking here:\n\n\"NT15 -> 't6'\" is present, but I don't see it in the initial list. Wait, wait, the grammar is a long list. Let me find all the rules where a non-terminal is mapped to a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nThere's NT7 -> 't3'\n\nNT15 -> 't6'\n\nWait, actually, the grammar is presented as a list of rules. I need to find all the rules where a NT is mapped directly to a terminal (i.e., without a continuation). Let me scan the entire list:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- S -> ... (no terminal)\n- NT21 -> ... (no terminal)\n- ... (many rules, but only specific ones have terminals at the end)\n\nLooking at the end, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't17' and 't61'\u2014so these are terminal strings, but their length is 2, with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nAlso, there's NT23 -> 't43'\u2014so 't43' as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT3 -> 't31' (terminal string 't31')\n- NT60 -> 't71' (But that's a production, not a terminal)\nWait, perhaps I should make a list.\n\nLet me extract all the rules that end with a string composed of only terminals:\n\n1. NT7 -> 't3' (single token)\n2. NT15 -> 't6' (single token)\n3. NT16 -> 't10' (single token)\n4. NT7 -> 't3'\n5. NT18 -> 't66' (two tokens 't' and '66')\n6. NT23 -> 't43'\n7. NT6 -> 't68' (No, it's 't6' followed by '8')\nWait, no, NT6 is \"NT6 -> NT1 NT10\" and another rule \"NT6 -> NT0\". In the end, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> NT0\nBut NT0 can be 't17' or 't61'.\n\nSo, perhaps 't6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-491","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. So, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t6 t14 t68 t66 t14 t14 t23 t30 t66 t23 t40 t0 t8 t71 t70 t14 t31 t52 t7 t14 t71 t6 t66 t50 t40 t71`\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar uses several productions where non-terminals are replaced by two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which first produces combinations of NT and NT like NT2 NT28, etc. So, the derivation tree starts from S.\n\nGiven the string starts with `t6`, I should check which production leads to `t6`. Looking through the productions, I see that NT18 \u2192 NT5 NT18. No, wait, actually, looking at the terminals, I see NT18 \u2192 't6', so that's a direct production. Similarly, NT26 \u2192 't28', NT18 \u2192 't66', and so on.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals derived from the grammar. Since the grammar only produces terminals through the productions, each step in the string must be a result of replacing a non-terminal with another non-terminal until reaching a terminal.\n\nNow, the initial step is to see if the entire string can be broken down as per the grammar. The string has 25 elements, so that's a lot. Let's think in terms of the start symbol S and how the expansion could proceed.\n\nStarting from S:\nS can produce NT2 NT28 or NT32 NT14, etc. So, let's see if the string can be built by expanding S.\n\nBut it's complicated to track manually. Maybe I can look for the rules step by step.\n\nFor example, the first part is `t6`, which comes from NT18 \u2192 't6'. So, maybe NT18 is part of the expansion. Similarly, the next `t14` comes from NT14 \u2192 't14', which is a production. So, perhaps the string has been built step by step, but I need to ensure that the entire string is covered without any leftover symbols.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the string starts with t6, followed by t14. So, in the grammar, t6 is NT18 and t14 is NT14. Looking at the production NT14: in the grammar, NT14 has several rules, such as NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT7 or NT14 \u2192 't65' or NT14 \u2192 't14'. So, t14 is directly produced by NT14, and t65 (which is not in the string) would come from NT34 perhaps.\n\nLooking further, the third token is t68, which is NT13 \u2192 't68'. Then t66 is either NT18\u2192't66' or NT56? Wait, looking at the productions, t66 comes from NT18 \u2192 't66'. Hmm, actually, in the grammar, some tokens are from multiple NTs. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, t66 is derived from NT18 \u2192 't66'. Similarly, t30 is NT21 \u2192 't30', and t40 is NT32 \u2192 't40' or NT22 \u2192 't40'? Let me check the productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT32 has a production to 't54' or other NTs. But I also see NT32 \u2192 't40' is not direct. Wait, checking the production list:\n\nLooking through, I see NT22 \u2192 't40' is one of its productions. So, t40 comes from NT22.\n\nSimilarly, t50 is NT28 \u2192 't50', and t71 is from NT15 \u2192 't71', among others.\n\nNow, to see if the string can be constructed, maybe I should try to parse it. Since the grammar is CNF, a recursive descent parser could work, but manually it's tedious.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each step in the string aligns with the grammar's terminals. For example, each symbol in the string must be a terminal, or a non-terminal that can produce the next symbol.\n\nWait, but wait: is the grammar only using terminals and non-terminals correctly? Let me check. The string is composed of symbols like t6, t14, t68, etc. Now, looking at the grammar, these symbols like t6, t14, etc., are actually either the result of NT productions or are terminals.\n\nIn the grammar, some productions end with a terminal symbol. For example, NT26 \u2192 't28', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 't31' or NT3 \u2192 NT20 NT13. Wait, that's a production for NT3 as two non-terminals.\n\nWait a minute, looking back, the grammar actually uses some NT productions to terminals and others to non-terminals. Let me look:\n\nFor example, NT15 \u2192 't71', so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT26 \u2192 't28' is a terminal. But NT32 \u2192 't54' would be a terminal if such a production exists. Wait, let me check the list.\n\nLooking into the grammar, I see:\n\nNT32 productions include:\n- NT32 -> NT1 NT23\n- NT32 -> NT28 NT18\n- Also, is there any NT32 -> 't54'? Wait, I see at the end:\n- NT32 -> 't54' is one of its productions?\n\nWait, in the list, I see \"NT32 -> NT2 NT33\", \"NT32 -> NT28 NT18\", and then further down, in the provided grammar, I think I might have missed it. Wait, the last part includes:\n\n\"NT32 -> 't54'\" ?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I think I missed that. Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking through, I see at the end:\n\n\"NT0 -> 't61'\", \"NT15 -> 't68'\", \"NT33 -> 't33 NT19'\", etc. Wait, no. Actually, I don't see a production for NT32 that directly results in 't54'. Instead, does it exist?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe list ends with:\n\n\"NT17 -> 't49'\"\n\"NT24 -> 't71'\"\n\"NT14 -> 't84'\"\n\"NT32 -> 't54'\"\n\"NT21 -> 't77'\"\n\"NT15 -> 't68'\"\n\"NT23 -> 't40'\"\n\"NT22 -> 't8'\"\n\"NT23 -> 't52'\"\n\"NT13 -> 't71'\"\n\"NT5 -> 't84'\"\n\"NT19 -> 't22'\"\n\"NT2 -> 't23'\"\n\"NT17 -> 't49'\"\n\"NT23 -> 't40'\"\n\"NT2 -> 't38'\"\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, in the list, I don't immediately see a production that results in 't54'. Let me scan through the grammar list to check.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT32 -> NT28 NT18\n- Then, later, I see:\n\"NT22 -> 't40'\"\n\"NT23 -> 't40'\"\n\"NT14 -> 't65'\"\n\"NT10 -> 't0'\"\n\"NT28 -> 't50'\"\n\"NT5 -> 't41'\"\n\"NT25 -> 't77'\"\n\"NT34 -> 't30'\"\n\"NT34 -> 't14'\"\n\"NT7 -> 't84'\"\n\"NT12 -> 't16'\"\n\"NT12 -> 't14'\"\n\"NT3 -> 't12'\"\n\"NT16 -> 't10'\"\n\"NT19 -> 't25'\"\n\"NT33 -> 't49'\"\n\"NT15 -> 't68'\"\n\"NT33 -> 't60'\"\n\"NT15 -> 't34'\"\n\"NT24 -> 't71'\"\n\"NT14 -> 't84'\"\n\"NT32 -> 't54'\"\nWait, yes, I see now. The production NT32 -> 't54' exists. So, t54 is a terminal produced by NT32.\n\nSo, in the grammar, we have both NT32 producing other NTs and also NT32 \u2192 't54'.\n\nTherefore, the string includes t6, t14, t68, t66, t14, etc., which are all terminals.\n\nNow"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-512","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: `t34 t70 t56 t28 t6 t41 t6 t71 t3 t22 t10 t22 t41 t32 t77 t71 t36 t50 t70 t60 t77 t0 t17 t36 t41 t41 t22`. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can expand into terminals. In this grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands into NT21 and NT28, then each produces other non-terminals, and some of these non-terminals are terminals with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nI think I should convert the string into the sequence of terminals and check if it can be derived from S using the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list the string terms: t34, t70, t56, t28, t6, t41, t6, t71, t3, t22, t10, t22, t41, t32, t77, t71, t36, t50, t70, t60, t77, t0, t17, t36, t41, t41, t22.\n\nI'll try to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting from S -> NT21 NT28. So S must produce two parts: first NT21 leads to the first part of the string, and NT28 leads to the second part.\n\nLet's see what each production can generate.\n\nNT21: Let's look up. NT21 has productions: NT21 -> NT32 NT29, NT21 -> NT6 NT0, etc. Wait, actually in the given grammar, NT21 has several productions, including NT21 -> NT21 NT24, but I need to check each production.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT21 with multiple rules: NT21 -> NT32 NT29, NT26 NT6, NT21 -> NT21 NT24, NT18 NT18, and others. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to see if any of the terminals in the string can be produced by NT21 or NT28.\n\nWait, NT21 can produce 't8' and others? Looking through the rules, I see NT25 -> 't77', NT20 -> 't50', etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this as a top-down parsing using the grammar.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, I can try to split it into parts that could correspond to each non-terminal's expansion.\n\nFirst, S -> NT21 NT28. So the string is split into two parts: part1 from NT21, part2 from NT28.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t34. I need to see if t34 can be generated by any of NT21's productions.\n\nLooking through NT21's rules: it has NT21 -> 't8' (e.g., NT16 -> 't6', but NT21 might produce 't8' via some path). Alternatively, checking the productions for NT21: does any rule produce t34?\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see t34 being directly produced by NT21. Hmm, but maybe through a series of expansions.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT32 -> 't54', but also NT22 -> 't22' and other terminals. Maybe more steps are needed.\n\nWait, this could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to notice that some of the tokens in the string can be matched directly to certain non-terminals, and see if a chain can lead back to S.\n\nFor example, t34 is in the string. Looking at the rules, I see that several non-terminals can produce t34: NT16 -> 't6', but t34 is not that. Wait, I see NT34 has rules that produce t30, t14, t84, etc., but wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar has NT34 -> 't30' and NT34 -> 't14' and also in other rules. Wait, looking at the full list, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are several entries for NT17, NT19, etc. Looking back:\n\nNT14 -> 't65', 't51', 't10', 't84', etc.\n\nWait, let me look for 't34' as a terminal. Scanning the rules, I see that NT4 -> 't41', NT3 -> 't31', NT5 -> 't41', etc., but none of the rules directly produce t34. Wait, checking:\n\nLooking at the start of the given rules, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce t34 as a terminal. Hmmm. So that's a problem because the string starts with t34, and if t34 is a terminal, then it must be produced directly by a non-terminal in the grammar. But looking through all the NT rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t34. Therefore, I think t34 cannot be part of any derivation because there's no production rule that directly or indirectly produces t34 as a terminal.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check again. The rules are all in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning each rule is a non-terminal expanding into exactly two non-terminals. Wait, no, in the given grammar, all the productions are of the form A -> BC (where A, B, C are non-terminals) except for some that have A -> a or A -> a B, but in most cases, they are only two non-terminals.

That's a long string with a bunch of these tokens like t68, t6, etc.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all our productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which produces combinations of NT21, NT31, etc., all the way down to terminals like 't28', 't14', etc. Each symbol in the string is a terminal, so I need to check if the string can be derived from S through a series of left derivations, substituting each part according to the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it starts with t68. Let me look at the grammar rules to see where t68 comes from. Scanning through, I see that NT6 -> 't68'. So, NT6 produces t68, which matches the first token in the string.\n\nSo, the first step would be to derive t68 from NT6. Now, the next token is t6, and looking at NT6's productions, I see NT6 -> NT13. So, to get t6, we can set NT13 \u2192 't6'. So the second token is derived from NT13.\n\nThen, the third token is t3. Looking at NT13's productions, I don't see a rule that directly gives t3. Wait, let me check more carefully. NT3 -> 't3', right? Oh, but according to the grammar, NT3 has a production to 't7', but that's a different token. Wait, perhaps I need to check all possibilities.\n\nWait, the string is t68 t6 t3 t38 t23...

{"custom_id":"request-531","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires each production rule to be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. Wait, looking at the given grammar, I notice that the rules sometimes have a single terminal on the right side, like NT5 \u2192 't28' or NT9 \u2192 't84'. That might complicate things because in standard CNF, each production should be either A\u2192BC or S\u2192\u03c3 where \u03c3 is a string of terminals. So I'm a bit confused here\u2014maybe the grammar isn't in strict CNF? Or perhaps these are exceptions.\n\nWait, the user mentioned the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, but looking deeper, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, which is acceptable in CNF if they're the start symbols. Or maybe these are individual rules allowed for the start symbol. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed assuming it's in CNF despite these direct terminal productions.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t3 t38 t54 t77 t68 t14 t65 t22 t10 t41 t54 t77 t6 t71 t14 t14 t6 t66 t14 t38 t3 t28 t70 t23 t28 t36 t41 t6`.\n\nThat's a long string. Let's count the tokens to see how many there are. 30 tokens total. Now, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT21 NT28. Each production seems to split into two non-terminals except the ones that produce terminals. So perhaps I can build a parse tree starting from S and see if the given string can be derived.\n\nBut looking at the string, it starts with 't3' and ends with 't6'. Let me check which non-terminals produce 't3', 't6', etc. Scanning through, I see rules like NT7 \u2192 't3', NT3 \u2192 't12', NT9 \u2192 't84', and others. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to see if each token in the string can be traced back through the grammar. But this might be time-consuming. Another approach is to consider that each non-terminal production can generate two tokens, so the entire string should have a length that's compatible with the starting from S.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each step of the derivation introduces two non-terminals, so the number of symbols in the sentential form increases by one each time. Starting from S, which is a single symbol, the length of the string after n steps is 2 + n. So the total number of symbols should be of the form 2^n. But let's check the length of our string after considering all tokens. Since each non-terminal production results in two symbols, the actual string length should be 2^(n+1). Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Actually, each production in CNF replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so starting from S, each step doubles the number of symbols.\n\nWait, the initial string at step 0 is S, length 1. After one production, say S \u2192 NT21 NT28, the length becomes 2. Then, each of NT21 and NT28 can produce more, so the total length grows. But in the given string, there are 30 tokens. 2^5=32, which is more than 30; so it's possible if the string was generated with a few more steps. Alternatively, maybe the string length has to be 2^n, but 30 isn't a power of two. Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split into parts that match the given productions. Let's try to match the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't3', which can come from NT7 \u2192 't3'. So maybe NT7 is the start. Let's see if NT7 can produce more tokens.\n\nLooking at NT7, I don't see a direct production except in the middle where NT7 is involved in other productions. Wait, NT7 appears in some rules as a result, like NT9 \u2192 't84' (but not relevant here). Wait, there's a production like NT7 \u2192 something? Let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n- NT7 \u2192 't3'\n- NT7 appears in other productions as a left-hand side? Wait, looking at the rules, I only see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't3', so it's a terminal. That's the only production for NT7.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't3', that's the first token. Then, the next token is 't38'. So after 't3', we have 't38'. But NT7 can't produce 't38' because it only produces 't3'. So perhaps something else is producing 't3' followed by 't38'. Alternatively, maybe 't3' is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of tokens, so each non-terminal production must generate exactly two non-terminals until we reach terminals. So perhaps 't3' is the result of a production that is followed by another production.\n\nWait, perhaps the first two tokens are the results of S's production. Let's think: S can produce two non-terminals, say A and B. Then A can produce more, or perhaps A and B can each produce a pair, as long as the entire string is generated.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 30 tokens. To generate 30 tokens starting from S, the number of steps would need to generate enough tokens. Let's try to see:\n\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28. Now each of these can be NT21 and NT28. Let's see where they can go.\n\nLooking at NT21: there's a rule like NT21 \u2192 't25' (wait, I think earlier I saw NT21 \u2192 't25', but let me check: looking through the grammar, yes, I see NT21 \u2192 't25' and another rule NT21 \u2192 't26', which is a bit confusing because a non-terminal usually has one production. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm miscounting. Wait, the grammar provided has multiple production rules for the same non-terminal? Or is it that each rule is a separate alternative. Wait, looking back, it seems that NT21 has two production rules:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't6' NT5? Or wait, no, let me re-read:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see several rules for NT21:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n- NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24\n\nWait, that seems a problem because a non-terminal in CNF should only have one production. But perhaps this is a typo or misinterpretation. Alternatively, maybe the productions are listed, and each non-terminal can produce to multiple alternatives. But in that case, the grammar wouldn't be in CNF because CNF requires each non-terminal to have exactly two productions, perhaps.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each non-terminal can have multiple production rules, as long as each is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a (if it produces terminals directly). But the issue here is that some non-terminals produce more than one non-terminal in their rule, but that's okay in CNF.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT21 NT28, both NT21 and NT28 will need to be expanded. Let's expand them one by one.\n\nNT21 can be expanded in multiple ways:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n- NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n- NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24\n\nWait, but that would mean NT21 can produce more NT21s, leading to loops. Hmm, but perhaps that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in copying the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar again carefully. Here's the full list of NT21's productions:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n- Line 18: NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n- Line 20: NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- Line 25: NT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24\n\nSo indeed, NT21 has three productions: leading to NT26 and NT6, NT6 and NT0, or NT21 and NT24. Hmm, that's unusual. But I think in this case, it's possible that the grammar is structured that way.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT28:\n\nLine 1: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\nLine 2: NT28 \u2192 NT32 NT18\nLine 3: NT28"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-553","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: `t23 t14 t52 t50 t71 t30 t71 t70 t14 t28 t30 t68 t28 t14 t28 t14 t28 t49 t0 t84 t70 t54 t25 t50 t41 t54 t71 t0 t11`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided meets this structure, so that's a good start.\n\nThe goal is to check if the string can be derived by starting with the start symbol S and applying productions step by step until we get the string. But manually parsing this could get complicated. Maybe I can approach it by looking for sequences of non-terminals that can produce the terminal string.\n\nLooking at the given string, it starts with `t23 t14...`. I see there are several `tXXXX` terms, some are defined as terminals in the grammar. Let me check the terminal definitions:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that several symbols are terminals:\n- `t23`, `t14`, `t52`, `t50`, `t71`, `t30`, `t68`, `t84`, `t70`, `t54`, `t41`, `t25`, `t49`, `t0`, `t8`, `t6`, etc.\n\nSo, the string is entirely made of these terminals. Now, I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI think I should start from the start symbol S and see if I can produce the given string. Since S has three productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nI can choose one of these and see if the string starts with the corresponding symbols. Let's try the second production: S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is `t23`. Let me check what NT32 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT32 is:\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23\nNT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27\nNT22 \u2192 NT29 NT2\nWait, but NT2 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23\nNT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27\nNT22 \u2192 NT29 NT2\nNT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18\nNT18 \u2192 NT20 NT0\nWait, this seems to be a chain leading deeper into non-terminals. But looking at the string, the first t is t23, so maybe NT32 can be reduced to t23 through a chain.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that in the grammar rules, several non-terminals directly produce t's:\n\nFor example, NT21 \u2192 t6\nNT23 is defined as:\nNT23 \u2192 NT24 NT28\nNT24 \u2192 NT22 NT32\nNT22 \u2192 NT18 NT32\nThis seems to loop, perhaps. Alternatively, looking at NT5 productions:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t41 (from NT5 production: NT5 \u2192 t41)\nBut in our string, the first t is t23. So maybe NT32 \u2192 t23 through some path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the entire string can be broken down into paths that match the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be parsed by the grammar, perhaps using a recursive descent parser or similar method. Since manually parsing is time-consuming, I'll try to see if there's a possible path.\n\nLet's consider the first few tokens: `t23 t14`.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then NT32 should produce `t23` and NT14 should produce `t14`.\n\nLooking at NT32: the productions are:\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23\nSo, NT32 needs to produce `t23` from NT23.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions:\nNT23 can produce NT24 NT28, which eventually must produce t23. Let me check NT24 and NT28:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT22 NT32\nNT22 \u2192 NT18 NT32\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23, which gets us back to a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, NT23 may produce a terminal through a different path. Let me check if any other productions of NT23 lead to terminals. From the given grammar, NT23 doesn't have any direct terminal productions. So this path might not be feasible.\n\nWait, maybe I chose the wrong initial production. Let's try another one.\n\nWhat about S \u2192 NT21 NT28?\n\nThen the first part would be NT21 producing t23 and NT28 producing t28.\n\nLooking at NT21: NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT22\nNT26 \u2192 NT28 NT22\nWait, this seems to loop as well. Unless there's a way to produce t23 from these.\n\nWait, let's look for any non-terminals that directly produce t23. Checking the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT24 NT28 \u2192 which eventually may lead to t28, not t23.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first step is to check if the entire string can be matched by the grammar. Since S can derive multiple non-terminals, maybe the string is a result of multiple productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long or doesn't fit. Let me count the tokens:\n\nThe string has 33 tokens, so that's a lot. Each production in CNF splits the string into non-terminals, so the tree depth might be high.\n\nAnother approach is to see if any non-terminals directly produce sequences that can form the string. For example, looking for where a non-terminal directly can produce a tXXX.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT28 \u2192 t50 (since NT28 \u2192 t50 is defined as a terminal).\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, NT28 \u2192 t50 is one of the productions: NT28 \u2192 t50. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t41 (from NT5 \u2192 t41)\nNT7 \u2192 t3\nNT18 \u2192 t66\nAnd many others have specific t-values.\n\nWait, so the string has terms like t23, t14, t52, t50, etc. Let me check which of these are directly produced by terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nIs there any production where NT can produce t52?\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0\nBut I don't see any NT that directly outputs t52 except for looking through the rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT32: NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23\nBut NT23 doesn't produce directly a t, looking further down, but perhaps that's too nested.\n\nWait, does any non-terminal produce t52? Let me scan the entire grammar:\n\nI see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 t8 (from NT21 \u2192 t8)\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nIn the grammar, there's:\nNT21 \u2192 't8' only in the last lines, like:\n- NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\nBut in the part where it's defined as a terminal:\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, I think I need to correct myself. The grammar's definition of terminals is only in the last parts for some non-terminals:\n\nLooking back:\n\nFor example:\n- NT26 \u2192 t28? Or is that defined later? Let me check the full grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. I realize that in the grammar provided, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like:\n\nNT21 \u2192 t8? Or is that correct?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nIt ends with lines like:\n\nNT11 \u2192 't6'\nNT25 \u2192 't71'\nNT15 \u2192 't68'\nNT10 \u2192 't0'\nNT28 \u2192 't50'\nNT5 \u2192 't41'\nNT25 \u2192 't77'\nNT15 \u2192 't6'\nNT23 \u2192 't43'\nNT21 \u2192 't8'\nNT26 \u2192 't71'\nNT18 \u2192 't36'\nNT11 \u2192 't6'\nNT18 \u2192 't70'\nNT34 \u2192 't30'\nNT34 \u2192 't14'\nNT7 \u2192 't84'\nNT12 \u2192 't16'\nNT12 \u2192 't14'\nNT3 \u2192 't12'\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\nWait, I think I messed up earlier"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Alternatively, maybe some nt's have rules that produce a terminal, like t71.\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT0 -> 't17'\n- NT1 -> 't29' and 't14'\n- NT2 -> 't23', 't38', etc.\n- NT8 -> 't27', 't6', 't10', 't6'\nWait, looking through all, I see 't71' is in the string, but do any non-terminals have 't71' as a production?\n\nWait, looking through the list of NT rules, I don't see any that produce 't71'. That's confusing because in the grammar, some rules produce terminals, but none list 't71' directly. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the provided productions again. Scanning through the rules, the last part shows several NTs mapping to t's.\n\nWait, looking at the top, the NT3 is 't31'; NT14 is 't65'; NT31 is 't75'; etc. But I don't see 't71' as a terminal in any of the rules. That's a problem because 't71' is in the string but I don't know how it's produced.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> 't17'\n- NT1 -> 't6 NT27', as per the last entries: NT16 -> 't18 NT6', etc.\n\nWait, in the very end of the given grammar, under NT19, I see NT19 -> 't22' and 't28'. So no, 't71' isn't directly a production. So how can 't71' be in the string? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I missed it. Let me go through all the rules again to see if any produce 't71'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT -> 't71' directly. So that suggests there might be a typo in the string, but I must proceed under the assumption that the grammar includes 't71' as a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps 't71' is produced by some combination of non-terminals and terminals through the rules. But without a direct rule producing 't71', it's impossible to derive it.\n\nWait, perhaps 't71' is produced by some other way. Maybe indirectly. Let me think: does any rule produce 't71'? Looking through, I don't see any.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT15 -> 't6', but looking for 't71' doesn't show up. So perhaps 't71' is a terminal that's allowed but not defined, which would make the string invalid. Alternatively, maybe the starting symbol S can be expanded into a tree that includes 't71', but without a direct rule, it's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Maybe I should parse 't71' as part of a larger non-terminal. For example, perhaps S can produce NT21 NT28, and then both of those non-terminals must eventually derive to terminals, including 't71'.\n\nWait, but S's expansion requires two non-terminals to produce two terminals. Looking at the string's beginning, 't71 t50 t70...', that's three symbols, but S produces two non-terminals, which would expand into two terminals. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the count.\n\nWait, maybe the string is parsed in a way where each non-terminal in S's production expands to two symbols in the string. But with the string starting with three 't's, that suggests that perhaps S's production must be followed by more, but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting symbol is S, and in the string, the first element is 't71', which might be a terminal, so if S produces NT21 NT28, each of those must derive into 't71' and something else. But without a production for NT21 -> 't71', that's impossible.\n\nWait, let's think differently: perhaps the string is a concatenation of non-terminals, and during parsing, some non-terminals might produce multiple symbols. But in the given string, all elements are terminals, so S's expansion must directly result in two terminals. For example, if S -> NT21 NT28, then in the string, the first two symbols should be the terminals resulting from NT21 and NT28.\n\nLooking at the string: the first two symbols are 't71' and 't50'. So if either NT21 -> 't71' and NT28 -> 't50', or vice versa, that could fit. But without those direct productions, it's not possible.\n\nWait, checking the rules again, do any of the nt's NT21 or NT28 have direct terminal productions that include 't71'?\n\nLooking back at the NT rules, I don't see NT21 or NT28 directly producing any 't's. So unless they produce other non-terminals that do, but that's a longer path.\n\nWait, perhaps in the string, 't71' is part of a longer expansion. Let me try to track back.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first symbol is 't71', so in the initial expansion, the first non-terminal must expand to 't71' and the second one to the next symbol.\n\nBut since 't71' isn't directly produced by any nt, the string cannot be generated. So the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but I'm probably missing something. Maybe 't71' is part of a longer derivation.

The grammar has several production rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens, some of which are non-terminals ('t' followed by numbers) as per the productions.\n\nFirst, I should note that in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the rules seem to fit this form, except maybe some where a non-terminal might have multiple symbols, but in this case, it seems each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of tokens: t38, t77, t6, t51, t28, t14, t71, t30, t60, t23, t43, t10, t54, t52, t70, t14, t38, t30, t36, t70, t14, t23, t30, t14, t28, t14, t17, t84, t68, t17.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string from the beginning, attempting to find a derivation that matches the entire string. Since the first symbol is t38, I need to find a production for S (the start symbol) that leads to t38 as the first step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the initial productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nNow, checking the productions:\n\n- NT21 has production NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29 or other terminals like t28, t14, etc. Looking at the 't' rules:\n  - NT25 \u2192 't51' (from NT25: 't51')\n  - NT32 \u2192 't54' etc.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t38.

In CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 B, or A \u2192 C where B and C are terminals or other non-terminals, and each rule has at most two symbols on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t84 t38 t84 t28 t14 t28 t41 t54 t14 t14 t71 t60 t22 t10 t0 t77 t71 t60 t77 t71 t3 t36 t77 t71 t12 t8 t50 t36 t14 t84`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived starting from S. Since it's a rightmost derivation, I'll try to break down the string into the non-terminals step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that S can produce NT2, NT32, etc., but looking at the string, I think starting from S as t84, t38, etc., might not fit because S's initial productions are combinations of NTs, not terminals. So maybe S needs to produce a series of NTs which then derive into the terminals.\n\nLet me check the grammar rules. The start symbol S can produce NT2, NT32, etc., but looking at the string, the terminals start with t84, which doesn't match any NT directly. Wait, looking at the productions, I see that some NTs are terminal strings. For example, NT17 \u2192 't14', NT26 \u2192 't28', etc. So some of the NTs are terminals, others produce more NTs.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because S is an initial symbol that produces combinations of NTs. Each NT in the start production (S) can then derive into a sequence of terminals, possibly through other productions.\n\nGiven the string, perhaps each token in the string is derived from an NT that eventually becomes a terminal. So I need to see if each part of the string can be matched by a path from an NT to a terminal.\n\nLooking at some of the NT productions:\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT26 \u2192 't28'\n- NT25 \u2192 't77' (through specific productions)\n- NT33 \u2192 sometimes 't19', 't33', etc.\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', which is in the string.\n\nWait, the string has several 't71's, such as at position 15 and 16. Let's see how that can happen. Look at NT15: according to the rules, NT15 \u2192 't6' (from NT15\u2192t6?), but actually in the grammar, I see NT15->t6 and also NT15 being produced by other NTs. Wait, let me go through the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT15\u2192't6'\nNT23\u2192't40'\nWait, no, some NTs can be terminals. For example, NT5 can be 't41' through some productions, but I'm not sure. Wait, the rules include:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't14'\nNT26 \u2192 't28'\nNT25 \u2192 't77'\nNT33 \u2192 sometimes 't49', 't19', etc.\nNT21 \u2192 't8', but in the string I don't see 't8' except once.\n\nWait, in the given string, the last token is 't84' which is at the end. Let me see if there's a production that directly gives 't84'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT14 \u2192 't65', which is not helpful. Wait, let me check NT34: NT34\u2192't30' and NT34\u2192't14'. So, NT34 can produce t14 or t30.\n\nLooking deeper, how are these terminals produced? For example, 't14' is produced by NT34, but where is 't28' from? NT26\u2192't28'. Similarly, 't38' is not a terminal I immediately recognize. Wait, the string starts with t84, t38, t84, etc. Hmm.\n\nI think I need to identify the paths from NTs to terminals. Let me try to map out the possible steps.\n\nFirst, T84 appears twice early in the string. So, likely, this comes from a NT that can produce t84.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t84. Wait, some NTs produce others, which eventually produce terminals. For instance, NT17 \u2192 t14, NT14 \u2192 t65, but NT34\u2192t14 or t30. Wait, but NT26\u2192t28, NT27\u2192t6 (through different rules). Hmm, this seems a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the NTs derive into a sequence that starts with t84. Let me check if there's a way any NT can lead to t84 as the first symbol. For example, looking at S's productions, S can produce NT2, NT32, etc. So maybe the first token comes from one of these NTs.\n\nLooking at NT2: NT2\u2192't23', 't50', or others? Hmm, no, perhaps NT2 is derived from other NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to build the derivation tree from the string, working from the leaves up.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt84, t38, t84, t28, t14, t28, t41, t54, t14, t14, t71, t60, t22, t10, t0, t77, t71, t60, t77, t71, t3, t36, t77, t71, t12, t8, t50, t36, t14, t84.\n\nThis is quite long, but perhaps I can find a pattern or see if each token can be matched by a production of some NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can determine starting from S and see if the entire string can be produced.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Maybe I should first look at each token and see which NTs can produce them or lead to them.\n\nFor example:\n\nt84: does any NT derive to t84 directly? Looking at the rules, I don't see any NT with a production directly to t84. So perhaps t84 is the result of a derivation from a combination of NTs leading to t84.\n\nWait, perhaps some NTs can combine other NTs that produce t84.\n\nLet me consider some NTs:\n\nLooking at NT17: \u2192 t14\nNT29: \u2192 't27', 't22' (from production 29\u219227 22)\nBut I don't see t84 mentioned in these.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe t84 comes from NT14 somehow, but looking at NT14's production: NT14\u2192t65 or NT17 (t14). Alternatively, NT34\u2192t14, which could give t14. Similarly, other NTs might lead to t84 through other steps.\n\nWait, this seems too fragmented. Maybe I should look for the first token 't84' and see how it can fit.\n\nGiven that t84 doesn't appear as a direct production of any NT, perhaps it's generated through a chain of derivations. So, for example, perhaps S \u2192 NT2, which then \u2192 something, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, since S can produce NT2 and NT32, etc., maybe 't84' comes from NT34 somehow.\n\nLooking at NT34\u2192t14 (from production 34\u219214 t t14?), no, actually in the rules, I see NT34\u2192t30 and NT34\u2192t14.\n\nSo, NT34 can produce t14 or t30. But how does he get t84?\n\nWait, perhaps some NTs can combine with others to produce t84.\n\nWait, another approach: the grammar is in CNF, so each production has exactly two symbols on the right, except for terminals.\n\nGiven that, I can try to see if each token in the string matches a terminal in some NT's direct production. If each token is a direct terminal, then the derivation would be easy, but in this case, the first token is t84, but I don't see any NT directly producing t84. So maybe the string's first token is a result of some derivation"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-591","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure this out. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It seems to consist of a bunch of production rules where each non-terminal on the left produces a pair of non-terminals on the right. The start symbol is S, which produces various pairs like NT21 NT28, NT31 NT32, etc. The terminals here are strings like 't84', 't71', and so on, and non-terminals like NT21, NT22, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t84 t71 t84 t54 t6 t12 t36 t40 t23 t52 t50 t36 t36 t7 t36 t17 t84 t68 t70 t50 t41 t17 t12 t41 t36 t28 t30 t84 t36 t38 t52`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT17 -> 't14' and NT0 -> 't61'. So, the grammar has rules where some non-terminals are replaced by specific terminal strings.\n\nNow, I need to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals, until the last step which replaces a non-terminal with a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, production rules can be either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this grammar, I see rules like NT21 -> NT8 NT14, which is the first case, and some rules like NT17 -> 't14', which is the second case.\n\nSo, this grammar allows derivation steps where non-terminals are expanded into other non-terminals until we reach terminals. I need to see if the string is built up by expanding the start symbol S through these rules.\n\nLet's look at the string. It starts with 't84 t71 t84 t54 t6 t12 t36 ...'. So, perhaps the first step is S -> NT32 NT28, because looking at the string, 't84 t71 t84 t54...' has a 't84' followed by 't71', which might correspond to NT32 and NT28 since NT32 -> t54 and NT28 -> t50, but 't71' could be from NT7. Wait, no, NT17 -> t14, NT0->t61, but maybe that's a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should map the string to the possible production rules. Starting from S, which can be NT32 NT28. Let's check the rules for NT32 and NT28.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT32: it can be NT20 NT13 or NT1 NT20, and so on. Similarly, NT28: rules include NT11 NT3, NT27 NT0, etc.\n\nWait, but in the provided string, the first symbol is 't84'. Let me check if any non-terminal starts with 't84' when expanded.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules like NT17 -> 't14' and NT0 -> 't61', but 't84' is produced by NT18 (since in the rules, NT18 production has 't66', but wait, wait, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let's list out all the terminal strings:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT16 -> 't6'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT0 -> 't17' (wait, no, earlier it was NT0 -> 't61')\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT18 -> 't41'\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT14 -> 't51'\n- NT10 -> 't0'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't71'\n- NT18 -> 't36'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT18 -> 't70'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT34 -> 't14'\n- NT7 -> 't84'\n- NT12 -> 't16'\n- NT12 -> 't14'\n- NT3 -> 't12'\n- NT16 -> 't10'\n- NT19 -> 't25'\n- NT33 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't28'\n- NT33 -> 't60'\n- NT15 -> 't34'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- NT14 -> 't84'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT21 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT23 -> 't56'\n- NT13 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n\nWait, I notice that several non-terminals directly produce 't84' or 't71', such as NT7 -> 't84', NT5 -> 't84', NT14 -> 't84' (from the rule NT14 -> 't51'?

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up.\n\nWait, maybe I should note which non-terminals have rules ending with a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see which terminals appear in the string and check if any rule can produce them.\n\nThe string starts with 't84 t71 t84 t54 t6 t12 t36...'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't84' (so 't84' is produced by NT7)\n- NT14 has a rule -> 't51' (so 't51' is produced by NT14)\n- Wait, but in the string, 't84' appears at the beginning, so the first symbol must be derived from a non-terminal that produces 't84'.

Hmm, let's see how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, all the productions except for some like S \u2192 NT28 are in CNF. Wait, the first line says S \u2192 NT2 NT28, which is two non-terminals, so that's fine. But I see other productions, like NT5 \u2192 't41' and others like that. Wait, these are terminals because they're replaced by 't' followed by a number. So in the grammar, some non-terminals expand into terminals, which is allowed. \n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t68 t3 t71 t84 t38 t28 t71 t60 t54 t40 t8 t22 t40 t17 t71 t50 t66 t41 t3 t77 t71 t31 t41 t6 t71 t6 t43 t14 t12 t71 t7`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. \n\nOne approach is to see if each step constructs the string correctly according to the grammar. Let's break down the string into tokens: \n\nt68, t3, t71, t84, t38, t28, t71, t60, t54, t40, t8, t22, t40, t17, t71, t50, t66, t41, t3, t77, t71, t31, t41, t6, t71, t6, t43, t14, t12, t71, t7.\n\nEach token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. So each of these must be produced by some NT with a terminal production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several NTs that produce terminals, like NT5 \u2192 t41, NT3 \u2192 t31, etc. Some non-terminals also produce other non-terminals, which means the parser has to handle that.\n\nFirst, I think it's useful to identify which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLet's list out the terminal productions:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t41\nNT5 \u2192 t41 again\nNT7 \u2192 t3\nNT14 \u2192 t65\nNT14 \u2192 t51 (Wait, maybe I need to check again)\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't41' appears twice: line 9 and 11.\nNT7 \u2192 't3' (line 15)\nNT14 \u2192 't65' (line 18), but also NT14 \u2192 NT34 (line14) which leads to t34 \u2192 line34 is t34 \u2192 t14, which is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-614","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this string is part of the language defined by the given context-free grammar. The string is `t3 t23 t84 t3 t71 t10 t71 t38 t70 t68 t71 t77 t71 t12 t41 t40 t50 t66 t56 t6 t84 t38 t71 t70 t84 t23 t23 t11 t71 t66 t68 t50`. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and the start symbol S produces two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol S has production rules that produce two non-terminals each. For example, S \u2192 NT21 NT22, S \u2192 NT34 NT16, etc. So each production splits S into two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can further split into two more non-terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it's a sequence of terminal symbols (like t3, t23, etc.), which are defined in the grammar. Each terminal corresponds to a specific non-terminal's production rule ending. For instance, 't6' corresponds to NT23, 't7' to NT17, and so on.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if I can trace a path from S through the productions leading to the terminals in the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, every step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. Therefore, the length of the string should be one less than a power of 2. \n\nLet me check the length of the string. The string has 33 tokens. 2^5 = 32, 2^6 = 64. 33 is one more than 32, so that fits. It would mean the derivation started with S and had 5 splits. Wait, 2^5 is 32, so 33 is the total number of symbols after 5 splits. That seems right.\n\nNext, I need to see if the order of the terminals in the string can be matched by the grammar's rules. Since manually tracing all possible derivations would be time-consuming, maybe I can look for patterns or specific production rules that fit.\n\nLooking at the string, let's list the tokens: t3, t23, t84, t3, t71, t10, t71, t38, t70, t68, t71, t77, t71, t12, t41, t40, t50, t66, t56, t6, t84, t38, t71, t70, t84, t23, t23, t11, t71, t66, t68, t50.\n\nI notice some patterns. For example, 't6' corresponds to NT23. Where does NT23 come from? Looking at the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT7. NT5 is NT3 and NT7 is NT28, according to one of the rules. NT3 can be NT20 NT13, and NT28 is NT11 NT3. So NT23 would expand to NT20 NT13 NT11 NT3.\n\nThen, let's see how 't23' comes into play. The string has t23 twice. Looking at the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT7, which is NT3 NT28. NT28 is NT11 NT3 again. So if we have a t23, that might come from NT23.\n\nWait, but in the string, there's a t23 followed by t23 again. I need to check if there's a way for two t23s to appear. For example, NT23 being NT5 NT7, which could each expand to something else.\n\nBut perhaps it's getting too detailed. Maybe a better approach is to check if each terminal in the string matches a non-terminal and see if their parent productions can be chained appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can use a CYK algorithm approach. The CYK algorithm parses strings in CNF grammars by dividing the string into segments and checking all possible ways to split them according to the productions.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can look for high-level structures.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t3, t23, t84.\n\nt3 corresponds to NT14, t23 corresponds to NT23, and t84 corresponds to NT18.\n\nLooking at NT14, its productions are NT34 NT7 and NT8 NT11. So for t3 \u2192 NT14, that would need to come from NT14's production.\n\nLooking up where NT14 can come from: NT34 is a terminal, which is in the grammar as NT34 \u2192 't34'. Wait, no, actually the grammar defines some terminals. For example, NT14 \u2192 t65, but in the given string, I don't see t65. Wait no, looking back, the definitions in the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT14: It appears in several rules where it's a non-terminal. For example, NT14 \u2192 nt34 nt7, which is 't34' and 't7'. 't7' is defined as NT7 \u2192 't3' and NT18 \u2192 't6'? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, no, the grammar has some terminals. I think I misread that. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the grammar definitions, I see lines like:\n\nNT34 \u2192 't34', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT16 \u2192 't16' (wait, actually, the grammar has 't3' defined as NT18, 't7' as NT16, etc. Wait, no, looking through the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't3' (Wait, no: looking at the grammar, I see lines like NT7 \u2192 't3', NT18 \u2192 't66', etc. So, for example, 't3' is NT7, 't6' is NT28, etc.\n\nSo for the string token 't3', in the grammar, that's NT7. So the production for NT7 is NT26 NT34. So 't3' comes from NT7 \u2192 NT26 NT34, which are non-terminals.\n\nEach of those, NT26 and NT34, can be broken down further.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT28 NT22, and NT34 \u2192 't34' (a terminal). Wait, no, NT34 is a non-terminal, but in the grammar, it's a terminal? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\nNT34 appears in several rules, but in most cases, it's a non-terminal except where it's assigned a terminal like 't34'? Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, the terminals are those that appear on the right-hand side as words without further breakdown. Looking at the grammar, some N terminals have rules ending with a terminal symbol (denoted by lowercase t followed by a number).\n\nFor example:\n\nNT34 \u2192 't34' (a terminal)\n\nNT16 \u2192 't16' (another terminal)\n\nNT7 \u2192 't3' (another terminal), and so on.\n\nSo any N terminal that ends with 't' followed by another number is a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT34 is a terminal because it's defined as 't34' (so it's a string of 22's?), wait no, 't34' is just a single terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, so each non-terminal expands into exactly two others. Terminals are those that cannot be split further.\n\nSo in the grammar, the non-terminals are all the 'NT' followed by numbers, except when they're assigned a terminal symbol. For example, NT7 is a non-terminal because it's defined as NT26 NT34, but in another production, NT7 is 't3', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, for NT34 \u2192 't34', that means 't34' is a terminal, not a non-terminal.\n\nSo, in the string, 't34' would be a terminal symbol, but our given string doesn't include 't34', which is a good point to note.\n\nWait, but in the given string, I don't see 't34', so perhaps that's not an issue.\n\nNow, looking back at the first tokens: t3 (NT7), t23 (NT23), t84 (NT18). \n\nSo, for the string to be valid, t3 must be derived from NT7, t23 from NT23, and t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-610","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar has several production rules. I'll list the important ones to get a sense of how the non-terminals expand:\n\n- S produces combinations like NT28 NT3, etc. Each production starts with S and has two parts.\n- There are many rules for NT1, NT3, etc., each splitting into two non-terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7.\n- Some non-terminals produce terminals like t14, t28, etc.\n\nThe string given is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like `t28 t49...`. These seem to be the terminal symbols, and the other symbols like NT1, NT3, etc., are non-terminals. To check if the string is in the language, I need to see if it can be derived from S through these productions.\n\nFirst, notice that the string starts with 't28'. Looking at the grammar, the only rule starting with t is NT29 \u2192 t27 t22, which then might produce terminals when broken down further. Alternatively, NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6, etc. But the string starts with 't28', so I need to see how that can happen.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 't14', NT0 \u2192 't61', etc. So perhaps a path exists from S down to these terminals.\n\nLet's think about how 't28' can appear. From S's productions, S can lead to NT28, which then leads to NT11 NT3. Looking at NT11, it has a production NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13, and NT25 can produce NT5 NT1, etc.\n\nBut the string starts with 't28', so let's see if any non-terminal leads directly to 't28'. Looking at the grammar, NT28 \u2192 't27' 't22'. So 't28' is produced by NT28, so we'll need to see if the string can be generated through NT28.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. Start from the string and try to match it to a production of the grammar.\n2. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, except the base cases where they produce terminals.\n3. So, the string can be processed by a top-down or bottom-up approach. Top-down (recursive descent) seems manageable here.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to backtrack through the string, seeing if each part can correspond to a production.\n\nGiven the string: t28 t49 t43 t14 t7 t41 t36 t6 t84 t6 t84 t38 t84 t8 t23 t52 t56 t68 t6 t68 t6 t84 t54 t56 t68 t60 t22 t32 t38 t54 t41 t41.\n\nI'll try to process it step by step, attempting to match from the left.\n\n1. The first term is t28. Looking at NT28, we see that NT28 \u2192 't27' 't22'. So, to get t28, it must come from NT28. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT28 NT3.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the grammar again. S's productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT3\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo, to get the string starting with t28, S must split into NT28 and NT3, which both produce t28 and something else.\n\nWait, no. NT28 is a non-terminal. When S \u2192 NT28 NT3, both NT28 and NT3 need to produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t28, which is the first symbol. So, the entire string is a series of terminals, and each step in the derivation must split the non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to match the string from right to left, since each production has exactly two symbols, except for the base cases which produce terminals.\n\nLet me structure it as a parse tree, starting from S, and trying to match the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better approach is to represent the string as a list and apply the grammar rules from right to left.\n\nHere's the string as a list: ['t28', 't49', 't43', 't14', 't7', 't41', 't36', 't6', 't84', 't6', 't84', 't38', 't84', 't8', 't23', 't52', 't56', 't68', 't6', 't68', 't6', 't84', 't54', 't56', 't68', 't60', 't22', 't32', 't38', 't54', 't41', 't41']\n\nI'll list them as positions 0 to 34.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. So, for the string to be derivable, the length must be 2^n - 1 for some n, which is the depth of the derivation. Our string has 35 symbols, which is 2^6 -1 = 63? No, 35 is 2^6 - 1 is 63. So, perhaps not exactly, but the number of symbols must match the number of steps.\n\nWait, 2^6 -1 is 63, but we have 35 symbols. Maybe the depth is 6, so 2^6 is 64, starting with S. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the length 35, it's exactly 2^6 -1, which would mean the derivation is 6 levels deep, so 35 symbols. So that's possible.\n\nNow, let's try to parse from the end.\n\nStarting from the last symbol, 't41', which must come from a production that ends with 't41'. Looking at the grammar, we have several NTs that produce 't41'. For example:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' (twice: NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT20, but those in the grammar, which may not produce t41. Wait, looking at the grammar more carefully.\n\nWait, let's look at where 't41' occurs:\n\nLooking at the productions in the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' (twice: NT5 \u2192 't41' and NT5 \u2192 't41'?

{"custom_id":"request-629","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The task is to use my reasoning skills, pick a strategy, and then arrive at a conclusion. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific characteristics. Each production rule is either of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't generate the empty string. The grammar provided looks like it's in CNF because all the rules have two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal. For example, S -> NT2 NT28, which fits the first condition, and rules like NT21 -> NT32 NT29, also a two non-terminal production.\n\nThe string given is a series of terms separated by spaces: t14 t12 t54 t84 t41 t28 t3 t50 t41 t43 t28 t71 t36 t0 t40 t28 t30 t14 t6 t66 t30 t66 t84 t6 t50 t8 t30 t71 t14 t28 t40 t3 t71.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can approach this problem using the concept of derivation and parse trees. The idea is to check if the string can be built by starting from the start symbol and applying productions until the entire string is consumed.\n\nI think a good strategy is to work backwards\u2014start with the string and see if it can be reduced to the start symbol S. For that, I'll use a method called \"reduction\" where I check each part of the string to find a production that could produce that part.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S has the productions:\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, S can produce pairs of non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals will have their own productions. For example, NT21 can produce various combinations, and so on.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first step is to see if the entire string can be generated by one of these initial productions. For instance, the first few terms are t14, t12, t54, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see productions that map to terminals. For example, NT14 -> 't14', NT12 -> 't12', etc.\n\nBut to see if S can produce the string, the string should be a concatenation of the terms derived from the initial productions of S.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so perhaps the parse tree is constructed in a way that each node corresponds to a production which eventually leads to terminals. Since S has three initial productions, the string would need to be the concatenation of the sequences generated by those initial non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into the left and right parts of one of the initial productions. For example, the initial S can produce NT21 and NT28, so the string should have the left part NT21 producing some sub-string followed by NT28 producing another sub-string.\n\nLooking more closely at the grammar, each of the NTs (like NT21, NT28) have their own productions. For example:\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT29, or NT26 NT6, etc.\n\nAnd looking at the string, the first part is 't14 t12 t54 t84 t41 t28 t3 t50 t41 t43 t28 t71 t36 t0 t40 t28 t30 t14 t6 t66 t30 t66 t84 t6 t50 t8 t30 t71 t14 t28 t40 t3 t71'.\n\nHmm, this is quite long. Let me see if I can break it down. The string starts with t14, which is a terminal produced by NT14. Looking at the grammar, NT14 has the following productions:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7\nNT14 -> NT15 NT7\nNT14 -> NT71 -> 't71'\nNT14 -> 't65'\nNT14 -> 't51'\n\nSo, NT14 can produce 't71', 't65', 't51', or via other productions, like NT14 -> NT34 NT7.\n\nThen, the grammar also has NT14 -> 't65', 't51', etc. Similarly, NT12 has NT12 -> 't16', 't14', etc.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t14, which is produced by NT14. Let me check. For example, looking at the string, the first token is t14, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, to generate t14, the non-terminal must be something that can directly produce t14. Looking at the grammar, let's check which NTs can produce t14.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT14 -> 't65', 't51', etc., so no direct production for t14. So, to get t14, it's via a two-step process where NT14 is part of a production that eventually reduces to t14.\n\nWait, no: NT14 has a production that's NT14 -> 't14' but looking back, wait, in the grammar provided, under NT14 I see:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT1, NT14 -> NT15 NT7, NT14 -> NT2 (but wait, no, NTC items are in a different set. Wait, perhaps I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, in the grammar, under NT14 I see:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT1\nNT14 -> NT15 NT7\nNT14 -> NT2 (Is this a typo? Wait, looking back, I think in the full list of rules, I might have to check correctly. Let me scan the rules for NT14.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT14 appears in several rules, some are:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT1\nNT14 -> NT15 NT7\nNT14 -> NT2 (Wait, is there a direct production where NT14 -> NT2?)\n\nWait, looking for NT14 -> NT2: no, looking through all the rules carefully, I don't see that. So perhaps NT14 doesn't have a direct production leading to NT2. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check more carefully:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\nUnder NT14: \nNT14-> NT2 (Wait, no, maybe.

It's in CNF, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the parsing can be done using aCYK algorithm or checking step by step.\n\nThe string has 35 tokens. I'll try to see if it can be parsed step by step. But given the complexity, maybe I should look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol S has productions:\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 something. The string starts with `t23 t14 t51...`. Let's see which production could possibly start with t23.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT21: several productions, including NT26 NT6, NT18 NT32, etc. Maybe NT21 can produce t23?\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT23 is a non-terminal. It has:\nNT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27\nNT22 \u2192 NT29 NT2\nNT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9, etc. It's possible that NT23 could derive a t23 via a chain.\n\nWait, looking at the list of productions, each NT has several options. For example, NT33 \u2192 NT33 NT19 and others. Some non-terminals directly produce t's like NT5 \u2192 t41.\n\nLooking for 't23' in the string, it appears multiple times at positions 1, 15, 21, etc. So we need to see how 't23' could be produced.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see NT23 appears in several productions. For example, NT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24, but not directly t23. Let me check if any NT directly produces t23.\n\nLooking through the list, NT23's productions don't produce t23 directly. The only NT that might produce t23 is none, because searching through the list of NTs, I don't see any production that directly outputs 't23'. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules above, the NT tokens are defined as follows:\n\nLooking for 't23', I see that in the list, there's NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27, and others. But none of the NTs produce 't23' directly. The only NTs that produce terminals are ones like NT5 \u2192 t41, NT17 \u2192 t14, etc. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe NT23 can derive a t23 via a chain. Let's see. For example, NT23 can go to NT22 NT27. Then NT22 can go to NT29 NT2. NT29 can go to NT27 NT22. This seems to be a recursive path without producing any terminal except maybe t23. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the start symbol S. The production S \u2192 NT21 NT28. The string starts with t23, which is the first t. So if the first symbol is t23, maybe the first step is that S \u2192 NT21 NT28, but NT21 would have to produce a t23, which seems not possible because the productions of NT21 don't directly produce t23.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT14, which appears in multiple productions. NT14 has several outputs, including NT34 NT7 and others. Also, looking for 't14' in the string: it appears at positions 2, 7, 13, etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with t23, but the first production of S is NT21 NT28. Let's check if any of NT21's productions can start with t23. For example, NT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24, but that would lead to another t21. It's unclear how we get a t23.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong parts. Wait, the string starts with t23, but if S produces NT20 NT25, could NT20 produce a t23? Or NT14? Hmm.\n\nWait, let's list the positions of 't23' in the string to see how they can be generated:\nPositions: 0, 15, 21.\n\nAt position 0: t23.\nSo the parse tree must have a node that produces t23 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t23. So how is that possible? Maybe I'm missing something in the productions. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27\nNT22 \u2192 NT29 NT2\nNT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9\nNT9 \u2192 NT26 NT34\nNT26 \u2192 NT28 NT22\nNT22 \u2192 NT18 NT32\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23\nNT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27 (again)\nWait, this seems like an infinite loop. Maybe NT23 can't produce a terminal. So how does 't23' appear in the string?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's produced by a deeper derivation. Let's see if there's a way to get t23 through a chain of productions.\n\nLooking at NT23 again, it's part of a loop. Maybe it's produced through multiple NTs. However, if none of the NTs directly produce t23, it's impossible to have a t23 as the first symbol.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar because 't23' doesn't appear in the start symbol's productions. Or maybe I missed a production that directly produces t23.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and there is a production I'm not seeing. Let me double-check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the list again, I don't see any NT that directly outputs 't23', but perhaps via some chain. Wait, perhaps another NT produces 't23' indirectly.\n\nWait, looking at NT33, NT19, etc., but they don't seem to produce t23.\n\nWait, perhaps it's produced via a longer chain, but since 't23' appears at the beginning, I can't see how without a direct production of t23.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 'No, the string is not generated by the grammar because 't23' is not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is on the left side. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see the start symbol is S, and it has productions like S \u2192 NT2 NT28, etc. Each non-terminal (like NT2, NT3, etc.) has their own productions leading eventually to terminals. The terminals are the t's followed by numbers, except for a few like 't28', 't14', etc., which are treated as individual terminals.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I can try to parse it using the grammar rules. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can model it as a recursive descent parser or construct a parse tree. However, manually constructing a full parse tree for such a long string might be time-consuming, so I'll look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each production step in the grammar could generate the given tokens. I notice that many non-terminals expand into a pair of non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t6. Let me see which non-terminals produce t6. Checking the grammar, I see rules like NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT5. Also, some terminals are defined as such, like NT6 \u2192 't68'. Wait, no\u2014NT6 is a non-terminal, and in the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't68'\u2014so it directly produces t68. Wait, no. Wait, looking back, some of the right-hand sides are combinations like 'nt28' or 'nt10', and others like 't28' is a terminal. So for example, NT28 has rules like NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, etc., and some have terminals like 't50', 't77', etc. So NT28 \u2192 't50' is a production, which would produce the terminal t50 when expanded.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list out the productions for a few non-terminals that have terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' \u2014 so NT5 produces t41 directly.\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' \u2014 NT17 directly produces t14.\n- NT2 \u2192 't23' \u2014 NT2 directly produces t23.\n- NT7 \u2192 't3' \u2014 NT7 directly produces t3.\n- NT18 \u2192 't66' \u2014 NT18 produces t66.\n- NT27 \u2192 't22' and 't9', but looking at NT27's rules: NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9 and others. Also, NT27\u2192 't22' directly. Wait, looking at the grammar: NT27 \u2192 't22' \u2014 so when NT27 expands, it can produce t22.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 't61', 't17', 't11', 't10', etc. So for example, NT0 directly produces t61, t17, t11, etc.\n\nSo, given the string starts with t6, t14, t14, etc., I need to see if the initial expansion can produce these.\n\nLet's take the string step by step. The string is a sequence of tokens. Let me list them:\n\n1. t6\n2. t14\n3. t14\n4. t51\n5. t66\n6. t68\n7. t54\n8. t43\n9. t38\n10. t54\n11. t40\n12. t60\n13. t69\n14. t22\n15. t34\n16. t41\n17. t6\n18. t22\n19. t8\n20. t69\n21. t8\n22. t28\n23. t36\n24. t60\n25. t22\n26. t28\n27. t11\n28. t36\n29. t40\n30. t28\n31. t54\n32. t77\n33. t71\n34. t12\n\nStarting with S, which is the start symbol. Looking at the productions of S: S \u2192 NT2 NT28. So the first symbol is the result of NT2 and NT28.\n\nIn the string, the first token is t6. So either NT2 or NT28 must derive to t6. Looking at NT2's productions: one of them is \u2192 't23' directly, which doesn't produce t6. So NT2 probably needs to derive further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe NT2 is a non-terminal that can expand into other non-terminals until it reaches a terminal. For example, NT2 \u2192 't23' in one of its rules, so if NT2 can derive to t23, then the first symbol being t6 doesn't match NT2, which directly produces t23. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the first t6 comes from another non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the productions wrong. Let me look again at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t6:\n\nFrom the grammar, let's search for any production where a non-terminal directly expands to t6.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'? Wait, no, NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 't68' as per the rules provided. Wait, no: looking back, in the grammar, NT6's rules are multiple: NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT5; also, NT6 appears in some other productions like NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9 and others. Also, I see a production: NT6 \u2192 't68' \u2014 wait no, let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided under \"Grammar:\", the relevant rules are:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\nWait, no, looking more carefully, the line is: NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9, but I see a rule: NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9. Wait, I'm looking for any rule where a non-terminal goes directly to t6.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces t6. All the non-terminals that expand to terminals eventually go through a chain. For example, NT2 \u2192 't23' is a direct production.\n\nWait, that's an issue\u2014Wait, no, wait. Let's re-examine the grammar provided. The user has provided a long list of production rules. Let me look for any rule where a non-terminal produces a single terminal symbol t6.\n\nLooking through, I notice that NT17 \u2192 't14', which is a direct production. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't23', NT14 \u2192 't51', etc. But nowhere in the provided rules do I see a non-terminal that directly produces 't6'. Hmm, that's a problem. Then perhaps the initial token t6 comes from a non-terminal that eventually expands through multiple steps to t6.\n\nWait, but without a production that directly produces t6, it's impossible to derive t6 as a single token unless another non-terminal produces it in a chain. But that would require that some NT produces a series of symbols that eventually resolve to t6, but given that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT2 NT28, and unless NT2 or NT28 can derive to t6, it's impossible to start with t6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar to see if any non-terminal directly produces t6.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe user provided:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\nWait, no, that's not correct. The rules are listed line by line. Let me search for 't6' in the RHS of any production:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nLooking at line by line:\n\nLine 5: NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT26 \u2014 no t6.\n\nLine 7: NT31 \u2192 NT25 NT13 \u2014 no t6.\n\nLine 9: NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0 \u2014 no.\n\nLine 10: NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT5 \u2014 no.\n\nWait, I think I'm looking at it wrong. Let me actually list out all the RHS where a terminal is present.\n\nLooking through each production right-hand side (RHS):\n\nLine"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-652","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) for context-free grammars has each production rule of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are pairs of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is: \n\n`t41 t28 t66 t23 t60 t70 t56 t14 t23 t30 t28 t14 t11 t0 t69 t12 t8 t14 t68 t75 t41 t28 t14 t14 t71 t30 t8 t84 t68 t22 t40 t41 t6 t31`\n\nI notice that the string is made up of various tokens like 't41', 't28', etc. From the production rules provided, some of these tokens appear under certain conditions. For example, NT5 is followed by NT7, which could produce 't41', or NT25 followed by NT1 produces 't77', and so on.\n\nI think a good approach would be to try and derive the string step by step using the given rules. Since the string is quite long, starting with the beginning symbols and seeing if we can expand them to match this string.\n\nThe starting symbols in the grammar are S, and according to the rules, S can expand into four different options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n4. S \u2192 NT32 NT2 (Wait, is this possible? Because NT32 NT2 leads to another production.)\n\nLooking at the string, the first tokens are 't41', 't28', which makes me think that the expansion might start with S \u2192 NT5 NT7, which is 't41' and 't28' if NT5 \u2192 't41' and NT7 \u2192 't28'. Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nFrom the rules, NT5 can produce 't41' directly (NT5 \u2192 't41'). So if NT5 is expanded to 't41', then the next step is to look at NT7. NT7 can produce 't28' only if there's a rule NT7 \u2192 't28'. Looking back at the rules, I don't see NT7 directly producing 't28'. Wait, actually, I think NT7 can produce NT26 NT2. NT26 can produce 't28' if we expand it. Let me check: NT26 \u2192 't28' looking at the rules where NT26 is a production. Yes, for example, NT17 \u2192 't26' and NT22 \u2192 't33' etc. But wait, NT26's production is in the rules like NT26\u2192 NT34 NT2, and NT26\u2192 NT32 NT9? Hmm, not directly. Wait, no, let's look again.\n\nActually, looking through the rules, I don't see NT7 directly producing anything except NT26 NT2. So, if we go that route, NT7 would expand to NT26 NT2. But then, NT26 can further be expanded, perhaps leading to 't28'. Let me see if NT26 can produce 't28'. Checking the rules for NT26:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT34 NT2\n\nNT34 can produce 't30' or 't14' (looking at NT34 rules). So if NT34 is 't30', then NT2 could produce 't28'? Wait, NT2 can produce 't28'? Let me check NT2's rules.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT2: NT2\u2192 NT5 NT18. NT5 is already 't41', and NT18 can produce 't38' perhaps. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, is there a way for NT2 to directly produce anything? No, NT2's production is only to NT5 NT18, which would be 't41' followed by whatever NT18 produces.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's try to build the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't41' 't28', so perhaps S must first produce (NT5)(NT7), which is 't41' and then something that can produce 't28'. \n\nIf NT7 \u2192 NT26 NT2, then NT26 needs to produce something that can yield 't28'. Looking at NT26's production: \n\nNT26 \u2192 NT34 NT2\n\nThen NT34 can be 't30' or 't14'. If NT34 is 't30', and then NT2 needs to produce 't28'. But NT2 only has one production NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT18, which would be 't41' followed by NT18. Wait, if NT18 can produce 't28'. Let me check NT18's productions: \n\nLooking at the rules, NT18\u2192 NT16 NT24, and NT16\u2192 NT29 NT7. Wait, that seems like a chain. Alternatively, NT18\u2192 NT20 NT0, which is 't69' followed by whatever NT0 produces. Or NT18\u2192 NT26 NT1 (which is 't28' and 't36')? Or maybe I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, the rules are in a list that's a bit hard to parse. Let me look for any NT18 \u2192 NT28, but I don't see that. Or perhaps NT18 can produce 't28' if something leads to that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe NT26 can go to 't28' through another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe string's first two tokens are 't41' and 't28'. So starting from S, if I expand S \u2192 NT5 NT7, which would be 't41' and then NT7 must expand to 't28'. But looking at NT7's productions, I don't have a direct 't28' production. NT7 can produce NT26 NT2. So that would make the first part 't41' and then NT7 as 't26' 't2', but that's three tokens, which doesn't match. Wait, no, because NT7 is a single symbol, so when we expand S, it's S \u2192 NT5 NT7, resulting in 't41' and whatever NT7 expands to. But in one step, NT7 would produce a sequence, which might lead to the second token being 't28'. So perhaps through expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT32 NT14 would be better. Let's see: 't41' is produced by NT5, and maybe another part.\n\nWait, looking at the start symbol, maybe there's another way. Let me check the production rules for S. Yes, S can produce NT21 NT28 or NT32 NT14. So possibly S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Let's see what NT32 and NT14 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT32's production: NT32\u2192 NT28 NT18. NT28 can produce 't50' or 't54' or other things. Wait, looking at the rules for NT28:\n\nNT28\u2192 NT27 NT0\n\nSo, NT28 would expand to whatever NT27 and NT0 produce. Let's look at NT27: NT27\u2192 NT9 NT9. So NT27 would produce two NT9s. Hmm. Wait, no, wait. NT27's rule is NT27\u2192 NT9 NT9. So when NT27 is expanded, it's two NT9s in a sequence.\n\nWait, then NT28 would produce ND27 followed by NT0, which is 't69' or something else?\n\nI think I'm getting lost. Maybe I should approach this differently.

{"custom_id":"request-671","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is quite extensive, with multiple production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens like `t68`, `t84`, etc. \n\nFirst off, I remember that a context-free grammar uses production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side can be either two non-terminals, two terminals, or a mix. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems all the production rules are in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT2 NT28 means that the non-terminal S can be replaced by two other non-terminals NT2 and NT28. Similarly, other rules follow this pattern.\n\nNow, the string in question is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Each token looks like `tX`, where X is a number. At first glance, these tokens resemble terminals in the grammar. So, my task is to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules.\n\nI need to approach this step by step. Since the grammar is complex with many production rules, it might be challenging to parse manually. I think the best way is to try to break down the string into a sequence of non-terminals that can lead back to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list out the string again: `t68 t84 t6 t70 t70 t6 t84 t23 t0 t8 t84 t28 t14 t84 t23 t30 t23 t49 t22 t8 t84 t23 t50 t70 t43 t10 t50 t41 t17 t50 t14 t7 t66 t84`.\n\nEach `tX` is a terminal symbol. So, I need to see if these can be generated by expanding the starting symbol S through the given production rules.\n\nStarting from S, which can be expanded into three options: S \u2192 NT2 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, or S \u2192 NT20 NT25. So each production of S generates two non-terminals. \n\nI'll need to see if the string can be produced by expanding these non-terminals. Let's try to go step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look for tokens that might correspond to immediate terminal outputs. For example, some of the production rules are terminals. For instance, look at the grammar rules, some of them are terminals. For example, NT0 -> 't61', so 't61' is a terminal that NT0 can derive. Similarly, NT1 -> 't29' and NT2 -> 't23' and others. \n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is `t68`. So I need to see if any of the non-terminals can produce 't68'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT6 -> 't68'. So, if NT6 is a non-terminal in the grammar, then 't68' can be produced by NT6.\n\nSimilarly, let's break down the first few tokens:\n\n1. `t68`: This is produced by NT6. So, somewhere in the derivation, we'll have NT6 \u2192 t68.\n\nNow, the token before `t68` is `t84`. I need to see if any non-terminal can produce `t84`. Looking at the grammar, NT84 might not be present, but wait, looking at the rules, I see that NT17 \u2192 't14', and NT7 \u2192 't3'. Wait, no, looking further, NT18 \u2192 't66', and NT23 \u2192 't43'. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the grammar includes rules like:\n- NT18 \u2192 't66'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT25 \u2192 't77'\n- NT27 \u2192 't71'\n- NT14 \u2192 't84'\n- etc.\n\nWait, for example, NT14 \u2192 't84' is a rule. Also, NT34 \u2192 't30', and NT24 \u2192 't22'. Hmm. \n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at the individual production rules, I see that some of them are terminals. So, for instance, NT14 \u2192 't84'. So, `t84` can be produced by NT14.\n\nSo, going back to the string, after `t68` comes `t84`. So, perhaps the derivation goes NT6 \u2192 t68, and then NT14 \u2192 t84. But wait, looking at the grammar, NT14 can indeed produce 't84', so that works.\n\nNow, the string is: `t68 t84 ...`. So, the production could be part of a larger structure. Let's consider how S is split. S can be split into (NT2, NT28), (NT32, NT14), or (NT20, NT25). So, if the string starts with `t68 t84`, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT68 and so on, but wait, S is only splitting into two non-terminals. So, in this case, how does S relate to the first token?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about the structure. The string starts with `t68`, which is the result of a non-terminal, say NT6. Then, to produce that, perhaps another non-terminal needs to be involved. Alternatively, maybe the initial non-terminal from S leads to a tree that eventually produces these terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is S splitting into two non-terminals, each of which can produce sequences that eventually yield these `t` tokens.\n\nWait, maybe I should structure this as a parse tree and see if the given string can be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a bit complex, perhaps I can look for direct derivations or patterns.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each token in the string is a terminal, so I need to find a way to derive these terminals from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the entire string, I notice that several tokens correspond to terminals present in the grammar. For example:\n\n- `t68` is from NT6\n- `t14` is from NT14\n- `t84` is from NT14\n- `t50` is from NT25\n- `t70` is from NT17? Wait, looking at the grammar: NT17 \u2192 't50'? Or is it NT17 \u2192 't14'? Wait, looking back, I see that NT17 \u2192 't50' is not present. Wait, in the grammar provided, looking through all the rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't61'\n- NT1 \u2192 't29'\n- NT2 \u2192 't23'\n- NT3 \u2192 't31'\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\n- NT8 \u2192 't27'\n- NT14 \u2192 't84'\n- NT25 \u2192 't77'\n- NT17 \u2192 't49'? Wait, in the grammar, NT17 is actually a non-terminal, and looking at the rules:\n\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules, I see that several are terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 t68, NT7 \u2192 t84, and others. Wait, let me find all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I notice that several of the productions are of the form NTX \u2192 'tY'. Let's list them all to see which terminals they generate:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\n- NT7 \u2192 't84'\n- NT8\u2192 't27'\n- NT14\u2192 't84'\n- NT15\u2192 't6'\n- NT16\u2192 various 't' tokens, e.g., 't10', 't36', etc.\n- NT17\u2192 't49', 't50', 't25', 't50'... Hmm, need to check each rule for NTx \u2192 'tY'.\n\nWait, let's go through the grammar rules provided and pick out all the terminal productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT2 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nThen, the rest are all NTx \u2192 NTy or NTx \u2192 'tY':\n\nLooking through all the NTx rules:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't8'? No, wait, in the grammar, NT21 isn't a terminal. Wait, looking through, I see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let's check each line:\n\nAfter S, starting from NT2:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29\n- NT31 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n- NT3 \u2192 ... etc.\n\nIn fact, most of the rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is S, which can produce combinations of non-terminals like NT2, NT3, etc. Each production is of the form A -> BC, which is typical for Chomsky normal form.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, but actually, all elements here are terminals because they end with numbers (like t28, t36, etc.). So my task is to see if this string can be derived by the grammar starting from S.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards and try to parse the string using the grammar's productions. Alternatively, I can simulate a top-down or bottom-up approach, but since the grammar is quite large, a top-down recursive descent might be time-consuming.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t28. Let's see which productions can generate t28. The non-terminals that produce t28 are NT28 in two cases: NT28 -> NT11 NT3 and NT28 -> NT27 NT0. So, t28 can be generated if there's a way to get NT28 and then expand further.\n\nLooking at the string, the last part ends with t61. The non-terminal that can produce t61 is NT0, because NT0 -> 't61'. So, the last symbol, t61, must come from NT0.\n\nSo, the string must end with a production that ends with NT0. Let's check the grammar: indeed, the rule NT0 -> 't61' exists.\n\nNow, looking at the part before t61 in the string: t14. What produces t14? The non-terminal NT14 has a production NT14 -> 't65' and NT14 -> 't51'. Wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, NT14 -> 't65' is it? Or does it have another production? Wait, the given rules include:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT14 appears in several productions. Let's list them:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT14 -> 't65' (line 11: NT14 -> NT34 NT7; wait, no, actually, NT14 is derived from other rules. Wait, the rules might not directly produce t14 except certain non-terminals. Let me check each rule.\n\nWait, the rules for NT14: in the given rules, NT14 is produced by NT34 NT7 (line 11: NT14 -> NT34 NT7) and NT14 -> NT5 NT28 (line 14: NT14 -> NT5 NT28) and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the given rules, looking for NT14:\n\n- Line 11: NT14 -> NT34 NT7\n- Line 14: NT14 -> NT5 NT28\n- Line 19: NT14 -> NT15 NT7\n- Line 20: NT14 -> NT12 NT24\n- Line 23: NT14 -> NT28 NT0\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because line 23: NT28 is another production. Wait, no, line 23: NT28 -> NT11 NT3, etc. So actually, for NT14, according to line 11: NT14 can be derived as NT34 NT7. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look at the rules again in order.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I see:\n\nLine 8: NT12 -> NT25 NT3\nLine 11: NT14 -> NT34 NT7\nLine 14: NT14 -> NT5 NT28\nLine 19: NT14 -> NT15 NT7\nLine 20: NT14 -> NT12 NT24\nLine 23: NT14 -> NT28 NT0\n\nSo, NT14 can be either NT34 NT7, NT5 NT28, etc., but none of these directly produce t14. So how does NT14 produce a terminal symbol?\n\nWait, looking at lines like NT17 -> 't14' (line 2: NT17 -> 't14'). So the non-terminal NT17 can produce 't14'. But the string has 't14' as part of it, so perhaps there's a NT17 somewhere producing 't14' and others.\n\nSo the string has 't14' somewhere, so the part before t61 must end with 't14', which comes from NT17 -> 't14'.\n\nSo the string before 't61' is part of a larger production.

{"custom_id":"request-691","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's see, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) consist of a start symbol, terminals, non-terminals, and production rules. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way the productions are structured, typically either as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in CNF since the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t77 t6 t84 t70 t71 t49 t22 t8 t71 t84 t71 t71 t38 t8 t70 t54 t6 t36 t43 t66 t50 t23 t40 t50 t50 t8 t22 t22 t71 t14 t41 t30 t38 t30 t14 t50`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it can produce different combinations of non-terminals. The first step is to see what's produced by S. The productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo, any string generated by the grammar must start with one of the first three symbols in these right-hand sides.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is `t77`. I need to check which non-terminals can produce `t77`.\n\nLooking at the productions, one of the rules is NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23. Wait, but in CNF, the right-hand side should have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Here, NT2 \u2192 ... and NT23 \u2192 ... seems more complex, but there's also a production NT5 \u2192 't41'.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me look for any non-terminals that produce 't77'. Scanning through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n- NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31\n- NT31 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n- NT13 \u2192 NT10 NT21\n- NT21 \u2192 NT19 NT26\n- NT19 \u2192 NT26 NT34\n- NT34 \u2192 NT16 NT1\n- NT16 \u2192 NT29 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT27 NT1\n- NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT2\n- Hmmm, this seems to be getting me nowhere. Maybe I should check the other way around. Let's see what NT1 is. Oh, wait, looking for where 't77' appears as a terminal in any rule.\n\nWait, in the list of rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't71'\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT9 \u2192 't84'\n- NT18 \u2192 't66'\n- Wait, but looking specifically, I see:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't49'\n- NT19 \u2192 't25'\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n- NT27 \u2192 't28'\n- NT18 \u2192 't43'\n- NT0 \u2192 't61'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT14 \u2192 't51'\n- NT32 \u2192 't54'\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT25 \u2192 't77' \n\nWait, here's NT25 \u2192 't77'. Oh, right! So the production NT25 \u2192 't77'. That means that the non-terminal NT25 can produce the string `t77`.\n\nLooking back at the start symbol S, one of the productions is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. If NT32 can produce something that starts with 't77', but NT32 doesn't directly produce 't77'. However, NT25 is a different non-terminal. Looking at S's productions again, the third option is S \u2192 NT20 NT25. So, if we have S \u2192 NT20 NT25, then the production would start with what NT20 produces, followed by 't77' (since NT25 \u2192 't77').\n\nWait, so to get the string starting with `t77`, we would need to have a production where one of the components is NT25 \u2192 't77'. But let's see:\n\nLooking at the first production of S: S \u2192 NT21 NT28. If either NT21 or NT28 can produce 't77', then maybe. But checking NT21's productions:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\nNT6 \u2192 NT10 NT31\nNT31 \u2192 NT25 NT13\nNT25 \u2192 't77'\nSo, NT21's production leads to NT25 \u2192 't77'. Therefore, S \u2192 NT21 NT28 can produce 't77' 'something'... Wait, no. Wait, the production is a sequence: S \u2192 NT21 NT28 means the string generated starts with whatever NT21 produces, followed by whatever NT28 produces.\n\nWait, but in order for the first symbol of the string to be 't77', that has to come from a terminal produced directly. So, perhaps a non-terminal that can produce 't77', like NT25. So, looking at the start symbol, S has a production S \u2192 NT20 NT25, so if NT20 can produce nothing (wait, no, NT20 is a non-terminal, it must produce something). Let me check NT20's productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32. So, NT20 can produce NT29 followed by NT32. Then, looking at NT29 and NT32:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT7 NT2\nNT7 \u2192 NT27 NT1\nNT27 \u2192 NT9 NT9\nNT9 \u2192 NT84 NT18\nWait, so that's a long chain. But none of these directly produce a terminal except maybe somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. Let me parse the string starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with `t77`. So, the first symbol must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't77'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT25 \u2192 't77'. Therefore, to start the string with 't77', one of the components derived from S's productions must produce 't77'.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo, to get 't77' as the first symbol, the NT25 in option 3 needs to produce it. So, S \u2192 NT20 NT25 would result in the first symbol being what NT20 produces, followed by 't77' (since NT25 \u2192 't77').\n\nBut wait, no. In the production, it's S \u2192 NT20 NT25, meaning after the first non-terminal (NT20) and the second non-terminal (NT25), but that's more about how the entire string is built from those non-terminals. So, each non-terminal in the production replaces to a string, which is then concatenated.\n\nSo, to get 't77' as the first symbol, that would require that either NT25 is directly the first symbol, or that the expansion of one of the non-terminals in a production starts with 't77'.\n\nBut looking at the production options, NT25 is the only one that directly produces 't77'. So, the production that includes NT25 would be the third option: S \u2192 NT20 NT25. Then, in the resulting string, the first part is derived from NT20 and followed by 't77'.\n\nSo, for the first symbol to be 't77', it would require that NT25 directly starts with 't77', but that's not the case. Wait, no, in the production S \u2192 NT20 NT25, NT20 would produce a string, say A, and NT25 would produce 't77'. So, the string would be A followed by 't77', meaning the second symbol is 't77' in that case. But our string starts with 't77', so we need either that the entire A is empty (which it can't be since in CFGs, a production must derive a terminal string, which includes the empty string only if allowed by the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is a non-terminal generating two non-terminals or a terminal. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I think are terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see how these terminals might appear.

NT33 -> t70, etc. Hmm, none of these directly start with t36, which suggests that maybe t36 is generated by a production starting with a different non-terminal that eventually expands to t36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe t36 is part of a longer derivation. Wait, looking again, I see NT5 -> 't41' and NT17 -> 't14'. But I don't see any production that gives t36 directly, so I might be missing something.\n\nPerhaps I need to backtrack and see how t36 can be formed. Looking at the grammar, I see NT3 -> 't12', but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the initial non-terminal sequences can generate this string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar's non-terminals can't produce the first t36 symbol because none of the NT symbols directly produce that. So, maybe the string isn't in the language.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I've missed a production. Let me quickly scan the grammar again for terms that might generate t36. No, I don't see any NT -> t36. So, it's impossible to derive t36 as a terminal because there's no production for that. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided string includes the terminal symbol 't36', but the grammar does not have any production rule that directly or indirectly derives 't36'.

Both the grammar and the string are quite complex, so I'll need to carefully analyze them.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF is. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B, C are non-terminals or terminals. Looking at the grammar provided, most rules are in CNF, except for the one starting with NT2, which has more non-terminals on the right-hand side. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT21 NT28  \nS \u2192 NT32 NT14  \nS \u2192 NT20 NT25  \nS \u2192 NT32 NT2\n\nThese all are fine; each is a single non-terminal on the left and two on the right, so they\u2019re in CNF.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29  \nNT31 \u2192 NT34 NT1  \n... and so on.\n\nLooking through, I notice some non-terminals like NT31 have two non-terminals on the right, which is okay since they\u2019re in CNF. But wait, I see that NT21 has a production with several non-terminals, maybe more than two, like NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6. No, all seem to have two non-terminals on the right, so it's fine.\n\nNow, the string consists of a sequence of terminals, which are all the 't' followed by numbers. The string is a series of these symbols, which I assume correspond to terminal symbols in the grammar. Since it's a sequence of terminals, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions in the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, we can think of it as a right-recursive parser, possibly using something like the CYK algorithm to parse the string. Alternatively, since it's CNF, we can parse it using a recursive descent parser with lookaheads.\n\nBut manually doing that is going to be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to construct the parse tree for this string.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in a parse tree for a CNF grammar, each node has exactly two children, and each production is applied top-down, so the entire parse tree must be a full binary tree with S as the root.\n\nBut given the string's length is 40, the parse tree would have about 39 internal nodes, which is quite large. It's not feasible to manually check each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or substitution that can be applied.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see what terminals are present: t84, t23, t50, t66, t43, t14, t6, t3, t70, t0, t77, t12, t1, etc. Some of these are unique, like t77, t70, t18 (but there's no t18 here), and some repeat, like t14, t50, t84 appearing multiple times.\n\nI notice that several of the terminals correspond to NT rules, which are the non-terminals in the grammar. For example, NT84 -> 't84', which is a rule because in the grammar, NT84 isn't a non-terminal (since I don't see any NT entries with '84'). Wait, looking back, I see that some of the non-terminals have rules ending with 't' like 't28', 't14', etc. But 't84' doesn't seem to be a terminal; perhaps it's a terminal symbol because it's just 't' followed by a number. But wait, in the grammar, NT17 \u2192 't14', so it's substituting a terminal string that starts with 't'.\n\nWait, no, 't28' is in the grammar under NT28: NT28 \u2192 't50', but looking back, I see that NT28 is defined as NT27 NT0, and NT0 can be various things. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify which symbols are terminals and which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, the start symbol is S, and all other symbols are non-terminals (like NT2, NT3, etc.), but some non-terminals produce terminals (e.g., NT17 \u2192 't14'). So, in that case, the terminals are 't' followed by a number, and the non-terminals are the NT... symbols.\n\nSo, in the string, all symbols are terminals because they are 't' followed by numbers. Therefore, when constructing the parse tree for a CNF grammar, each leaf must be matched to a terminal rule, and internal nodes are non-terminals with two children.\n\nSo, the first thing to check is: Are there any productions in the grammar that correspond directly to the terminals in the string. For example, do we have any NT that directly produce one of the terminals in the string?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' \n- NT8 \u2192 't27' (NT8 is defined in multiple places, like NT8 \u2192 NT27 NT6, but also with t27 sometimes?)\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT27 NT6\n- NT8 \u2192 NT8 NT11\n- NT8 \u2192 NT29 NT6\n- NT8 \u2192 NT8 NT1\nBut wait, under NT8, I don't see any production that produces a terminal like 't84' or 't23' because in the given rules, the NT8 doesn't have a production that ends with 't84' or 't23'. Instead, the only NT8 \u2192 't27' is under NT28. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3. But under NT11, perhaps there's a rule that produces 't25' or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting too confusing. Maybe I should approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, the string is `t84 t23 t50 t66 t43 t50 t14 t6 t3 t6 t70 t0 t66 t6 t12 t77 t0 t84 t38 t52 t52 t54 t14 t69 t71 t14 t14 t23 t14 t50 t41 t43 t41 t71 t36 t40 t84`.\n\nEach of these is a terminal. To parse this, each of these terminals must be produced by a non-terminal production rule. Therefore, we need to find for each terminal symbol, which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see which NT rules produce terminals:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT8 \u2192 't27' (I think under NT28, not directly NT8. Let me check NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT3, but NT24 is another rule: NT24 \u2192 NT22 NT23, etc. Hmm, perhaps not NT8.)\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, the grammar does have entries where NT corresponds to a terminal:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't50' (Wait, in the grammar, I see NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0, but also NT8 is another non-terminal. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the entries are like:\n\nFor example, under NT16, there's NT16 \u2192 't6'.\n\nSo, each of the 't' symbols corresponds to a non-terminal that can derive that string. So, for example, if a 't84' appears in the string, we need to find a non-terminal NT that can produce 't84' when expanded.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' (Yes)\n- NT8 \u2192 't27' (Wait, actually, in the grammar, I think NT28 is defined as a series of non-terminals, but looking at the end of the given rules, there are some NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the last lines:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't27' (Wait, I need to look at all the rules again because it's a bit jumbled. Since the user listed a lot of production rules with right-hand sides, it's tedious to find which produce terminals, but perhaps I can note that some of them are directly producing terminals, such as:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT24 \u2192 't71'\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar rules for better visualization. Starting from S, the grammar has several productions, each producing pairs of non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc. Then, many other non-terminals produce combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t70 t68 t71 t28 t49 t38 t43 t77 t6 t22 t22 t71 t66 t3 t28 t49 t84 t3 t71 t28 t60 t25 t38 t40 t52 t50 t71 t14 t84 t3 t71 t36 t65 t68 t70 t68 t84`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. Let's start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the possible ways the string could have been generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces combinations of two non-terminals. For instance, S \u2192 NT21 NT28. So, the initial symbols derived from S would involve expanding NT21 and NT28 into their respective components. Each NT is a non-terminal that eventually produces a terminal or another combination. \n\nI think a good approach would be to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using a method like recursive descent or using a tree structure. Since the string is quite long, I'll need to break it down systematically.\n\nLet me list out the steps I would take:\n\n1. Identify the start symbol S and see which productions it can take.\n2. The string starts with t70, which is a terminal. I need to find a production in the grammar where a non-terminal produces t70 or part of the string leading up to t70.\n3. Looking into the non-terminals, t70 is produced by which NT? Scanning through the rules, I see that several NTs have productions that include terminals.\n\nLet's see the production rules that produce t's:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 NT7 NT22\n- NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT18\n- NT1 \u2192 NT29 NT14\n- NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT17\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT27 NT1\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT0\n- NT9 \u2192 NT26 NT34\n- NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT1 (Wait, I think I might have duplicate rules here.)\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I should look for any non-terminal that directly produces t70.

{"custom_id":"request-731","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can have a terminal at the beginning or end. Looking at the grammar, most of the productions are in CNF, but some have single terminals like NT5 \u2192 't41'. That's allowed in CNF since the right-hand side can be a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, I think this grammar is in CNF.\n\nNext, the given string is a series of terminals separated by spaces: `t10 t71 t71 t10 t54 t43 t7 t6 t7 t41 t84 t68 t66 t32 t84 t71 t60 t25 t14 t3 t68 t6 t25 t8 t22 t71 t84 t23 t65 t3 t71 t60 t84 t71 t3 t38 t0 t11`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the start symbol is S, the entire string must be a sentential form derived from S through a series of productions. \n\nI'll start by checking the depth of the string. The longest production in the grammar is either 2 or sometimes, like NT6 \u2192 't68', which is only one terminal, but since CNF allows single terminals, I need to consider that.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, most productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. But wait, some have only one terminal, like NT6 \u2192 't68'. Hmm, but in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So the RHS of a production in CNF can be either one terminal or two non-terminals. So in this case, all productions seem to fit.\n\nNow, the string is 39 symbols long. Let's see if we can parse it using the grammar.\n\nLooking for possible splits, perhaps starting from the left. Let's see if there are possible rules that can split the string. For example, S \u2192 NT21 NT25.\n\nBut looking at the string, it starts with t10, which is a terminal. So maybe we need to find a production that starts with t10. Looking at the RHS of the productions, I see NT10 \u2192 't32' and NT10 \u2192 't33 NT24', but 't32' is a single terminal. Wait, there's a production NT10 \u2192 't32', but no production that starts with t10 as a terminal directly. Wait, looking back, I see NT10 \u2192 't0' as one of the productions. Hmm, but in the string, the first symbol is t10, which isn't directly present as a terminal in any non-terminal's RHS except in NT10 \u2192 't0', which is t0, not t10.\n\nWait, looking deeper, I see that there's a production NT24 \u2192 't22', NT22 \u2192 't18', etc. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet's attempt to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the top symbol S.\n\nPossible approach: find a production for S that matches the beginning of the string. The given grammar has three options for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT25\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t10. So let's see if any of these productions can emit t10 at the start.\n\nLooking at the RHS:\n\n1. NT21 NT25: Both are non-terminals. So the first symbol would be a non-terminal, but the string starts with t10, which is a terminal. So this production can't be the start here.\n\n2. NT32 NT14: Both are non-terminals. Same issue as above. \n\n3. NT20 NT25: Both non-terminals. Same problem.\n\nSo none of the S productions directly start with terminals. Hmm, that's odd because S is the start symbol and in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals or a terminal, but in this case, the start productions are only non-terminals. So how does the string start with a terminal?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The start symbol is S, and S can derive the first symbols of the string being a combination of non-terminals. So perhaps the first step would be to have S \u2192 NT21 NT25, and then each of those NTs derive into terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, but S would derive into two non-terminals, so the string would start with the first non-terminal's expansion. So the first part of the string should be a valid expansion from the first non-terminal, and the second non-terminal would produce the rest.\n\nLooking at the string again: it starts with t10. So perhaps the first non-terminal (NT21 or NT32 or NT20) must produce t10.\n\nSo, let's look for any production of NT21, NT32, or NT20 that can derive t10.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check NT21's productions:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29\nNT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\nNT21 has no other productions. So NT21 can only produce sequences of other symbols. It doesn't directly produce t10.\n\nLooking at NT32:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20\nNT32 \u2192 NT28 NT18\nNT32 \u2192 NT11 NT3\nNT32 \u2192 NT27 NT0\nNT32 \u2192 NT22 NT33\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23\nNT32 \u2192 NT31 NT16\nSo NT32 again doesn't have a production that starts with t10.\n\nLooking at NT20:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT4 NT13\nNT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32\nNT20 \u2192 NT11 NT25\nNT20 \u2192 NT25 NT3\nNT20 \u2192 NT21 NT26\nNT20 \u2192 NT6 NT1\nLooking at these, NT20 doesn't directly produce t10 either.\n\nHmm, this is confusing because the initial symbol of the string is t10, but according to the productions, S \u2192 NT21 NT25, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25, none of which can start with a terminal. So how can the string start with t10? Maybe I made a mistake in considering whether the start symbol can produce t10 directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost symbol in any sentential form must be a non-terminal. Therefore, the string starts with t10, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, S's productions only produce non-terminals, so the string cannot start with a terminal. Therefore, this string cannot be generated by the grammar because it starts with t10, a terminal, when every expansion from S starts with a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the productions for NT21, NT32, NT20 include terminals. Wait, no, looking again, all the productions for NT21, NT32, NT20 are combinations of other non-terminals. For example, NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29, etc. So there's no production for NT21 that produces a terminal, except in some cases where perhaps the NTs derive terminals themselves.\n\nWait, perhaps the NTs can derives into terminals through a chain of productions. For example, if NT21 can produce a terminal after some steps, but looking at the productions, it seems like NT21, NT32, and NT20 produce other non-terminals, and none of their productions introduce terminals for these specific NTs.\n\nWait, but looking at the provided rules, for example, NT26 \u2192 't28' is a production. So NT26 can become t28. But NT26 is derived from, say, NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0, and then NT6 might have some production that can reach t28. Wait, in NT26, the production is NT26 \u2192 't28' or NT26 \u2192 't26 NT22'. So if NT26 is part of the expansion, perhaps that could lead to a terminal.\n\nWait, but let's think: The string starts with t10. So perhaps one of the NTs derived from S must produce t10. For that, perhaps the NT20 \u2192 NT21 NT26 \u2192 NT6 NT0 NT26 \u2192 NT6 NT0 \u2192 etc.\n\nBut looking at the productions, NT6 \u2192 't68', which is a terminal, but in the context of NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Maybe the user made a mistake, but I'll proceed as given.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t6 t71 t28 t49 t34 t7 t77 t70 t23 t52 t84 t84 t50 t70 t43 t28 t84 t66 t71 t30 t60 t22 t84 t50 t66 t40 t71 t14 t28 t14 t75 t68 t60 t41 t54 t71 t70`.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, many non-terminals produce terminal strings. Let me list those:\n\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT33 -> 't33' (wait, 't33'? But in the string, it's 't70', etc. Maybe I need to check each production carefully.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list. For example, NT21 -> 't8', so that's an actual terminal production. Similarly, NT22 -> 't8', NT23 -> 't23', etc. Some of the non-terminals have mixed productions to terminals.\n\nSo, I think the approach is to see if the string can be derived step by step from the start symbol S. Let's look at the grammar productions again.\n\nThe start symbol S has three options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo any string generated by the grammar must start with the concatenation of two non-terminals from one of these options.\n\nLet's see the given string starts with t6 t6 t71 t28 t49...\n\nLooking at S's first step:\n\n- Option 1: S \u2192 NT21 NT28. NT21 produces t8, NT28 produces t50. So the first two tokens would be t8 and t50, which don't match the string's first two t6, t6.\n\n- Option 2: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Let's see what NT32 and NT14 produce. NT32: looking through the productions, NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT23. NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27. NT22 is a terminal 't8', and NT27 is another production: NT27 can be 't43' (wait, checking NT27: actually, NT27 has several productions: looking through, NT27 \u2192 NT22 NT9, or 't40', etc. Hmm, maybe I need to break this down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the start symbol's options, but perhaps the initial step is leading to t6, which might come from another production.\n\nWait, the string starts with t6 t6. Maybe I need to see if any production of S leads to a terminal starting with t6, t6...\n\nLooking at the given grammar, let's check for any non-terminals that produce t6. Scanning through the productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT8, maybe? Wait, I see several NT productions to terminal strings like 't14', 't61', etc.\n\nLooking for 't6' in the productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\n- NT10 \u2192 't32'\n- NT13 \u2192 't6'\n- NT14 \u2192 't65', 't61', 't51'\n- NT15 \u2192 't6'\n- NT16 \u2192 't6', 't10', 't66', 't84', 't38', 't14', 't40', etc.\n- NT18 \u2192 't66'\n- NT20 \u2192 't31', 't29', 't32'\n- NT21 \u2192 't8', 't69', etc.\n- NT22 \u2192 't8', 't28', etc.\n- NT23 \u2192 various 't's.\n- NT25 \u2192 't54', 't77', 't20', etc.\n- NT26 \u2192 't28', 't71', etc.\n- NT27 \u2192 't43', 't14', etc.\n- NT28 \u2192 't50', 't14', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't31', 't12', etc.\n- NT31 \u2192 't75', 't30', etc.\n- NT32 \u2192 't54', 't31', etc.\n- NT34 \u2192 't14', 't30', 't34', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't68' (but we can't produce that first t6)\n- NT7 \u2192 't3'\n- NT8 \u2192 several 't's, including 't6' in some productions\n- NT11 \u2192 't6'\n- NT12 \u2192 't16', 't14', etc.\n- NT16 \u2192 't6', 't10', etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 't14', 't28', etc.\n- NT19 \u2192 't25', 't28'\n- NT21 has several, but initial 't8' or 't69'\n- NT23 \u2192 't43', etc.\n- NT24 \u2192 't22', 't30, 't28'?\n- NT26 \u2192 't71', 't28'?\n- NT29 \u2192 't7', 't60', 't27'...\n\nWait, the string starts with 't6', 't6', maybe NT10?\n\nLooking, NT10 \u2192 't32', or in some productions like 't12', 't0', etc. Alternatively, perhaps it's from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the string as a series of steps. But this could take a long time, as the string is quite long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of how the string is built from the start symbol and the possible expansions.\n\nOption S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nNT21 \u2192 't8'? No, because the string starts with 't6', so that first step might not fit.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string does start with 't6', which might come from NT11 \u2192 't6' or NT16 \u2192 't6', etc.\n\nLet me check NT11: NT11 \u2192 't6'. So in the string, the first three tokens are t6, t6, t71... So perhaps NT11 would produce t6, then another t6, but that would require something else. Or perhaps another way.\n\nWait, but maybe the string is structured in such a way that it can be derived through a series of steps, but considering the complexity, perhaps it's easier to approach this by using a CYK-like parsing or attempting to find a possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the string as being composed of certain non-terminals that can produce these t's.\n\nLooking at the string: t6, t6, t71, t28, t49, t34, t7, t77, t70, t23, t52, t84, t84, t50, t70, t43, t28, t84, t66, t71, t30, t60, t22, t84, t50, t66, t40, t71, t14, t28, t14, t75, t68, t60, t41, t54, t71, t70.\n\nThis is a long string. Let me try to see if I can find a possible chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the first symbol matches any production and then recursively check the rest.\n\nThe string starts with 't6', so I can look for non-terminals that produce 't6':\n\n- NT11 \u2192 't6'\n- NT16 \u2192 't6'\n- NT19 \u2192 't25', 't28' (wait, no: NT19 \u2192 't25'?

{"custom_id":"request-755","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t71 t36 t6 t3 t38 t32 t49 t8 t54 t41 t84 t84 t23 t71 t14 t71 t50 t41 t17 t3 t23 t84 t11 t36 t54 t66 t28 t30 t30 t14 t22 t14 t71 t70 t40 t36 t14 t6 t66`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that when a grammar is in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly. Also, for a CFG in CNF, the derivation process is such that each step either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven the grammar, I notice that most of the productions are in the form of NT X \u2192 NT Y NT Z. Some exceptions are rules like NT17 \u2192 't14' and NT0 \u2192 't61', etc., where the production directly results in a terminal symbol instead of non-terminals. So, these terminals are the \"leaves\" of the parse tree, and the grammar's structure is that of a binary tree.\n\nThe goal is to see if the given string can be produced by the grammar. One approach is to parse the string top-down using the grammar, which can be done using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since writing CYK is time-consuming, maybe I can look for patterns or specific rules that might match the string.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to consider that in a CNF grammar, the length of the derived string must be 2^n, where n is the number of productions. For example, starting from S, each production doubles the number of symbols. So, for the initial S, it's length 1. Applying one production would give two symbols, but each of those could be non-terminals, so the string length after one step is 2, but after two steps, it's 4, etc. So if the string's length is not a power of two, it's likely not generated by this grammar.\n\nLooking at the given string, let's count the number of tokens. The string is a sequence of t's and numbers, each separated by spaces. Counting them: 39 tokens. Hmm, 39 is not a power of two. The closest powers of two are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). 39 is between them, so it's not a power of two. Therefore, according to the properties of CNF grammars, this string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but I should make sure. Is it possible that the start symbol can be rewritten to a string of non-terminals that result in a non-power of two length? Let me think. Each production step with non-terminals doubles the number of symbols. So starting from S (length 1), after one step, the symbols expanded would be two non-terminals, making length 2. Then each of those non-terminals would expand in the next step, but if they are non-terminals, they each would produce two symbols, resulting in length 4, and so on. However, if some of the non-terminals produce terminals instead, that might change the count.\n\nBut actually, in CNF, each production either introduces terminals or non-terminals. If a production leads to a terminal symbol, that would increase the length by one (since one non-terminal is replaced by one terminal). Wait, no: in CNF, productions are either of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 terminal. So, the derivation steps would proceed as follows:\n\n- Start with a single non-terminal (S).\n\n- Each application of a production rule either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (expanding the string length by +1 at each level, leading to a power of two increase each time) or replaces it with a terminal (increasing the length by 1).\n\nBut the exact length is determined by the number of terminals and non-terminals in the derivation path. For example, if during derivation, all non-terminals are replaced by terminals in a single step, the length would be 2^n, but if they are replaced later on, the count could vary.\n\nWait, perhaps I was mistaken before. Let me clarify: each production replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, each step increases the number of symbols by 1 (since one non-terminal is turned into two). Therefore, the number of symbols in the string after n steps is 1 more than before. Wait, no: starting with one symbol, each production step replaces one symbol with two, so the length becomes previous length -1 + 2 = previous length +1. So after m steps, the length is m +1. So to reach a string of length L, it would require m = L-1 steps.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because for CNF, each production step produces two non-terminals. So starting from S, after one step, you have two non-terminals. Then, each of those can be replaced in the next step, doubling again. So, for example:\n\n- After 1 step: 2 symbols (both non-terminals)\n\n- After 2 steps: 4 symbols\n\n- After 3 steps: 8 symbols\n\nSo the length would be 2^n, where n is the number of times we've applied the non-terminal productions. But if some of those non-terminals are replaced by terminals, then their expansion doesn't create new non-terminals, so the branching factor changes.\n\nWait, no: each production step for non-terminals replaces one with two, so each application increases the count by 1. However, when a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, it doesn't add to the count because it just replaces one with one. So the overall length of the string can vary.\n\nThis means that the length doesn't necessarily have to be a power of two, but the structure is that of a binary tree where some leaves are terminals and others are non-terminals. The exact length can be anything, depending on when and how non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut let me check the given string. It has 39 symbols. Is 39 a possible length given that each production can eventually lead to terminals? For example, consider an initial production that after k steps, including some terminals, could result in a string of 39 symbols.\n\nBut 39 is an odd number, which is tricky because in a binary tree expansion, each level of non-terminals would double the number. Let's think about possible expansions. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2 (2 symbols, both non-terminals)\n\n- Each of those could branch further, but if at each step, a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, the count increases by 1 each time.\n\nBut 39 is an odd number, which complicates things because starting from 1 (S), each non-terminal replacement would double the count, but terminals only contribute a +1 per replacement.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: check if all the symbols in the string correspond to the productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given string, the tokens are t71, t36, t6, t3, t38, t32, t49, t8, t54, t41, t84, t84, t23, t71, t14, t71, t50, t41, t17, t3, t23, t84, t11, t36, t54, t66, t28, t30, t30, t14, t22, t14, t71, t70, t40, t36, t14, t6, t66.\n\nWait, some of the t's might be terminals.

However, looking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions are from non-terminals to pairs of non-terminals, without any terminals except for some specific cases like `NT21 -> 't8'` and others. Wait, actually, the grammar seems to have some terminals like 't71', 't60', etc., embedded within the productions, which might mean that after expanding the non-terminals, the terminals are generated.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, I thought all productions are non-terminals expanding to other non-terminals or terminals. But in the given grammar, the initial productions from S are all non-terminals, e.g., S -> NT21 NT28, which are pairs of non-terminals without any terminals. Then, further down, I see productions like NT3 -> 't20' which is a terminal. So, perhaps the grammar is in modified CNF, mixing terminals and non-terminals, but I'm not entirely sure. However, for the sake of this problem, let's proceed.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t71, t60, t71, t23, t71, t36, t68, t52, t56, t14, t14, t3, t36, t68, t23, t70, t14, t84, t28, t36, t32, t0, t14, t3, t6, t70, t60, t50, t70, t56, t3, t71, t66, t14, t12, t22, t54, t61, t61.\n\nI notice that the string is quite long, so perhaps a top-down parsing approach would be tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can look for possible leftmost derivations or check if the string can be represented by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the structure of the grammar and see if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules. Since the initial productions start with S, which branches into various non-terminals, I can think about which S rules are used to generate the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t71, t60, t71, t23, t71. Let me check which productions result in these terminals. I see that NT0 -> 't71' (from NT0 -> 't11'), NT15 -> 't6' (but that doesn't help here), NT10 -> 't32', etc. Wait, let me find NT that produce these t's.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice:\n\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT25 -> 't36'\n- NT12 -> 't14' (is this correct? Let me check the productions. NT12 -> NT4 NT0) Wait, no, in the given grammar, some NT have direct terminal outputs.\nWait, I see:\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT6 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT24 -> 't22'\n- NT14 -> 't65'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't41'\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't6'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT16 -> 't10'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT24 -> 't71'\n- NT14 -> 't84'\n- NT32 -> 't54'\n- NT21 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't52'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT23 -> 't56'\n- NT13 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't84'\n- NT19 -> 't22'\n- NT2 -> 't23'\n- NT17 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT31 -> 't75'\n- NT11 -> 't14'\n- NT8 -> 't27', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking for the NT that can generate the initial t71, t60, t71, t23, t71.\n\nBut some of the t's are terminals, like t71, t60, which are not directly generated by any NT. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should start by thinking about the top-level non-terminals. The given string begins with t71, which must come from some NT production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there any NT that directly produces a 't71'? From the provided rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t71. So perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with a terminal that the grammar doesn't have a production for. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, I see NT0 -> 't71', yes, because NT0: `NT0 -> 't71'`. So if the string starts with 't71', that would come from NT0.\n\nBut in the given grammar, the left-hand side of S is 'S -> NT21 NT28', 'S -> NT32 NT14', etc. So the start symbol S expands into pairs of non-terminals. Therefore, the first step in derivation would be to pick one of these options. Suppose we pick S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nFrom there, each non-terminal must be expanded. Let's say NT32 -> ... I need to check what NT32 expands into. From the grammar, NT32 -> NT5 NT18.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the grammar, I see that some lines are actually part of the same rule:\n\nFor example, the first four lines are S productions. Then, NT21 -> NT32 NT29,\nNT31 -> NT34 NT1,\nNT3 -> NT20 NT13,\nNT28 -> NT11 NT3,\nand so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is written in a way where each production is on a separate line, but they are not all presented in the beginning. So, for example, NT21 -> NT32 NT29; other productions for NT21 are listed later: NT21 -> NT6 NT0 and another earlier NT21. Wait, I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar provided, after the initial S productions, the grammar continues with other NT productions. For example:\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT6\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nSo, that suggests that NT21 has two productions: one to NT32 NT6 and another to NT6 NT0.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs appear to have multiple productions.\n\nSo, in the case of S -> NT32 NT14, each of NT32 and NT14 will have to be expanded.\n\nBut, focusing back on the string: the first symbol is 't71', which must come from some NT. Since I see that NT0 -> 't71', but in the S productions, I don't see S -> NT0 NT... anywhere. S starts as S -> NT21 NT28, etc.\n\nSo, to start, S must expand into two non-terminals, say A and B. Then, A and B must be expanded until terminals are produced.\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is t71, which is generated by NT0. So, that would require that the first expansion leads to NT0, which produces t71. So, in the entire derivation, somewhere along the way, we need to have a production that leads to NT0.\n\nBut looking at the start symbol S, the first expansion is to NT21 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can be checked for string generation using a few methods. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (all productions are either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a), that's helpful. I think the CYK algorithm might be an option, but with this many symbols, it might be time-consuming to apply manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the sequence of productions that would generate this string step by step. The string is a series of terminals, so each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal symbol. The grammar's rule S\u2192NT2 NT28 suggests that the string probably starts with NT2 and NT28, but the actual symbols generated might be different. Wait, the grammar has S transforming into NT2 NT28, but NT2 in the grammar is a non-terminal. Let me check: looking at the grammar, NT2 is defined as NT15 NT18. Hmm, okay, so S expands to NT15 NT18 NT28. But NT28 is defined as NT11 NT3, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this by trying to see what S can generate. S can be replaced by three different initial productions: S\u2192NT2 NT28, S\u2192NT32 NT14, or S\u2192NT20 NT25. Each of these NTs eventually lead to a sequence of terminals through their productions.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to see which NT in the grammar can produce the given string's tokens. Let's look at the first token in the string: 't84'. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't65'\n- NT15 \u2192 't6'\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' or 't49'\n- NT21 \u2192 't8'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT23 \u2192 't43'\n- NT25 \u2192 't77'\n- NT26 \u2192 't28'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT3 \u2192 't31', 't3', etc.\n- NT1 \u2192 't29', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' or 't84'\n- NT7 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nLooking at the start, we have 't84', which seems to come from NT17 or NT5. Let's check NT17 and NT5:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' or 't49'. Hmm, not 't84', so maybe that's not it.\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' or 't84'. Ah, so NT5 can produce 't84'. So the first token is from NT5.\n\nSo, the first step could be S\u2192NT32 NT14, but that's not directly. Wait, S can produce NT5 via another path. Wait, no: S is a non-terminal, and we need to see how it can generate the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parse the string using the leftmost derivation steps. Starting with S, we can derive the string step by step. But this could be time-consuming, so perhaps I can use an alternative approach.\n\nAnother idea: since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the RHS, except the rules that produce terminals. So each step increases the length of the string by 1. Let's see the string length: I count 34 tokens (like t84, t68, etc.) So, the depth of the parse tree would be log2(34) which is around 5 or 6 levels. But actually, since the grammar might have branching, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to trace the possible derivation. Let me attempt that.\n\nThe string starts with t84 t68 t41 t84 t22... So, starting with S, which can go to three options: NT2 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25. So, for S, it's one of these three.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT32 NT14. NT32 is defined as NT1 NT20, and NT14 is \u2192t65.\n\nWait, but the first token is t84, which comes from NT5. So perhaps we need to find a derivation path that starts with a non-terminal that can produce t84.\n\nLet me explore S \u2192 NT17 NT7. Wait, no: looking at the rules, S can't produce NT17 directly. The rule is S\u2192NT20 NT25, S\u2192NT32 NT14, or S\u2192NT21 NT28. So S goes to a pair of NTs. Then each of those NTs can produce terminals or more NTs.\n\nWait, so to have t84 as the first symbol, we need a path where S goes to a non-terminal that can produce t84.\n\nLooking at the NTs:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t41 or t84\n- NT17 \u2192 t14 or t49\n- NT25 \u2192 t77 or t25\nWait, but wait: Let me check all NTs for possible 't84' terminals.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41' or 't84'\n- NT26 \u2192 't28' or 't22' or 't71' or 't41'\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' or 't49'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50' or 't27'\n- NT34 \u2192 't30' or 't14'\n- NT7 \u2192 't3', etc.\n- Others... Hmm, it seems only NT5 can produce 't84'.\n\nSo the first symbol t84 must come from NT5. Now, looking at the rule for NT5: NT5 can be derived from two different production rules: NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT32 (which then leads to t84) and NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20.\n\nWait, let me find the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT5:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT32\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20\n\nWait, no: in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT32\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT20\n\nSo, to get 't84' from NT5, perhaps NT5 is derived from NT3 and NT32, which in turn produce 't31' and 't22' or something?\n\nWait, no. Let me check the rules for NT5:\n\nWait, according to the provided rules:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nHere's what I see about NT5:\n\n- NT5 -> NT3 NT32\n- NT5 -> NT5 NT20\n\nSo, to produce a terminal, we need to have NT5 eventually derive a terminal symbol. Wait, but in the grammar, NT5 can be in a chain. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14 could lead to NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20, etc. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see how 't84' is produced. NT5 \u2192 t84 when NT5 is part of a production that eventually leads to t84. Wait, but from NT5's rules, we can see that if NT5 is derived as NT5 NT20, that would mean it's still a non-terminal, so it needs to derive further. Unless NT20 can derive a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT20:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT29 NT32, and NT29 is derived from 't68' (since one of NT29's productions is 't68').\n\nWait, let me check NT29:\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\n- NT29 -> NT27 NT22\n- NT29 -> 't68' (wait, is that so? Let me check: in the rules, I see NT29 -> NT27 NT22 and NT29 -> 't56' maybe? Wait, no, actually:\n\nWait, looking at the rules provided:\n\nWait, no, I don't see 't68' as a direct production from any NT. Wait, let's check NT29:\n\n- In the rules, I see NT29 \u2192 NT27 NT22 and NT29 \u2192 't66', I think.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which might produce two terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: `t38 t50 t8 t6 t14 t14 t38 t43 t43 t6 t14 t28 t14 t84 t38 t23 t0 t851 t14 t12 t8 t30 t28 t84 t38 t54 t0 t8 t32 t69 t28 t3 t71 t36 t50 t38 t52 t50 t36`.\n\nWait, I notice something odd. Towards the end, there's a token `t51 t14`. Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but let's proceed.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It consists of a bunch of production rules from S down to various NT (Non-Terminals) and terminals marked as t followed by numbers. Each production rule is in the form NT -> NT1 NT2.\n\nThe string provided seems to be a sequence of these terminals. I need to see if starting from S, I can derive this string by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nLooking at S, the start symbol, it can produce three options: NT21 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25. So, the string must start with a combination matching one of these.\n\nLet me check the beginning of the string: it starts with t38 t50. Wait, let me see which NT could produce t38 and t50.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT21: has rules like NT21 -> NT28 NT22, NT21 -> NT6 NT0, etc.\n- NT2: NT2 splits into various combinations, like NT2 -> NT15 NT18.\n- NT25 has a rule: NT25 -> NT23 NT28, which could produce t50 (as 23 might be t50? Wait, I might need to check.\n\nWait, the terminals are all prefixed with 't' followed by a number. So, for example, 't38' is a terminal, 't50' is another, etc.\n\nI think the approach here is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nBut given the length and complexity of the string, it might be a bit time-consuming. But let me try to find any obvious issues.\n\nStarting with S, the options are:\n\n1. NT21 NT28\n2. NT32 NT14\n3. NT20 NT25\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t38 t50 t8 t6 t14...\n\nLet me see which production rule could start with t38. Scanning the NT rules:\n\nLooking for NT where the first symbol is t38. I see that NT2 has a production: NT2 -> 't38'. Similarly, NT3 -> 't31' or 't7', etc.\n\nSo, if NT2 produces 't38', what does NT2 produce?\n\nFrom the NT rules:\n\nNT2 -> NT15 NT18, which then splits further into NT15 -> NT21 NT23 and NT18 -> NT16 NT6, etc. But let's see:\n\nIf NT2 -> 't38', then the next symbols after t38 should be generated by NT15 and NT18.\n\nWait, but in the given string, after t38 comes t50. Let's see if NT15 and NT18 can produce t50.\n\nWait, but NT18 -> 't66' via one of its rules. So, if NT18 -> 't66', that would make the string after t38 as 't38 t50'... But NT18 can't directly produce t50. Maybe through other steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol is different. Maybe I should try other options.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t38 t50.\n\nIf S starts with NT21, then the first two symbols should be from NT21's production, such as 't28' and 't22' or other combinations.\n\nBut looking at NT21 -> 't6' or 't0' as in some rules. So, that might not fit with t38.\n\nIf S starts with NT32, then the production could be NT32 -> 't3' or 't2'.\n\nWait, 't32' isn't in NT32's productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT32: from the rules, NT32 can produce 't54' (e.g., NT32 -> 't23') or via other NTs. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string does not start with S's productions. Maybe the initial symbol isn't S but some other NT, but the problem states that the string has to be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nSo, let's re-examine: the string starts with t38, which is a terminal. So, one of the NTs must directly produce t38.\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\n- NT2 has a rule that leads to 't38': looking through the list, I see NT2 -> 't38' is present. So, NT2 can produce 't38'.\n\nWait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT8 -> 't27' NT6, but I'm looking for a production where NT2 directly produces 't38'. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I see:\n\nNT2 has a production: NT2 -> 't38' (from the rule 'NT2: NT2 -> t38').\n\nWait, no. Actually, looking carefully, the rules list doesn't directly show any NT producing t38. Let me check the list again:\n\nScanning through the list, most produce combinations of NTs, but I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT32 -> 't50' (from NT32 -> 't2' or others)\n- NT18 -> 't66', 't6', etc.\n\nWait, but perhaps the rules may include t38 as a direct production. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nI'll scan the list item by item:\n\nFor example, under NT2:\n\n- NT2 -> 't38'\n\nWait, looking at the rules, there's indeed a rule where NT2 is mapped to 't38'. Yes, in the very end of the rules: `NT2: 't38'`.\n\nSo, NT2 can directly produce t38. Thus, the string starts with t38, which could come from NT2.\n\nNow, the next part is important: after t38 comes t50. So, the second symbol is t50, which we need to check if it can come from the same NT2.\n\nWait, since NT2 is a single non-terminal, and in the case where NT2 directly produces 't38', then the production would be S -> NT2 NT28. So, after t38, the next symbols come from NT28.\n\nBut the next symbol is t50. So, let's see what NT28 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT28's production rules: in the list, I see NT28 -> 't50' because one of the rules is `NT28 -> 't50'`, specifically in this line: `NT28: 't50'`. So, NT28 can directly produce 't50'.\n\nThus, the first two symbols t38 t50 would be produced by NT2 -> 't38' followed by NT28 -> 't50'. So far, so good.\n\nNow, the string continues after t50 with t8, t6, t14, etc. So, after the initial S -> NT2 NT28 -> t38 t50, the next part of the string is t8 t6 t14...\n\nSo, the next production would involve NT28's next output. Wait, no: the rule S -> NT2 NT28 will produce t38 t50. Then, to generate the next symbols, we need to expand NT28 further.\n\nWait, no. Because S \u2192 NT2 NT28, and each of NT2 and NT28 can produce other symbols. But after the initial S, the entire sequence is t38 t50 t8 t6 t14 t14... So, after t38 t50, the rest should be generated from NT28, not NT2 anymore, since NT2 has already produced t38.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you perform a derivation, S produces two non-terminals, and each can expand into more symbols.

The start symbol is S, and it's rewritten into combinations of NT2, NT32, etc., with various terminals and non-terminals. The string we're evaluating is a sequence of these terminals, and we need to see if it can be derived from S through a series of expansions.\n\nLet me start by parsing the string and seeing if it can be produced by the grammar step by step. The string is: `t14 t84 t84 t77 t71 t12 t41 t43 t71 t36 t14 t12 t14 t77 t71 t84 t22 t36 t22 t6 t8 t75 t0 t68 t14 t84 t3 t28 t36 t22 t54 t56 t6 t50 t70 t6 t41 t84 t66 t34 t41`.\n\nI see that it starts with t14.

Wait, actually, looking back, I think I might have misread because NT14 was mentioned multiple times. Wait, looking at the grammar again, I see:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7\nNT14 -> NT5 NT34\nNT14 -> NT15 NT7\nNT12 -> NT4 NT0\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7\nNT14 -> NT15 NT7\n\nHmm, so t14 is not directly produced by NT14. Wait, maybe I should double-check all the grammar rules to see where t14 can come from.\n\nLooking through the list again, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> t50\n- NT6 -> t68\n- NT5 -> t41\n- NT17 -> t49\n- NT25 -> t77\n- NT15 -> t68\n- NT23 -> t52\n- NT22 -> t8\n- NT21 -> t69\n- NT31 -> t75\n- NT11 -> t14\n- NT17 -> t49\n- NT19 -> t6\n- NT7 -> t3\n- NT18 -> t66\n- NT26 -> t28\n- NT0 -> t61\n- NT16 -> t6\n- NT5 -> t84\n- NT17 -> t14\n\nWait, perhaps NT17 has a production that leads to t14. Looking again, I see NT17 has:\n\nNT17 -> NT5 NT28\nNT17 -> NT9 NT18\n\nBut also, I see at the end:\n\nNT17 -> t14\n\nYes, so NT17 directly produces t14. So, the grammar has a rule NT17 -> t14.\n\nSo, looking at the string, it starts with t14. So, that could come from NT17.\n\nNext, after t14, the next part is t84, then t84 again.\n\nSo the first sequence is t14 t84 t84 t77 t71 t12 t41 t43 t71 t36 t14 t12 t14 t77 t71 t84 t22 t36 t22 t6 t8 t75 t0 t68 t14 t84 t3 t28 t36 t22 t54 t56 t6 t50 t70 t6 t41 t84 t66 t34 t41.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break the string into tokens and see the order. Let me list the tokens:\n\n1. t14\n2. t84\n3. t84\n4. t77\n5. t71\n6. t12\n7. t41\n8. t43\n9. t71\n10. t36\n11. t14\n12. t12\n13. t14\n14. t77\n15. t71\n16. t84\n17. t22\n18. t36\n19. t22\n20. t6\n21. t8\n22. t75\n23. t0\n24. t68\n25. t14\n26. t84\n27. t3\n28. t28\n29. t36\n30. t22\n31. t54\n32. t56\n33. t6\n34. t50\n35. t70\n36. t6\n37. t41\n38. t84\n39. t66\n40. t34\n41. t41.\n\nNow, starting with t14 (token 1), which could come from NT17.\n\nWhat comes after? The next tokens are t84 (token 2) and then t84 (token3). So after NT17 (t14), the next part is t84 t84. So we need to find a production that NT17 can generate, but NT17 can't generate t84 directly. NT17 has a production to t14, or perhaps a production that produces t84.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I missed some rules for NT17.\n\nLooking again at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT17 -> NT5 NT28\n- NT17 -> NT9 NT18\n\nAre there any rules where NT17 produces t84? Or perhaps another NT that leads to t84.\n\nLooking through NT rules, I see:\n\nNT17 is defined as above, but perhaps another NT can produce t84. For example, NT28 -> t50, NT5 -> t41, NT17 -> t14. Alternatively, looking at the end of the grammar, there's:\n\nNT25 -> t77, NT22 -> t8, NT23 -> t52, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a path where t14 (NT17) can lead to t84. Maybe through NT17 -> NT5 NT28, then NT5 can expand into something else that gives t84. Let me see.\n\nWait, looking for rules that have t84 in their terminals. In the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> t41\n- NT17 -> t14\n- NT0 -> t61\n- NT15 -> t68\n- NT25 -> t77\n- NT29 -> t7\n- NT27 -> t9\n- NT10 -> t32\n- NT12 -> t14\n\nHmm, I don't see any direct rules that produce t84 except from NT17 itself, which just gives t14. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Oh, I see:\n\nWait, looking again, in the grammar, the rule `NT28 -> t50` and `NT5 -> t41`. Also, `NT17 -> NT5 NT28`, which would produce t5 followed by whatever NT5 and NT28 expand into.\n\nIf NT17 is used to produce t14, and after that, the next part is t84, perhaps the grammar can have multiple NT17s. But wait, each NT symbol can only expand once per step in the derivation, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S expansion can produce different NTs that eventually give the t14 followed by t84.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long or not fitting the rules. Perhaps I can approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar's rules, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each part of the string can be derived from the grammar. The first token is t14, which comes from NT17 -> t14. After that, t84 could come from NT25 -> t77? Wait, no, NT25 is t77. Wait, perhaps another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps NT27 -> t29 (which is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-793","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar consists of several production rules.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for parsing algorithms because it simplifies the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that all the rules start with a non-terminal on the left side, followed by two non-terminals on the right side, except for the rules where a non-terminal is directly mapped to a terminal. For example, I see rules like NT2 -> t23, where t23 represents a terminal symbol. That\u2019s good because in CNF, terminals on the right-hand side are allowed, and each production rule should have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t71 t41 t54 t22 t8 t22 t40 t14 t7 t36 t3 t38 t3 t22 t71 t31 t7 t34 t70 t52 t10 t71 t38 t54 t36 t41 t49 t23 t56 t50 t71 t77 t3 t23 t23 t40 t6 t41 t54 t52 t3.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived by the given grammar. To do this, I'll try to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. The string starts with t71. Looking at the grammar, there are productions that produce t71. Specifically:\n   - NT0 \u2192 t71\n   - NT15 \u2192 t71\n   - NT23 \u2192 t71\n   - NT26 \u2192 t71\n   - NT33 \u2192 t71\n   So, the first symbol t71 can be generated by any of these non-terminals.\n\nLet's choose the leftmost non-terminal, which in the standard parsing approach is the leftmost symbol, so probably NT0. Wait, no, in the string, we start with t71, which could come from NT0, NT15, etc., but without knowing the structure, it's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the start symbol down to the string. The start symbol in the grammar is S, which expands into NT21 NT28. So starting with S \u2192 NT21 NT28.\n\nNow, we have S -> NT21 NT28.\n\nEach of these NT21 and NT28 will produce parts of the string. Let me see what NT21 and NT28 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT21, the productions are:\n- NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29\n- NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6\n\nSo, from NT21, it can split into either NT32 NT29 or NT26 NT6.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 has:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\n\nSo, from S, after the first step, we have two possibilities for each of the two non-terminals, leading to four possible initial branches. This could get complicated, but maybe we can see a pattern or find a way to generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t71, which I mentioned can come from several NTs. Let me pick one and see if it can lead to the rest of the string.\n\nSuppose the first t71 comes from NT0 \u2192 t71. Then, after t71, we have t41. So the string so far is t71 t41.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t41 can come from several NTs:\n- NT17 \u2192 t41\n- NT5 \u2192 t41\nSo, perhaps the next symbol t41 comes from NT17 or NT5.\n\nIf I take t41 as from NT17, which is a non-terminal. So the string after t71 t41 could be part of the derivation if NT17 leads to t41 and something else.\n\nWait, but t41 is a terminal, so in the context of the grammar, it must be directly derived from a production that maps a non-terminal to t41. So, for example, NT17 \u2192 t41, which means after t71, the next is t41, which could come from NT17.\n\nBut then, after t71 t41, the next symbol is t54. So t54 must come from the second non-terminal after NT17. Wait, because in the CFG, each production is of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 a, and in this case, we have S \u2192 NT21 NT28, and each of these NTs will produce parts of the string.\n\nBut maybe this approach is getting too messy. Another approach is to check if the entire string can be matched by the RHS of the grammar rules.\n\nEach symbol in the string is either a terminal or a non-terminal, but according to the grammar, all non-terminals can only produce terminals or other non-terminals, but the string is entirely terminals, so all non-terminals in the derivation must have been directly mapped to their terminal equivalents.\n\nSo, each step in the derivation must involve a non-terminal expanding into a terminal, except possibly in the middle steps, but eventually, the entire string must be consumed.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to see if the string can be constructed from the grammar's rules, symbol by symbol, ensuring that each step follows the allowed productions.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to look at the entire length of the string and see if it conforms to the possible derivations. The string is 55 symbols long, which is quite long, but given the grammar's structure, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the grammar, certain non-terminals seem to produce only specific terminals. For example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t23\n- NT14 \u2192 t65\n- NT10 \u2192 t0\n- NT11 \u2192 t6\n- NT7 \u2192 t3\n- NT18 \u2192 t66\n- NT19 \u2192 t25\n- NT25 \u2192 t77\n- NT26 \u2192 t28\n- NT34 \u2192 t30, t14\n- NT31 \u2192 t75\n- NT33 \u2192 t49, t60, t34, t60, etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 t12, t7\n- NT5 \u2192 t41, t5, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps focusing on the terminal symbols and seeing if all the symbols in the string are covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt71, t41, t54, t22, t8, t22, t40, t14, t7, t36, t3, t38, t3, t22, t71, t31, t7, t34, t70, t52, t10, t71, t38, t54, t36, t41, t49, t23, t56, t50, t71, t77, t3, t23, t23, t40, t6, t41, t54, t52, t3.\n\nLooking up each of these in the grammar's terminals:\n\n- t71: yes, NT0, NT15, NT23, NT26, NT33, NT36, etc.\n- t41: yes, NT17, NT5\n- t54: yes, NT52, NT25? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT52: Let me check. Actually, I think I may have misread earlier. Looking back, there's a rule NT25 \u2192 t77 and another...

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t84 t28 t49 t54 t84 t71 t68 t14 t65 t66 t68 t16 t68 t77 t12 t77 t6 t3 t22 t28 t60 t71 t49 t36 t28 t71 t6 t7 t36 t14 t30 t84 t50 t36 t71 t10 t49 t71 t14 t84 t3 t0`.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar rules to see which non-terminals can produce the terminals in the string. The terminals in the string are things like 't84', 't28', 't49', etc. I notice that some of these terminals have direct productions. For example, rules like NT5 \u2192 't41', but I don't see NT5 in the string. Wait, the grammar does have a rule NT5 \u2192 't41' in the provided context. But the string has t41? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the string, I don't see any 't41's. The string has t84, t28, t49, etc. Let me check the grammar for any non-terminals that produce these.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT17 \u2192 't14' and NT0 \u2192 't61', but I don't see any direct rules for t71, t84, etc. Wait, but in the grammar, there are rules that have parts that might produce these. For instance, NT22 \u2192 't8' is one rule, but 't8' is not in the string. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start from the string and see if each token can be derived from the grammar. Let's break the string into individual tokens: t84, t28, t49, t54, t84, t71, t68, t14, t65, t66, t68, t16, t68, t77, t12, t77, t6, t3, t22, t28, t60, t71, t49, t36, t28, t71, t6, t7, t36, t14, t30, t84, t50, t36, t71, t10, t49, t71, t14, t84, t3, t0.\n\nNow, I'll try to find a derivation path for each token starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce NT21 NT28. So S \u2192 NT21 NT28. So, the string must start with something that NT21 can produce or derive into, and similarly for NT28.\n\nLooking at NT21, in the grammar, it can be NT32 NT29 or NT6 NT0, among others. Wait, let me see all the productions for NT21. Oh, looking back, the productions for NT21 are:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29\nNT21 \u2192 NT6 NT0\nNT21 \u2192 NT19 NT26\nNT21 \u2192 NT21 NT24\n\nSo, for the first token in the string, which is t84, I need to see if t84 can be derived from NT21 or NT28.\n\nWait, t84 is a terminal. Let me look for any non-terminals that have a production leading to t84.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 't14', so that's not it. NT25 \u2192 't77', which is another terminal. Wait, perhaps I should check all the rules where a terminal appears.\n\nLooking again, NT23 \u2192 't43', but that's not in the string. Wait, no. Let me list the rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, rules like NT5 \u2192 't41' are there, but I don't see any terminal other than those in the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for t84. Is there any production that leads to t84? Let me go through the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules where a terminal is on the right-hand side:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n- NT0 \u2192 't61'\n- NT10 \u2192 't32'\n- NT16 \u2192 't6'\n- NT7 \u2192 't3'\n- NT18 \u2192 't66'\n- NT13 \u2192 't6'\n- NT24 \u2192 't22'\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'\n- NT19 \u2192 't25'\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n- NT26 \u2192 't28'\n- NT21 \u2192 't8' (Wait, no, NT22 \u2192 't8', not NT26)\n- NT17 \u2192 't49' (Wait, no, NT17 is defined as NT5 \u2192 't41', etc. Wait, no, look at NT17: in the grammar, I see NT2 \u2192 't23', but I don't see any NT17 productions except perhaps in some other rules. Wait, looking again, maybe I should find if any non-terminal produces t84.\n\nWait, in the grammar, is there any production that results in 't84'? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' (Wait, no, that's another rule: looking back, NT17 \u2192 't17'? Wait, no. Let me find.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules provided, I don't see any production that immediately produces 't84'. The only production that says 't84' is in the NT15 \u2192 't68' perhaps? Wait, no, looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't84' directly. Maybe all the 't84's in the string must be derived from a non-terminal that can produce 't84'.\n\nWait, let me check. Maybe NT2? NT2 has a production to 't23' or 't66' or others, but I don't see 't84' there. Wait, looking through the grammar rules, do any non-terminals have 't84' as a terminal? Let me go through the rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any production that leads directly to 't84' from a non-terminal. That means the only way to have 't84' in the string is if some non-terminal can derive into t84 through a series of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps t84 is a result of another non-terminal's production. For example, maybe some non-terminal A has a production A \u2192 B C, and each of B and C can produce t84 through their own derivations.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce 't84'. Hmm. Wait, perhaps t84 can be derived from a non-terminal that can produce other terminals, eventually leading to t84.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't84' is derived through a series of steps from a non-terminal that has a production to a combination that can lead to t84.\n\nWait, looking back at the string, the string starts with t84. So the first part is t84, which suggests that one of the non-terminals used to generate the first part must be able to derive into t84.\n\nBut I don't see any non-terminal in the grammar that can directly produce t84. Therefore, this would mean that t84 must be the result of some longer derivation, but since t84 isn't the result of any non-terminal's immediate production, I'm starting to think that the string might not be valid. \n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the possible non-terminals for production rules that could lead into t84.\n\nLooking again, I think perhaps there's a misunderstanding on my part. Let me check the entire grammar again carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't14'\n\nSo NT17 is a non-terminal that can produce t14. Similarly, NT10 \u2192 't32', etc.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is t84, so perhaps that comes from a non-terminal that can derive into t84. But in the given grammar, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces t84.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is constructed through left or right nestings that eventually derive into t84 from some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So there must be an NT (NT17) that produces t14.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other terminals:\n\nt3 comes from NT3 \u2192 't3'? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT3 has several productions:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't20'\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar list, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n\nYes, there's a production: NT3 -> 't3' (from \"NT3 -> 't3'\").\n\nSimilarly, t84 appears multiple times, but let's see if that's produced by any NT.\n\nLooking for 't84' in the productions:\n\nI see NT21 \u2192 't8' (but that's t8, not t84). Wait, maybe I'm mixing terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking for 't84':\n\nWait, no, perhaps 't84' is a terminal, and I need to see if any NT production ends with 't84'.\n\nLooking in the list:\n\nWait, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't52'\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't61'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't68'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't6'\n\n- etc.\n\nWait, looking through, I don't see any NT production that directly produces 't84'. That's a problem because the string has 't84's. How can that happen? Unless 't84' is produced through a chain of productions that eventually reach a terminal.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Each production is either to a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nSo, for 't84', it must be the case that it's produced by a non-terminal which has a production that includes 't84' as one of its outputs.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, I see that NT0 \u2192 't84' (from \"NT0 -> 't84'\"), so yes, NT0 can produce t84. So in the string, any 't84' must come from NT0.\n\nSo, the string starts with t54. To produce t54, we need to have a path from S to NT32, since NT32 \u2192 't54'.

{"custom_id":"request-830","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies the rules into specific structures. Let me unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier because it restricts the way thegrammar can produce strings.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that there are multiple production rules starting with S. The initial symbols S are expanding into combinations of non-terminals and terminals. Each rule seems to involve two non-terminals on the right-hand side, so the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string I need to check is:\n\nt0 t40 t50 t71 t28 t36 t68 t3 t71 t6 t65 t14 t23 t30 t3 t66 t71 t10 t68 t14 t3 t38 t0 t7 t69 t43 t71 t14 t71 t14 t36 t54 t23 t43 t17 t56 t54 t71 t8 t54 t54 t43 t10\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the string starts with t0 and ends with t10. Since the grammar has a start symbol S, I'm assuming t0 might be derived from S, or it could be a substring of a larger derivation. But I need to see how the terminals relate to the non-terminals.\n\nTo approach this, I think of BFS (breadth-first search) parsing, which is commonly used for parsing in CNF. The idea is to start from the start symbol and see if the entire string can be built from it by expanding non-terminals and matching terminals.\n\nBut manually doing BFS on a string of 50+ terminals would be time-consuming. Perhaps I can look for patterns or specific sequences that correspond to the start symbol's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nS starts with NT21 -> NT32 NT28, which produces t50 (if NT32 produces t32 or something else). Wait, let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are written with NT followed by numbers, but some of these might be terminals or non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014 in Chomsky normal form, everything is non-terminal except the explicit terminals, which are given as specific symbols like t0, t1, etc.\n\nSo, the symbols after NT are numbers\u2014probably indicating non-terminals, except for those that are terminals. For example, looking at the rules, some of them end with a terminal, like NT17 -> 't14', where 't14' is a terminal and NT17 is a non-terminal.\n\nSo, my first thought is to identify which non-terminals produce which terminals. For example, NT17 produces t14, and similarly, other rules end with specific terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t0, so I need to see if any of the non-terminals can produce t0. Looking through the rules, I see that NT29 -> NT27 NT22, NT32 -> NT2 NT30, etc. Wait, but do any non-terminals directly produce t0? Looking through the list, I see a rule: NT6 -> 't68' and another NT26 -> 't28', NT5 -> 't41', and others. But I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce t0. Wait, actually, in the rules, I see a rule NT10 -> 't32' and another NT0 -> 't61'. So, t0 might not be directly produced by any NT.\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list out all the rules and see if any non-terminals directly produce t0.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT0 -> 't61'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT0 -> 't10' (Wait, is that correct? The user included a lot of rules, but perhaps I missed it.)\n\nWait, let's go through each rule:\n\nLooking for where NT0 appears in the RHS:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT0 -> 't61'\nNT10 -> 't32'\nNT26 -> 't28'\nNT18 -> 't66'\nNT33 -> 't71'\nNT23 -> 't43'\nNT21 -> 't8'\nNT...\nWait, I see a rule: NT0 -> 't10'\u2014yes, in the last lines, there's NT0 -> 't10'. So, NT0 directly produces t10.\n\nAnd NT10 -> 't32' is another rule.\n\nSo, t0 is the starting symbol, and perhaps the parser can be built from expansions of non-terminals leading to these terminals.\n\nNow, the string starts with t0, so we'd expect that the start symbol S can expand into a sequence that includes t0. Let's think about how S can produce t0 somewhere.\n\nLooking at the S rules:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, S can expand into any of these combinations. Let's look at NT21 and NT28.\n\nNT21 has a rule: NT21 -> 't8' (among others). Wait, in the rules, NT21 has multiple productions; I should check each.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT21 is defined as:\n\nNT21 -> NT32 NT6\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\nSo, from NT21, we can get t8 by NT21 -> 't8', according to one of the rules where NT21 -> 't8'.\n\nWait, looking:\n\nIn the rules, NT21 -> 't8' perhaps? Let me check:\n\nNT21 has these productions:\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT6\n- NT21 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT21 -> NT26 NT6\n- NT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me look again at the provided rules.\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\nHere's the list:\n\nNT21:\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT26\n- NT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nYes, those are the two rules for NT21. So, NT21 can derive NT32 NT26 or NT6 NT0. But wait, no NT21 -> 't8' directly. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the initial list, I see:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6\n\nAnd:\n\nNT21 -> NT6 NT0\n\nSo, perhaps from NT21, we can derive t8 via some chain. Wait, looking further, in another part of the rules:\n\nLooking for NT26:\n\nNT26 -> 't28'\n\nAnd earlier, another rule:\n\nNT26 -> NT18 NT9\n\nSo, perhaps NT26 can expand to t28 or NT18 NT9.\n\nWait, NT18 can produce:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT18 has:\n\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT18 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't16'\n- NT18 -> NT6 NT27\n- And others, like NT18 -> 't49', etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think differently.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t0. So, in order for t0 to appear, one of the productions derived from S must include t0 in the string. That could be via S -> NT21 NT28, and then NT21 expanding to something with t0, or S -> NT20 NT25, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built such that at some point, S expands to a combination that includes t0.\n\nWait, looking at S's productions:\n\nS can expand into NT21 NT28. Suppose NT21 expands into NT6 NT0 (from rule NT21 -> NT6 NT0). Then, from NT6, we can have 't68' (from NT6 -> 't68'), and from NT0, we can have 't10' or NT0-> other stuff, like NT0 -> 't61' or NT0-> NT10-> 't32'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t0, so that would require the leftmost part of the string to be t0. Let's think about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is being built such that t0 appears as one of the symbols in the expansion somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe the string is built by a derivation path that includes t0. Let's try to see.\n\nThe string starts with t0, followed by t40, t50, t71, etc.\n\nLooking at the rules for t40, let me see where that could come from.\n\nLooking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This helps because, in CNF, the structure of the string can be broken down more systematically.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many symbols (like NT21, NT31, etc.) have productions that lead to terminals. For example, `NT21 -> NT8`, and checking further, `NT8 -> 't28'` directly, and `NT21 -> 't8'` which is the same. Wait, I need to be careful here because the grammar uses mixed NTs and terminals for simplification.\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions that some NTs are producing terminals directly. For example, looking through the grammar, some NTs have entries like NT17 -> 't14'. So, these NTs consume 't14' directly. However, most seem to have further productions.\n\nTo approach this, I think of the problem as a parsing task, starting with the overall structure. The top-level symbol is S, which in the grammar is `S -> NT2 NT28` and a few others, but mostly `S -> NT2 NT28`. Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, S has several options: NT21, NT32, NT20, etc. So, first, the string should start with one of these NTs.\n\nLet me check the string's first token: `t23`. Looking for an NT that can produce 't23'. Checking the grammar, I see symbols like NT23: \n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT51\nWait, but 't23' is a terminal. Looking for NT23 with a rule that produces 't23'. Scanning through, I don't immediately see an NT23 -> 't23', unless maybe mapped via other productions. Alternatively, maybe NT23 has a production that eventually leads to 't23', but perhaps another NT is directly producing 't23'.\n\nLooking further, I notice NT22: production includes 't23' as a terminal, for example, NT22 -> 't23'. Another one: NT25 -> 't54', but that's not 't23'. Wait, perhaps NT23 is a part of the structure but not directly producing 't23'. Maybe I need to see if 't23' can be derived from an allowed NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting point S \u2192 NT21 \u2192 NT8 (from S -> NT21, and NT8 is 't28'), but that doesn't match t23. Alternatively, S \u2192 NT21 \u2192 't84', but that's not t23. Hmm.\n\nWait, S can produce NT21, which can lead to certain terminals. Let's see, perhaps the initial symbol leads to a sequence that starts with 't23'. Let's see if NT21 can produce 't23'. Looking at NT21's productions: NT21 -> NT8, NT21 -> NT6. NT6 is NT13, and NT13 has a production that leads to 't6', etc. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for an NT where 't23' is in its productions. Let me scan the grammar again. \n\nLooking at NT5, for example: NT5 can produce 't41', 't8', etc., but not 't23'. NT25 can produce 't77' and others. NT12 can produce 't16', but perhaps via other steps.\n\nWait, perhaps NT3 can produce 't23' through NT23: looking for a path that leads to 't23'. Let me check NT23's productions: \n\nNT23 -> NT22 NT27\nNT23 -> NT22 NT51\n\nAnd NT22 has a production: NT22 -> 't23', NT22 -> NT32 NT23\n\nSo, perhaps in NT23, can we go NT23 -> NT22 -> 't23'? That would lead to 't23'. That seems possible. But is there a way for NT23 to reach that?\n\nWait, but from S, how do we get to NT23? Looking at S's productions, such as S -> NT21 -> NT23? No, S's main productions are NT21, NT32, NT20, etc., but S can't directly produce NT23 unless I'm missing that. Wait, yes, S is defined with several options, but looking again:\n\nLooking at the S production: the initial options are \n\nS -> NT21, NT32, NT20. Then, S has other productions, such as S-> NT21 again, S-> NT20 NT25, etc. But perhaps S can reach NT23 via some chain.\n\nWait, perhaps S -> NT21, and then NT21 has a rule that leads to NT8, which is 't28', but that might not match 't23'. Hmm, this seems confusing. \n\nWait, let's consider that perhaps the string is composed of a series of rule applications. The string starts with t23, so where can t23 come from? As I thought earlier, NT23 might be the starting point if S can reach it.\n\nLooking in the grammar, S's productions don't include NT23 as a direct option, but perhaps through a chain of productions. So, for example, S -> NT21, and then NT21 produces another NT, which then produces t23.\n\nWait, let's consider S -> NT21. Then, NT21 -> NT8. NT8's productions: NT8 is 't28' or NT8 -> NT27 NT6. If NT8 -> 't28', then that's t28, which doesn't help. If NT8 -> NT27, then NT27 -> 't84' or other options. Not t23, so perhaps that path isn't giving us t23.\n\nAlternatively, S could be NT25. Looking at S's other options: S-> NT20 NT25. If S produces NT20 NT25, perhaps each of those can produce parts of the string.\n\nNT20 -> NT29 NT32, and NT25 -> 't77' or other NTs. If NT20 produces something leading to t66, etc., perhaps that's a part.\n\nWait, let's try building the string step by step. The first token is t23, which suggests that the initial NT leading to t23 must be a production that ends in t23.\n\nSo, from the grammar, the possible way t23 could be produced is if some NT X can produce 't23', either directly or through a production that eventually leads to it.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT23 can be produced as NT22 NT51. But NT22 -> 't23' or other options. So, perhaps NT23 can produce 't23' by NT22 -> 't23'. So, NT23 -> 't23' via NT22 -> 't23'.\n\nBut does NT23 have a production to NT22? Let's see: NT23 has production NT22 NT27 and others, not directly.\n\nWait, but let's think differently. If there's a way to have NT23 produce a 't23', that would be a match. However, based on the grammar provided, I need to check whether any NT leads directly to 't23' or through a series of productions that reach 't23'.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I see that NT23 could be part of a production that leads to 't23'. For example:\n\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT22 -> 't23'\n\nTherefore, if I can derive 't23' via NT22, and somehow have the NT23 chain to that, then 't23' is possible. However, I need to see if S can reach such a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to have S produce a series of NTs that lead to the initial 't23'.

{"custom_id":"request-851","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is pretty long, so I should break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the grammar seems quite complex with many productions. Some symbols have multiple production options, so the parsing might involve choosing the right path.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: `t84 t71 t36 t36 t50 t84 t71 t41 t40 t52 t41 t14 t38 t36 t50 t40 t23 t30 t14 t71 t14 t0 t43 t50 t6 t84 t38 t28 t60 t41 t6 t31 t66 t22 t36 t54 t77 t14 t84 t84 t54 t43 t6 t54 t51`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a lot of 't' tokens with numbers, which are presumably terminals. The non-terminals in the grammar are various symbols like S, NT2, NT3, etc. Each production in the grammar starts with a non-terminal and is followed by two other symbols (either terminals or non-terminals), except for S, which has multiple initial productions.\n\nGiven that Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to have exactly two symbols, our string must be built by expanding S step by step, breaking down each non-terminal into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to simulate the parsing process. Starting from the entire string, we can try to match the rightmost non-terminal, working our way to the start symbol, S. Alternatively, perhaps a top-down approach using the grammar's productions could help, but the string is long, so it might be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if each token in the string can be derived from the grammar. For example, each term like t84, t71, etc., corresponds to a non-terminal. So I can check which non-terminals produce these tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals are terminals. For example, NT17 -> 't14', and so on. So the string must consist of such terminals, and their production paths must form a valid derivation.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce 't's. For example:\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\nNT16 -> 't6'\nNT7 -> 't3'\nNT18 -> 't66'\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the string contains a series of 't's, each of which must correspond to one of these terminals. To check if the entire string is in the language, each 't' in the string should be reachable through the grammar's productions.\n\nSo let's go through each token in the string and see if it's produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nList of 't's with numbers:\nt84, t71, t36, t36, t50, t84, t71, t41, t40, t52, t41, t14, t38, t36, t50, t40, t23, t30, t14, t71, t14, t0, t43, t50, t6, t84, t38, t28, t60, t41, t6, t31, t66, t22, t36, t54, t77, t14, t84, t84, t54, t43, t6, t54, t51.\n\nNow, let's map each 't' to the corresponding non-terminal:\n\nLooking for which NT's productions result in these 't's.\n\nCheck the grammar:\n\nNT17 -> 't14'\n\nIs there a production that produces t14? Yes, NT14 can produce 't65' or 't6'.\n\nWait, looking up NT14:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT7\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a list of non-terminals and their direct productions to terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals that directly produce 't's are:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT16 -> 't6'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT4 -> NT29 NT10, but NT29 is not a terminal.\nWait, actually, the productions that produce terminals are those where the rule ends with a terminal, not in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up each non-terminal's production to see if it directly or indirectly produces each 't'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the entire string is formed by concatenating the right-hand sides of the non-terminals, starting from S.\n\nBut considering the string is 56 tokens long, that's tedious.\n\nAlternatively, I can check each 't' in the string to see if there's a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nFor example:\n\nt84: Is there any NT that can produce 't84'? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing t84. So maybe we need to see if t84 appears in any expansion.\n\nWait, in the grammar, does any NT directly produce 't84'? Looking at the productions, I don't see any. For example, S -> NT21 -> ... but I don't see t84.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, perhaps I might have missed something. Let me scan through:\n\nLooking for 't84':\nNT17 -> 't14' \u2192 no\nNT16 -> 't6' \u2192 no\nNT7 -> 't3' \u2192 no\nNT18 -> 't66' \u2192 no\nNT34 -> 't30' or 't14' \u2192 no\nNT3 -> 't31', 't7', 't12', etc.\nWait, none of them produce t84 directly. So perhaps t84 can be derived through a sequence of productions.\n\nWait, but if none of the NTs directly produce t84, then the string contains a t84 token, which would not be possible. So does the grammar allow for producing t84?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some non-terminals. Looking at NT14: It can produce NT34 and NT7. NT34 can produce 't30' or 't14'. NT14 is used in some productions, but I don't see how it would produce 't84' directly.\n\nAnother approach: check each token and see if it's present in any production.\n\nFor example:\n\nt36: Looking for NTs that can produce 't36' directly. Do any NTs have a production ending with 't36'? Checking the grammar, I don't see any, which suggests that 't36' is not directly produced by any non-terminal. However, maybe it is produced through a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to see if for each token, there's a path in the grammar that leads to it. If every token is reachable through such a path, then the string could be in the language.\n\nBut looking at the first token, t84, if there's no NT that directly produces it, unless it's produced as part of a chain. So perhaps t84 is a terminal derived from some NT through a series of rules.\n\nWait, maybe I can trace back. Let's look for where 't84' appears in the grammar. Checking the productions:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT3\n- NT32 -> NT11 NT3\nWait, no 't84' there.\n\nLooking further, do any NTs produce 't84'? Looking at the list, I don't see any direct production for 't84' by any NT. So perhaps the string contains a token that cannot be derived, which would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut before confirming, let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\n- NT21's productions: NT32 NT3, etc. Do any of these produce t84? Doesn't look like.\n\n- NT25: NT32 NT18. Not seeing t84.\n\n- NT31: NT25 NT13. Same issue.\n\n- NT22: NT29 NT2. Not t84.\n\n- NT33: NT33 NT19. No.\n\n- NT17: 't14'\n\n- NT18: 't66'\n\nLooking through all the terminals in the grammar, I don't see any 't84' being directly produced by any NT.

So S can produce t23 if NT21 can produce a terminal and NT28 can produce another terminal that combines to form t23.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The production S \u2192 NT21 NT28 means that NT21 must be expanded into a terminal, and NT28 must be expanded into another terminal, and together they should be t23 something. But no, actually, each side must produce a terminal, so S \u2192 NT21 NT28 would produce the concatenation of the terminals from NT21 and NT28.\n\nWait, for example, if S produces NT21 which is t52, and NT28 is t23, then the string would start with t52 t23, which is not the case here. But in our string, it starts with t23, so perhaps the left-hand side is NT21 \u2192 something that produces a token, and NT28 \u2192 something that starts with t52? Wait, no, because NT28 is on the right side.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: for the production S \u2192 NT21 NT28, that would produce the concatenation of the strings from NT21 and NT28.

But wow, this is going to be a bit of a challenge.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with context-free grammars, especially in Chomsky normal form, each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for this grammar, every rule is in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for those ending with a terminal like 't12' etc. Wait, looking back, some rules have terminals on the right side, so actually, some rules produce a terminal followed by a non-terminal or two terminals? Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that N terminals like NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3, which are all non-terminals. But in the given string, the tokens are like 't77', 't71', etc. These 't' terms must be the terminals that are derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. So, for example, looking at the grammar, there are rules like NT5 \u2192 't41', NT0 \u2192 't61', etc. So each 't' string is a terminal symbol derived from the respective non-terminal.\n\nTherefore, to determine if the string is in the language, I need to check if each 't' in the string corresponds to a production rule in the grammar that can generate that 't'. So, the first step is to parse the string into its components, which are these 't' symbols, and then see if each can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, more accurately, each step in the derivation of the string should match a production rule in the grammar. So, the overall approach would be to parse the string top-down using the given grammar, starting from the start symbol S and trying to match the entire string through a series of productions.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long and the grammar is somewhat complex, perhaps I can look for the structure of the grammar and see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has three options for S:\n1. NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT28\n2. NT31 \u2192 NT34 NT1\n3. NT20 \u2192 NT25 NT13\n\nWait, no, looking again, the S productions are:\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT31 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\n\nWait, actually, looking at the user's message, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS -> NT31 NT14\nS -> NT20 NT25\nS -> NT32 NT14\n... (other production rules for NT symbols, mostly)\n\nWait, but in the initial S productions, it's NT21, which eventually leads to other non-terminals.\n\nI notice that each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or, for example, NT5 \u2192 't41', which is a terminal symbol.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach would be to parse the string as a sequence of terminals and see if we can find a derivation path that starts from S and ends with the given string.\n\nHowever, given that the grammar could generate a lot of sequences, it might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps we can look for whether each 't' in the string corresponds to a production rule that leads to it. If every token in the given string is a terminal derived by a non-terminal, and there exists a way to get a sequence of non-terminals that can generate the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to see if each 't' can be associated with non-terminals that can produce them. For example, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce a single terminal symbol, and others produce pairs of non-terminals.\n\nSo, for each 't' in the string, we can check if there's a production that can derive it. But the order and sequence matter because it's context-free, so the entire structure needs to match.\n\nBut since this might get too detailed, perhaps a better approach is to look for the starting point: what symbols can S produce? S has three options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 NT28\n2. S \u2192 NT31 NT14\n3. S \u2192 NT20 NT25\n\nSo, each S production is two non-terminals. Then, we'd need to expand these until we get terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't77 t71 ...' so the first part must come from the expansion of NT21 and NT28, or another starting production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be broken down into segments that correspond to parts of the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a better method is to use a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying to match the string.

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. However, looking at the grammar, it seems to mix both forms\u2014some productions have two non-terminals (like S -> NT21 NT29) and others produce terminals. But actually, in CNF, all productions are supposed to have two non-terminals, except for the terminals as single symbols. Maybe this is a modified CNF allowing for terminals as needed.\n\nThe string to evaluate is quite long and consists of a sequence of terminal symbols (strings like 't14', 't65', etc.). My goal is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar productions starting with S:\n\n1. S -> NT21 NT29\n2. S -> NT32 NT14\n3. S -> NT20 NT25\n\nEach production from S results in two non-terminals. So, I'll need to recursively apply the grammar rules, replacing each non-terminal with their respective productions until I reach the terminal symbols.\n\nStarting with the string `t14 t65 t36 t68 t60 t6 t31 t66 t43 t11 t6 t14 t71 t6 t68 t49 t71 t28 t70 t84 t14 t28 t60 t14 t71 t30 t71 t30 t8 t68 t3 t38 t0 t60 t25 t71 t22 t32 t8 t71 t3 t41 t54 t52 t61 t38`.\n\nBut this string seems to have 48 elements. That's a lot. Let's break it down by looking for starting points.\n\nThe first symbol is 't14'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't14'?\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that some non-terminals have rules that produce 't14'. Let's scan:\n\n- NT14 -> NT34 NT7 (but that's non-terminal)\n- NT6 -> NT10 NT31 (also non-terminal)\n- NT14 -> NT15 NT7 (non-terminal)\n- NT32 -> NT2 NT23 (non-terminal)\n- NT5 -> 't28' (terminal), but that's not 't14'\n- NT25 -> NT5 NT13 (non-terminal)\n- NT5 -> 't41' (terminal)\n- NT17 -> 't14' (terminal)\nWait, looking for 't14' directly. In the productions, I see NT14 -> 't14' directly? No. Wait, checking the productions:\n\nLooking through the list of productions, I see:\n\n- NT14 -> NT4 NT1 (non-terminal)\n- NT3 -> 't31'...\nWait, no, more accurately, looking for NT14 producing 't14'\u2014I see:\n\nLooking through the entire list, the only 't14's come from:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT25 -> 't51'...\nWait, perhaps the non-terminal NT17 can produce 't14'?\n\nWait, checking the productions for NT14:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT14 has productions to NT34 NT1 and NT15 NT7, and NT10 -> 't68' which is a terminal, but these are non-terminals. I also see NT25 -> 't51' which is a terminal, but that's not 't14'.\n\nWait, maybe looking for where a non-terminal directly produces 't14':\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\n- NT14 seems to always produce non-terminals.\n- Oh, wait, looking further, I see NT14: NT14 -> ... But I don't see any production that directly produces 't14' from a single non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking at the productions for each non-terminal:\n\nLooking for any production where X -> 't14'.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT14 has no direct terminal production.\n\nWait, but NT17 -> 't14'\u2014so if any non-terminal can produce NT17, then it can produce 't14'.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't14', which would require that the start symbol (S) eventually derives through some rules leading to a production of 't14'. Since the only way to get 't14' is via NT17, which can produce 't14'.\n\nSo, S must derive via one of its rules to a sequence that eventually produces 't17', and then 't14'.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n1. S -> NT21 NT29\n2. S -> NT32 NT14\n3. S -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, S starts with two non-terminals. Let's see what these can produce.\n\nFirst, production 2: S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nIf we take this path, the first part is NT32 and the second is NT14.\n\nNow, NT14 is a non-terminal that must produce 't14' via NT17. So, NT14 must derive a sequence that includes NT17.\n\nLooking at NT14's productions:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT1\nNT14 -> NT15 NT7\n\nSo, NT14 can't directly produce NT17, which would produce 't14'. Therefore, this path seems problematic because NT14 can't reach 't14' unless through another path.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let's see:\n\nLooking for any rule where NT14 is derived as part of another production leading to 't14'. Hmm, perhaps if NT15 can produce 't14' somehow, but looking through NT15's productions:\n\nNT15 -> NT21 NT23\nNT15 -> NT33 NT28\nNT15 -> NT16 NT19\n\nNone of these are terminals. So, NT14's only way to produce a terminal is through NT17.\n\nThis suggests that to get 't14', we need to go through NT17. But how?\n\nLooking at production 2: S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nIf NT32 can produce 't32' and NT14 can produce something leading to 't17', perhaps.\n\nWait, but NT14 can't directly produce 't17'\u2014it can only produce non-terminals. So, unless there's a way for NT14 to produce NT17, which in turn produces 't14', but looking at the productions, I don't see any such rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the productions. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the productions for NT14:\n\nNT14 -> NT34 NT1\nNT14 -> NT15 NT7\nNT14 -> NT10 -> 't68'? Wait no, NT10 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for any rule that ultimately leads to 't14'. It seems that the only way is through NT17, so the production chain for 't14' would require going through NT17.\n\nThis suggests that if any of the non-terminals deriving from S can reach NT17, which can then produce 't14'. Alternatively, another production path might lead to 't14' via other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's consider another S production: S -> NT20 NT25.\n\nLooking at NT20 and NT25:\n\nNT20's productions: NT20 -> NT29 NT32\nNT25's productions: NT25 -> NT5 NT13\nNT13 -> NT10 -> NT21\nNT10 -> NT0 -> 't11' or other terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps if S takes the path of S -> NT20 NT25, then NT20 could produce things like NT29 and NT32, which might have terminals.\n\nBut let me try to trace this.\n\nNT20 -> NT29 NT32.\n\nNow, NT29's productions: NT29 -> NT27 NT22, etc.\n\nThis seems to enter a loop, not helpful. Let's see if any NT20's production leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT20:\n\nNT20 -> NT29 NT32. Neither NT29 nor NT32 directly produce terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 -> NT5 NT13.\n\nNT5's productions: NT5 -> 't28' or NT5 -> 't41'.\n\nWait, NT5 can produce 't28' or 't41'.

Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't77' and 't30'\n- NT22 \u2192 't84' and 't22'? Wait, no, looking again, the productions for NT22 are NT22 \u2192 NT28 NT23 and NT22 \u2192 NT9 NT28. So no 't22' terminal here. Wait, earlier I thought NT22 might produce 't28', but looking again, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead list all the non-terminals that produce 't28' directly. Looking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't84', but not 't28'. Hmm, let me go through all the rules.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't41'.\n- NT17 \u2192 't14' and 't6'.\n- NT0 \u2192 't61', 't17', 't11', etc.\n- NT24 \u2192 't22'.\n- NT28 \u2192 't50' and 't27' (looking at NT28's rules: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3 and NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0; looking at NT11's rules, NT11 \u2192 NT25 NT13, which eventually leads to 't70'? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me first look for which non-terminals directly produce 't28' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n1. NT25 \u2192 't30' or 't77'.\n2. NT23 \u2192 't43' and 't56'.\n3. NT22 \u2192 't23' and 't84'.\n4. NT21 \u2192 't8'.\n5. NT28 \u2192 't50' and 't27'.\n6. NT21's rules: NT21 \u2192 NT17 NT26 and others, but terminal 't28' doesn't appear directly.\n7. NT29 \u2192 't27' and 't22'.\n8. NT15 \u2192 't28'! Wait, looking at NT15's rules, I see NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT23 and NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT28. Oh, finally, NT15 can produce 't28'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first symbol is 't28', which can come from NT15 by the production NT15 \u2192 't28'.\n\nSo, we can start with NT15 \u2192 't28'.\n\nNow, the string is 't28 t70 t40 t70 t50 ... t31', so after 't28', the next symbol is 't70'. So, the production of NT15 is 't28', but the next symbol is 't70', which suggests that we need to look at the next production in the parse tree.\n\nWait, but in context-free grammars, each production is applied to the entire left-hand side, so in this case, the entire NT15 would produce 't28' and some other terminal. But wait, NT15's production is either 't28' and another terminal, or 't7' (from NT7? No, wait, looking back, NT15 \u2192 't28' or something else? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no: looking at the productions, NT15 has two rules: NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT23 and NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT28.\n\nSo, for NT15, the two options are:\n\n1. NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT23, which are both non-terminals, so this production would need to be broken down further.\n2. NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT28, so 't7' and 't28'.\n\nWait, no, in the productions, it's written as NT15 -> 't28' perhaps? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules provided:\n\nLooking for production parts where NT15 appears on the left-hand side. I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT23\n- NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT28\n\nSo, NT15 can either produce two non-terminals or another combination. So, the 't28' is a terminal, but in this case, it's part of a production that would be followed by NT7 or not.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. When we have NT15 \u2192 't7' NT28, that would mean NT15 produces the terminal 't7' (from NT7?) followed by NT28, but that's not the case. Wait, no, in the production rules, the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, NT15 can produce 't28', but that's only if it's a terminal, but looking at the rules, that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to track which non-terminals produce 't28' as terminals. I think I confused myself earlier. Let me list all non-terminals that have 't28' as a terminal in their rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't56' and 't43'.\n- NT28 \u2192 't50' and 't27'.\n- NT29 \u2192 't27' and 't22'.\n- NT15 \u2192 't28' via NT15 \u2192 't28'. Wait, is that possible?\n\nWait, no. Looking again, the production rule for NT15 is either NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT23 or NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT28. Those are non-terminals, so that doesn't produce 't28' directly. Wait, maybe NT28 can produce 't28'?\n\nLooking at NT28's rules: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT32 and NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0. None of those right-hand sides have 't28' as a terminal.\n\nAh, I see. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check all the production rules again for terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals seem to be the ones that appear directly as 't' followed by a number, like 't28', 't70', etc.\n\nSo, for example, looking at NT29 \u2192 't27' NT22, which would produce 't27' and then NT22 may produce something else.\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is 't28'. So, the starting point must be a production that produces 't28' as a terminal. But looking at all production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't28'. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me go through each production rule again to see if any of them result in 't28' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- S -> NT2 NT28\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-887","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t28 t30 t41 t71 t71 t60 t8 t28 t30 t30 t38 t30 t17 t77 t6 t14 t68 t49 t25 t22 t71 t34 t70 t84 t49 t25 t22 t69 t66 t70 t7 t60 t22 t71 t14 t71 t30 t8 t28 t49 t34 t84 t30 t11 t41 t71 t41\", and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals. The string starts with \"t28\", which suggests that the initial symbol must be S, and the productions starting with S must somehow derive a string that begins with \"t28\". Looking at the production rules for S:\n\nS -> NT21 NT28\nS-> NT32 NT14\nS-> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT21 and NT28, or NT32 and NT14, or NT20 and NT25. The first symbol in the string is \"t28\", which corresponds to t28, which is a terminal. Let's check what each of these productions start with.\n\nLooking at NT21, NT28, NT32, etc. in the grammar, some of these non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT28 -> 't50', S's second production is NT32 NT14. The first symbol in the string is \"t28\", which might come from NT28 if NT28 can produce 't28'.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT28, I see NT28 -> NT11 NT3. Then, NT11 -> NT6 NT0, and so on. Wait, looking further, NT19 -> 't28', according to the rules. So, NT19 can produce 't28'. Similarly, NT28 has a rule NT28 -> NT11 NT3, which eventually could produce 't28' through another path.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is \"t28\", which suggests that the first production is coming from a rule that directly starts with that terminal. Let's see which non-terminals directly produce 't28':\n\nLooking through the rules, NT19 -> 't28' and NT28 -> 't50'. So, NT19 can directly produce 't28'. So, maybe the first step is to see if the string can be derived from NT19.\n\nBut from the grammar, S can produce NT21 NT28, NT32 NT14, or NT20 NT25. How does NT21 or NT32 or NT20 start? NT21 can produce \"t6\" and \"t68\" through some rules, which don't match 't28' directly. NT32's first rule is NT32 -> NT1 NT20, which seems to produce 't23', not 't28'. NT20's rule, like NT20 -> NT29 NT32, leads to 't66', I think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is built from a series of non-terminals that eventually expand into these terminals. Since S directly expands into two non-terminals, each of which must be further expanded into terminals, perhaps the string has length 2m -1 for some m, but here, the string's length is 49 words, implying that m would be 25, which may not necessarily be impossible as the grammar is context-free and can produce long strings.\n\nBut let's approach this step by step. The first symbol is \"t28\", which must come from one of the first symbols in the productions of S. Looking at S's productions:\n\n1. S -> NT21 NT28\n2. S -> NT32 NT14\n3. S -> NT20 NT25\n\nSo, the first symbol is either from NT21, NT32, or NT20. But none of these directly produce \"t28\". However, some non-terminals further down can produce \"t28\". For example, NT19->\"t28\". So maybe the first symbol comes from a path through other non-terminals leading to NT19.\n\nSimilarly, the second symbol is \"t30\". Looking at which non-terminals produce \"t30\", I see NT19 -> 't30' (no, wait, NT19 is 't28'. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT0-> 't61'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT16 -> 't6'\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT26 -> 't28'\n- NT18 -> 't49'\n- NT3 -> 't31', 't7', etc.\n- NT0 -> 't17', 't8', 't11', etc.\n- NT15 -> 't28'\n- NT33 -> 't49', 't71', etc.\n- NT21->'t8'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n\nWait, NT34 can produce 't30' because one of the rules is NT34 -> NT16 NT1, which perhaps leads to 't30'. So, perhaps the sequence starts with S -> NT34 NT1 or something, but looking at S's productions, none start with NT34. S only goes to NT21, NT32, or NT20. So, perhaps the first production is S -> NT34 NT1, which is not in the initial S productions. So, that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the first symbol is 't28' coming from NT28, but looking back, S's second production is NT32 NT14. Let me check if NT32 can produce 't28' directly.\n\nLooking at NT32: NT32 -> NT1 NT20. Then NT1 -> NT6 NT27, and so on. Alternatively, NT32 can also produce 't23' (as per NT32->'t54'). Or does it? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT17->'t14', NT0->'t61', etc., but perhaps some non-terminals further down produce 't28'. Wait, NT23 can produce 't43' (NT23->'t40' and others), but I'm looking for 't28'.\n\nWait, I might be getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe string starts with \"t28 t30 t41 t71 t71 t60 t8 ...\".\n\nFirst, 't28' must come from a production of some non-terminal in the first step. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't28':\n\nLooking at the rules, NT19->'t28', NT5->'t41', NT17->'t14', etc. So, perhaps the first production is from NT19. But in the grammar, S does not directly produce NT19. So, this suggests that the first symbol comes from a chain that eventually produces 't28'. But this would require that S can produce a string that starts with 't28', which would mean that S's first symbol must somehow generate 't28'.\n\nLooking at S's production NT21 NT28. So, the first symbol would be the first symbol of NT21's expansion. Looking at NT21's rules: NT21->'t8' or through other paths. So, NT21 can produce 't8', which is not 't28'. So that can't be the start.\n\nSimilarly, S's second production is NT32 NT14. NT32's first rule is NT1 NT20, which can produce various symbols, but I don't see 't28' in the first step. The third production is NT20 NT25. NT20's rules start with NT29 NT32, leading to various symbols. Not sure if 't28' appears here.\n\nSo, perhaps the first production is not directly from S's initial productions, but through a chain of productions. But that would mean that the string starts with 't28', which is not directly reachable from S's initial productions. Therefore, this string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first symbol is 't28', which is not directly reachable from any of the S productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

{"custom_id":"request-903","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, but they look quite complex. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a CFG in CNF looks like. CNF requires that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal. Also, all productions are free of \u03b5 (epsilon) on the right-hand side, except possibly for the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the rules are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, which fits the CNF structure. Some rules have single non-terminals, like the start symbol S, but since S is the start symbol and it's part of the productions S -> NT2 NT28, etc., I think the grammar is correctly in CNF.\n\nThe target string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. It's 50 tokens long, ending with t71. I need to parse this string according to the CFG and see if it's possible.\n\nBut parsing such a long string manually would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way, perhaps using the Left-Right scan or some other method, but since I'm new to this, I'll proceed step by step.\n\nI'll start by identifying the structure of the string and see if it can be broken down into the non-terminals and terminals of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t38 t71 t6 t10 t54 t40 t38 t23 t8 t66 t54 t41 t41 t36 t66 t70 t14 t28 t30 t70 t30 t23 t30 t30 t3 t38 t23 t0 t8 t3 t22 t34 t36 t68 t36 t8 t6 t22 t23 t84 t3 t22 t6 t84 t71 t14 t66 t84.\n\nI notice that many tokens start with 't', which might be terminals, while others like NTx are non-terminals. For example, the grammar has terminals like 't28', 't14', etc., which are part of the string.\n\nMy first step would be to map the string tokens to the grammar symbols. I should check if each token in the string corresponds to a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some non-terminals like S and NTx are present, but the terminals in the string are 't' followed by numbers, like t38, t71, etc. So I can consider that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and other symbols like NT2, NT3, etc., are non-terminals.\n\nSo, for each token in the string, I'll categorize it as terminal (tXX) or non-terminal (NTx), and then try to build a parse tree or at least see if the string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nThis might take a long time manually, given the length. Maybe I can find key points or features that would help me determine if the string can be generated.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t38. Let's see if the grammar has any production that starts with NT38. Scanning through the grammar rules, I see that NT38 is not a non-terminal in any production. The productions I see involve other non-terminals, but not NT38. So, if the first token is t38 but there's no rule in the grammar for NT38, then the grammar cannot generate this string because the first symbol doesn't match any production.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string starts with t38, which could correspond to a terminal symbol derived from a non-terminal. So maybe a non-terminal like NT23 could produce t38? Let me check the grammar rules for NT23.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I search for rules involving NT23. Here's what I find:\n\n- NT23 -> NT22 NT27\n- NT27 -> NT11 NT4\n- NT4 -> NT29 NT10\n- NT10 -> NT27 NT24\n- NT24 -> NT32 NT23\n- NT23 doesn't directly produce t38.\n\nWait, maybe further down the chain. Let's see if any of these non-terminals derive to a terminal ending in t38.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's not possible for any non-terminal to produce t38 as a single terminal. If that's the case, then the string cannot be generated because the first symbol (t38) can't be derived.\n\nWait, but let me check specific rules. The user provided a list, so let me search through all the productions to see if any NTx rule ends with t38 on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3\n- NT3 -> NT20 NT13\n- NT13 -> NT18 NT18\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT0\n- NT20 -> NT4 NT NT (Wait, checking more carefully).\n\nActually, I'm looking through all rules:\n\nLooking more carefully, I see that NT28 -> NT11 NT3.\n\nThen NT3 has rules like:\n\n- NT3 -> NT20 NT13\n- NT13 -> NT18 NT18\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT0\n- NT20 -> NT4 NT NT... Wait, no, more precisely:\n\nWait, checking every NT rule for terminals. Let's list out the terminals in the grammar as per the user's long list:\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar, several entries suggest terminals:\n\n- NT17 -> 't14'\n- NT8 -> 't27 NT6' \u2014 wait, actually, the user provided a long list, but in the grammar, some rules have terminals. For example, looking through the end:\n\nAt the end of the grammar, the user has:\n\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't71'\n- NT18 -> 't36'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT18 -> 't70'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT34 -> 't14' \u2014 seems there are multiple terminal productions.\n\nWait, the user actually has a mix of terminals and non-terminals, I think. So for example, the productions where the right-hand side is a terminal followed by a non-terminal, etc.\n\nFor instance, looking near the end:\n\n- NT25 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't43'\n- NT21 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't71'\n- NT18 -> 't36'\n- NT11 -> 't6'\n- NT18 -> 't70'\n- NT34 -> 't30'\n- NT34 -> 't14' \u2014 okay, so some non-terminals produce single terminal symbols.\n\nNow, in the given string, the first token is t38. I need to check if any non-terminal NTx produces t38 as a terminal. From the grammar, looking through all the terminal rules, does any rule have 't38' as the terminal?\n\nGoing through the terminal rule list (from the user's long grammar):\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT29 -> 't27 NT6'\n- NT9 -> 't26 NT18'\n- NT27 -> 't9 NT9'\n- NT18 -> 't16 NT24'\n- NT22 -> 't29 NT2'\n- NT7 -> 't27 NT1'\n- NT0 -> 't10 NT5'\n- NT17 -> 't5 NT28'\n- NT0 -> 't17'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT21 -> 't26 NT6'\n- NT26 -> 't28 NT22'\n- NT22 -> 't18 NT32'\n- NT13 -> 't10 NT21'\n- NT24 -> 't72 NT23' \u2014 wait, the user's input may not have all the way, but in the provided grammar, do any of the terminals end with t38?\n\nLooking carefully, in the grammar, some of the terminal rules have 't' followed by numbers. Scanning through:\n\nLooking in the list, I don't immediately see any terminal symbol as t38. For example:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT29 -> t27 NT6\n- NT7 -> t27 NT1\n- NT0 -> t10 NT5\n- NT17 -> t5 NT28\n- NT0 -> t17\n- NT10 -> t32\n- NT21 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, that's a long string, so I'll need to figure out some way to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recap the grammar structure. The grammar is in CNF, so each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the starting symbols, I notice that S can produce NT21, NT32, or NT20. Each of these seems to lead to further non-terminals. For example, NT21 can produce NT32 and NT29, which in turn go to NT11 and NT4, respectively, but I see that NT11 can produce 't68', a terminal string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with \"t6 t65...\". The first symbol is \"t6\". So, maybe the grammar has a production that directly outputs 't6', like looking through the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 't3', NT0 \u2192 't17', etc. But \"t6\" seems to come from NT6's productions.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> NT10 NT5\n- NT10 -> NT24 NT2\n- NT24 -> NT22 NT23\n- NT22 -> NT21 NT6\n- NT21 \u2192 NT26 NT6 or NT6 NT0\n- NT26 -> NT28 NT22\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT0\n- NT27 -> NT26 NT21\n- NT21 also \u2192 NT21 NT24, which might loop.\n\nBut I also see NT19 \u2192 't6'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT19 \u2192 't6' is there.\n\nWait, in the productions, I do see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'\n- NT13 \u2192 't6'\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions for NT19 is listed as NT19 \u2192 't66', and NT22 \u2192 't8'. Wait, actually, let me parse through the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't6' in the productions:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't6' (from NT3 \u2192 NT20 NT13, and then NT20 might lead to 't6' or other things)\n- NT24 \u2192 't68' (Wait, I think I need to scan each production line for terminals)\n\nLet me go through all the productions line by line to find which NTs produce a single terminal:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't66' (so it's not 't6')\n- NT22 \u2192 't25'? No, NT22's production is NT22 \u2192 NT21 NT6, which are non-terminals, but also NT22 \u2192 NT18 NT32, etc. So NT22 doesn't directly produce 't6'.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't6' (from the line 'NT3 -> NT20 NT13' but is there a terminal here? Wait, looking for where NT13 directly becomes a terminal.\n\nWait, no, NT13 -> NT10 NT21, unless somewhere else.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check each production line that's an NT -> terminal:\n\nLooking through each line, most are A \u2192 BC except a few are A \u2192 a.\n\nSo:\n\n- NT5 -> 't41' (line: NT5 -> NT5 NT20, but also NT5 -> 't41' earlier? Wait, looking at the grammar, I think I may have misread.\n\nWait, looking back, the first part of the grammar has:\n\nS -> NT21\nS -> NT32\nS -> NT20\nThen, the list continues.\n\nWait, trying to find any production where NTx \u2192 't6'. Wait, looking through the grammar, perhaps NT6 \u2192 't68' (from the line 'NT6 -> NT10 NT5' but then is there a production for 't68'? Wait, 't68' comes from NT24? Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the first production of each NT to see if it directly outputs a terminal.\n\nLooking at each NT production:\n\n- NT21 -> NT32 NT29 (A-> BC)\n- NT32 -> NT11 NT3 (A-> BC)\n- NT20 -> NT4 NT13 (A-> BC)\n- NT3 -> NT20 NT13 (A-> BC)\n- NT28 -> NT11 NT3 (A-> BC)\n- NT12 -> NT4 NT0 (A-> BC)\n- NT14 -> NT34 NT7 (A-> BC)\n- NT32 -> NT20 NT3 (A-> BC)\nWait, this is getting too long. Maybe a better approach is to look for any NT that directly produces 't6'.\n\nWait, in the production rules, looking for NTx \u2192 't6'. For example, in line: NT19 -> 't66' (so not 't6'), but wait, looking through all the productions:\n\nNo, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't6'. Wait, maybe I'm wrong because earlier in the list, for NT21, is there a path that leads to 't6'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar lines carefully.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT6 -> NT10 NT5 (so it's A-> BC)\n- NT5 -> 't41'? No, looking through all lines: I can find multiple NTs with 't' as part of their production, but not directly as A-> 't6'.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed 't6' in the terminal symbols. Looking again, the string starts with 't6 t65 t14 t28...'\n\nSo the first symbol is 't6'. So the grammar must have a production that allows the top-level symbol (start, which is S) to derive a 't6' terminal.\n\nBut in the given grammar, I don't see S directly producing a terminal; all S productions go to other non-terminals. So perhaps S itself must derive a string that ends with t6, meaning the leftmost derivation must produce t6 at the end.\n\nSo that implies S must have a path where all non-terminals are resolved into t6 via productions.\n\nWait, but S only directly produces NT21, NT32, or NT20. These are each connected to other non-terminals. So the only way for S to produce a terminal string is if the entire S can be reduced to a terminal. So for example, if NT21 can be further reduced to t6.\n\nBut in the grammar, none of the productions for NT21 directly produce a terminal. They all produce non-terminals, like:\n\nNT21 -> NT26 NT6 or NT6 NT0.\n\nSo NT21 can be replaced by NT26 and NT6, etc. So we would have to follow this chain until we reach a point where all non-terminals have been resolved into terminals.\n\nSo to get 't6' in the string, that would have to be the last symbol, meaning that the derivation for S must end with t6.\n\nHmm, but in the string, the first symbol is t6, followed by t65, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps I should try to find a way for S to derive t6 as the first symbol. But let's think: The first symbol is t6, but S is the start symbol, which doesn't produce a terminal directly. So this implies that the entire string must start with the expansion of S, which goes through NT21, NT32, or NT20, which each go deeper.\n\nWait, but the string's first symbol is t6, so we need to find a way for S to produce t6 as the first symbol, meaning that the leftmost derivation of S must start with t6.\n\nBut checking S's productions, none directly produce t6. So S can only start with NT21, NT32, or NT20. So I need to see if any of these can be transformed into a string that starts with t6.\n\nWait, perhaps S can derive into a string that starts with t6, meaning that in the derivation, after expanding S into one of its options, the first production would be a path that eventually starts with t6.\n\nBut let me walk"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The first two symbols in the string are `t23 t6`, which might correspond to a production rule for S. Let me check the grammar for S productions:\n\nThe grammar has three initial S rules:\n1. S -> NT21 NT28\n2. S -> NT32 NT14\n3. S -> NT20 NT25\n\nI need to see if the string starts with any of these combinations. Looking at the string, the first two tokens are `t23` and `t6`. Let's see which production could generate `t23` and `t6`.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals: NT23 is in the grammar. NT23 has the rule NT21 NT27 and others. Checking the productions for NT23, I see that one of them is NT23 -> NT22 NT27 and another is NT23 -> NT24 NT71. \n\nWait, maybe I should start by identifying which parts of the string can be derived from each non-terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to use the given string and try to parse it step by step by matching the rules.

Looking for the rule that produces `t23`. Scanning all the productions, I can see that NT23 is present as a terminal or part of a rule. Wait, actually, NT23 is a non-terminal and might have rules leading to t23.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. NT23 has the rule NT23 -> NT24 NT16. Then, NT24 is another non-terminal. What about NT24? Looking through the productions, NT24 has two rules: NT24 -> NT22 NT32 and NT24 -> t22. Oh, wait! So NT24 can produce t22. So if NT23 -> NT24 NT16, and NT24 can produce t22, then perhaps we can get t22 and NT16 somewhere else.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t23. So perhaps the first part is derived from NT23 and some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, another approach is to look for the possible rules that could directly produce the initial part of the string. The string starts with t23, t6. Let's see which non-terminals produce t23 and t6.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that NT16 has a production NT16 -> NT18 NT6 and NT16 -> t6. Also, NT21 has a production NT21 -> NT26 NT6 and NT21 is used in S->NT21 NT28, so perhaps t23 comes from NT21.\n\nWait, let's break down the first few tokens: `t23 t6 t14 t3...`.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\n1. The first part of the string is `t23 t6 t14`. So perhaps the first two symbols are from a production like NT23 NT14 or something similar, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the first production of S: S->NT21 NT28. So the first two symbols must be something that can be derived from NT21 and NT28. So the string starts with `t23 t6`, so maybe NT21 can produce `t23` and NT28 can produce `t6`.\n\nLooking at NT21: NT21 has several rules, including NT21 -> NT26 NT6 and NT21 -> NT6 NT0. Also, NT21 can produce NT21 NT24, which might not help directly. Wait, there's also NT21 -> NT26 NT6. Does NT26 produce t26 or other things?\n\nWait, NT26 has the production NT26 -> t28 and NT26 -> t28. Wait, no, looking again: NT26's production is NT26 -> t28. Hmm, that can't be right. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking at NT26: NT26 -> NT28 NT22, and another rule NT26 -> t28. Oh, no, wait, that's correct. So NT26 can directly produce t28. So if NT21 produces NT26 NT6, then perhaps the two symbols could be t28 and t6.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t23 t6, so maybe NT21 is producing t23 and NT28 is producing t6? Let me see.\n\nLooking for the rules that produce t23. There are multiple rules for NT23. One of them is NT23 -> NT24 NT71, another is NT23 -> NT22 NT71, another is NT23 -> NT16 NT32.\n\nHmm. Maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the initial t23 comes from NT23 -> t3. Wait, no, looking at NT3: NT3 has a production NT3 -> NT20 NT13, but also NT3 -> t7, and other rules involving NT5 and others. Wait, looking at NT3, the terminal t7 is an option. Wait, but the string starts with t23, so maybe that's not the right path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the string as a sequence and try to see if it can be split into known sequences from the grammar.\n\nLet's start from the beginning:\n\nt23 t6 t14 t3 t66 t28 t41 t38 t43 t71 t31 t68 t11 t75 t28 t30 t71 t14 t60 t32 t3 t23 t71 t66 t32 t3 t34 t36 t71 t77 t36 t36 t31 t84 t71 t36 t23 t70 t32 t75 t68 t41 t71 t30 t30 t50 t8 t30 t66.\n\nThe first part is t23, t6, t14.

Let's see what NT21 and NT28 can produce.\n\nNT21 can produce, for example, NT21->NT26 NT6, which as per above gives t28. Wait, but we have t23 as the first symbol, which is likely from NT23.\n\nWait, but in the S rule S->NT21 NT28, maybe the T21 produces t23 and NT28 produces t6. Let's check NT21's productions:\n\nLooking at NT21's rules, one is NT21 -> NT26 NT6, which can produce t28 and then perhaps t6? Wait, NT26 can produce t28, which is a symbol in the string.

{"custom_id":"request-918","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is \"t28 t60 t14 t54 t14 t3 t23 t32 t8 t71 t71 t14 t66 t77 t6 t31 t41 t40 t38 t32 t32 t6 t84 t6 t10 t52 t50 t3 t38 t51 t71 t7 t36 t11 t71 t38 t65 t84 t3 t23 t22 t71 t84 t60 t8 t66 t54 t77 t71\". \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF requires each production rule to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that all the production rules are indeed in this form, which is a good start.\n\nThe next step is to figure out how the grammar generates strings. Since it's a context-free grammar, the derivations happen from the start symbol, which in this case is S. Each non-terminal can be expanded into terminals and other non-terminals according to the rules provided.\n\nThe string in question consists of a sequence of terminal symbols (\"t28\", \"t60\", etc.). My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from S in one or more steps. To approach this, I think I should try to trace back from the string to see if it can ultimately be derived from S by reversing the production steps.\n\nFirst, let's observe the structure of the string. It starts with \"t28\" and ends with \"t71\". From the grammar, I can see that S has productions like S \u2192 NT21 NT28, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc. Also, several non-terminals expand into terminals like \"t28\", \"t6\", etc.\n\nI notice that \"t28\" appears multiple times. One of the S productions is S \u2192 NT21 NT28. Since NT28 can expand into NT11 NT3 and eventually into \"t50\". Wait, looking more closely, NT28's production is NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3. Let's check the rules for NT28 and NT11.\n\nNT28 can expand into NT11 NT3, and NT3 can expand into NT20 NT13, NT13 can expand into NT5 NT7, etc. However, NT28 can also go directly into \"t27\" and \"t22\" via other productions. Hmm, but in the given grammar, NT28's productions are:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT22\nNT28 \u2192 NT0 NT27\nAnd another production: NT28 \u2192 NT5 NT7.\n\nWait, looking back, let me check the exact productions for NT28:\n\nFrom the provided grammar, I see:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT22\n- NT28 \u2192 NT0 NT27\nAlso, looking elsewhere, I see NT28 \u2192 NT5 NT10, etc., but I think it's more detailed above.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused. Let me check all productions for NT28:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT22\n- NT28 \u2192 NT0 NT27\n- NT28 \u2192 NT6 NT25 (Wait, no, looking through the list, it's NT28 \u2192 NT5 NT7?\n\nWait, actually, I think NT28 \u2192 NT5 NT10 is in the grammar? Or was it another NT? Let me clarify.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar list provided, one of the NT28 productions is:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT22\n\nAnd another later line:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT5 NT7?\n\nWait, checking again, I see:\n\nAt line 17:\n\"NT28 -> NT11 NT3\"\n\nLine 25:\n\"NT28 -> NT27 NT0\"\n\nLine 27:\n\"NT28 -> NT27 NT22\"\n\nLine 34:\n\"NT28 -> NT5 NT7\"\n\nLine 53:\n\"NT18 -> NT20 NT0\"\n\nWait, perhaps I should methodically check all NT28 productions.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nLines 4, 5, 6, 7, etc., no. Let's go one by one.\n\nLooking for NT28 in the production list:\n\nNT28 is mentioned in:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3 (line 4)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0 (line 25)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT22 (line 27)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT5 NT7 (line 32? Or another line)\n\nWait, looking at the list after NT25:\n\nNo, let me reindex the productions for NT28:\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3 (Line 4)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0 (Line 25)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT22 (Line 27)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT0 NT27 (Line 29)\nWait, that's the same as line 25, just swapped. So, NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0 and NT0 NT27 are the same in terms of expansion because NT0 can be a non-terminal that might lead to terminals.\n\nAdditionally, is there another production for NT28? Let me scan the list.\n\nLooking for NT28 ... yes, line 21:\n\"NT21 -> NT26 NT6\"\n\nWait, that's NT21, not NT28.\n\nAh, maybe I should focus more on NT28. Let's see:\n\n- Line 4: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- Line 25: NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\n- Line 27: NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT22\n- Line 29: NT28 \u2192 NT0 NT27\n- Line 54: NT32 \u2192 NT5 NT3 (No, that's NT32)\n- Line 32: NT28 \u2192 NT5 NT7? Let me check line 32.\n\nWait, line 32 is \"NT28 -> NT5 NT10\". No, that's NT28 \u2192 NT5 NT10.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, line 32 is:\n\"NT28 -> NT5 NT10\"\n\nWait, let me find:\n\n- Line 32: NT28 \u2192 NT32 NT0 (Wait, no.)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier; let's go through the list step by step.\n\nLooking at each production, I need to find where NT28 appears on the left side.\n\nHere's a more careful approach:\n\nGo through each production and note the left-hand side:\n\n1. S -> NT21 NT28 (Line 1)\n2. S -> NT32 NT14 (Line 2)\n3. S -> NT20 NT25 (Line 3)\n4. NT21 -> NT6 NT13 (Wait, no; checking for NT21)\nWait, no, let's actually parse through each line:\n\n- Line 1: S \u2192 NT21 NT28 \u2192 yes, NT28 is on the right.\n- Line 2: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 \u2192 no.\n- Line 3: S \u2192 NT20 NT25 \u2192 no.\n- Line 4: NT21 \u2192 NT32 NT29\n- Line 5: NT31 \u2192 NT34 NT1\n- Line 6: NT3 \u2192 NT20 NT13\n- Line 7: NT28 \u2192 NT11 NT3\n- Line 8: NT12 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- Line 9: NT14 \u2192 NT34 NT7\n- Line 10: NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT20\n- Line 11: NT17 \u2192 NT5 NT28\n- Line 12: NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- Line 13: NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- Line 14: NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT0\n- Line 15: NT14 \u2192 NT15 NT7\n- Line 16: NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- Line 17: NT12 \u2192 NT15 NT3\n- Line 18: NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
